                  </hi>. I am a cashier at the London and Westminster Bank—on 16th of March, a little before 4, I was at the bank, in Lothbury—Matthews came in and presented this cheque over the counter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) purporting to be signed by Charles Harvey for 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and dated 14th March, 1868, on one of our forms—we have a customer of that name—I said to Matthews, "What shall I give you for it?" the usual question—he said, "160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "I know the cheque is for 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in what form will you have it, notes or gold?"—he said he was not particular, he did not care as long as he got the money—I pressed him to give an answer as to what he would have—he then said he would take two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the rest gold—I said, "135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold?"—he said, "Yes"—I entered the cheque in my pay book, and went away to get the notes—I showed the cheque to some of my fellow cashiers, who examined it and compared the signature—I then spoke to the manager, Mr. Higley—I went outside the counter, and asked the prisoner where he brought the cheque from—he said, "From Burgoyne &amp; Co."—I said, "Who are they?"—he said, "Burgoyne's, in Coleman Street"—I said, "Do you mean Burgoyne, Burbridge, &amp; Co., the wholesale druggists"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Oh, we know them very well"—I again referred to Mr. Higley, and returned to the prisoner and said, "I will go with you to Bargoyne's," and we went down the office together; when we got to the door he turned to me and said, "I do not come from Bargoyne &amp; Co.'s, I come from Maw &amp; Sons, of Aldersgate Street"—I said, "That alters the case; you must return with me, and state</p>

               <p>that to the manager"—we went back to the manager's room, and I left him with Mr. Higley—Mr. Higley desired me to go to Maw &amp; Sons, and see if his statement was correct—they are wholesale druggists—I went there and made inquiries on the subject, and after that returned to the bank—the prisoner had previously said that he had rcceivod it from Mr. scott, who was confidential clerk to Messrs. Maw &amp; Sons, Aldersgate Street—they had no person of that name in their employment—when I told Mr. Higley that, the prisoner said, "I did not say Scott, I said Charles"—I then went and fetched Sergeant Spittle—I believe I saw this paper written by the prisoner in the manager's room—he was requested to write his name and address, in case we should have to communicate with him; and he wrote "R.

About 4 o'clock on Monday, 16th March, I was sent for to the London and Westminster Bank—the manager made a communication to me, handed me the cheque for 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I was introduced to the prisoner Matthews—he was in the manager's room—I said to him, "I am informed that you have brought a cheque to the bank, fur 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which is believed to be a forgery; lama police-officer; consider what you say, for it may be used against you for the purposes of justice"—he replied, "About 3.30 this afternoon, I met a man in Aldersgate Street, near Maw's; he asked me to oblige him by taking the cheque to the bank, and getting it cashed; I replied I did not care about doing it; he said, 'You will very much oblige me if you will;' I then consented to go"—at this time Sergeant Funnell came to the bank, and we took the prisoner, to Aldersgote Street, in a cab, the prisoner saying he should like to ride in a cab, that the man who gave him the cheque might not see him—he pointed out Maw's premises as the place where he met the man, and said, after giving him the cheque the man went up the gateway, and told him, when he returned, to go up the steps (the steps lead from a yard to the principal part of the premises at Maw's) and inquire for him—he stated that he knew the man by the name of Charles—I asked him if that was the Christian name, or surname of the man—he said he only knew him by that name—we then took the prisoner into Messrs.

                  </hi>. I live at Wandsworth, and am a tallow-chan<lb></lb>dler. On the 19th of November I bought two dozen of patent palm wax candles at Blundell's manufactory, at Wandsworth—the prisoner served me—I paid him 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—this is the bill and receipt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of Messrs. Henry Blundell and Co.'s manufactory, at Wandsworth. The prisoner was their foreman, and lived on their premises—it was his business to sell goods, and receive the money for them, and he was to account to me for it on the Saturday—sometimes he handed money to me on the day he received it, but always on the Saturday he accounted to me for what he had got that</p>

               <p>week—I was at the manufactory on the 19th of November—I believe I saw the prisoner there—he did not account to me then, or at any other time, for 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Ripley—he kept a book in which it was his duty to enter all the goods that went out, and if they were paid for, he was to enter them as paid—I have the book here—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—here is an entry to Mr. Ripley on the 12th of November, and another on the 20th of November, but this 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is not entered, and he never paid it to me—this is the book in which he ought to enter all candles that went out, and there is no entry of these.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This young man is a Prussian? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he is from some part of Germany—he does not speak English very imper<lb></lb>fectly—when there has been a bill to make out he has come to me to write down English names for him—I think it was Professor Rungay who brought him over—I am not aware that the prisoner was in possession of the secret by which these particular candles were made—he never imparted any secret to me—there is no secret but what is published, we work under a patent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has not the prisoner paid you money which it turned out he had not received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he has in one instance—I did not know it at the time, but I know it now—he paid me money on account of a person—I saw the person afterwards, and he said he had not paid it—when the prisoner was in prison two persons came to the office, and made a search while I was there—they searched a certain cupboard, and there was found 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money laid up there—that was more than sufficient to have liquidated all the indictments against him—I never asked him to account for these individual sums—he had been about two years in the service to my knowledge, and I believe altogether about three or four years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On one occasion he made a mistake against himself, did you ever give him an opportunity of explaining this transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I certainly did not ask him specifically to explain why he had not accounted for this sum on the 19th of November.</p>

                  </hi>. I went to Mr. Longstaff, and with him I went to the office in the factory—I found the parcel containing the money—the prisoner had told me where the money would be found, and it was done up in a bundle—Mr. Pullen has got it—it was on the top shelf, behind the upright—Mr. Pullen got up and took it down—I could not see it at first—the prisoner gave me directions to take it to my master—he was taken into custody on a Thursday, and on the Monday after E went to the factory, and found this money—I do not know whether his wife had access to the office—she lived on the premises till the last day or two—the counting-house is on the opposite side to her house—I never saw her having any thing to do with the counting-house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

The prisoner's wife remained in her usual place of abode on the premises—the key of the counting-house was usually laid on the ledge above the door—it was kept in the prisoner's house, and he had the charge of it—when he went to prison I took the key myself, but it was sometimes left in the door, and I sometimes went down the yard for an hour, and during that time any one on the premises had the opportunity of going into the counting-house—the top shelf in the cupboard was not a place for money at all—I did not find the parcel—I was in the room when they opened the cupboard-door, and I did not see the parcel—it was not the business of the prisoner to keep such a sum of money as that.</p>

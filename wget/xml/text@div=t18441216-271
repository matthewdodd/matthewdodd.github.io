I met with the prisoner Drain in the Wheatsheaf public-house at Greenwich—I went home witb her to a house, but I do not know where—I had eight sovereigns in my watch<lb></lb>pocket, besides some silver in my trowsers-pocket—I was not sober—I recollected taking the sovereigns out of my pocket, and looking at them after I went to the Wheatsheaf—I cannot say whether I fell asleep on the bed before Drain went out of the room or after, but I went to sleep—when I awoke, Drain was gone, and my money also—went with a policeman to the Wheatsheaf, and saw Drain, and gave her in charge—Caton had been in the Wheatsheaf before I left, and had drank with Drain and me, but I had bad no conversation with Caton—she was in the Wheatsheaf when I came back.</p>

On the 11th of Dec., a little after six o'clock in the morning, a person came to the station where I was, to inquire after a person named Drain, or Brain—the prisoner Drain was at that time locked up in the station, but I did not take her—I went myself to tell Drain—she said her name was Caroline Drain—I said a female wanted her, but I must know what was the charge against her before she saw her—she said a man charged her with taking nine sovereigns last night, but it was but eight, and she gave them to <hi rend="italic">Kit</hi> Caton at the Wheatsheaf to put away—she said, "If it is <hi rend="italic">Kit</hi>, tell her to give the man six, and keep two"—I then went and found Caton, and brought her in—I said to Drain, "Is this the girl you gave the money to?"—Caton said, "I have not got it"—Drain said, "You know where it is, <hi rend="italic">Kit</hi> "—Caton said, "It is a hard case for me to be locked up"—Drain said, "I will take it all on myself, and get you out of trouble"—Caton bad no money at all—there was no money in the room where she was.</p>

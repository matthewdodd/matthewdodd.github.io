I do not know whether any body answered, but immediately one of them took my shoe buckles out, and then my knee buckles, which were silver; they said I should meet two more of their companions, and I had the presence of mind to ask them what I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300129"></xptr> say, for they had got my all, and they told me to wish them a good night, and they would let me pass; I got up and went to Stepney, and got four or five men armed, with lanthorns and candle, and went in quest of them till near one in the morning, but found nothing of them.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - A very fine moon-light night; I believe it was full moon.</p>
               <p>Did you see any of these men so as to know them again? - Yes, the shortest of the prisoners, Greenough, was the man that held the cutiass.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Positive, very positive; I will give you a reason; one of them says, b - st him, he sees us, he will betray us, cut off his head; in giving them the money, I dropt the half guinea, and one of them says, the b - g - r is dropping the money, cut off his head; from that time I shoved up my hat, and I never took my eye from Greenough; he had a very bright cutlass in his hand.</p>
               <p>Were your eyes fixed on the cutlass or the man? - On both; he did not offer to strike me with it.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to say positively that he was one of the men? - Yes, positively.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the other prisoner? - I have my doubts about the other.</p>
               <p>How soon after were they taken up? - I believe it was near a month; I gave information on the Friday following at Mr. Justice Wilmott's office; none of my property was ever found.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to swear to a man that you never saw before, and seeing him in the hurry of this transaction to swear to him at a month's distance? - My Lord, I can; I described him the very man he appears at the bar; I also described him at Justice Wilmott's office; before he was brought to the bar, I described him.</p>

             seized him by the</p>
               <p>"collar, and said, now one word and you</p>
               <p>"are a dead man, and he immediately received</p>
               <p>"a blow, and he was knocked</p>
               <p>"down, but by which of them he does not</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, I take notice of this before you give your verdict, to shew how extremely uncertain the evidence of the prosecutor is; there before the Magistrate, fixing it on Greenough and Bentley, and now coming into Court and upon the evidence of the accomplice changing his account, and fixing it on Greenough only, this changes the degree of his certainty, with respect to Greenough.</p>
               <p>The Jury conferred a minute, and gave a verdict BOTH <rs id="t17860830-86-verdict435" type="verdictDescription">

               NOT GUILTY
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. I cannot fulfil my duty, without reprehending very much your conduct in this transaction; if this man Brown had not been taken up two or three days ago, before the trial of these prisoners, you might rashly have taken away the life of a man that you now believe to be innocent, that is Bentley; you therefore were very rash in positively charging a man against whom you cannot now support that charge, and that rashness has been the means of discrediting your evidence, with respect to the other prisoner, of whose guilt there is not much reason to doubt.</p>
               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>

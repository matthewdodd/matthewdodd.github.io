                  </hi>, I am a policeman of the Eastern Counties Railway. On the night of 23rd Oct., about five minutes past eleven o'clock, I was on duty at the goods shed—it was lighted with gas, and the gas was suddenly reduced—in three or four minutes I turned it on, and saw the prisoner and two of his mates near the engine-house—there was a hogshead of wine close to them—I said, "You are all in the dark"—one of them said, "That is right, let us have a little light"—I went on and came round, and saw the gas was turned off again—that would leave the hogshead of wine in dark<lb></lb>ness—I heard some one knocking in the direction of it—I turned on the gas, and saw the prisoner stooping behind the hogshead to pick up this jug—I went to him, and took the jug from him—he tried to <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> it away—he said, "For God's sake forgive me"—I took him to the gate, and gave him into the custody of Green—the jug was full of red wine—I went to the hogs<lb></lb>head, and there was a plug put in it.</p>

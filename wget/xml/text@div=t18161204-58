            , Jun. On the 13th of October, between seven and eight o'clock, I was in Whitecross-street, with my father; he sent me home to put my brother to bed. I went home; the door was open; the latch I lifted up, and saw a light up stairs. I went up, as I thought it was my brother; a man came out of the room, and put the light out, and came down stairs. He rushed past me, and told me to go down to my father. I did not see his face. I don't know who it was. My brother was out of doors.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. You saw the man on the stairs; it was not the prisoner - A. No. I gave evidence here last session against two men.</p>

            , Sen. re-examined. My little child was not in the house. My son came back and told me what he had seen. I went home; my chests were both broken open. I had lost a little bag of silver, to the amount of about 7l., and a pocket-book; some duplicates and other things. I had left my brother in charge of the house. I apprehended him and another, and they were tried here last sessions and acquitted, because I could not trace the property. I had not seen any part of it until the 13th of October, when Mr. Sowerby, who is a pawnbroker, sent for me down to his shop; when I got there the prisoner was in the shop. He had produced two duplicates to redeem two articles; the pawnbroker shewed them to me in his presence. The prisoner asked me if I had lost them. I told him I had lost them and a great deal of property in a red pocket-book, and with some money. He said that he found them in a red pocket-book, which he had at home; but that he lived at Chatham.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040031"></xptr>He said had several more which he picked up with them. He produced them. They were the very tickets which I had lost. We went to Worship-street to know how he came by them, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. My keeping my money in a chest was no secret. The prisoner said he found them at Chatham, and he said that he had more. I have heard that the man who was tried with my brother had been at Chatham.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you believe that the prisoner committed the robbery - A. No; from what I have heard since I don't think he did. I should know the pocket-book again (produced by the prisoner). It is mine.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Sowerby, who is a pawnbroker. The prisoner came into our shop to redeem some pledges. I found that I had notice from the prosecutor to stop any body who offered to redeem them. I asked him how he got them. He said that he had bought them of Mrs. Edwards. I sent for her. We were not particular in detaining him; he might have got away if he liked; he did not seem at all agitated. The conversation took place that Mr. Edwards has related. I was at the office, and Mrs. Edwards was there.</p>

               <p>Q. What did she say-A. She said that she had not sold the duplicates, and the prisoner confessed that was the only part in which he was criminal. He said, he intended to redeem the property, that the perosn who had lost them might have it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The property was pledged in the name of Edwards.</p>
               <p>Q. If he should tell you that he had found the tickets, you would take them away - A. No; we should stop the property. The prisoner staid very quietly in the shop.</p>

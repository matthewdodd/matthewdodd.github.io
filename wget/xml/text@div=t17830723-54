               <p>Did you lodge in this house? - Yes, I was washing for the mother the same day the accident happened, and that was the way I was not up in the room, and the child went up to make the beds, and she was there longer than usual, and the child was frightened, and at last she came and told me that she was up stairs, and the prisoner whom she called Jerry, came in and threw her down on the bed and behaved very insolent to her; what do you mean said I by insolence, she then said he pulled out his impudence and forced it into her body, then that startled me when she said so, I did not know what to do, for her father and mother were in anger; I did expect if I had spoke that night there would have been murder; so the next day it was disclosed, and the doctor was sent for, and he found the child injured; the doctor is in court, we disclosed it the next day in the morning, that man was in the house, they took him into custody.</p>
               <p>How long did the prisoner stay in the house afterwards? - I believe he was one night before the father and mother knew it.</p>
               <p>The girl said he staid for several days; were there people in the next room or not? - Upon my word I cannot give any account whether they were at home or not.</p>

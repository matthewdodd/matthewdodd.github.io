                  </hi> I deal in coals, and live at Clapham. On Friday, the 5th of Aug., I had a donkey turned out on Clapham-common—I saw it safe at nine o'clock next morning, and missed it about half an hour after<lb></lb>wards—about four o'clock the same afternoon, I saw it in Smithfield—it is worth from 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Park-place, Walworth. On the 6th of Aug., about twelve or half-past, I was in the Blackfriars-road, and saw the prisoner riding a donkey, with a man walking by his side—they both spoke to me—the prisoner asked me to buy the donkey—I said I did not know—he offered it for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I offered all the money I had got, which was 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he would not take it—he went about forty yards further, then ran back to me, and said I should have it—there was an old bridle with it—I said, "I had got nothing to hold it with"—he said, "I cannot give you this, because my father said I was to take it home again," but as last I had it, to lead the donkey home with—I paid him the money, and came away with it—I took the donkey home, and put it in a little barrow to see if it would draw, but it laid down and was no use to me, so I sent a man named Simpson with it to Smithfield that afternoon.</p>

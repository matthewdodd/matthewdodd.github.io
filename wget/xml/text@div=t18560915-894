She was six years old last Nov.—I am a shoemaker, and live at Haggerstone—on 4th Aug., about half past 6 o'clock in the afternoon, the child came into my house—she appeared confused, and could scarcely stand—she made a complaint to me—after her mother had called my attention to it, I observed the child's neck—it appeared as if a wire, or something tight, had been drawn round her neck—I went to the front door of the prisoner's house—I found it fast—I went and forced open the back door—I tried to open the door of the room in</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of New North-road, Hoxton. This child was brought to my house by a constable on the after<lb></lb>noon of 4th Aug.—I examined her, and found about her neck considerable extravasation of blood, and several marks of excoriation—the skin was broken—I found three or four marks round her neck—it might, no doubt, have been done by this cord, in tying the child to a bedpost—from what I saw, tying the cord round the neck would be most likely to suffocate the child, if she had been suspended long—it appeared to have been tied very tightly round her neck—there had been great pressure round the neck to cause the breaking of the skin, and the extravasation of blood underneath.</p>

               <p>JOHN HERBERT. I am an officer. Last Saturday se'nninght I observed the prisoner in a wherry. I boarded the wherry. He was about fifty yards from the Wapping shore. There was only the prisoner and the waterman (Smith) on board. I observed the prisoner wit a great coat under his arm. I searched the great coat, and in the two pockets I found one bladder in each pocket. The two bladders contained about five quarts of rum, and in the coat that he had on I found a pewter half-pint pot; it had rum in it, by the smell. The prisoner said, he was an Excise watchman; he had been watching a craft. I directed the waterman to row back to the place where he had it from. Smith rowed me back to the craft.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn from the prisoner whether he had been watching it - A. He said it was the craft. The craft was loaded with casks of rum. I examined the cask of rum. On Tuesday. I attended the Excise officers guaging. I found that rum had been spilled over the cask very lately. I took him to the Thames police office. It was a lighter that had hatches, and there was a communication from the hatches to the scuttle. These are the bladders; they leak.</p>
               <p>JURY. The bladders seem to have had a deal of use.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you went to the craft did you find any person belonging to the craft there - A. There was another watchman on board, his name was Edwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You searched me twice, did you find any tools upon me - A. No.</p>
               <p>

            . I am the waterman that took Edwards from the lighter, and going towards shore the officers in the police boat called to me to stop. I stopped immediately. I told the prisoner. He said, I am done. That was just before the officer came on board of us. The prisoner had got a great coat under his arm. I saw one of the bladders taken from the great coat. I shewed the officer where I took the prisoner from.</p>

I staid from eight o'clock till nine, and then I was relieved by the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a cooper. On Tuesday, last week, I examined the rum puncheon, marked W and a diamond, No. 28. I found the cask had a spill in it, near the bung, and not properly cut off. It appeared to be newly put in. The cask was a very sound cask. I took out the bung, and there was deficiency of upwards of a gallon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am very certain I never took any rum out of the cask. Seaby had the same charge as I had; he was with them two days the same as I was. A little before day-light in the morning a man throwed something up on the lighter as I was standing on the deck; it was rum, in these bladders. I should have carried it to the office if I had not been stopped.</p>
               <p>MR. MANDER. Q. I believe you and your partners are the proprietors of these rums - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the goodness to taste this rum. This is a sample taken out of the bladder, and this is a sample taken out of the cask - A. From the taste, I should think them both the same.</p>

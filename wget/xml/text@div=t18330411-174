               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You did not miss any of these till Dr. Dewsnap's groom brought you a bridle? A. No; it was my father's business once, but he has left it three or four years; there was a person named Bottle in our service, but I do not know what has become of him, that I can confidently swear - I did not take him any where.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a clergyman seeing you and him together at Margate? A. Mr. Bottle came down to Margate unknown to me, while I was there for a week - he was married in May last, and he was turned away from our service in September - it was in July that he came down to Margate - his wife was not with him there; I believe she was at home - my father and mother were not with me; Bottle knew where I was; he came down on Saturday, and staid till the Sunday evening; I never told a person named Goodlad, that if the prisoner had not set up in business at Hammersmith, I would not only not have interfered with him, but I would have given him a good character for honesty; I said, if he had left quietly, I might not have interfered with him, if he had not interfered with my business - I did not discharge him for any fault.</p>
               <p>GEORGE KENNEY. I am a tailor. I have been in the habit of making clothes for the prisoner; I made him a suit of black - he paid me a sovereign, and I received a chaise harness in payment of the rest - I have no doubt this is the harness; he said if I could get a customer for it it would be serving him - this was in August last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you do with it? A. I went to Dr. Dewsnap, to see if it would do for his horse; it was to be 4l. - the prisoner occupied a room, and worked as a harness-maker; Dr. Dewsnap dealt with the prosecutrix, and the prisoner must know that any thing he sold him the prosecutrix would have any opportunity of seeing; the harness was not quite finished when I made the clothes - he did not desire me to conceal it.</p>
               <p>NICHOLAS SALMON (Police-constable T 96). I produce the harness; I found the reins, the bit, and the traces at Mr. Heady's, where the prisoner lodges; the traces are not finished - they are lined with brown leather.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I made the traces at my own lodging.</p>

               <p>JAMES COVEY. I know I made this collar. I do not know for whom; I am a master for myself - I make six hundred in the course of a year, and sell them to saddlers.</p>
               <p>Witness for the Defence.</p>
               <p>CHARLES LINDERGREEN. I sold a pair of winkers to the prisoner, similar to these; I saw the prosecutrix on this business - she said if the prisoner had left Hammersmith she would not have interfered with him, and given him a good character; it is impossible for a person to speak to these traces - I could cut fifty strips out of one hide; these ornaments are as common as can be.</p>

On the 4th of August I saw the prisoner come up the area steps - I ran to the pantry, where I had left some plate, and missed the property described in the indictment. I called to the footman to pursue him, as I was undressed - I put on my coat and waistcoat, ran out, and saw him on the other side - the footman had got beyond him. I seized him, and told him to deliver up what he had under his coat to the footman; he did so, and a silver fork dropped from the parcel he was delivering. I took him back to the house. The value of the plate is above 20 l.</p>

On the 7th of November a little boy took a candle to look into the privy to find by what means the cat had escaped. He there saw a shelf under the seat of the privy, and ten bottles on the shelf. He came into his mother, and said there is a robbery going forward, and Mr. Carney ought to be acquainted with it. The prisoner came on Monday the 14th of November, to ask if we could employ him, and the man said there was no work to do. The prisoner then went to the privy; the housekeeper then discovered two bottles taken away out of the privy. We engaged him to work on Monday the 21st of November; that day passed without any bottles being taken away. On Tuesday evening he was observed to go to the privy about eight o'clock. On his return I called him into the accompting-house; the woman brought in word there were two bottles missing out of the privy. I sent for a constable; the constable took one bottle out of his pocket, and two out of his breeches. I had taken one out of his pocket previous to the constables's coming. One of the bottles contained Hollands, two red port wine, and one white wine, all drawn from the casks on tap.</p>
               <p>- I am a constable. I produce one bottle of Hollands; there are four bottles in all; three out of the four I took from him; one out of his pocket, and two out of his breeches; down before him he had a leather apron on.</p>

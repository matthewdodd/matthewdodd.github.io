                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 250.) I live in Rodney-street. On the night of the 20th of March I was in Lower-street, Islington, about eight o'clock—I saw four men near Mr. Barren's shop—he is a linen dra<lb></lb>per—I walked on, on the other side of the way, and saw one man cross the road—I ran after him—he went down River-street—I ran across a brick-field, and got to the top of River-street, where I had seen the man go down, with something, which I supposed to be linen—I stopped about a minute, when the two prisoners came up in conversation, and Hunter was carrying a bundle—I followed them about fifty yards, and then asked Hunter what he had got there—he said, "It is mine"—I said, "You are my prisoner"——he then threw down the bundle, and I took him to the station—it had two pieces of linen in it—King walked off—he was a yard or two before Hunter—I am sure they were together—I had seen them both together before the prosecutor's shop, and I saw them again in River-street, in two or three minutes—I had known King a considerable time.</p>

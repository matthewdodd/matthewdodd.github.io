            . I went to the prisoner's lodgings in Stingo-lane - he was in bed - his wife got up and opened the door; I said I wished to look into their premises - the prisoner said he had no objection: I found this brush with J. S. on it, for Mr. Shepherd's name - I then found these three half-pint pots, with the name nearly out, under the bed, and found this shovel, with the name nearly scraped out - between the bed and the mattress, I found this cloth with the name on it; the prisoner said he had picked it up in the Mews, and washed it several times, but never noticed the name on it; and he had given another brush for it to one of Mr. Shepherd's men.</p>

The horse-cloth I picked up in the street, all over dirt, four years ago - there was a hackney-coach there, and I offered it to the man; he said he would not have it - I washed it several times, and saw the sign of a name on it, but as to whose it was, I could not tell. I gave a hard brush to Morgan, Mr. Shepherd's hostler, for this clothes-brush - I picked up the shovel in the street, and as I had met two dung-carts, I thought they had dropped it - there were several pails about, and I took this one home.</p>

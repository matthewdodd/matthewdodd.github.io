               <p>Which of you does the house belong to? - We are partners in the trade, which is carried on in the warehouse under the dwelling house; the house belongs to us both; the rent and taxes are paid out of the partnership account; on the 6th instant, as I was sitting in my compting-house, I heard a noise on the counter, as if papers was sweeping out; I saw no person in the warehouse, but I heard the door shut softly; I had left two pieces of dimity on the counter, they had been laying there possibly an hour, in a wrapper, ready to he packed up, but I had seen them about ten minutes before this circumstance, and had gone into the compting-house to make out a bill of parcels to inclose in them; going out of the door, in consequence of missing the two pieces of dimity; I looked on each side of the door, and perceived the prisoner with the two pieces under his arm, he was got from the door about forty yards; I supposed it to be a joke of some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110089"></xptr>neighbour's porter; I did not suppose any body would come to steal them at that time of the day; I called to him to bring them back; he did not at first regard me; but I called stop thief, and whether he dropped them then, or on my calling after him, I cannot say; but I saw him drop them; I pursued him, and left the dimities laying on the ground; I saw him stopped by a person who is now in Court; he was out of my sight for an instant; while I might be supposed to be turning two corners; I might be about twenty yards from him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the man that was stopped is the same man that you saw drop the piece of dimity? - I believe I may say to a certainty, as far as a man can say by seeing the back of another; his face I never saw; I am not positive whether I picked up the goods, or whether some neighbour picked them up; he was brought back to the warehouse, and the goods; he was not particularly charged, but I believe Mrs. Gill coming down said, for shame, young man, what will be the consequence? I think he made no answer; he was taken to the Compter immediately; the goods that were brought in were left in my house, and then the constable took charge of the prisoner, and he marked the goods before he left the house, and fetched them when he had taken the prisoner to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Were the goods that he marked the same pieces that you saw the prisoner drop? - They were the same; I am sure of that, I had no others of the sort in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheridan, Prisoner's Counsel. Did you see the prisoner's face till he was in custody? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>By what marks can you take upon yourself to say now, almost to a certainty, that he was the person? - In the first place by his low stature; next by a blue jacket he had on when he had the goods under his arm, and the same when he was brought back, and seeing no other person running at the same time.</p>
               <p>You lost sight of him? - I did, it was impossible to mistake him; there was no person between him and me running during the time; I pursued him till I got into Bread-street.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gill. The lengths is the only thing I have to judge by; I believe they are the same pieces; I am sure they are the same pieces; they are the property of Mr. Maxey and me; the value of them may be about six pounds.</p>

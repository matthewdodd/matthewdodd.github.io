                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Broad-court, Drury-lane—the prisoner worked for me as a journeyman—on the evening of the 1st of August, 1840, he was in my shop about six o'clock—I left the shop for about ten minutes, leaving him on the shop-board working—my wife</p>
               <p>was there also—I was sent for in about ten minutes—he was then gone, and I missed the coat he had been finishing, also a black frock coat, and a pair of black trousers—about nine o'clock I missed another new frock cost—I have never found any of them—the prisoner never came back for the money that was due to him—I had not paid him for that day's work, and never saw him again till about a month ago.</p>

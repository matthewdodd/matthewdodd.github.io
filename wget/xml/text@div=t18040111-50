               <p>Q. What do you know about this business? - A. The prisoner came to my place a month ago last Saturday, and enquired for Mrs. Graham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she see you in your room? - A. Yes; I told her, Mrs. Graham was gone to live at the Coach and Horses, in the one pair back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out? - A. Yes; I only just latched the door, and left the child in the cradle; I went up stairs for an iron, and staid about ten minutes; when I returned again, the things were missing; I missed a pair of sheets, two shirts, a shift, and an apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the things afterwards? - A. I went to all the pawnbrokers about, that I could; I happened to go to a pawnbroker's, in Turnpin-alley, Leicester-square; I saw my apron and shift upon the counter, I told the pawnbroker they were mine; the pawnbroker asked me who stole them; I told him I did not know, I was afraid my husband would lick me, and the pawnbroker gave me a description of the person; I know it was the prisoner that had been in my room.</p>

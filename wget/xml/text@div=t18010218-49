               <p>Q. You don't sell great coats and handkerchiefs? - A. No: On Monday the 26th of January, I had been out the greater part of the day, I came home about five o'clock, took off my great coat, and laid it on the arm of a sofa, by the parlour door in the shop; I had occasion to go out to the back part of the house, and in the mean time the prisoner at the bar, with another man, came into the shop; when I returned I saw them speaking to my wife; upon my coming in my wife cried out that my coat was gone; the prisoner stood between my wife and the great-coat; I then took the prisoner by the collar; he made a strong plunge, disengaged himself from me, and ran away; I went after him, and called stop thief; he went down Pitt-street; I did not see the great-coat upon either of them; it was found in the passage of No. 23, in Pitt-street, just by where the prisoner was stopped; he had run past that door; there was a handkerchief in the coat pocket, and some cards of my address; I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH GERRARD sworn. - I am a carpenter; I was going along Charlotte-street, I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw a man running across from the corner of Pitt-street, angle corners to Goodge-street; I advanced a few steps towards him, and attempted to catch him; he aimed a blow at me, but I brought him to the ground; he got up again and got from me; he ran, and I pursued him till he was taken.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CHINNERY sworn. - I am watch-house keeper: In consequence of information I went to No. 23, Pitt-street, and there I found this coat. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Harris. I am sure this is my coat, here are my cards and my handkerchief in the pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. While I was in the shop the woman said she had lost a great-coat, and that somebody belonging to me had taken it; I said I was a seafaring man, and not a thief; I was a little groggy, and said I would not be taken by the collar; that gentleman made a blow at me, and I struck him again; I am as innocent as the child unborn.</p>

             sworn. - I am the wife of John Harris; two men came into the shop with a pint mug to ask the price of it, and they took it out again and put it down where they found it; they then consulted and came in again; the prisoner offered me twopence halfpenny; I said I would not take less than threepence; he said he must have it, for he had nothing to use; he then gave me a shilling, which I doubted, and he gave me another, and as soon as I had taken his second shilling, they both turned round very quick; I then missed the coat, and immediately accused them with it; my husband immediately came in at the door, I don't think they made any answer; my husband then collared the prisoner, but he disengaged himself, and ran away; there had been nobody else in the shop.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did he run away without his change? - A. Yes; I returned him the shilling at the shop door. <rs id="t18010218-49-verdict274" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. For what purpose did he come into your shop? - A. I had known him for some time, and he used frequently to call in and stop half an hour or an hour; when he had been in about five minutes, I had occasion to go out, but I returned in again in about five minutes, and then the prisoner was standing outside of the shop-door; when I went in my brother informed me something; I went to the prisoner, who was standing at the door, I took his hat off his head, and found ten shawls in the crown of his hat; I then sent for a constable, and had him taken into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at the time? - A. He pleaded very much to me to let him go; he told me it was entirely distress that drove him to it. (Produces the property.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know them to be your's? - A. They are new shawls with my private mark on them; they were in my shop ten minutes before I left my shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have known him some time? - A. I have, about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. You have know him in very good situations? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen these shawls? - A. I do believe I had seen these shawls ten minutes before I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not take your private mark off when you sell them? - A. I do not.</p>

               <p>Q. What were you employed about? - A. I had occasion to go behind some furniture for something, and I saw the prisoner take some shawls from a shelf in the shop, and he put them into the crown of his hat, and he went to the step of the door; as soon as my brother came in I told him; then my brother went up to him, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been in the habit of buying shawls of different people, and likewise stockings; some gentlemen are here that will prove that I have bought both shawls and stockings of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are they? - A. There is a gentleman who has promised to be here to-day, but he has neglected coming.</p>

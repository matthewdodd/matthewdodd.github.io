You have made a fine mess of this job; you ought to have taken the cab home yourself"—Murphy said, "If I had done so I should have been <hi rend="italic">sneaked</hi> at the time, as the <hi rend="italic">coppers</hi> were there waiting; it <hi rend="italic">licks</hi> me how they got the number of the cab"—West said, "The <hi rend="italic">copper sneaked</hi> it when we were turning the corner; he</p>

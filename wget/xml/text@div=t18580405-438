                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, of No. 204, Fleet Street. The prisoner was my shopman from May to Oct., 1855—I had four shopmen at that time, including the prisoner—about Christmas, 1855, and alter the prisoner had left, I missed this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is worth 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it cost 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I next saw it about Feb., this year, in the hands of an officer who had another case in hand.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you known him before he went into your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I received a character with him from the person with whom he had been employed, which was quite sufficient for me to engage him, and when he left, his character did not suffer in my hands—heconducted himself in a straightforward and exemplary manner—he is a young man of intelligence, and I had no reason to doubt his honesty when he left—heleft me for the ostensible purpose of going to New York—he was absent one year from England, and returned at the latter end of last year—he did not call on me on his return—letters were not directed to him at my place after he returned to England—I saw him speaking to an assistant of mine—thewatch was not a pledge; I bought it a long time before the prisoner came into my service—I have not had occasion to discharge any servant who was living with me at the time the prisoner was—I parted with the assistant who succeeded the prisoner in the same department; I have an idea where he is now—he remained in my service three quarters of a year; he parted with me of his own acoord; he gave me notice to leave—the watch was in my window, and I marked it myself; I bought it about a year before the pri<lb></lb>soner came, and soon after wards put it in the window—to speak with the greatest certainty, I saw it there early in Aug., but my impression is that I saw it in Sept.—the prisoner had not authority to sell, he was quite in another department—I missed it very shortly after he left—I had not once a different impression about the time that I missed it—I did not once think or say that I missed it while he was with me; other property, but not that—Iam not aware that I have said so, but if I have, it may be correct—I may have been once under that impression—I cannot tell you why I did not give him into custody then—I gave him a character after that.</p>

               <p>I might have missed it when I wanted it to show to a customer, even while the prisoner was in my service; but I should not think, from a temporary absence for an hour, that it had been stolen from me—I am sure it was not sold; I have an accurate system of book keeping, wherein the number of every watch sold is entered—I am quite certain it was not sold, and it has my writing on the gold at the present moment.</p>

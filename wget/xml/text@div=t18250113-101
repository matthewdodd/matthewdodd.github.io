On the 29th of November I bought these goods in Bishopsgate-street, and about four o'clock in the afternoon went into the Sun, public-house, with them - the prisoner was there. I had a pint of beer, and fell asleep, and on awaking the bundle was gone, and she also - I missed my watch; I went out directly, and informed Hill, who afterwards produced the shalloon and Marseilles.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prosecutor stated this case to me; a person named Browning was brought to the watch-house, and after that the pot-boy directed me to the prisoner's lodging, in Angel-alley - I found her in bed with a man, with the shalloon and marseilles under her pillow, between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor came into the Sun, and got in company with a female - they drank ale and gin; he went out with her for half an hour, and was quite drunk. The female knew my room - whether she took him there I do not know. I went about eight o'clock to put my child to bed, and thought somebody had been there; - I went home about eleven.</p>

            . I live at the Sun, public-house. The prosecutor came in about one o'clock, and had a pint of ale, then went out, returned about six, and Mary Browning made friends with him. His parcel fell down two or three times, and she would not let me take it to the bar for safety. The prisoner came in after that with her child - the prosecutor let the child play with his watch two or three times. The prisoner then went home with her child; I had to carry some beer that way, and walked with her. I left Browning there laying on the parcel; when I returned the prosecutor was quite tipsy - he could not stand, and missed his parcel. My master and mistress were gone to the play.</p>
               <p>JAMES CHAMBERLAIN. I was neither drunk nor sober - I had had rather too much beer. I did not leave Tottenham till after one o'clock. I met a patrol at the door of the public-home; he took me to Hill's house - we found her at the watch-house.</p>

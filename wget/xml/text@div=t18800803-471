I was on duty in Smithfieid on 26th June, about 8.15 a.m.—the prisoner was loitering about, I following him through several streets into Long Lane, Smithfieid—he waited there some time, and then came back into Smithfieid and stopped some little time—I followed him through several streets—he was carrying a bundle—I stopped him in Charterhouse Street, and said "What have you in that bundle?" he said "What do you think I have got there? clothes belonging to me"—I said "Where have you brought them from?"—he said "Mr. Rees's, but I do not know where they live"—I said "Where did you lodge last night?"—he said "In this lodging-house," pointing to one close by—I said "I do not feel satisfied with your statement; I shall take you in custody, and charge you with unlawful possession of these things"—I took him to the station, where he was charged—I found upon him twenty counterfeit half-crowns wrapped separately in tissue-paper in two parcels, and in a black bag also 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good money—after he was charged he said "I picked them up, and you know I did"—I did not know he picked them up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Magistrate "I asked him how he came by them, and he said he picked them up just before he saw me"—he did say those two things—he did not say what he meant by "and you know I did"—he said "for you must have seen me pick them up"—he was not charged with the unlawful possession of the bundle—it contained socks and shirts.</p>

            . My father and I went out at eight o'clock, my father left me at half-past eight, I had the bundle, and knocked at Mr. Glazier's door, where I was to leave it. A man knocked me down and took the bundle away from me. The prisoner is the man, I am sure of it, he threw the bundle away in the court; and ran down John-street into Goodge-street. The watchman took him.</p>
               <p>JOHN GLAZIER. There was a knock at my door, I went up, the boy had fell down, and I saw a man run off with the bundle.</p>
               <p>ELIZA PARKER. I saw a man take the bundle from under the boy's arm, and run down John-street; I think the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HIGGINS. I heard the alarm and saw the prisoner running, and tried to stop him, but he over-powered me and got past; I am sure the prisoner is the man-it is a bye street.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM RICHARDSON. I am a watchman. I heard the alarm and saw a man run by me, he ran up Goodge-street, I pursued him, he dodged me through the coach-stand; I took him at the bottom of Cumberland-street, he was in a crowd, I knew him by his dress.</p>

               <p>ELIZA BESSITER. I keep a coal-shed in Colwell-court. I picked the bundle up in the court, at a little after eight o'clock in the evening.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was running to keep myself warm. I saw a man running who was dressed like me. The watchman did not know me at first.</p>

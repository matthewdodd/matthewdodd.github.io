                  </hi>. I am incumbent of Christ Church, St. George's—on Sunday, 3d December, at 1 in the morning, I was called up by a constable—the sexton went into the church then—I went in the morning, and found the cash-box, in which the offertory was, broken open, and a blanket, 2 globes, and 4 chimneys from the gas lights removed—these are the articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found that an opening had been made in the vestry window, and an entry effected there—those articles are the property of the churchwardens, except the blanket, which is mine—the cash-box had been taken out of the drawer in the table, the lock of the drawer forced, and the side of the cash-box broken open—it had contained about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in coppers—they had left a halfpenny in—I had seen the cash-box safe on the Wed<lb></lb>nesday, and the other articles on the Sunday—I think I saw Fitz Henry, on</p>

On 3d December, from information I received, I went to Mr. McGiu's residence—I saw the church—the vestry door had been broken open—the 2 globes, the 4 chimneys, and the blanket were lying outside the vestry window, in the churchyard—another constable called the set ton up, and we examined the church—we found a drawer in the vestry had been broken open, and the cash-box was on the table, also broken open—I found marks on the cash-box—on Tuesday, when the prisoners were in custody on the former charge, I saw this knife found on Fitz Henry—is corresponds with the marks on the drawer and the marks on the cash-box, and would be caused by a knife like this—I preserved the footmarks which I found under the window, took Fitz Henry's boots, com<lb></lb>pared them with three different impressions, and found them to correspond—I charged the prisoners—they both stated they knew nothing whatever about it.</p>

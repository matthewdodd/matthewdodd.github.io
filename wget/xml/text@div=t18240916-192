               <p>"Stop thief!" Two young men followed after him; he turned to go into Petticoat-lane, and they also; and by the time I had got up, the two young men turned and said he was gone round another way into Whitechapel. While I was hesitating, an officer came up with Marks in his hand, but nothing was found on him. Next morning I found both the prisoners at the Mansion-house, and my watch also. I am certain that Marks is the man who snatched it; I never doubted about him; I could not see his face, but he was stouter than the others. There was nobody in the yard but them. I think Allen is one of the two who ran after him. It was dark.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the evening of the 18th of July. I was in Petticoat-lane, at the corner of Blue-anchor-yard, I heard a call of</p>
               <p>"Stop thief!" Marks immediately ran up, and I stopped him; two others were behind him, and the prosecutor behind them. I took them to the watch-house; returned to the spot in a quarter of an hour, and saw Allen putting something into his breeches pocket. I collared him, and he dropped the watch, and said he had picked it up. The prosecutor said he could not positively swear that Marks was the man who had taken it; but he was the nearest man to him, and the person who ran from him.</p>

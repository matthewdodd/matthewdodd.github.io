(I am servant to Mr. Jackson) and while I and my fellow servant were out of the kitchen, there was a silver table spoon taken away, that was lying with another in the kitchen. Upon missing it, I went and charged the prisoner, as he had been in the kitchen just before. I went for a constable, but before he came, the prisoner had confessed he took it, and shewed us where he had hid it amongst the coals, in my master's cellar. [Produced in court, and deposed to ]</p>

            . I happened to be in Mr. Jackson's house; Mr. Lee sent his fellow servant for assistance, I went to him. The prisoner, upon being taxed with taking the spoon, at first denied it; then they told him, if he would tell where he had put the spoon, they would stop the constable. Then he told them where he had taken it, and shewed them where he had hid it among the coals. I took it out; I could see about half an inch of the bowl bare, close to the wall in the help of coals.</p>

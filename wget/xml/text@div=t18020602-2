             sworn. - On the 8th of May I lost four pair of boots from the wharf in East-Smithfield; they had come from Leith, in a Berwick smack belonging to the old Shipping Company of Berwick, the firm of the partnership is as it is stated in the indictment; the boots were in the custody of the officer; I saw two pair taken out of the pocket of the prisoner, Griffiths, and the other two pair out of the jacket-pocket of the prisoner, Piper; Mr. Ray, who had come up in the vessel, had brought a cask of boots, which my clerk told me he desired him to sell for him; I did not see the gentleman at all; my clerk, and some of the other clerks, wished to have a pair of cheap  boots, and I went to the cask, with Mr. Thomas-Coxhead Stevens, Alexander Bowmaker, and another gentleman, and they sitted themselves; I noticed one of the boots had a little rent behind, and they were put into the cask again; I suppose there were a dozen pair taken out, and one of the pair that was found upon Griffiths, had a rent behind; I have no doubt of their being the same boots; they were tacked together.</p>
               <p>Q. As to those taken from Piper, can you speak to them at all? - A. No, any further than when we counted the number in the cask, they were missing; there should have been four dozen in the cask, and we found four pair were gone; the prisoners worked in the warehouse where the boots were.</p>

             sworn. - I am porter at the Berwick wharf in the employ of Mr. Laurie; I employed the prisoners on the 8th of May, about one o'clock, to move leather from one lost to the other; in one of the losts there was a cask of boots, which had been landed from the vessel; I told out the boots the night before, and there were a dozen and four pair; we found two pair in Griffiths's jacket-pocket; his jacket was lying upon a case as if he was about his work; I asked him what he had got in his pocket; when I discovered the boots in his jacket, I went down stairs, and informed Mr. Laurie; he told me to fetch the jacket, which I did, and shewed them to Mr. Laurie; there were two pair of boots, and a spoon; I took it back again, and Griffiths put on the jacket, and came down stairs; he desired me, for God's sake, to take the boots out of his pocket, and let them go; I said, I could not do it, for my master knew they were there as well as myself; then he went up stairs for his hat; my master desired me to go and see where he was gone to, and, when I went up, I saw him jumping out of the loop-hole into the street; I called out stop thief, and he was stopped; I brought him back to my master on the wharf, and an officer was sent for to take him up.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it you searched the pocket of the other man, Piper? - A. After Griffiths had got out into the street; I went into the warehouse, and took up the jacket; I asked Piper if it was his; he said, yes, and asked how it came there; he said, he had left it upon the case; I went down into the accompting-house with him, and put his jacket on the stool in the accompting-house; I looked, and found two pair of boots, one pair in each pocket, of the same sort of boots; I cannot swear to them; they were delivered to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. (Counsel for Piper.) 
               <persName id="t18020602-2-person67">Q. </persName>
            Griffiths took to his heels, and ran away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Piper submitted to be searched very readily? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GRIFFITHS sworn. - I belong to the Police-office, Lambeth street: On the 8th of May, I was sent for to Mr. Laurie's there was a soldier's jacket on the stool in the accompting-house; I took it up, and asked Piper if that was not his jacket; he said, it was; I then took a pair of boots out of each side of his jacket in the lining; the lining was tore; the other two pair were delivered to me by Mr. Laurie.

            (To Jones.) Were there any other soldiers employed? - A. Yes, there was one other soldier, and another man, that always worked there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Laurie. This is the boot that had the rent in it; the others are the same kind of boots; I believe them to be the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. All the boots were consigned from Scotland in a cask? - A. Yes.</p>

            No; Piper certainly did not shew the least symptom of criminality or fear, so much so, that I wished the Justice not to commit him; I dare say he was five minutes in the warehouse after it was discovered.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Piper, left his defence to his Counsel, and called his serjeant, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Griffiths, put in a written defence, stating that he was innocent of the crime.</p>

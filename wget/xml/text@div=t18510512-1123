                  </hi>. I am overseer to Mr. Charles Barlow and two others. They carry on the printing business in East Harding-street—Symmonds was in their employ for six or seven weeks—I missed some back numbers of the "Patent Journal"—I had missed some for ten days before 24th April—these are some of the numbers—I cannot tell what quanity was missed—we have traced nearly 5 cwt., which we valued at 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we sell the back numbers at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a number—the first I saw of the papers which are connected with this indictment was at Mr. Hembury's, a shell<lb></lb>fish dealer in the Strand, and I saw some at Mr. Hilsdon's—they were claimed by me, and given up to the officer—I can swear to these by the wrappers and the manner in which they were put away—they are packed in quires of twenty-five—the men who bought them of the boys took the wrappers off.</p>

At half-past twelve o'clock on 24th April I went to Red Lion-court, where Nyren resides—I told him I wanted him for stealing paper in company with Symmonds; he said, "Yes, I took the paper, but I did not sell it"—I took him to the station, and placed him by the side of Symmonds—Symmonds said that they had taken some paper on Saturday night last, and on Monday—he said, "We took it in a truck, to a shop in Clare-market"—he said Nyren came to the premises, and took the paper from the passage—when I was going from the Compter to</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waste-paper dealer, at 4, Beer-street, Clare-market. I have bought numbers of the "Patent Journal" from Symmonds—he came sometimes by himself, and sometimes he brought a lad with him, of the name of Bunting—on Easter Monday Nyren and Buntiag brought a truck; it contained some of the paper now produced—there was 101lbs. of it—while I was out that afternoon, Symmonds came, and re-weight weighed the paper, and made it 106lbs.—when I paid him that afternoon, he said it was 106lbs.; I said it was only 101lbs.—I paid him 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it; that was rather between the two weights—he had given me this address, which he said was his brother's: "John Frazer, Frederick-street, White-chapel "—he said his brother had got very nearly two tons' weight of paper—he said his name was William Frazer, and he was keeping his brother's books—he signed his name William Frazer—I sold part of the paper to Mr. Hicks, at the corner of Panton-street, Haymarket, about 60lbs. of it—this is part of the paper.</p>

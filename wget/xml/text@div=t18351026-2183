                  </hi>. I am a waiter at a concert and exhibition room, No. 6, Leicester-square. On the 13th of October, a few minutes after three o'clock in the morning—I was with a friend, and he had a very bad cold, I had the same myself—we went to the public-house opposite, and had some rum<lb></lb>and-water with some butter in it—when I came out, I saw this young woman, whom I had seen several times but never spoken to her—I asked her, how a friend of hers was, whom I knew—she came over to me—I stopped for a minute at the other door, which was shut, speaking about him—the policeman said, "You must not stop here"—I went home to my own door, about 150 yards off—I said, "Good night"—she put her hand into my watch-pocket, and took out a sovereign and two half sovereigns—I said, "Stop, it is not all right"—I missed the money—she was going—and the policeman stopped her—he caught her hand and found two half sove<lb></lb>reigns and one sovereign.</p>

The prosecutor called me, but I had before spoken to them, at a dark door, and told them to move away—I went round my beat, and saw them near the same place—I said to the prisoner, "What do you want with a drunken man?"—she said, "I know him"—I said, "You can't mean any good"—he then said, "Heigh, heigh, that woman has got a sovereign, and two half-sovereigns"—I saw her moving her hand to another female—I said, "What have you got there?"—she said it was a shilling—I opened her hand, and found the sovereign and two half-sovereigns—the other female said, "What she has got there is only a few halfpence, given her by a gambler."</p>

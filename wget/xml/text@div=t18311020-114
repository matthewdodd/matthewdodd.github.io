            . I am a Policeman. On the 14th of September, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in <placeName id="t18311020-114-crimeloc610">New Palace-yard, near Poetscorner</placeName>

I told him I had seen him pick a gentleman's pocket - he gave me no answer; I took him to the station, and asked if he had any mark on the handkerchief - he said there that it was his own; he said he did not know of any mark on it - I found the centre of it marked, "A. J. West, Durham, No. 7."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have you had many charges for stealing the property of persons unknown? A.Never before; I have been a Policeman since February, 1830. and before that was in a tallowchandler's service for thirteen years; I was about twelve yards from the prisoner; I should think there were fifty persons between us - I could see very well what he was doing, as when the crowd crushed towards the barrier the mob was not pressed together, and being elevated I saw this; I was at least a foot from the ground, and saw over the heads of the people - the people passed from barrier to barrier, which opened at certain times; the prisoner was pointed out to me by a gentleman, as having attempted his pocket.</p>

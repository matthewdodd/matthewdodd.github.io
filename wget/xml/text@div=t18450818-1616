                  </hi>. I keep the White-hart at Hampton-wick—the prisoner was in my service as ostler—on Saturday evening, the 2nd of Aug., about nine o'clock, I was standing in my bar, against the door, and heard the yard door open—this is a correct plan of the premises—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—I heard the back door open, in consequence of which I said to the lad, Phil-lips, who was wiping glasses between the bar and the tap-room, "Who is gone into the yard?"—I looked towards the door, and saw some person going out—he said, "John, the ostler, gone to shut the kitchen shutters"—I told him to go and see who it was—Mrs. Phillips asked him some ques-tion which delayed him—he went in about two minutes from the time of the door opening—I think there was sufficient time for a person to have gone down the yard through the stable to the back of the lean-to as described is the plan—the distance is about thirty yards—about a minute and a half or two minutes after Phillips went out I heard him cry out, "Master, master, the loft is on fire"—I ran into the yard and saw the flames through the lattice of the loft, over the stable where the horses are keptvthe flames appeared to come from the back part of the loft—there arc feather-edged boards above</p>

               <p>the rack which join the loft to the stable—on seeing the flames I returned into the parlour and gave an alarm—Mr. Wheeler, George Styles, Mr. Lemon, and Mr. Elkins, customers, who were in the house at the time, went out with me into the yard—I went to the pump and remained there pumping water and they got up into the loft by the ladder—the flames were extinguished in less than five minutes—I afterwards went with a po<lb></lb>liceman to the back of the stable—we found the door leading into the stable adjoining the lean-to, open—the other door leading into the pig-sty was bolted—we got into the lean-to, and found the ashes of some straw there alight, on the feather-edged boarding at the top of the wall—I found three such wisps of straw had been placed there—they had all been lighted—two were burnt, and one was singed but did not appear to have taken—there were ashes in the corner from the two that had burnt—the other was washed away by the water—it appeared to me that the loft had been fired from the lean-to—I had not seen the prisoner during this time—after the fire was put out I saw him in the yard—I said nothing to him—I did not see him assist in extinguishing the fire—I stood in the scullery, at the pump, and could not have seen him—there is a privy in the yard, for the use of the yard only—I saw the remains of a lucifer-match found there next morning in a cobweb—it was nearly burnt—there are two gates under the loft—the prisoner told me a few minutes after eight that evening that he had locked the gates, and the yard was safe—the pieces of straw appeared as if they had been <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> down the feather-edged boards from the loft—I went into the loft with the policeman—the flooring was very wet, and in a hole that ap<lb></lb>peared to have been cut in the feather-edged boarding we found a wisp of straw containing lucifer-matches—there was a quantity of loose straw near it, and four or five trusses of straw besides—that is the place where they were usually kept—I had seen the prisoner throw some straw from that loft at seven o'clock for the racking of the horses—there was no means of placing the wisps of straw down the feather-edged boarding except by going up the ladder into the loft, nor was there any way by which they could have been fired except by going through the stable to the back—we have tried how long it would take to get there from the yard door, and it would not take a minute.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Baker. On Saturday, the 2nd of Aug., about nine o'clock, I came out of the parlour, took up a glass, and told Mrs. Baker to draw the nine o'clock beer—the prisoner had been sitting in the tap-room just before—he had been there since eight o'clock, and had his supper—he asked me for a screw of tobacco and a pipe about half-past eight, and he was smoking that when I came out—when I took it to him, he said he had got to go and fasten the kitchen shutters—that would not take quite half a minute—I did not see him leave the tap-room or go out at the yard door—as I was wiping a glass Mr. Baker asked me who was gone out at the back door—I said, "John, gone to that the kitchen shutters"—I heard the back door opened and shut again—I looked into the tap-room—he was not there, and I said, yes, it was him—there was no one else there—the kitchen shutter did want fastening—I believe it was open the last time I was in the yard, and when I opened the door the kit<lb></lb>chen shutter was shut—the last time I was in the yard was about half-past four or five o'clock—I did not go to the yard door directly Mr. Baker spoke to me, as Mrs. Baker said something to me—he told me a second time, and then I went—about five minutes elapsed between my hearing the door shut and my going—I did not see a soul in the yard—I saw a light in the loft—the loft door was shut—I had been out of an evening, and had seen the prisoner there with a light before, and thought it might be that, but I saw the smoke and flame came from under the tiles—I said, "Oh, master, the loft is on fire!"—I should say I said it loud enough for any one in the yard or privy to hear—I did not see the prisoner till about twenty minutes after I discovered fire, when I was going with my beer—I then saw him in the yard, coming out with some carriage harness—I did not see him in the privy—the family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Baker, a young lady, a little boy, the prisoner, and myself—there was no female servant in the house—the customers were in the parlour.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Kingston-on-Thames. I go to an upholsterer's shop for my own amusement, but I gain no earnings from it—I live on my property—I sometimes sleep at the White Hart—I was not there at all on the 2nd of Aug.—I was at Dorking, in Surrey, which is fifteen miles distant—I started from Kingston about half-past nine o'clock in the morning—I heard of the fire on the following Monday—I have no knowledge who it was that fired the premises.</p>

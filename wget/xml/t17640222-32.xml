            . I am a constable. Between 6 and 7 o'clock, on the 24th of January, I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner at the bar for stealing a pig of copper ore; I took him to the counter; I asked him how he came to be so foolish to go to take this copper ore; he hesitated a little while, and at last said he took it for want; says I there must be two or three concerned with you in taking so much away, being told there were two or three more pigs missing; he made little or no answer; he was a labouring man upon the keys; I never saw him but once before in my life.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner bring the pig of copper ore out of the gateway, and throw it down where the rest of the copper ore lay; the gates were shut that he could not get out, I imagine was the reason he brought it back again.</p>

               <p>I work on the key. I was coming along about dusk; I saw a man run up one of the gateways; he dropt something; I went to see what it was, and found it to be a piece of copper; I took it up, and put it down where the rest of the pigs were lying. I am but lately come from the East-Indies in a king's ship, and have no friends to speak for me.</p>

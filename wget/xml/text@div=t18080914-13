               <p>Q. Was any body in the house when you went out - A. Nobody; I shut the door after me and locked it, with the key on the outside; it is only a common lock. I am sure I locked it. I come back about half past five, I could not have been absent longer than ten minutes; then I took the outside shutter down; I had taken the pins out when I went out: when I had taken the shutter down I had put the key in the lock; I could not unlock it; I thought I had strained the lock. I took the latch in my hand, I found the door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when you went out pulling your door to and locking your door - A. I always take the key with me. I recollect putting the key in to unlock the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put the key in the door when you went out - are you sure of that - A. To the best of my recollection I did; I do not recollect that ever I forgot it. We are all frail creatures.</p>
               <p>Q. To the best of your recollection you did lock it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You lifted up the latch, and then the door opened - A. Yes, and immediately the young man at the bar come down stairs before I got into the house; I had hardly entered the door when he came down with a pistol in his hand; I think it was in his right hand; but he did not offer to do me any mischief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you - A. Not a syllable; he rushed by me instantly, and immediately went into the street; directly after he passed another came down, he passed into the street the same way; I attempted to lay hold of him, I slipped my hand and fell down; I did not fall, properly; I recovered my fall, I got up again and made an alarm and cried stop thief; the man that went out last made a blow at me, it just touched the fore part of my face, it did not hurt me, and then he ran away immediately; I pursued after him about a dozen yards, not more, I was not capable of going far; then I made an alarm, a neighbour pursued him; I returned into my own house, I went up stairs into my chamber, I found all the things taken out of the drawers and throwed on the floor, and the plate was put on the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Had all these things been in the drawers when you left the house - A. Yes; the drawers were not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. What things did you find on the floor - A. Sheets and shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. None of them are mentioned in the indictment - did you find any of the things in the indictment on the floor - A. The bag with the silver things in it was put on the drawers in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. What silver things were they - A. Two silver pepper casters, two silver salts, seven silver tea spoons, two table spoons, a punch ladle, a stone stock buckle, two milk pots, all silver; there was one milk pot in the chamber, the other was in common use below stairs, it had been removed from one table to another; all the others were in a bag in the drawers, where they had been many years. The seven tea spoons remained in the box on the table not taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did you see or hear any thing of the prisoner - A. I suppose it night be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; some children informed me he was at the watchhouse; I went in the watchhouse and found him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you undertake to say that it was the same man that rushed by you - A. I have no doubt of the man; I wish I had.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the first man - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what coloured coat he had on - A. Something of a darkish coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the colour of the other man's coat - A. It appeared to me it was a dark coat; I was told it was a green coat; I did not observe myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know him before - A No; he is quite a young man; I hope he will not do so any more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. At the time you left your house you had no suspicion about the door being locked - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you had never taken any precaution about locking the door - A. No, I did not: it is a common thing for me to lock the door; it is possible. I might not have locked it: possibly I might be deceived about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with respect to the person of the prisoner, when you returned you saw a person running down stairs, which you believe to be the prisoner at the bar - A. I am very certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had only a moment to observe him - A. A very little time.</p>
               <p>Q. It was merely a person coming down and rushing out - A. He walked slowly across the room; when I first saw him I was about as far from him, as from him to me in the court now.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man a hat on - A. Yes; a round hat.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140009"></xptr>Q. Does any body live in the house besides yourself - A. Nobody.</p>
               <p>COURT. These things that you have given an account of are you a judge of the value of them - A. I valued them just as it came in my head; I do not know the weight of them.</p>

            . Q. How near do you live to Mr. Mann's house - A. Four doors offer my house faces the bottom of this court: from my place I can see Mr. Mann's door; it is on the right hand going in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the day when there was an alarm at his house - A. Yes; it was on the 22nd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Mann go out - A. No: I did not; I came out of my own house to open the window shutters, between five and six o'clock in the morning. I saw a man go very hastily into Mr. Mann's house dressed in green clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light or a dark green - A. Between a light and a dark green; I cannot say exactly; I only saw one man; the door was open. I saw him run in; I saw nobody near; I saw Mr. Mann about ten minutes after go to his window and take out the bolts; immediately he went up the court he put his hand up to the window and took out the window pin; I saw him put his left hand into his right hand pocket, as I thought, to take out a key to open his door; he then went in doors; he had not been in above a moment before I heard Mr. Mann say what do you want here, you villians, you have come to rob me; two men instantly rushed out of the house; in the scuffle Mr. Mann slipped down; Mr. Mann recovered himself again, he called out stop thief, and when he called out stop thief I saw the man in the green coat turn round and strike him in the face; that is the man that came out last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. You say it was about ten minutes from the man in the green coat going into the house and Mr. Mann returning - you did not keep your eye all the time upon the house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore in the mean time the second man might have got into the house - A. He might.</p>

When Mr. Mann gave the alarm, I was in Red cross street, up by my stables; that is not more two hundred yards off from where Mr. Mann lives; they called out stop thief; it was about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning; I then started from the stable and ran to Dean street; there I saw the prisoner running down Dean street; I called to him, and says, pray what have you been doing this morning; he said, nothing; I made way for him to go by; I catched hold of him as he past me; I said as you have done nothing stop till these people come up; Mr. Parrot and Dunstan came up; they are not here; I told these people they could take care of him; they took him to this gentleman, the officer of the parish.

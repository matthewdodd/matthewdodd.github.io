             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 19th of July last, Saturday morning, at half after eight o'clock in the morning, I went to this public house to meet Mr. Pendegraft according to appointment the day before, I called for a pint of ale and waited for the space of an hour, till I was quite out of patience; I then spoke to the landlord, Mr. Mullein, and he says, you may as well go into the parlor; I went to the parlour, and I told the young woman, whom I understood was doing business for Pendegraft, I should be glad to speak to you, and she came out to me, and I told her what I said to Pendegraft, and she said, I can do nothing just now, I have got no whites, she said she expected Mr. Pendegraft presently, and I went and sat down again, I sat there for the space of half an hour or more, then I went into the parlour and sat there some time with them, where she was very busy serving out this money, there were some score of customers, at last as I was sitting in the parlour, she asked me how many six-pences I would have? I told her I would have as many as she could let me have, I left it to her, I told her I wished to have some of all sorts, and she gave me eight shillings and twenty-four sixpences, and sixty halfpence, and I gave her half a guinea in gold for them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Page, in the first place did you know the prisoner at the bar before? - Never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe she is the wife of Pendegraft, don't you know that? - Just as much as you do.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that she is the wife of the last prisoner Pendegraft? - No, I do not,</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard that? - Never in my life time, on my oath.</p>
               <p>

            Don't you know that she is a relation of the last prisoner? - I do not, the landlord said so, but she denied it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. She said she could not do any thing till Pendegraft returned? - She did so, but she did do without Mr. Pendegraft coming.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not attempt to make any bargain with you till you spoke to her? - By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you encouraged her to deal in this sort of way? - I did not, the landlord went in to inform her I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. You asked her for some whites, and before you asked her she did not attempt to put off any to you? - No, by no means to me, but she did to others, a great many.</p>

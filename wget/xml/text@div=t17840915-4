               <p>You took them to be gentlemen? - Yes, he asked for some rabbets, he wanted a rabbet or a couple to be chopped up for frying; after agreeing for the price, this gentleman asked me to change a guinea, and he put down a guinea, I put down thirteen shillings, which he took up, the other gentleman said, O! damn it, do not change, I have money plenty, he laid down the money again.</p>
               <p>Did he take up all? - Yes, I had bet ten shillings when he went away, in the room of thirteen.</p>
               <p>I think you say, the prisoner took up the money as you laid it down? - Yes, he did take it up, he then laid down ten shillings of it, and they both went out of the shop, and bought nothing.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you observed there were three shillings short? - Not three minutes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you had thirteen shillings? - Yes, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Did you count them out one by one? - Yes, I am sure, I took out thirteen shillings, and had but ten again, and nobody was in the house but myself, and one child of ten years old, they had a chaise waiting for them opposite to my house, I saw them get into the chaise and go off immediately; there was another waiting at the door for them with a whip in his hand, I am sure the gentleman is the same, because he asked me how I did at the Justices, and he said he knew I should use him well.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I touch your money? - You took it in your hand, and threw it down again, I stooped to pick up one of the shillings, and you immediately pulled something out of your pocket like a gold watch, and went out in a trice.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 17 wharf, Wharf-road, Paddington. I keep fowls—I lost one on the 11th of June—I saw the one the prisoner had, it was mine—I had employed the prisoner, and would have em<lb></lb>ployed him regularly, but he would not work.</p>

About a quarter before two o'clock, on the morning of the 11th of June, I was on duty in the Harrow-road, and I saw the prisoner with two other boatmen—the pri<lb></lb>soner had something bulky under his smock-frock—I followed him, and asked what he had got—he said, "Nothing"—I said he had—he then said, what he had got was his own—I pulled up his frock, and found this fowl with its neck twisted, but it was not quite dead—the prisoner and his companions were then about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's, bat I had seen them before, about thirty yards from his place—I took the prisoner, and found the owner of the fowl—I found his gate had been opened.</p>

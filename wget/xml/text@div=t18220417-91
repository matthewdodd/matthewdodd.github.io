             and M'Carthy were prisoners there. We were all in the same yard; I saw Dempsey throwing some sopped bread at the prisoner out of the yard, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, just after breakfast; the bread hit him on the shoulder; the prisoner took no notice of it, but went down stairs; Dempsey followed him, threw more pieces of bread at him, which hit him on the back. As he was going down stairs the prisoner said, if he did not be easy he would hit him on the top knot; then the prisoner went up stairs again and the deceased threw more bread at him; then the prisoner kicked at him, but missed him; they then both got together and struggled, and both fell; he did not strike him, but threw him in the struggle; the prisoner was uppermost, they got up again - had another scuffle - I saw no blows, the deceased fell again, and the prisoner at the top. Dempsey seemed hurt and said, he would not fight any more, and leant his head on the table. He died in the afternoon. He laid hold of the prisoner's foot and began the wrestling.</p>

I was a prisoner in the same ward, and saw the deceased following the prisoner, throwing a piece of sopped bread at him, the prisoner said he would give him a kick on the top knot, the deceased still provoked him, they wrestled and fell, the prisoner was taken from him, and wrestled again, and had another fall, the deceased was undermost - a little while after he laid on the table and seemed very bad.</p>

            , ESQ. I am surgeon of Newgate; I saw Dempsey between twelve and one o'clock, he was then dying very fast, and died in three minutes; I opened his body, the internal appearances were perfectly healthy, and completely free from the appearance of violence, there was no appearance of scratch or bruise; I examined his head particularly, there was a rupture of one of the principle arteries, and six ounces of blood were taken out, that caused his death - it is impossible to say it was in consequence of the fall.</p>

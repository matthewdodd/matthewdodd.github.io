                  </hi>. I live at 5, Cannon Street Road, St. George's—on the night of 1st January, I was in a public-house in St. George Street—I saw the two prisoners there in company with others—I went out between 11 and 12 o'clock—I was sober—I had had a little, but nothing to affect me in the least—I saw them outside the door—I walked away towards home—after I had walked a little way, the men came up and tackled me—I could tell that they, these two men, were the ones that I saw in the public-house before—there were four of them when I came out, and four came up and attacked me—they took my purse out of my pocket—one put his hand to my eyes, and one held me by the shoulder, and the others were feeling my pockets—I called "Police!" and they ran away—one left a hat behind, and I took it to the station—I did not see the men who attacked me—these prisoners were two of the four that I saw, but I can't say whether they attacked me.</p>

I was with the last witness at the public-house, and came out with him—I saw some persons outside—I think Norman was there, with a young woman—they ran away after they took hold of the man—I saw them catch hold of him, I can't say who it was—it was a dark place—I did not see anyone there but the four men—they were together—I can't say whether either of the prisoners attacked the man.</p>

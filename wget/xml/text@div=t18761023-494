                  </hi>. I am a student of medicine, and live at 86, Richmond Road, Barnsbury—on 3rd September, about 12.30, I was passing a public-house on Pentonville Hill, which was closed—a lot of men and women were dancing and making a noise on the path—I tried to pass through them, one of them got in front of me and asked me for some tobacco, that was Wallis—I put him on one side, and then Larman got in front of me and asked me for tobacco—I tried to push him on one side and Wallis pushed me behind, and I felt a snatch at my chain which was hanging a little bit out—I looked down and missed it—I hit at 'Larman with my stick, but he got away and Wallis got in front of me so that I could not follow him—I afterwards <hi rend="italic">followed</hi> him, he turned back and came straight towards me and as he turned off the path to avoid me I saw the chain in his left hand—I have not the slightest doubt of his identity; I picked him out from half a dozen at the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Larman</hi>. I told the Magistrate the first time, that I saw the chain in your left hand—when I saw you at the station you had new clothes on, and I said "That is like the man", I then examined you more carefully and said that you were the man.</p>

On 13th September, I was on duty in Pentonville Road, with another officer—we were in plain clothes—"we stood outside the Penton Arms, and saw the two prisoners with some other men and some prostitutes, they all commenced dancing outside the house, and in about ten minutes the prosecutor came by and Wallis, whose real name is Morris, got in front of him and pushed him, and then Larman pushed him and he sang out "My watch is gone"—I saw him hit Larman over the head—Larman <hi rend="italic">ducked</hi> and got away, and the prosecutor chased him—I saw Larman's hand go up just as the prosecutor pushed Wallis out of the way—I took Larman last Tuesday morning, and he was identified.</p>

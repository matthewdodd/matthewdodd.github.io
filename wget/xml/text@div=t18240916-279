On the 7th of July I went to see the review on Hounslow-heath, and staid there till late in the evening. I was in a booth at the time this happened. I had taken a little drink, but swear that I was quite sober. I went into the booth between nine and ten o'clock with a young man who works with me; he is not here - and in a quarter of an hour, as I was coming out of the booth, (it was light,) I put my hand into my pocket, and took out half a crown to pay for some beer; and when I had paid the reckoning, some person struck me behind on the head - it was a severe blow; I could not see who it was - I was then dragged by two persons out of the booth - one of them laid hold of my arm. I had about 12 s. or more in my pocket. About twelve people then came and formed a circle round me, and I was shoved from one to the other for two or three minutes, and then the prisoner came up on my left side, and put his hand into my waistcoat pocket, and then into my trowsers pocket. I had two half-crowns in my waistcoat pocket; I put my hand to it after he had taken his out, and found the money was gone. I could not make the least resistance; there were so many people about me - I was afraid to resist. After he took his hand out of my trowsers pocket, I received a severe blow in the face, which knocked one of my teeth out. I was knocked down on the ground, and received several kicks. I got up, and then my coat was taken off my back. I then made towards the booth to save my life; they got between me and the booth, and prevented my getting in, and hawled me three or four yards from the booth. I was again knocked down on the ground - and one of them came and jumped on my legs, sprained it (I was under the doctor's hand with it) my waistcoat and shirt were then taken off my back, and the handkerchief off my neck, and the shoes off my feet - an umbrella was taken from me at the time; they took my coat - I was left naked all but my trowsers and stockings - my money was all taken.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner you say is one of the party who illused you, and took your money? look at him, and say if you can safely swear that he was one of them - A. I can, my Lord; he kept staring me in the face before this ill usage began. I had observed him staring at me, and can safely swear that he is the man - he was a stranger before. Nobody came to my assistance; and after my clothes were gone, I was naked. I was hopping about towards the barracks, calling</p>
               <p>"Murder;" they all left me when they had stripped me. I called</p>
               <p>"Murder" while they attacked me also; I made it known next morning, but did not go before a Magistrate till evening, in consequence of my leg being so bad. I went before Mr. Trimmer at Histon, and was obliged to apply to the overseers of the parish, being so ill, and went into the workhouse to be cured; I was fetched from the workhouse about a week afterwards, and saw the prisoner in custody, and was certain of his person, and stated so to the Magistrate. I am quite sure of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is not your name O'Sheehan - A. No. I had drank part of three pints of beer, and had some bread and cheese between me and another man that day, and I had part of a pot of beer with another man at six o'clock that evening, and about seven I had about three pints in a booth, and had nothing more all day. I went to the review at twelve o'clock, but did not go to drink till half-past four, when it was over. I drank nothing else. None of my companions were drunk while I was with them. I was a little fresh, but nothing to affect me. This happened about half-past nine o'clock, it was light. I did not see the prisoner till I came out of the booth; he was not one of the three who first came up. They did not shove me about till he came up; they surrounded me, and then he came up to me. I did not observe him before. I was frightened - for I had cause so to be. There were at least twelve people around me: I never saw either of them before.</p>
               <p>JURY Q. Was it a rainy day - A. It was a rainy morning before the review commenced; it cleared up between three and four o'clock, and did not rain again.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and was at the review, acting as servant to Mr. Cook, who keeps a booth. This happened thirty or forty yards from our booth. I heard a cry of murder between nine and ten o'clock and came out of the booth, and saw a party of people a little way from our booth; I went up, and saw them taking hold of Sheehan, and were dragging him on the ground. They<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160112"></xptr>forced an umbrella out of his hand. He got up, and I saw him knocked down. There were twelve or thirteen people surrounding him, and all going on ill using him. They then got his coat off his back - he attempted to keep it under his arm. He made his escape into a gingerbread stall with the coat under his arm; they rushed after him, and took away his coat. I saw him bleeding at the mouth, he walked very lame, and appeared to be hurt in the leg. They all came again, and took him from the stall round to the back part of a publican's booth; I could not see what they did there, but in five minutes I saw him without shirt, waistcoat, and handkerchief; he had nothing but his trowsers and shirt, and appeared to have been much hurt. I could distinguish several of the persons. I saw the prisoner there; I am quite certain that he is one of them. I was afraid to interfere to assist him. It was light - I could very easily distinguish a person's features. The rain had cleared up about three o'clock, and it was a fine evening. I attended before the Justice about a week after, and saw him in custody, and am certain he was one of the men. I swear positively to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go up into the crowd while this was going on - A. I was not in the crowd; I was looking at it; I heard murder cried, and went to see what it was. Every time they took anything they ran from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not run to some house and give an alarm - A. If I had run, very likely I should be attacked by some of them; I did not leave till they left him. I heard them say they would go and have something to drink; I ran up, and said,</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, you cannot go in here, there is nobody there; master is not there;" the booth was pinned down. One of them was on horseback.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you give information at any place about this - A. About four o'clock in the morning. There were twelve or fourteen booths on the beath, but I was afraid to move to give information. It might last altogether about an hour and a half, but I was not there at the beginning. I was there for three-quarters of an hour, and had drank nothing that day but about a pint and a half of beer; and a gentleman, whose horse I was minding, gave me two glasses of stout.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard the cry of murder, why not go and give information, instead of going to the place - A. I went to see what was the matter, and when I got up I was afraid to leave: I said nothing to them - they went down the course, and I after him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you in the slightest degree intoxicated - A. I was not; I was frightened.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 14th, I apprehend the prisoner at Monlsey Hurst - I told him it was for ill using and robbing Sheehan; he at first said he was not there, and then that he was there; I put him into the cage at Hampton-court, and took him before Mr. Trimmer, at Heston, next day. The prosecutor saw him that evening; he (Sheehan) was at that time very lame; indeed, I found him at the workhouse - he could just put his foot to the ground, but could not walk without a stick; he was examined before the Magistrate, and the prisoner committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. He at first said he was not there, and then that he was - A. Yes; I had old him of the robbery.</p>

               <p>Q. He said he was not at the robbery - A. No; he said he was not on the heath at all, and then said that he was; three more persons were taken, but could not be identified.</p>
               <p>JURY to SHEEHAN. Q. Do you know the man who was drinking with you - A. Yes; his name is Evans; he works with me; he went away about four minutes before this began.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent; the officer asked me, as we went along, if I knew any of the people who were there; I said I knew nothing of them, but should know them if I saw them again, and that I had heard two men in the morning say, that two of them worked in a brickfield.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

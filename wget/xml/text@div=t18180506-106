            . I am porter to Messrs. Metcalfe's. I took the goods to No.15, Nightingale-lane, which I found to be a hair-dresser's shop; they knew nothing about them. I had heard Nicholls, the night before, telling Mr. Joseph Metcalfe that they had taken a shop in King Henryyard. I went there and could not find them, and was returning with the goods. As I came out of the yard I met the three prisoners together. I am sure of their persons. They said they had been to my masters', who said I was gone with the goods, and I must go back with them, for the house they had taken was at the bottom of the yard - I returned with them. When I got to No. 20, Splain helped me down with my load-there was no appearance of a shop there; there was only a shutter put across for a counter. I was ordered not to deliver the things without the money. They took them out of my basket and put them on the counter; Nicholls put her hand into her pocket when I delivered her the bill, and said, "I have not got money enough to pay for them, my husband is at the Crooked Billet, in Rosemary-lane;" and sent Splain to tell him the porter was come with the goods. Splain returned and said Mr. Jones was so busy settling masonic affairs, that he could not come, and I must go to him to receive the money; I said I did not know where the Crooked Billet was-Fitzgerald went with me to shew me where it was. I expected I was going to receive the money, and did not intend to part with the goods without the money. I left them behind. She took me there, and told me to wait at the bar-door while she called Jones down, instead of which she ran out of the back-door. I asked, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060036"></xptr>could find no person of the name of Jones there. I returned to the house, and found the prisoners and goods gone. I was not absent above ten minutes. On the 18th I saw the prisoners together at the back of the Crooked Billet, and gave them in charge. I have never seen the goods or Jones.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. There were neither goods or furniture in the house. I left the goods expecting I was to receive the money. I am not authorized to give receipts for my masters.</p>

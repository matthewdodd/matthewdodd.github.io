               <p>Q. Which way was you going?</p>
               <p>Jarvis. I was going towards Pancras; I perceived them when we were within about 20 yards of each other; Walker took a pistol from under his jacket; they came up to me together; Walker said, Sir, your money; gentlemen, said I, I have very little money, I hope you will not take what I have from me; Walker said, Sir, your life; I said, that will do you no service; then he said, your money or life directly; I said, gentlemen, if that is your resolution, I will give it you, and put my hand in my pocket, and gave him 5 s. it was 3 shillings and 4 sixpences; in my delivering it, there was a sixpence dropped on the ground; he seemed to show it to Johnson in his hand; then he put it into his pocket; I still stood in the same position, and so did they both, side by side; seeing me, he presented his pistol to me again, and said, Sir, your watch; I said, gentlemen, I hope you will not take my watch, I have had it a good many years; Sir, said Walker, your life then; I said as before, that will be of no service to you; then he said, your watch or life directly; then I took and gave it him; when so done, he pointed the pistol, and said go that way, that was to proceed the way I was going.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Johnson do?</p>
               <p>Jarvis. Johnson never said a word during the whole; he only stood by the other; I believe I went on about 30 yards towards London; then I began to consider what to do; I looked either way, and saw no body coming; then I turned back after them; then I began to think they might have laid themselves in ambush at the bridge for some body else; I went on, and saw nobody there; then I met the old gentleman that I had met before, with a little bundle under his arm; I told him I had been robbed, since I met him, by 2 men; said he, they just passed me; I said, will you assist me; he seemed not to be willing; then I went on, till I came to the Black Horse, and asked if any body had come there; they said no; then I went to the next public-house, and there enquired, and found no body; I proceeded down the town as fast as I could; I met a man, and said, have you met two men, I had been robbed by two men; then a young man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176612170019"></xptr> near us said, Sir, I saw two men just now, they had like to have run against a ladder which I had; then we agreed to see if we could find them, and in our hurry we had overshot the Angler; another man seeing me going in, he pushed and went in with me; the prisoner Walker had just had a dram at the bar; the other was going to have one; Walker pushed towards the door; I had a pretty large stick in my hand; I struck at him, but missed him; I took hold of him, and said, if you stir you are dead, as you said to me just now, and challenged him with being the person that had just robbed me; he said, Sir, I acknowledge it, I am the person, and I will not resist in the least; I will surrender myself, and I crave your mercy; at that very instant Johnson was ready to come out; he was rather behind the door; Mr. Hale took hold of him; I said, down with him, knock him down, this is one, and he is the other; upon that Mr Hale kicked his heels up, and threw him against a settle; he was obstreperous, but in a minute's time the other two men came in and assisted Mr. Hale; we searched them; Johnson had the pistol upon him; it was taken from him in the house with some difficulty; he had hold of it at the time; Mr Hale took it from him; it was loaded two fingers deep; they had 4 s. and 6 d. upon them, which they said was all they had; the next morning a sixpence was found sticking in the ground edge-ways, where they robbed me; the watch and money were found upon Walker (the money, three shillings and three sixpences, and a pistol, produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. When you first met them, did you see their persons, so as to be able to know them again, if nothing had happened?</p>
               <p>Jarvis. Yes, I believe I could have known Walker again, Johnson rather held his head down; I knew them again when I found them at the alehouse; I am certain they are the two men that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Johnson say after he was taken?</p>
               <p>Jarvis. He said very little, and cried; when we were in the coach, going to prison, Johnson desired he might be run through; he said we must both die, meaning Walker and himself.</p>
               <p>Q. fro m Johnson. Whether I was not a-head of Walker, when you met Walker?</p>
               <p>Jarvis. Johnson was rather first, but they stood a-breast, facing me, during the whole time.</p>

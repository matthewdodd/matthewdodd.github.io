               <p>I live with Mr. Biswell, in Spitalfields: on the 25th of August, Meadow's streets-man brought home some silk (the prisoner at the bar): after he was gone, we examined the silk, and found there were several knots too small; it appeared there was some silk taken out: I sent immediately for Mr. Meadows; he came, and the second time brought the prisoner with him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a dyer; I went with the prisoner from the dye-house to his own apartment; I know not what day, but it was the same day he carried the silk to Mr. Biswell's; he desired his wife to give him the silk, and she seemed to be very much alarmed: when I went with him, it was between ten and eleven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the silks at Mr. Biswell's first? - I saw them at our own warehouse, and saw him take them from thence to go to Mr. Biswell's, but did not see him at Mr. Biswell's: he repeated again, give me the silk, for I am a ruined man: she gave him a little parcel of silk, which he took, and put in his pocket, and took it to our shop, and from thence carried it to Mr. Biswell's: he came and laid it on the counter; I went with him: the silk he carried from the warehouse was of six colours, and seven parcels; two parcels of one colour;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150139"></xptr>those he took of his wife appeared to be of the same colours; and, as far as I can judge, I believe them to be the same silk.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It was after Mr. Meadows and he went together, that he and you went together? - It was when Mr. Meadows was gone for an officer, and I went with him to his apartments.</p>
               <p>I do not find you weighed the skeins before they went out in the morning? - I did not: I helped to skain them up.</p>
               <p>This man went to his own home? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>He was to do two things at one going out; go to Mr. Biswell's, and get his breakfast? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>The man has got a wife and four children? - He has.</p>
               <p>The man had been home, and got his breakfast, and had gone to Mr. Biswell? - He had.</p>
               <p>When he was charged with stealing he constantly denied it? - He did.</p>
               <p>When he came to his own home he desired his wife to give him the silk, for he was a ruined man; she hesitated, and seemed confused; he said, give me the silk, in a still more peremptory manner; on which the woman went to her drawer, and got the silk? - She gave it to him out of the box.</p>
               <p>Mr. Worth, you seem a good humoured looking man, let us see whether it is so: has the man always persisted he did not know any thing had been taken, and did not he say this, the man having gone home to his breakfast, and having laid down the parcel, and having played with the child, if any was taken out, the wife took it out behind his back; did not the man constantly state this to be the case: did not he say, as to stealing any of the silk I know nothing of it; I went home to my breakfast, I laid down my parcel, and played with my child, and if the good woman has taken some few skains, it is my misfortune? - He said nothing like it; he confessed he took it from Mr. Biswell's warehouse.</p>
               <p>How old are these children? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>What was the value of these miserable pieces of silk taken out? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am innocent. I never had a blot in my character. I have been twenty-six years in the dying business, and never had a blot before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him an excellent character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Church-street, Bethnal-green. On the 9th of March Sargeant applied to me for a room in Chequer's-place, Bunhill row—Drew, my collector, let him a room—he took possession of it without my leave—I went there on Fri<lb></lb>day the 13th of March—I found a hole in the ceiling with paper plastered over it, and about 140 lbs. weight of lead was gone from the gutter of the roof—it was the joint property of me and my brother, my nephew, and niece—I sent for a policeman, and took Sargeant to the station-house, but before that I asked him who gave him leave to take possession of the room—he said the deputy-landlord—I said we had no deputy landlord, and asked him how the hole came—he said it had fallen in, but it was evidently cut in the rafters, pushed up, and the tiles laid carefully on the roof—I know it was perfectly sound on the Monday when he spoke to me about the room—it was a square hole out in between the joists—the laths were broken off and pulled downwards towards the room, but the rafter laths were broken and pushed upwards—it was certainly made from the, inside—four sash weights were gone which were safe before, and two were gone from the lower room also.</p>

                  </hi>. The prosecutor it the owner of the house in Chequer's-place—I am his agent. On Monday, the 9th, Sergeant applied to me for a room, which he said he would take if I put shelves in—I said I could not answer till I saw the landlord—I saw the landlord afterwards, and when I returned Sargeant was at a neighbour's house, using a shoe-maker's file—I told him I could not get the repairs done that week, and on the Monday he might take possession, but I would see him before</p>

               <p>that—I have since seen an instrument like the one I saw Sergeant using—it was taken from the tiles and given to me by Peacock—I know the premises perfectly well, and know the sashes there—I went to the place on Friday, the 13th—I found the window sashes disturbed, and three or four squares of glass broken; next morning I found the sash weights gone, which were safe on the Monday before—I cannot say when I had seen the lead, but the roof was good—the rain never came through it—it was in good order up to the 9th of March—I have since found a square hole cut big enough for a person to get through—it could not be made by falling in by, the laths were broken—I saw the ceiling on the 9th of March in a good state of repair.</p>

I live in Gloster-court, Chequer's-alley, near Chequer's-place—I can see from the roof of in house to No. 7, Chequer's-place, as my house is very high, and I keep pigeons on the roof. On Thursday, the 12th of March, about six o'clock, I went up to feed my pigeons, and observed that the top of No. 7, Chequer's-place, was safe, there were no tiles disturbed—next morning about half-past eight o'clock I went up again, and observed a large hole made in the roof, about the middle, big enough for a person to get out—the tiles were placed up on each side of the hole, and the tiles of the gutter Were piled up and put further on—I noticed this, because the same week my sister went to look at this house, and since that she has taken the rooms, I gave information.</p>

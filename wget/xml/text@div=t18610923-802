I am rather hard of hearing—I am the mother of Henry Hamilton, and live at 13, Palace-road, Westminster-road—the prisoner Hamilton was residing with me up to Wednesday, 21st August—I think it was about 10 o'clock when he left that morning—my daughter was sent for to go into the country on the 20th, and she went on the 21st, and he took her to the station—the train went at a quarter-past 10—Helyer, the last witness, also went with them—he called between 7 and 8 o'clock-Hamilton did not leave my house between 7 and 10 o'clock, because he was with me the greatest part of the time, assisting me in what I had to do—I have no other reason why I know it was Wednesday, the 21st, only I know that was the day—I remember there being a fete at the Crystal Palace on the 20th—my daughter was sent for by an aunt to go into the country—my son was at home on that evening—I saw him from about 9 o'clock till 11, when he went to bed—no one else was present besides myself and daughter when Helyer called in the evening—I do not recollect any one calling on the Tuesday between 9 and 11 o'clock—my daughter is in the country now.</p>

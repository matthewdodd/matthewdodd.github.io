                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Eden, of Richmond. On the evening of 17th July I was the last person up—I saw all the fastening secure about twelve o'clock—next morning I came down about seven—I was the first person up, and found the house in very great confusion—the kitchen window was open, and a pane of glass broken, sufficiently large for a person to put their hand through and undo the window—I missed a pair of my son's boots, two shirts, a pair of stockings, a blue and white cotton handker<lb></lb>chief, and a tin box, containing about 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—they are my husband's and son's property—I had seen them safe the previous night—the shirts had been washed, and were wet—I know the stockings by my own darning, and the shirts are marked by me, "J. E.," my husband's initials—I know the handkerchief by the pattern, and its being a little torn.</p>

About four o'clock, on the afternoon of 18th July, I was on duty at Old Brentford, which is about three miles from Richmond and saw Brown—I had received information, and asked her what she had got in her bundle—she said, "Two shirts"—I asked whether they were her own—she said, no, they were her brother's—I asked where her brother was—she said, at the public-house (pointing to the One Tun); that she was going to sell the shirts for her brother—I went to the One Tun, and found no one there—I asked what the shirts were marked with—she said, "Red"—I asked what the initials were—she said she could not tell me—I afterwards showed them to Mrs. Eden—she identified them—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

In consequence of information, I went to a pawnbroker's, at Brentford, and found some boots—I heard Brown say at the station-house that the shirts and boots were her brother's, and that she had pawned them—she said her brother was outside—I went outside, found Smith there, and brought him in—I asked Brown if that was the person she wanted—she said, "Yes"—I asked him where he got the boots—he said they were his own, he had them made at Northampton—I asked him if he sent her to pledge them—he said he did, he gave 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I asked him what stockings he had on—he pulled up his trowsers, and I found these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which Mrs. Eden identifies—I asked him where he got them—he made no answer—I had seen him about 100 yards from the house about twelve o'clock on the night of the 17th—I do not know whether he was alone or not—he is a stranger to me.</p>

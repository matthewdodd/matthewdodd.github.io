                  </hi>. I live near Temple-bar. On the night of the 5th of March I was out with Reuben Albiston—I was at the Three Elms, St. Ann-street, Westminster, about half-past nine o'clock, the prisoner Wright came in directly after me, drank with us for half an hour, and then asked me to pay for some liquor—I said I had no money with me—we staid there till past twelve—she was in and out, and after twelve we three and Emma Smith went out together—we were invited to go to Emma smith's room, in St. Ann-street—Wright and Smith asked Albiston to go—we all four went up</p>

               <p>into Smith's room, and stopped a short time—I went down to go to Wright's room with her—that is in a house down the same court—I went out down stairs into the entry, staid there a minute or so, and Wright passed two or three words at the bottom of the stairs, in the entry—there was no light there—two or three or more females came down from the top of the entry and jostled me about—I felt them at my waistcoat-pocket and my watch pocket—I slipped my hand to my waistcoat-pocket, where, I am sure, I had a sovereign and shilling, and they were gone—I felt my watch-pocket and missed my watch—I had left that up-stairs with Albiston, but forgotten it at that time—I accused Wright of taking my watch and money—she ran away down the court—I followed her up into her own room—I accused her again of taking my watch and money—she denied it—I went out to fetch a policeman, and met some one in the entry of the court—I do not know whether it was a man or woman, but they came out of the door-way that leads up to Smith's room, and jumped on my back—I threw myself against the wall—I went to the top of St. Ann-street, and told a policeman I had lost my watch and money, and I expected they were then robbing my companion—he told me to go on, and he would follow me—I made the best of my way back into Emma Smith's room, and found Albiston, Emma Smith, and Wright there—I told Albiston I had lost my watch, a sovereign, and a shilling—he said I had not lost my watch, and gave it to me—before I could well get it into my pocket, two men came up stairs—I did not notice them sufficiently to know them—one of them struck me a blow in the eye with his fist, and on my mouth, which was cut in two places, he then turned round to Albiston, who hit him with his fist, or pushed him—I saw him fall—the two men escaped out of the room—I ran and shut the door, and heard them going down stairs—I went to look for my hat, which they had knocked off when they struck me, and before I could find it I heard them coming up stairs again, beating their bludgeons and weapons on the stairs as they came up—I ran to the door, put my foot to the bottom and my hand to the top—they tried to force their way in, but could not—they knocked a pannel, or part of one, in with their weapons—I then loosened the door and it came wide open—I saw the prisoner Little with a poker in his hand—he came just inside the door, and struck me on the forehead with the poker—I noticed him sufficient to be sure of him—he stood to the left, and the other man to the right—I rushed in among them on the landing, where there were three besides Little—I believe Rose to be the one who stood to my right, but cannot swear to either of the three—I made my way down to the first landing—(this was on the second floor)—I met the policeman, and before I could turn round Albiston came tumbling down stairs, bleeding, with his head cut open—I then gave Little in charge, and Albiston gave Rose in charge on the stairs—the policeman took them both to the station—we went to Westminster Hospital to have our heads dressed—I had several bruises, and was much hurt—I remained at the hospital eight or nine days—I believe Wright was taken to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a whip-thong maker, and was in company with Gilbert at the Three Elms on the night of the 5th of March. We fell in with Wright and Smith there, and left the house together at nearly half-past twelve o'clock in the morning of the 6th—we all four went to Smith's room, which, I believe, is in a court out of St. Ann-street—we got there about twenty minutes to one, and had not been there long before Gilbert and Wright left the room together, leaving me and Smith there—I believe Wright's room is in the same court—it might be five or ten minutes when Gilbert came back and said he had been robbed of a sovereign, a shilling, and his watch, but he had given me his watch previous to going away, as I had told him I was going home—the two male prisoners came up stairs directly after, and struck him a severe blow on the eye—I cannot say which struck him, but am sure they are the two who first came into the room, and one of them struck him in the eye, and, another in the mouth—I cannot say whether the same man struck both blows—neither of them said a word before that, nor was anything said to them—they came in an abrupt manner, and immediately struck him, and directly came to make an attack on me—I believe it was Little that I knocked down—they both went down stairs, and in two or three minutes I heard footsteps coming up stairs, and making a great noise—I and Gilbert went to the door, and held it, to keep them from coming in—they fumbled at the door with the instruments they had got, and forced out a piece of the pannel—I then saw there was more than two on the stairs armed with weapons, one with an iron weapon—the others had pieces of timber—I found it useless to attempt to keep the door shut, and gave way—the two prisoners forced their way into the room—Gilbert was the first they met—they struck him a severe blow on the forehead, and laid his head open—I only saw the two prisoners come into the room, and it was one of them struck him—Gilbert got down stairs—the two prisoners then</p>

               <p>attacked me, and one of them, I cannot say which, gave me a blow, I believe it was with an iron instrument, for it cut the back of my hat quite through, and cut my head open—I made my escape—the blow caused me to tumble part of the way down stairs, being bewildered a little—I found a policeman on the landing, down stairs, (two or three, I believe)—the two male prisoners were taken to the station, and we were taken to the hospital—I only went there to have my head dressed, but was under the surgeon's care nearly a fort<lb></lb>night—it was a severe blow, and produced erysipelas in my face.</p>

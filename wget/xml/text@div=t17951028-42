               <p>Q. Why do you suppose the prisoner took these things? - I had no other in my house that I could suppose had taken them besides; I procured a search warrant, and found the things on this prisoner's premises, on Monday morning as I missed them on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Have you ever been in this court before? - Never on this business.</p>
               <p>Q. On some other business? - I never was here on any business of this denomination, I never was here as a prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Q. Be kind enough to tell me how long you have known the prisoner? - I have known him from the 3d day of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in partnership with any body? - Never.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know an attorney of the name of Banden? - I did.</p>

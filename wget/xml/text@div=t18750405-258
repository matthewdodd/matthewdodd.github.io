                  </hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate.</hi> "I did not give the cheque to Mr. Fleming with a guilty knowledge; I was the dupe of others. I became acquainted with Scott &amp; Co. through their advertisements. They declined my application for a loan, but subsequently, on my going to them and telling them I had got what I wanted and that I required to open a banking account, they gave me a letter of introduction to the bank in Sloane Square. I became acquainted with Collins in the same manner. When I showed him my paying-in book it had my address in it, as it now has; he saw or might have seen it, and he took it in his hands. I gave the Chislehurst address for no other reason than vanity. With regard to the endorsement being Guildford as well as my own name, I beg to say that was done in the presence of Mr. Hertz, the manager of the Cheque Bank, and of one of the cashiers in the Cheque Bank, Pall Mall. On taking the cheque he said 'This cheque is drawn in a very singular manner; it is simply payable to Mr. Guildford, there are no initials for Christian names.' I said 'Shall I endorse it Guildford and then put my own signature? He said 'Yes, that will do.' I did so. Subsequently the Cheque Bank gave me notice of the dishonour of the cheque. I made inquiries. I was told by a friend of the drawer that payment had not been advised. I immediately wrote to the manager of the bank and told him so. I requested him to present it again on the following Friday; he declined, and gave it back. In the following week, armed with the introduction of Scott &amp; Co., I paid it into the Chelsea Bank. I pointed out to the manager the peculiarity of the endorsement. He said it was all right. I received no notice of dishonour, and presumed it was paid. I wrote all my own cheques, in perfect confidence they would be honoured, and in proof of this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187504050035"></xptr>
               <p>I gave my wife and mother about 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of cheques, which they have since withdrawn. If I had intended to rob Mr. Fleming of his jewellery, it stands to reason if I had known his cheque was dishonoured I would not have gone to Thanet Place, as it was known as my address, and also to Collins, for it is written in the paying-in book. My wife did not like to wear the jewellery, and it was arranged to go on Monday and change it. I had plenty of time to make away with the jewellery and myself if I had wished to be dishonest; I ask the Court to take this into their merciful consideration; No sane man fearing arrest and knowing he had committed a crime would have acted as I did. I gave the drawer of the cheque 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my bill at four months and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash; the bill was drawn on a 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. stamp. On one occasion Lascelles called on me he was shown in my room. He was with me more than half an hour. Previously to this I had received from Lascelles a bill for 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable on sight. He took it away, and brought it back purporting to be signed by Vallantine &amp; Co. He withdrew the former note and substituted the one in question. Mr. Collins was to receive 10 per cent, on the amount of my purchases with Mr. Fleming. I gave him a cheque for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some odd shillings, being his commission. It was of course dishonoured."</p>

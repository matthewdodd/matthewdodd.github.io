            . Last Tuesday morning, as soon as I got up, I was told by one of my men there was a tea-chest stole out of my shop by one of my men. The prisoner <rs id="t17511016-34-deflabel155" type="occupation">worked journeywork</rs>

               <p>

            . I live with the prosecutor. This chest is my master's; I saw it in his shop on the Tuesday morning. I was in the cellar at night with the prisoner, and fastening up the windows, and going from one window to another, I saw through a crack the prisoner, who was then going out of the shop, take a tea-chest out of the shop window, put it under his coat, and carry it out. I ran up, and told my master of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to lie in your master's house?</p>
               <p>Oliver. No, he did not. He came to work the next morning.</p>

            . I keep a pastry-cock's shop in Ludgate-street. To my knowledge I never saw the prisoner before he left this chest at my house on Tuesday in the evening; then I was behind the counter. He desired me to let him leave it half an hour, and I ordered my man to put it behind the door. The next morning a man came for it, but my servant told him he was not the person that left it, therefore would not deliver it to him. About half an hour after this, the prosecutor and another man came; he said it was his property, and he would swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was left by the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Harper. I am pretty sure it was.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Who was it that went to Mr. Harper's with you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was one of my journeymen.</p>
               <p>Harper. I went with the prosecutor to see the prisoner in custody, and knew him again.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to leave it at your shop?</p>
               <p>Harper. It is common for people to leave things at our shops, they being open later than other shops are.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say.</p>
               <p>To his character.</p>

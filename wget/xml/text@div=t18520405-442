On 13th March the prisoner came to our house, about half-past 7 o'clock, asked for a glass of ale, and tendered me a shilling in payments which was bad, and I put it at the back of the till, where there was no other money—the prisoner came again in about an hour and a half, called for a glass of gin—my husband served him with it, and h gave him another bad shilling—my husband took the other one out of the till, and told him he had given me another bad one before—I am sure the prisoner is the person who came the first time.</p>

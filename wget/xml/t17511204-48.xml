I had been with Mr. Pope, who lives at the Jack of Newbury in Long-lane. On the 13th of October I was drinking at the King's Arms in Fleet-market, the prisoner and Oglebury pick'd my pocket of a shirt and neckcloth, within ten minutes after I got out of the house. They had been drinking there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175112040031"></xptr>Trustraham. I was not sober nor I was not drank, I went back again, and said I'd not go to bed till I had them again. A young man directed me to where they lodged in Black boy-alley, I went first into the house, there was a woman that seemed to deny them to me; I said I did not want them for any harm. Then she took the candle and went up stairs, they were going to bed, they threatned to kick me down stairs; I said if they did not give me my things I'd charge the watch with them. I looked over the bed and saw my neckcloth and shirt, I took them and said now I have got them again; I heard them whisper as I was coming down the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you hear them whisper then, you are very deaf now?</p>
               <p>Trustraham. I have been deaf about a month, I catched cold. I was not deaf before, I was gone out of the house about half a dozen doors, then Oglebury came to me and said stop, I have something to say to you; I made a push back into a chandler's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was this?</p>
               <p>Trustraham. This was about 12 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Are chandler's shops open there till twelve o'clock?</p>
               <p>Trustraham. Yes they are, the prisoner came up and snatched off my hat and wig just as I was stepping into the shop, I catched my hat in my hand, away he made off up the alley with the wig. I went to the house they made at the door, the woman let me out at the back door and I went home, and said I had been robbed by 2 chaps, there I was told they went up Long-lane swearing and cursing about the wig.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any weapons?</p>
               <p>Trustraham. They had not.</p>

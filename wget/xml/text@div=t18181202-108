The prisoner did not return with the money as soon as I expected, and I went to know the reason; I was informed he had got the money, and was gone. I could not find him, returned home, and found his clothes were gone also. I gave information, and on the 16th of November he was brought to Town, from Wiltshire. He ought to have brought me 18 l., which he never did; I asked what he had done with it; he said he lost it. My house is not above 400 yards from Thompson's.</p>

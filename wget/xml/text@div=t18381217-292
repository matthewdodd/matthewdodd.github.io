                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 210.) I lodge at the station-house, Weymouth-terrace, Hackney-road—the prisoner was a police-constable of the same division, and lodged in the same room—on Sunday afternoon, the 2nd of December, I gave Edward Eastwood change for a crown-piece—I took it up stairs, locked it in my box, and put the keys into my pocket—I then laid down till I went on duty—the following morning about ten o'clock I went up to go to bed, went to my box, and could not find the five-shilling piece—I examined every thing I had in the box, and when I found it gone, I suspected the prisoner, and made inquiry of him, and another man, whether either of them had got the five-shilling piece—they said not—I then said, "I suppose you will have no objection that I should search you?"—the prisoner then said, "I have got a five-shilling piece, which I got in change of a sovereign at Islington"—I asked him for it—I called up the person I changed it for, and asked him to say whether he would know it—he said not—I said I should report it to our inspector—I was going out—the prisoner called me back, and said, "Make no more about it, the five-shilling piece is yours, I will return it back to you"—</p>

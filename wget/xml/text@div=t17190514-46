It appeared that the Deceased went to a Fencing-School that the Prisoner used and enquired for him, and was told by the Master that he expected him there presently, and the Deceased being a <rs id="t17190514-46-viclabel259" type="occupation">Fencing-Master</rs>

It further appear'd that the Prisoner went immediately to a Brandy Shop in the Road, where two Men were drinking, and inquired for a Surgeon, Saying that there was a Gentleman dangerously wounded in the Fields; that after he had sent a Surgeon to take care of the Deceased, he went into Oxendon-Street to a Surgeon to have his own Wounds drest, viz. one in his Breast of about half an Inch, and another in his Right Leg of about two Inches. There were were several Persons of Distinction who gave him a very good Character, and that he was neither Quarrelsom, nor given to swear, but a good natur'd obliging young Man. There were also a great many of the Deceased's Comrades, who had rid with him in Lumley's Regiment, and now in the first Troop of Horse Grenadiers, who gave him the Character of a very Quarrelsom Man, one that would Fight for Fighting Sake, and that it was, dangerous to keep him Company, and gave several Instances of it. The Jury considering the whole matter, brought him in <rs id="t17190514-46-verdict261" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. William Kingston, in Westminster bridge-road—between five and six o'clock in the evening of the 10th of September, I was behind the counter serving the prisoner—I saw her take a small piece of green ribbon—she asked for no particular colour—she had bought two yards and a half of white and pink—I saw the green, which she had not bought, under her handkerchief—she put the green back and wanted some more ribbon, and took this other ribbon out, which she let drop on the floor in my presence—she took her purse out of her pocket and let it drop as well—she picked her purse up and wanted to pay for what she had bought—she then took up this ribbon and concealed it about her person—I let her go as far as the door, within a step of being outside, I then turned her back, and she let her purse and this ribbon fall on the floor—I took her to the end of the shop—she asked Mr. Kingston to forgive her—she was examined—there was nothing found on her but some small parcels of ribbon.</p>

                  </hi>. I searched the prisoner—she said she had been in the shop two or three times before, and it was the first time she ever took any thing—she had a sovereign and some silver—she said she would pay for it.</p>

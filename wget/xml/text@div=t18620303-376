                  </hi>. I am the wife of Adam Richard Ashton, and live at 1, Amelia street, Walworth—on Wednesday, 5th February, the prisoner came there and asked for two mutton chops—she gave me a half-crown—the chops came to eightpence—I gave her the change—as soon as she left the shop I discovered that it was bad—I put it away by itself—on 21st February she came again for two mutton chops—I recognised her—she offered a bad half-crown—I told her that I knew her, and said, "This is a bad half-crown that you have given me"—she said, "A bad one! it can't be a bad one"—I said, "I believe it is, but I will go to my neighbour and ask her"—I called Mrs. Bennet, a neighbour, and then I said to the prisoner, "Now, you are the person who came a short time ago, and called for two mutton chops, and gave a bad half-crown in payment"—she said that she was not, I was mistaken—I told her I was not mistaken—I am quite sure she was the person—I sent for a policeman and gave him the two half-crowns.</p>

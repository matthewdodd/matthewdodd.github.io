                  </hi>. I have rooms, at 93, Regent Street—I am a retired officer in the army, having been a lieutenant in the Dragoons, and also in the Hussars—about 20th September last, I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> for a partner, with from 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is a copy of it: "Part<lb></lb>ner, active or dormant, with 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; can be admitted with or with<lb></lb>out lucrative and agreeable occupation, in London, into a highly respectable and profitable undertaking. Principals (who will please make appointments, if in town) only, to Partner, Mr. Steel, 2, Spring Gardens, S.W."—At that time I was residing at 56, Commercial Road, Landport, near Portsmouth—I answered it, asking for full particulars—I received a reply, but have not got it—I don't know what has become of it—I think I must have lost it—I well recollect the tenor of it; it was in these terms: "I want 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to establish a new dramatic club. I have taken eligible premises in the Strand; and I also want 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to bring out a newspaper, to be called the <hi rend="italic">City Argus</hi>"—I replied to that letter, stating that as I could take no active part in it, I would advance the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., provided proper securities were given to me—in due conrse I received this letter, marked "B"—to the best of my belief it is in the defendant's handwriting—I had conversation with him afterwards as to it—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "15, Parkstone Road, Peckham Rye, London, S.E., September 24, 1870. Sir. In reply to your favour of yesterday, I should be happy to place in your hands a Policy of Insurance for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and promissory note, and give you a mortgage or bill of sale upon the whole of the furniture and effects of the club, which I am going to buy with the</p>

If you would be inclined to accept those terms, I am prepared (as you would not be able to take an active part) to allow you 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum for the money so long as I keep it; six months' notice to be given on either side. I offer this liberal interest, because I know the value of the property, and what I can do with it; and also because I am not giving you realizable security, though, if you feel disposed to make me the advance, I will send you documentary evidence to show that I have a good business, and can repay your principal and interest quite independently of the success or failure of the club. I shall esteem it a favour to hear from you per return. Yours very faithfully, Thomas Cannon. To H. Bulkeley, Esq.")—I had a correspondence with the defendant, and on 1st October, in reply to a letter of mine, asking for an appointment, I received a telegram, stating that he would meet me on 3rd October, at the refreshment-room, Waterloo Station, at 2 o'clock—I left a letter there for him, appointing an interview at the Hotel de Provence, Leicester Square, from 3 to 6 o'clock—the defen<lb></lb>dant came to me there at 4 o'clock; that was the first occasion of my meet<lb></lb>ing him—there was some talk about the club—I asked him if it had promise of success—he maintained that it had—I can't tell you the whole of the conversation—when it came to the business-part of it, I asked him if he had the securities with him—he said he had not; but he held a form of agreement for me to sign, and if I would give him the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he would send me the securities—I declined that, and said I would look over the agreement, and in the mean time he could have his securities ready—I received a letter from him in reply to that, which I have since destroyed; I have destroyed a great number of the letters—he wrote to me urging me to fulfil it—I thought there was nothing to come from it, and I wrote and told him that as the Peruvian Stock, in which I had invested, was so low, I could not give it to him then—after that he called-once or twice at my lodging, at Norwood, with letters—I saw him—the next time I met him by appointment was at the Peckham Rye Station, on 20th October; that was in reference to some letters he had written to me, stating that he had the building, 21, Wellington Street, Strand—I asked him how he had the build<lb></lb>ing, when I saw the board still up to let—he said he did not know how that was; but he had the premises, and there was some conversation, in which he said I had better give him the money, or he would take action in Chancery, an adjudication, or something of the kind, and I should lose all my money—he said he was the man to do it, because he had been a solicitor himself for fifteen years—the result of that interview was that it was agreed I should make an appointment between that day and Monday—I think it must have been the 24th or 25th, both for him to bring his securities and me to bring my cheque—on Monday, the 24th, I wrote appointing to meet him at the building, 21, Wellington Street—when I got there I found him walking outside the building—I asked him to go up stairs—he said he had not the key with him, he had forgotten the key, or some remark of the kind—on my remarking that it was very unfortunate, that no business could be done in the street, he asked me to give him the cheque in the street and he would send me the securities—I told him I had the cheque with me, but it was not made up, upon which he wanted me to go into a public-house to draw it up—I declined doing so, saying that I never went into such places, but that if he liked to come down to Norwood next day I should be at home till 10 o'clock, and after</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187012120064"></xptr>
               <p>that I would go to the Crystal Palace Library, where I always went till 12—it was understood that he was to bring the securities with him; it was mentioned—next day I saw him at the Crystal Palace Library—I asked him at once if he had his securities with him, that I was prepared then to give him a cheque—he then produced an old policy of insurance, for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on his own life, six months out of date, and on my remarking that it was out of date he said that I could get it renewed, and that I might deduct 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for doing so, out of the cheque—of course I declined—I laughed at him when he told me that, because of course I knew it could not be correct—he then said "How do I know, unless you give me your cheque, that it will be honoured;" and he asked what bank it was drawn upon—I told him the London and County Bank—a proposition was then made that it should be sent to Mr. Lawrence, a solicitor—he proposed that—I asked him if he knew Mr. Lawrence—he said he did—I said I should be most happy to place it in his hands, and I wished I had done so before—he then left me, but on going down stairs I met him coming from one of the refresh<lb></lb>ment stalls—he came up to me and said "You won't make it two months hence?"—I said "No, we will make it for Friday, the 28th" (this was on Wednesday the 26th), and he said "You will write to Mr. Lawrence and mention about deducting 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the cheque for the insurance"—imme<lb></lb>diately I got home I wrote to Mr. Lawrence, stating the whole particulars—on the Friday, about 9 o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my lodging at Norwood—the servant brought up an envelope with his name written on it—I went down and found him in the room, with his hat on—he asked me if I was going to finish the business with him—I told him I must refer him to Mr. Lawrence—he then asked me if Mr. Lawrence had returned me my cheque—I said he had not—he said "But he will, because he told me he would send you back your cheque, and have nothing to do with you"—I told him I did not believe him—he then said I had altered all the affair to Mr. Lawrence—I said I had not, but I would have no further conversation with him personally, anything else he had to communicate must go to Mr. Larwence—he then said "Well, I have my remedy, and unless you give me a cheque for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now, I will go to the Lambeth Police Court, and have you arrested for forgery in ten minutes"—he said this in the most bullying manner—I then told him to leave the room—he did so—he said nothing more—that same evening I received this letter, marked "I"—I believe it to be in the prisoner's hand<lb></lb>writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Lambeth Police Court, Friday, 1 p.m. Sir. The detective officer from Norwood has been here with me for the warrant to arrest you, but the matter has to stand over till to-morrow morning for the production of one of your letters, which I did not happen to have with me. I do not wish to cause unnecessary annoyance to your landlady and her other lodgers by bringing a policeman to the house, so if you think proper to let me know this evening where you will surrender, any time after 11 o'clock to morrow morning, you can spare her that disgrace and unpleasant<lb></lb>ness. Yours obediently, T. Cannon.")—When I got that letter I treated it with great contempt, because I thought the man must be drunk who wrote it—next day my landlady brought me up this letter ("K"), and asked me to explain it—to my best belief it is also in the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "15, Parkstone Road, Peckham Rye, S.E., October 28th, 1870.

Yours obediently, Thomas Cannon.")—<hi rend="italic">on the fit leaf of the letter was printed:</hi> "Established 20 years, T. Cannon &amp; Co.

Sir,—'Buckley'—I hope to have this party in custody in a few hours, it may save you being subposnsed to Lambeth if you will kindly answer the inquiry in my last letter: who introduced him to you? Yours very obediently Thomas Cannon.")—Mr. Lawrence also handed me another letter, but not the name day—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was the next letter he showed me—I had signed my name "Buckly" in the first letter I wrote in answer to the, adivertisement—that is the way the name is pronounced, but not the way it spelt—I told the prisoner at our first interview how my name was spelt—in the draft of the agreement it was spelt "Buckly"—I said that was not quite the correct way of spelling it, although it was the way it was pronounced, and I told him the way it was spelt—it was not on that occasion that I altered it in his presence—I have been served with a writ by the prisoner far breach of contract-three were served, one at my banker's, one at the Magistrate's Court, and one at my landlady's—I don't know whether it was for breach of contract—it was for debt, I believe—this letter ("M") was also kmded to me by Mr. is the prisoner's writing "November 4, 1870. Sir. By the advice of Messrs. Cox &amp; Greenwood, I now formally, and for the third and last time, have to request you will furnish me with the name of the gentlemen in their establishment, who, as you told me introduced to you the Mr. Buckley through whose forgeries I have been recently victimised. Yours very Obediently, Thomas Cannon. To H.

               <p>then you first communicated with me I was at Portsmouth—after that I came to town and went to Norwood, and stayed at the Hotel de Provence two or three days—I went from there to Norwood, and then to 93, Regent Street—I gave that address to the Magistrate, and also to my bankers when I opened an account at the London and County; also Portrayne, Ireland—I did not tell the Magistrate that I came from Cheadle, Stafford<lb></lb>shire, and that it was the Buckly property—I said my family came from Cheadle—I adhere to that now—I don't know Mr. Thacker, a solicitor, of Cheadle—my family is a Staffordshire family; they do not reside there now, they used to—I never told you that I belonged to an old Hampshire family living in the Isle of Wight—I will not swear whether or not the policy was sent down to me when I wrote, saying I would give 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">looking at tome letters</hi>), I can't tell whether these are the letters you sent to me, but this is the paper they came in—I saw some of them were marked in pencil with certain names on them—I won't swear the policy was not inside, but I can't tell you—what made me know that the policy had expired was this, "On grant of undermentioned insurance premium, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—you said I could get it renewed—you did not tell me so till I saw it had expired—you did not say I could deduct it from the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you said I could deduct it from the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you told me you had been a solicitor, and you would ruin me in a court of law, adjudication, or something of that kind—I received this letter from you (<hi rend="italic">This was a letter complaining of delay, and stating that if he did not hear from the witness before 11 the next morning he should file a bill in the County Court for specific performance of the contract</hi>)—I told you that I was the original allottee of the Peruvian scrip; I think they were issued at 82—I don't recollect at our first interview referring you to Mr. Lawrence as my family solicitor—I don't recollect even mentioning Mr. Lawrence's name to you—I did not say "I think the agreement will do very well, Mr. Lawrence, of Bedford Square, is our family solicitor, I will take it to him to look at, and he will write to you to make an appointment about the money"—it is entirely false, every word of it—you first suggested the name of Mr. Lawrence to me at the Crystal Palace—as far as I recollect that was the first time his name was mentioned—(Mr. Lawrence was my solicitor on one occasion)—it struck me as rather strange; I think I said to you directly, "Do you know Mr. Lawrence"—I did not say before the Magistrate that I did not believe you intended to cheat me—I did believe it thoroughly—I believed you meant to get the money from me—I was not served with a writ before I commenced these proceedings against you; long afterwards—I got Mr. Emanuel to write me a letter—there has only been a writ served, no action was brought—you were in the Court at the time the summons was applied for, and you went out, I suppose, to go to Mr. Emanuel—the date of the summons is 12th October—the application was some days previously—the Magistrate was so engaged that day that he appointed a special day for hearing it—I told the Magistrate I had a great number of letters from you, more or less of a threatening nature—I daresay I said as many as three a day—I think very often I did get three a day—a great number were thrown into the fire without reading—this letter ("N"), dated 12th October, is my writing; it is dated from 56, Commercial Road, Landport—I was at Norwood when I wrote it—I intended to have returned to Landport—I had given up my lodgings there, but I could take them whenever I liked—I had no intention to deceive you, I gave you</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I read you some portions of Mr. Bulkeley's letter, stating some of the things he required; amongst others was the lease of the premises—you did not make any demand to have the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the letter I received from Mr. Bulkeley, marked "Q" (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "14, Surrey Villas, Woodland Road, Upper Norwood, S.E. 25th October, 1870. Dear Sir. Would you oblige me by arranging the following affairs. I would lend a Thomas Cannon 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for the purpose of forming a new Dramatic Club, on these terms, that he gives me a policy of assurance on his life for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a bill of sale for three months for amount, and a bill of sale on all furniture and other property that may be put on the above-named Club, 21, Wellington Street, Strand; also that the lease of these buildings be deposited with me. But should the whole of these securities not be deposited at your office at 12 o'clock on Friday morning, I shall decline, most positively, to have anything to do with it. For these reasons I wrote to him at the commencement of the present negocia<lb></lb>tions, 29th September, that if he could have all the papers aforesaid in this letter ready for me, I would give him a cheque for the amount, and on my coming to London for that purport, he came without bringing a single document, wanting me to give him the money on his promise of sending them; as this I did not like, I invested the money, meaning to have nothing more to do with it, but for a whole month he has done nothing but pester me with letters and visits again. I said if he would come to me with the papers, I would give him the amount, so he came, bringing with him as security an old Policy of Assurance, six months out of date, and wanted me to give him a cheque, saying I could get it renewed, the policy, and he would send me the remaining papers, but I refused to give him a cheque on</p>

               <p>the conditions. I enclose you a cheque for the amount, that you will please to deduct your expenses out of; but as I feel from Mr. Cannon's behaviour that I shall lose this money, I beg of you not to give it him until the whole papers are in your office, and after 12 o'clock on Friday I shall decline the affair; I will come up on Friday, and see you. Your obedient servant, H. Buckley.")—I remember your calling upon me; you did not say you had been referred to me by Mr. Bulkeley, as his family solicitor—I did not so understand you; you said you had been referred to me by Mr. Bulkeley, and you understood I was his family solicitor—you sent in a note by my clerk—I never knew you before—I refused to give the name of the gentle<lb></lb>man who introduced Mr. Bulkeley to me, because Mr. Bulkeley had con<lb></lb>sulted me in the meantime, and I had seen the letters you had written to him, to his landlady, and to myself, and I considered them impertinent—</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the first occasion of seeing me, did you tell me that Mr. Bulkeley was a man not likely to bring business, or anything; that he had been nego<lb></lb>tiating with a client of yours for some weeks, and then backed out of the bargain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't think there is a word of truth in it—I never said a word of the kind—I did not go to a deed-box, and take out a parcel of papers—that is founded in truth—when you spoke about Mr. Bulkeley, I referred to the papers to see who he was—I had forgotten the name—I simply took out a paper to refer to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in a long address, commented upon the evidence, and stated that, intending to establish a Literary and Dramatic Club, he had inserted the advertisement in question, with the bond-fide purpose of obtaining the funds to start it; that his negodation with the prosecutor was broken off in consequence of his discovering that he had deceived him by a false representation of his name and position, and that the present prosecution was only instituted upon his taking measures to bring the prosecutor to account for keeping him so long out of the money he had promised.</hi>

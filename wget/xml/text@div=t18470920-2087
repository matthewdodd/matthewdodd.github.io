                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 34.) On Tuesday evening, the 14th of Sept., I was in Bishopsgate-street with Thain and Huggett—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner come from Messrs. Silver's premises, and go into the Marlboro' Head—he afterwards came out with the other three—he separated from them, and I followed him to Amelia-street, Hackney-road—I did not take him into cus<lb></lb>tody then, but at Mr. Silver's warehouse, the next morning—I asked him at the station-house where he lived—he said, 7, Emma-street, Hackney-road—(it was close by there that I had lost him on the night previous)—I went there and searched the house—it is a four-roomed house—there were no lodgers beside him—I only found a female, who said she was his wife—I afterwards saw her in the presence of the prisoner, and they spoke together, and he called her his wife—I searched every room in the house, and found the articles I now produce—there two pieces of cloth were in box which was covered with a table-cloth, the other things in different parts of the house, some in the front parlour, and some in a cupboard up stairs—I believe I found something in every room—in bringing the prisoner to Newgate, his wife was present, and said that I had taken many things that were not Mr. Silver's—he said that many things in the box his wife had had before he married her.</p>

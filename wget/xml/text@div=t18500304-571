                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 4, Stevens-court, Lisson-Grove. On Sunday, 27th Jan., I was in Mr. Webb's room in my house, with Mr. Webb, Mr. Marshall, his wife, a young woman I live with named Whiting, and her mother—the prisoner came and knocked at the door, and asked for some one—he was told they were not at home—he went down and came back in five minutes with Ellen Burke, who lives with him—they broke open my room door—Burke caught hold of Whiting's hair, and dragged her about—I loosed her hands, and she flew to my hair, and dragged me about the floor—I got away into my room—the prisoner <hi rend="italic">pitched into me</hi> as hard as he was able, and stood in the room swearing he would not go out—he was persuaded to go out—in half an hour they came back—Burke sat down by the fire, and said she meant to stop there for the night, and he stood there by the door swearing—he was persuaded to go away—in five minutes he came back—I called Roe to me—the prisoner up with his arm and cut me across the head with something—I recollect nothing else till I found myself at the Dispensary—the prisoner was intoxicated—we had not quarrelled—I had seen him two hours before.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant at the Ship and HorseShoe; Mr. Dart pulled off his coat in the parlour; the prisoner came in a little after him; about two hours and a half after that, I saw the prisoner take the coat off the back of the chair, put it on his arm, and go out at the door; I had no thought that it was stolen till the coat was enquired for about ten minutes after.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew it was Dart's coat? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did not you mention when you saw him take it? - A. I did not pay any attention, I was taking my reckoning.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say that you saw a black man take the coat, and go out with it upon his arm? - A. No, a black man opened the door to assist him out, they both came into the house together, and drank together.</p>

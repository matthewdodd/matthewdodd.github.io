               <p>Tuesday afternoon, 8th October, I was on duty at Clerkenwell about twenty minutes past five; I was dressed in my uniform, as I am now, except that I had no great coat on—I was engaged in handing the female prisoners into the prison van from the cells of the Sessions House; I received them from warder Keeley—I was standing on the pavement, close to the door of the van—a woman named Alice Turner was handed out to me by Keeley—it the moment she was handed to me, the prisoner rushed up from the crowd behind me, put his two hands against the back of my head, and pushed me against the prison van; at the same time my body and legs hit the van violently—at the same moment I received a heavy blow on the right side of the head, I do not know from whom, whether it was the prisoner or not—the prisoner then got in between me and Alice Turner, and, with his left elbow bent, hit me a violent blow in the right side; he then seized hold of Alice Turner round the waist with both hands; her back was turned to him; he drew her back towards the crowd; he made use of some expressions at the time, I cannot tell what they were—I had not got hold of the woman at that time—he had got in between us—Keeley and two police constables got hold of the prisoner and Alice Turner, and gave him into custody and put the woman into the van—I should sup<lb></lb>pose there were between 200 and 300 people there at the time; they were behaving very badly, five or six in particular; they were noisy and shouting—I could not say that they interfered with me in the execution of my duty; I would not say that they were making a disturbance—Alice Turner was dragged about four or five yards from the police van—the prisoner was very violent when he was taken into custody; the sergeant had to send an extra force to take him to the station.</p>

On Tuesday, 8th October, I was on duty at the Sessions House, Clerkenwell when Alice Turner was brought from the cells to be placed in the van—I was standing at the door of the Sessions House—I saw Crowley there—as soon as Alice Turner was brought out of the Sessions House the prisoner rushed from the crowd, shoved Crowley violently against the van, and then hit him on the right side of the head with his left hand; he then got betwixt the warder and Alice Turner, struck his left elbow out, and caught the warder in the side; he then caught hold of Alice Turner round the waist and <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> her back towards the crowd; I caught hold of him by the collar and, with the assistance of another constable and warder Keeley, we broke his hold; he was then given into custody—he became very violent; we got him to the station with great difficulty—as near as I can say, I should think he drew Alice Turner between three and four yards she was on the van, and was drawn off the step of the van.</p>

As to trying to rescue my wife, it was the last of my thoughts; it was a matter of impossibility; there were fifteen or sixteen constables and warders there; no man would have the assurance to think of trying to rescue his wife from the van.</p>

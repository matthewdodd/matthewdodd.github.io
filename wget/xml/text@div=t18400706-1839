                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live in High Holborn. About nine o'clock in the evening of the 29th of June, the prisoner came and asked to look at some printed cotton for a dress—she had a shawl on, and held up her arm—I examined the goods which I had showed her, and found two were missing when she had gone out—she had got to the corner of my window—I followed, and said to her, "You have stolen a piece of print"—she said, "Don't make a noise, I will return with you into the shop"—I took her by the arm and took her into the shop, and keeping her from the counter where the prints were—I opened her shawl, and these two pieces dropped from her—she gave herself a twist, I saw them, they are mine.</p>

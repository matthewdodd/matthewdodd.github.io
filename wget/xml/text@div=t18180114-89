On the 13th of January, about three o'clock, I found a bag of nails hid under some bricks. I told Conner to watch who came for them; about five o'clock he called to me, and had the prisoner in custody, with the nails in his breeches. He said he only took a few to repair a hog-sty. There was 7lb.</p>

            . I am an iron-merchant in partnership with Mr. Hill; we live in Tooley-street. On the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110010"></xptr>23d of December, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner brought three pieces of wrought iron for sale - they were cramps and bolts; he put them down by the scale - I looked at them, and suspecting they belonged to some public building, I said I hoped he had come by it honestly - he said, Yes, and that he had some more; I asked where it came from - he said, from the Custom-house, and that it belonged to Mr. Taylor, of Holborn, the smith employed there; I said, "You may fetch the rest, and then we will talk about it" - he went, and brought three more pieces of the same sort - I then said, "My man, we can't buy this iron without a note from some gentleman of authority at the Custom-house;" he faltered, and said, "If you don't like to buy it, I will take it away;" I said, "No, I shall send somebody to the Custom-house to ascertain if you came by it honestly" - he agreed to that, and Lyon went with him, leaving the iron behind. Lyon returned in five minutes without him, and I gave information at the Custom-house. The iron weighed 2 cwt., and was worth about 11s. as old iron; but it was useful, and worth much more.</p>

On the 10th of March I saw her in the bar, she went to the rum cask and began to draw rum; I went up to her and asked her what she meant by it; she put the bottle down.</p>

            Rum, I suppose there might be a pint and a half; when I went in the bar she passed by me and went up stairs and fetched her things down stairs and went into the parlour. I ordered my wife to stop her; I went to Worship street to get an officer. I locked the front door but she made her way out at the back door. On the next day she was apprehended at Mrs. Carver's house just by my back door.</p>

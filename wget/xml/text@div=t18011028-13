               <p>MANUEL JOSE, being a foreigner, an interpreter was sworn: On the 10th of October, the night of the illuminations, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I met with the prisoner, and she took me to a house with her; we went into a bed-room together; when I went into the room, I had in my jacket-pocket seven guineas and two shillings; I sent for some beer, and put my hand into my jacket-pocket to pay for it, and then I saw the money; there was no other person there; we both undrest, and went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she entirely undrest? - A. Yes, I put my jacket under my head with the money in it.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober? - A. I was quite sober, I slept for an hour; I then awoke, and the woman was gone; I found the jacket on the floor, and the money gone; I then applied to the master of the house, and told him my money was gone.</p>

             sworn. - I am waiter at the Salisbury Coffee-house, Chancery-lane, nearly opposite Serjeant's-Inn; the prisoner brought a foreign sailor to our house, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, on the 10th of October, the first night of the illuminations; the woman asked for a room; the sailor could not speak English; they were shewn into a bed-room; the prisoner asked him to pay for the room, which he did; I fetched a pot of porter for them, and left them; the woman came out first, about twelve o'clock; she told me the man was going to sleep by himself, and that he was very agreeable to her going; she went away, and in about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes afterwards, I saw the man; he came down crying and wringing his hands; I could understand that he said guineas, and he counted seven of his fingers; I went to the Cheshire-Cheese, in Fleurde-Luce-court, and in about ten minutes found her; I charged the watch with her, and took her to the watch-house; I gave charge of her to the constable; I was in the room when he searched her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is it that keeps this house? - 
               <persName id="t18011028-13-person150">A. Elizabeth Holman</persName>
            ; it is her dwelling-house; she pays the rent of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sailor drunk or sober? - A. He appeared to be quite sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not call you up several times, and tell you I would not stay with him? - A. She called me up once, and told me to get another shilling for the room, for they were going to stay all night; I received two shillings of him altogether, and six-pence for the porter.</p>

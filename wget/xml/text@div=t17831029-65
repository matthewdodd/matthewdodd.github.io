On the 21st of September, about six o'clock in the morning, having staid all night with some ship-mates, and coming home in Wapping, I met a girl of the town. I was a little fatigued, being drinking all night, and I went home with her, and went to sleep, and while asleep, I lost these things. It was at a private house, in <placeName id="t17831029-65-crimeloc350">Black-horse-yard, East Smithfield</placeName>

I just lay down, I was not undressed, I fell asleep, and was awoke about ten in the morning by the landlady, and says I, where is the girl that was with me? Oh, says she, she and another girl came down stairs a long time ago; that is this girl. This<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290151"></xptr> prisoner is not the girl that I went up stairs with. I told the landlady I had been robbed, and she must find the girls, or I must find her; so she went out, and found Mr. Moses, a constable, a gentleman that lives in that neighbourhood, and he brought the prisoner to me, and when she was brought the before me, I told her that she was guilty, and she said she was not; she said the girl gave her the buckle to pawn. She broke out into a terrible fit of swearing, and said how should she know where the other girl was.</p>

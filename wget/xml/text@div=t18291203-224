            . On the evening of the 28th of November, the prisoner brought me a pair of carriage-steps for sale as old iron; I am a dealer in marine-stores - they appeared new; he said he brought them from his master, Mr. Smith, of John-street - I desired my boy to go with him, and see if it was correct; he said, "If you doubt me, you may send the money by the lad," and told the boy to tell his master he was gone for some blacking - I then thought it was right, and let him go, but did not pay him - he did not return for the money.</p>

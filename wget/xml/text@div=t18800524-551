                  </hi>. I live in Hemingford Road, Islington—on 1st May I was crossing Thornhill Square, about 9 p.m., with a bag in my right hand, and a purse in my left; I heard footsteps behind me, and my left hand was grasped and twisted round, and I was thrown on the pavement with my head on the edge; I screamed, and afterwards called out "Stop that man"—two boys ran after him across the road—the prisoner is the man—I had seen him before the purse was taken from my hand, and am sure he is the man—there was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the purse—I met two gentlemen bringing him back, and he said "Do you wish to charge me?"—a gentleman said "Charge him on suspicion," and I did so.</p>

I am 14 years old—I was in Hemingford Road about 9 o'clock, on the opposite side to the lady, and heard her say "Stop that fellow"—she was getting up from the ground—I saw a man run from her, but I could not see his face—I ran after him, lost sight of him by the church, and then saw two gentlemen bringing the prisoner from the direction in which the man had gone.</p>

I live at 33, Thornhill Crescent—I was at the corner of Thornhill Square, heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner running; my friend and I stopped him—he said that he was running after the thief, but I saw no one in front of him—I held him—he said "Oh, please let me go, it is not much!"—two men wanted to know what we were holding him for, and recommended us to let him go, but we did not—he wanted to know if Miss Brooks would charge him—he was given in custody.</p>

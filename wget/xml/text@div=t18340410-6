            . I am a police-officer. I came up with Avery at the beginning of this - there was sufficient to call a mob together, and it occasioned a disturbance and a mob before a shopkeeper's house sufficient for him to complain about - as Avery was endeavouring to take him, I followed him and saw the prisoner kick Avery to trip him up, as I suppose - a scuffle ensued, which made me go forward - Avery attempted to seize him by the collar, and they went down in the street - I ran up and saw him bite Avery's finger, and saw the blood run - I received a great portion of the blood over my clothes - no violence was used towards him by Avery - he used persuasion - I myself told him if he had been my own brother I should give him the same advice as he had done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you state on your oath that neither<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100015"></xptr>you nor Avery took me up by the collar? I do not say you had the truncheon with you; but did you not take me up by the collar, and throw me down several times on the ground like a dog? I don't know myself (being intoxicated), but I am told so. A. No. no violence was used further than was necessary to secure you - I received several kicks myself, and my eye was very much swollen - he was very violent indeed, and I received several kicks, one on the cheek bone - Spring came and secured his legs.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he appear to hear without any difficulty then? A. Decidedly so - I was in conversation with him some time next day.</p>

            . I was present on the occasion.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me insult anybody? A. I saw you drunk and riotous.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I humbly crave your kind attention on this unfortunate occasion - I respectfully assure you, I had no malice or guilty intention towards the prosecutor - it is with sincere regret and shame I confess that I was very much intoxicated, and have not the slightest recollection of anything that happened - I have been round the neighbourhood several years daily selling shell-fish - I do not suppose there is anybody in the neighbourhood but what knows me well - seeing me intoxicated would excite their attention, as I am not in the habit of being so - I challenge anybody living, ever to say they saw me intoxicated - I received a very severe injury in my head when a boy, which caused me to be deaf, and I have been under Dr. Curtis, the ear-doctor - having suffered that injury, I always find a very small portion of liquor takes effect, which always keeps me on my guard from being intoxicated; and had I wished to drink, my humble occupation would not allow me to do so - I have a wife and child - the money I earned would not allow it - I never insulted an individual in the street - I challenge every individual living to say they ever knew me act wrong in my life - had I been sober, I am the last man that would have done it - I am an honest man - I have had several situations, all of which I have left with a good character - nobody could suffer more pain and anguish than I have in Newgate - I have been in the Infirmary - I have had three blisters on my chest, and through over-excitement of mind, the blisters have turned to ulcers: and my wife has been confined to her bed, and subject to fits through fretting about this - I hope, as I had no malicious intention towards the prosecutor, you will take my case into your consideration - I had no guilty intention towards the man, and have no recollection of what happened - it is evident, had I been guilty, and wished to rescue myself, that it is not likely I should lie down on my back and kick - I had met an acquaintance that afternoon, who persuaded me to accompany him to drink - we had some home-brewed ale, and a quartern of gin afterwards, and it soon overpowered me - I should think you cannot call a man malicious in doing an act, when he is so overpowered, and has not the right use of his reason - drunkenness is next to craziness - I have always been respected, though I say it myself - I keep a small shop in Wheeler-street - the last situation I lived in, was at Mr.

               <persName id="t18340410-6-person184">Naggs</persName>
            , druggist, Piccadilly - I defy anybody to say I was ever guilty of a dishonest action - I throw myself entirely on your mercy - if you restore me to my wife and child, my prayers shall be offered up for you, my Lord, and the jury - I was totally intoxicated: it is all against me - if the amputation of a hand would restore me to my wife and child, I would willingly submit to it - when a man is drunk, as to giving him advice, it is like throwing pearls before swine - it is useless to give advice to a drunken man.</p>

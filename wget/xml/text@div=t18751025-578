                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at the Marsh, Pinner—on 3rd August last, about 4.30 in the day, I was with the prisoner and two other man in a hayfield at Cannon's farm—during the work the prisoner took up two pitchforks over his shoulder, the ends of the prongs being behind him—I said to him "You have got the two lightest forks, <hi rend="italic">Starchey</hi>," and I walked up behind him and drew one back, and laughed and walked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187510250011"></xptr>
               <p>threw one of the forks at me—I was just the length of the fork from him; he had the handle in his hand—when he threw it he said "Take that, you b----"—one of the prongs caught him in the back, and one in the side—it was a large fork, with prongs about a foot wide—when I found I was stabbed I put my hand and drew the fork from my back, pulled it out, and dropped on the hay—I said "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Starchey</hi>, how could you do a thing like that?"—he said "I will kill you, you b----"—I felt very faint—I was taken home in a cart and put to bed, and was attended by Dr. Dove—I was in bed altogether about three weeks—I am not very well yet—it could not have been the handle of the fork that struck me; the handle could not have struck the ground first, and then turned over and struck me—I was just the length of the fork from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He was two lengths of the fork off when I pitched it, and it struck the ground turned over. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I would have to be three lengths off to no that; it could not have been done in that way.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with the prisoner and prosecutor at Pinner on the 3rd—I saw the prisoner with two forks on his shoulder—Woodman came up behind him and drew one away from him, and the prisoner turned round and deliberately threw it over at him, and said "Take that, you b----"—it caught him in the side and back; he fell on the stubble of hay and said something, I could not make out what—I am sure he threw the points towards him; he was very nearly close to him—the fork was very long; he must have been a little more than the length of the fork from him—the handle never touched the ground or turned over—I should not think it was an accident.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Pinner—on the night of 4th August I saw the prosecutor at his house; he was suffering from two wounds in the side and back—they were small wounds; they might have been done by a pitchfork—the wounds were near enough to each other to have been caused by the same fork if thrown with violence—at first I apprehended serious consequences, because it was a dangerous vicinity—I believe he had been in ill-health previously.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody—he came to me and gave himself up—he said "I understand you want me?"—I said "Yes, Dell, I have been looking after you for stabbing Woodman in the back with a hay fork"—he said it was an accident; he could not help it, but he done it.</p>

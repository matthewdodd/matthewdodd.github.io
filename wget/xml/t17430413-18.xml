I found my Ring and Handkerchief upon him about ten o'Clock in the Evening, the same Night that I missed them. What will you do with me now, said the Prisoner, I will give you this Spoon which I have changed at the Silver-Smith's. - He would have given me two new Spoons and my Ring to make it up with me, but I would not do it; for he had changed with the Silver-Smith, and given him seven Shillings. This Spoon is one of them which was lost, and found by the Direction of the Prisoner. He confessed the taking of them; he had the Handkerchief about his Neck, and the Justice ordered me to take it off. - I found the Spoon by his Direction at a Goldsmith's, and then he confessed the taking of them.</p>

There were five Tea-Spoons, only I left him one of the Spoons to use; the Tea-Spoons, the Tea-Tongs, and Gold Ring, were locked up in a Drawer, and when I missed them, I could not speak for a Quarter of an Hour. I called Johnson, and told him the Drawer had been broken open, and that I believed the Prisoner had done it, and Johnson took him that Night; said the Prisoner, Mary, I am informed you have lost your Tea-Spoons; said I, so I have, and I believe you have got them; said he, G - d d - n you, you B - h, what do you mean by that, Madam?

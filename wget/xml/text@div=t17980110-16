               <p>THOMAS HARTSIDE sworn. - I am a smith: I never saw the prisoner till I took him, it was on a Friday; I took him in Church-lane, Whitechapel, with the glass upon him, about a mile from Mr. Derry's house; I had heard that he had taken a glass from Mr. Derry's and I pursued him; when I took hold of him, I said, my friend, how did you come by this glass; he immediately replied, he had bought it, and paid for it; I held him till the owner of the glass came up; as soon as Mr. Derry saw the glass, he said it was his; I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know how long a time took place between the time you heard of the loss and the time you took the prisoner? - A.Half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q.Then of course, when you set out upon your pursuit, you saw nothing of the man with the looking-glass for some time? - A. No; I kept strait on; it might be about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore for any thing you know, any body else might have taken the glass, and given it to him to carry? - A. Yes; but he told me he had bought it and paid for it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was the man walking or running? - A.Walking. (Produces the glass).</p>

                  </hi>. I now live at 196, Goldhawk Road, Shep<lb></lb>herd's Bush—on 11th March I went to lodge in the same house with the prisoner at 9, Rendle Street—she had three children; two boys and a little girl—I occupied a bedroom and sitting-room on the first floor—the girl was about a year and seven months old—the prisoner always complained of being drowsy and having headaches the latter part of the time—on Monday morn<lb></lb>ing, 19th July, at 9 o'clock, she brought up my breakfast as usual, but she did not speak—she opened the door suddenly a second time, and said "Have I brought you your hot water?"—about 9.45 she opened the door again, and aid "I am going to lie down, and I have put baby to sleep"—she shut the door very quickly, and I never saw her again till I saw her at the Court—I did not hear the child cry that morning as it always did when she bathed it—Dr. Knockhold, her medical attendant, came to see her about 11.30—I thought the prisoner was out as her bedroom door was locked, and he left—the prisoner and her husband lived on very affectionate terms, as loving a couple as could he.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an M.D. and surgeon, at 9, Keith Terrace, Shepherd's Bush—about 1 o'clock on 19th July I was called by the prisoner's husband to his house—I went into the back room, and found the prisoner lying on her back on the bed; I undid her dress, and found a thick silk handkerchief tied tightly round her throat; it was brought twice round with one knot in front, as if intended to commit suicide—she was in a state of insensibility and strangulation—after removing the handkerchief she breathed more freely, and in a few moments I and the husband went into the room below, and there found the child dead in a bath, and water in the bath—it appeared to have been dead about an hour or an hour and a half—it was about nine months old; it was naked—there were marks on the left arm, as if it had been held under water—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was suffocation by drowning—the prisoner was quite insensible—I had attended her in the previous November, she then showed symptoms of mental derangement—the last time I saw her was on 15th December—she then said she could not bear to be left alone, and that she would make away with herself—I recommended that she should be well looked after, and put under some kind of restraint—I was of opinion that she was not in a right state of mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I recommended that she should have a cheerful com<lb></lb>panion constantly with her, to take charge of her—I don't know whether that was done; if it had been I did not anticipate any danger—her conduct</p>

I am a medical practitioner, of 112, Goldhawk Road, Hammersmith—five days days before 19th July I attended the prisoner for mental depression—I knew her since February, and had seen her constantly—she appeared very desponding—in my opinion she was not accountable for this act at the time.</p>

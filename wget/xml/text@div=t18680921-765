I am clerk to Mr. Cannon—he is a newspaper proprietor—on 8th June I went to Mr. Elworthy's office and bought one of these pamphlets, in Crown Court, Threadneedle Street—that is the address on the pamphlet—I bought it of a clerk in the office—I paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I paid for another, but did not get it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Wyman, and have been so for some time—they have a printing establishment at Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, under the name of Wyman &amp; Son—I know Albert Henry Elworthy—he brought me the manuscript of this pamphlet to print—I afterwards sent it back to him—we at first printed 250 copies, and afterwards printed a second edition of 250 from a corrected copy which he brought—he took part with him, and the remainder we sent to him at 2, Crown Court—from the time of receiving the manuscript until the issue of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186809210004"></xptr>
               <p>the second edition about three weeks elapsed—I did not look over this thing—I told Messrs. Wyman that Mr. Elworthy had brought a job to be done—Mr. Edward Wyman was present when he gave me the manuscript, so I had no occasion to tell him—he saw that I took the manuscript—I did not tell him the nature of the contents—I did not look to see—I saw the title, "Persecutions of a Solicitor," when I gave it out to the workmen to be composed—I did not even read the preface—neither of the defendants took the pamphlet into his hands—I said nothing to them about the second edition—there is no person specially appointed to see that the things going through the press are fit to be issued, we look to the reader to do that—he corrects the grammatical errors for the press, after the type is set up—we should expect him to draw attention to anything specially obscene or Libellous—the manuscript was returned to Mr. Elworthy—that was not for the purpose of his correcting the copy, we corrected the proofs before we sent it out—it was done by the reader—he is not now in the establishment—he has several times called attention to matters that were specially libellous and obscene—I made an entry in the books of the receipt of the manuscript—we have not received the money yet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Does Mr. Edward Wyman attend to the counting—house department? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they are very large printers—they print the "Builder," "Public Opinion," the "London Review," and a number of papers and books—it would be quite impossible for gentlemen conducting a printing establishment to read everything themselves—a good deal of printer's work is done at night, and under pressure—the price of printing this pamphlet would be about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the profit would be almost a question of shillings—we employ 150 hands and sometimes more—we had done some law printing for Mr. Elworthy about eighteen months previously—he was not a stranger—I knew he was a solicitor—these pamphlets were to be printed in a hurry—the manuscript was given into my hands on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Elworthy said it was in a great hurry, and I sent him a proof on the Saturday—there was about a fortnight between the two editions—I don't think either of the defendants ever saw the pamphlet while it was being printed, or were aware of its contents.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do they do in the business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Edward Wyman looks after the counting-house—he makes out the accounts—he would go over the books and see the entries—he attends to financial matters exclusively—Mr. Charles attends to the working department of the printing office—he receives the work and gives it out to the men—he is the head person—Mr. Elworthy did not tell me why he was in a hurry for these—I did not know that he had been convicted—I knew nothing about the trials that had taken place—I did not ask him whether they were his persecutions—he was not asked by Mr. Edward in my presence—at this time Mr. Charles Wyman was very much engaged in bringing out a new directory—Mr. Edward would not, in the ordinary course of things see the entry of the manuscript—I should give him the figures from which he would make out the account.</p>

I have been connected with the press as a reporter for more than twenty years, and am a newspaper proprietor as well—I had to prosecute Elworthy for perjury—he was convicted, and escaped by a technicality—I am the person mentioned in the pamphlet—it has affected me very materially—I was always able to earn 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year as a law reporter, and reporter in the Houses of Parliament, and I have lost every</p>

               <p>shilling's worth of that business since—the pamphlet has been circulated very selectedly, and just in places where it would do me most harm—I have seen it at all sorts of places—Mr. Stanley, the defendants' attorney, appeared for them before the Magistrate, and he cross-examined me as to the truth of the contents of the pamphlet in a most insulting manner for three hours, till at last the Magistrate stopped him, and said he should not allow such questions to be put.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at 5, Norway Place, Commercial Road, Limehouse—on Tuesday evening, 21st July, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I was called to the deceased's house, and saw him and the prisoner—he was suffering much from a swelling at the lower part of the abdomen, about the size of a small fist—it appeared to have been done within a few hours' and was undoubtedly the result of violence—it certainly was inflicted within two or three days—the prisoner said that it was caused by a kick—I prescribed the usual remedies, and left; and next morning I was sent for, and when I arrived he was dead—the prisoner was there, and said, "He had been in the public-house, and when he came home we had some words about some change, but I undressed, and got into bed, while he sat in a chair by the bed-side, and called me foul names. I told him if he called me them again I would knock him out of the chair; he said them again, and I jumped out of bed and kicked him; I thought it was on the knee, but found it could not be so"—She said that this occurred on Tuesday night, 20th July, and that she did not expect to find that he would die—when I saw him on the second occasion he was partly dressed—some female who was in the room said that he intended to go to the hospital, and being impatient at the delay, he jumped out of bed—the prisoner said that being in so much pain he intended to go to the hospital, and the cab not coming at the time ordered, he got impatient, and partly dressed himself—a person suffering from an internal injury would aggravate it by the exertion of dressing—on the Thursday morning, by the Coroner's direction. I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found that the left kidney was very much congested and inflamed, and part of the bowel was dark and congested—the abdomen con<lb></lb>tained from a pint to a pint and a half of fluid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The cavity of the abdomen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was the result of inflammation—there was also a recent rupture on the left side—there was a swelling there and much discoloration when I examined him before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PATER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was the scrotum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was very much swollen and inflamed on the left side—death was caused by peritonitis, or inflam<lb></lb>mation of the lining membrane of the bowels, accelerated no doubt by his movements in dressing—the appearances that were presented at the time I examined him might be caused either by a kick or a blow—he appeared quite strong—I was present at the Coroner's Inquest when the prisoner made a statement; she was not under suspicion then—she said that she did not intend to injure him—I did not hear her say that she gave him some water after kicking him—she said that she never thought a kick would hurt him, as he had a bran poultice on, and that she went for some cholera medicine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You thought that death would not result? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought it was a serious injury, but did not expect death so soon, or that it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186808170117"></xptr>
               <p>would be necessarily fatal—it would be a very extraordinary injury to be inflicted by a woman's naked foot—a blow would produce the injury, but I do not think a fall would, but it is possible if against a sharp corner, or a fall in the public house; against steps might do it, or against anything sharp anything projecting—that would be much more likely to cause it than the naked foot of a woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> She says that the man was complaining of very great pain, was not the injury such as to be plain on the first examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the character of the injury—the sole injury had been inflicted when I saw him the first time—if a man was falling and was drunk, the injury would not necessarily be more severe—the injury was very severe altogether—the fluid found in the cavity of the stomach was the waste of the tissues, which was very rapid—it is highly improbable that a woman's naked foot could have produced it, but it is quite possible that the foot with a boot on might.</p>

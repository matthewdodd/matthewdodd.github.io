                  </hi>. I am a clerk in Newgate Market, and lodge at the China coffee house. The prisoner lodged in the same room with me—he left on Sunday, 15th May—I had not known him before—I paid fur his bed, thinking he was badly off—when I came home on Monday my trowsers were gone, my box was broken open, and a concertina was taken away, which I have not seen since—the prisoner never returned—I saw him on the Friday at a coffee shop in Sun-street with my trowsers on, and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in St, George's-street. On 14th Oct., between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening I was passing through Wellclose-square, and saw the prisoner and three others with him—I watched them and saw the prisoner go into No. 20, Wellclose-square, a private house, the door of which was open—I saw him take a coat from the passage, and come running out with it—I laid hold of him by the collar, and asked him what business he had with the coat—he said, "Let me go, I was only having a game"—I took him into the house, and the prosecutor came and owned the coat.</p>

This is my coat, I know it by the cut of it—I have had it about twelve months—I was employed at No. 20, Wellclose-square, and left it in the passage on a chair—I was called upstairs and found it on a chair, but I cannot say whether it was on the same chair which I had left it on as there were a great many chairs there—the prisoner begged me to let him go.</p>

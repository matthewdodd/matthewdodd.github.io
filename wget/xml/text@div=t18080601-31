               <p>Q. When you first went into this public house were you sober - A. I had been drinking; I was not intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have any thing to drink in that public house - A. Soon after I went in, I drank there, and I drank till the time I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you was in the public house, do you recollect any person coming in - A. There were three Malays Glosse was one, I recollect seeing him stand by the fire and two others; one of the others gave me money.</p>

               <p>Court. That was the deceased - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and Glosse - A. Glosse asked me once or twice to go out; I was drinking; I did not like to go out; I did not go out. I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010027"></xptr>recollect any thing more. Before I left the house I was very much in liquor indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the fact of leaving the house - A. I cannot recollect how I got out of the house; but when I was out of the house I saw a fight.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose you were likely to recollect more correct directly after, than you can at this distance of time. Do not you remember saying that as you were coming out of the door the deceased was fighting with some of them men - A. I remember there was a fight at the outside of the door between the deceased and the Malays, as far as I can recollect the fighting was with sticks; the deceased was a Lascar and the prisoners are Malays.</p>
               <p>Q. One of the Malays who had been in the house that evening gave you a seven shilling piece - A. Yes, that was none of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. That was to go with him - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you mean by ill using him - A. Giving him violent blows with sticks; the deceased fell a second time; they all went away then. I went to the Blue Gate door, and saw the deceased lay on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any persons standing near the deceased at that time - A. There were two or three round about him, I believe they were Lascars, they were persons like the deceased; I saw them take him away; I did not follow them no further than my own door. When I came up to the Blue Gate door I saw a violent blow on his forehead, it was bleeding very much; he laid on the steps, I did not hear him say a word.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. You say it was a very dark night - you was not there at the beginning - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not tell how the blows first came, because you were attracted by the noise - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Could you discern whether any of the Lascars were in liquor at all - A. No; I could not discover.</p>

             there, and three or four of the coloured men; I staid there till just before ten o'clock; I went out first.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went out was there any quarrel between the men of colour and this woman - A. Not a word nor a blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any sticks - A. They had none; the woman was very drunk indeed; I cannot say whether the men of colour were drunk or not; I paid no attention to them. About two minutes after I came out of the house I heard a noise; as I went down Shadwell High street I saw seven or eight men coming up from Shadwell High street towards the Blue Gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Sarah Williams, and the men that you had seen in the public house, after you had got in the street - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When these men came up Shadwell High street, what did you see - A. I went into a shop and staid about two minutes, then I came out and heard a great noise.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was this shop that you had gone into to the Blue Gate - A. About fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the noise that you then heard, as you was coming out of the shop, proceed from - A. From opposite of the Blue Gate; it was a noise as if a parcel of sticks were ratling; then I saw four or five men of colour come down the street again from the Blue Gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they sticks in their hands - A. I did not take notice; then I heard a man groan; I went up to him, the man was laying with his back towards the Blue Gate door; I saw his face all over blood; then I saw three or four men of his own colour take him down towards Shadwell High-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these four or five men that you describe going down Shadwell High street, men of his own colour - A. Yes, but different men.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know these men no more than the rest - A. No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gould. I sent to my father, he went for a surgeon; he died the next morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I suppose, Mr. Gould, you saw this man after this happened - A. Yes, I saw him when he was brought in at the door, he was groaning, he could not speak; he was brought in about half past ten at night; the servant called me up the next morning a quarter before six; I went up and saw him dead; I had left the Serang to take care of him.</p>
               <p>ISMAEL. - Mr. Gleed. Ask the witness if he knew the deceased Imambacchus - A. Yes, and he knows the three prisoners at the bar; Sacchaar and Glosse belonged to his ship, he has known them sometime; and Savau he has seen him at his quarters, he does not know him any other way.</p>

               <p>Q. At that time did he see either of the three prisoners there - A. Not then; they came up directly after they came out, he did not hear them say any thing; Savau struck him first over his head; Gloss struck him, and he then fell down.

               <p>Q. What was it that they beat him with - A. With large sticks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see any blow given by Imambacchus to either of the prisoners - A. He did not see Imambacchus strike any; he had his umbrella in his hand to defend himself from the rain; he went away directly to the house to tell some men to come to their assistance.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after they got there did he see the deceased, Imambacchus - A. Almost directly; the girl was with him; he did not see no one else.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he know the prisoners at the bar - A. He knows all three, he saw them that night, almost directly after the deceased and the girl came out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Imambacchus any stick in his hand at the time he came out of the house - A. He did not see any thing in his hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Had Imambacchus any conversation with the three prisoners before any blows were given - A. He did not hear a word pass; he saw Savau strike Imambacchus, and next he saw Glosse strike him; when Savau struck him, Imambacchus fell. Glosse and Sacchar struck him when he was down, and blood came from his mouth and his head; he went away to inform the people of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. During the whole time he was observing these blows, did he observe Imambacchus strike or attempt to strike - A. No. There were more men, but only three struck him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you called on this unfortunate occasion to see the body of the deceased - A I was; on Monday the 25th of April; I saw him in one of the rooms where the men are boarded by the East India company; he was laying in a state of stupor; there were three wounds upon his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these wounds appear to be inflicted by a sharp instrument - A. They did not appear to be done by a sharp instrument; the edge, of the wounds were ragged; there were three wounds quite to the scalp.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you attend him - A. I only saw him in the night; I was called about half past eleven o'clock; he was in the same state when I left him as when I first saw him. I did not see him after till he was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had seen him and left him, did you entertain any hopes of him - A. It was my opinion he would die by his laying in that state of stupor; I opened the head; I entertain no doubt that the wounds were the occasion of his death.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. What condition was the sheep in? A. It was healthy; they were there to graze - there is a footpath through the field; it was a fine day - he was not near the footpath; I do not think it was shady under the hedge - when I took him I asked what he was going to do with the sheep; he said, "What do you think?" I said, "I think you were going to kill it;" he said, "No, I had nothing to kill it with, if I had wanted;" the ditch was dry, and about three feet deep.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and have known the prisoner all his life; he bore a good character. I was passing through this field a few days before, and a sheep laid exactly in the footpath - I have no doubt it would have died if I had not taken it up; all the sheep there were ill.</p>
               <p> - MILLER. I am a farmer. I have been obliged to move the prosecutor's sheep; they were so rotten that they were ready to drop as I moved them, and several have died since.</p>

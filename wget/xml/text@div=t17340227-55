The Prisoner and other Carpenters were at work in fitting up other Rooms in the same House. I went and got some Shavings of them, and the Prisoner soon after came into my Room. I was sitting upon a Stool making a Shift, and the Watch hung up by the Chimney. He look'd on the Watch, and said it was between 3 and 4 a Clock, I said, Yes. Now, says he, in case you was afraid of being robb'd of this Watch, where would be the properest Place to hide it? And then he spoke smutty Words. I said, I hop'd I never should be robb'd of it, for if I or my Husband should be taken ill, we had nothing else that we could make a little Money of. He stood a while, and then pointing to the other End of the Room, he cry'd, God damn the Cat. I turn'd my Head to see what the Cat was doing, but there was no Cat there. Then the Prisoner went to work in the next Room, and in eight or nine Minutes, (before any body else had been in the Room) I mist the Watch. I ran to him, and said, Lord, how could you frighten me so, what have you done with the Watch? He swore he knew nothing of the Watch And

Presently the Door was shut and a Cloth hung over<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173402270021"></xptr> the Key-hole. But some of us looking thro' a Crevice in the Partition, observed some odd Passages between the old Man and her. He staid near an Hour, and when he went away, she came into our Room and went to plane a Board. I told her that was a Forfeit, and so I followed her into her Room, and asked her for a Dram: But I went back immediately, and she soon followed me. An Alehouse-Keeper's Man came up for some Shavings, she rioted him out of the House; and as he was going down Stairs, she said she must go back and shut her Door, for fear she should be robbed. So she went, and I went down to work in the Room below. She came down soon after, staid a little while, and went up again. In a few Minutes I heard a noise above, and ran up, she was then charging Hugh Meer and my Master's Apprentice with taking the Watch; and she said it was in her Room when she went to shut her Door, which was near an Hour after I was in her Room. And they were bantering her about the old Man. Then she said she was sure we had it among us; and at last she charged me with it.</p>

So she and the old Man went in and shut the Door. I thought some Game was going forward, and so I looked at the Key-Hole, but something was hung before it within Side. Then we found out a Crevice, and through that we could see 'em plainly. She was sitting in a Chair, and he stood before her. He thrust his Hand down her Bosom, and then up her Coats; she took out what she could find, and play'd with it, while the old Boy bill'd her, as if he would have eaten her up. After he was gone, she came into our Room, and we began to run the rig upon her, about what we had seen, and I called her - and - , which made her so angry, that she swore I and Gandy had stole the Watch. But when the Prisoner came up she charged it upon him. It was the first time that ever I had heard any of him. As to his being in her Room, she came to plane a Board, and he told her she must pay her Footing, and so he followed her and asked her for a Dram. I saw him in the middle of her Room, but he was not near the Chimney where the Watch hung, and he did not stay two Minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. How long might it be after you left the public-house, before you met with the prisoner? - A. It might be ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not noticed your money between the time of your leaving the public-house, and meeting the prisoner? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you spoken to any other persons before you met with her, or talked with any other woman? - A. No, I had not; I had the silver in my waistcoat pocket, and the gold in my breeches pocket; I had in my waistcoat pocket a piece of a button, that was found upon her afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take you cloaths off when you laid down? - A. Only my coat; I had pulled out the silver at this house, to pay for some purl.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no occasion to resort to the pocket that the gold was in? - A. No; she asked me, if I had been robbed, and I felt in my pocket, and found that I had, there was only a halfpenny and two farthings left in my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the house besides the girl? There was another woman in the next room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in the same room with you at all? I cannot say; when I awaked, a man went after her, and brought her back, she was taken from there by the watchman, to the watch-house; I went with her, she was examined, and there was a guinea found in her mouth, that she endeavoured to swallow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any attempt in her to swallow it? - A. Yes, and there was found half-a-guinea and ten shillings in silver in her pocket, and a part of the button; she said, a gentleman had just given her fifteen shillings in the street, and she had five shillings in her pocket of her own.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect her feeling about your pocket's while you were in bed? - A. No; I fell asleep, I had no connections with her at all.</p>

             sworn. - I am watch-house keeper of St. Giles's; the watchman brought the prisoner and the prosecutor to the watch-house, on the 23d of December, about three o'clock in the morning, I searched her, and found half-a-guinea in her pocket, and a part of a plated button, (produces it); I saw the motion of her mouth, and I judged the had got something in her mouth; I asked her if she had got any thing there, and she said, no; says I, come out with it, and held her by the cheeks, and I saw her strain, as if she was going to swallow it; I saw Fidler, the beadle, put his finger into her mouth, and out tumbled a guinea; I put the guinea, the half-guinea, ten shillings, and the top of the button on the table; the prosecutor says, there is a button belonging to me, I know it, I think he said it was filed.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know this to be mine, it was taken by my fellow-servant for a halfpenny, it had been filed before I had it.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot swear to the money of course? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I picked up that good man, he said, he had but a shilling, and he gave me that, and some halfpence to get something to drink, that button was among them, and then he gave me the guinea to change, to get something for supper, because he was to stop with me all night, the silver I had before.</p>

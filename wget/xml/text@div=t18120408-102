There being a bill at the window, the prisoner asked if he could have a lodging, it was the 2d of March, about half past eleven in the morning. I told him Mr. Furlong was a very particular man, could he refer me to any body for a character, he said he had come from some distance, and was going to work in the highway, he could not refer to any body. He came in the evening about half after five with a large bundle, saying if I would permit him he would go up stairs and put them things in the room; I went up stairs with him, and shewed him into the room, he asked me to let him put on a clean shirt, I left him there, he was in the room about ten minutes, I was in the next room, I heard him shut the door, I went down immediately afterwards. I went up to him at the street door saying I hope if you bring the remainder of your things to night you will not be late, he did not turn round to look at me, I looked to see if he had a clean shirt on, he had not. I went up stairs and found a sheet was gone, I pursued him and overtook him in the highway, I told him he had got my property I believed, my husband was a working man, that it was an object to me; I begged a gentleman to see me righted, he was secured, one gentleman said he has nothing in his hands, I said no, he certainly has it round his body; he unbuttoned his waistcoat, it was bound round his body under his waistcoat.</p>

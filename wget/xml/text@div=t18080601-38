I lost the tools on the 13th of April; we left them in the building safe at seven o'clock, on the evening of the 12th; at five o'clock the next morning I went to work; as soon as I opened the door I saw a board taken away from the window; I saw part of my tools laying separate on the bench by itself; then I went up stairs and found a chest broken open and some of the tools on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost a great many articles, part of which you found upon the prisoner in a basket - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A basket, a chissel, a punch, and a sawsett; these were all your property; they were afterwards found upon the prisoner - A. Yes. I lost a great many more.</p>
               <p>Q. You suspected the prisoner - A. I did, because of his being there on the 12th; he came to speak to a young man that he knew, and by that means we had suspicion of him; we made enquiries after him; we found that he went by the name of Bond; it passed on for a fortnight afterwards; we fell in with this man as we were going to work near the City road: we asked him where he lived; he told us near Smithfield. Two or three mornings afterwards he was taken; he was coming down the City road; we sent a man after him. He was taken in Little Britain, in Mr. Briant's shop; when I went into the shop, I asked this man if he wanted any hands there; he said no; I saw my basket under the bench where the prisoner was at work and my tools were in the basket; I took it up and said it was my property; he said it was not; I took charge of him till an officer came.</p>
               <p>SIMON FORD. On the 13th of April I lost my tools from a building, River Terrace; I was present when they were taken from Mr. Briant's shop; I was in company with Powell; my tools were in the basket that Powell claimed.</p>

               <p>- COCKMAN. I am a constable; as I was taking the prisoner to the counter, at Ironmonger lane, he asked me where I was going to take him; I said to the Compter; he swore he would not go any further; he knocked me down: I was all over mud as if I had been thrown into a mud cart.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010034"></xptr>four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I have known Jones a year and a half as a letter carrier—it is twelve months since he was a letter carrier—I accompanied Hanmer to Jones' place, and found this ladle under a broken pan in the dust bin, covered over—it was very sticky, and smelt the same as the sticky stuff on the letters—after the first examination, I went to Jones's place, and found three postage stamps at the bottom of a small box on the mantelshelf—they have not been defaced, and there it no gum on the back of them.</p>

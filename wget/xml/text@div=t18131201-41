               <p>Q. Did you see the same man run up the court - A. Yes; I saw nobody in the court but him.

               <p>Prisoner. He said, as I came down the yard he seized me, that I deny: because he suffered me to walk out of the yard with a person here fifty yards, before they could make up their minds to know whether I was the person or another person; they said, they could not make up their minds; they said, they believed it was a man drest in black, one of them did say that.</p>

               <p>Lampert. I said I thought there were eight lost: on Wednesday morning, when the examination closed we corrected the mistake.</p>

            . I am a constable. I assisted in taking the prisoner before the magistrate, and the seals were delivered to me. These are the seals.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have one observation to make, that is the improbability of either of Mr. Jarman's shopmen being able to identify me to be the person that took the seals; so sudden a thing they could not identify me again if I was the man.</p>

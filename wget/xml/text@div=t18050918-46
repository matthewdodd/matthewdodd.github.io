               <p>Q. Before they began fighting there was conversation, was there not? - A. Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased offer to make it up, or any thing of that sort? - A. There were some of the party that wished them to make it up, and the deceased said he was willing to fight, or to make it up; Mr. Dillon said, he was challenged to fight for half-a-guinea, and he would fight it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them gave in? - A. The deceased gave in; he never spoke a word after the last round, he fell down, I was not near enough to tell whether his fall was occasioned by a blow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The last blow the deceased fell uppermost? - A. Some of them that were near said so; I cannot say which were uppermost.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you see the fighting? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased fall the last time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner or the deceased fall uppermost? - A. They both fell alongside each other the last round; the deceased fell on his head, the ground was very wet, I could not perceive any blow that was the occasion of his falling.</p>
               <p>Q. And he fell upon his head? - A. He did so.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am a surgeon, I examined the body very minutely; I found no appearance of injury upon any part of his body whatever to which I could attribute his death, I opened the head, the abdomen, and the chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open the thorax? - A. No: there was no extravasated blood as I could perceive.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it come from exertion or agitation of the mind? - A. It might; most probably the fall was the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. That is all conjecture? - A. Entirely; there was no appearance of injury.</p>

             sworn. - I lost the property mentioned in the indictment, about a quarter before eight in the morning of the 26th of August; I am a <rs id="t17970920-91-viclabel485" type="occupation">looking glass frame-maker</rs>

             sworn. - I am a constable; I apprehended the prisoners in Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street; the prosecutor applied to me to apprehend them, which I did immediately; I searched them both, but found nothing; I searched their lodgings, but found nothing; this is the book which I received of the prosecutor, I found this piece of cord by the bed-post.</p>
               <p>The prisoners put in a written defence, stating, that they had not been used to speak in public, and begging to be indulged with having it read; that they were so poor, as not to have it in their power to employ Counsel; that the prosecutor and another man had been with them the night before, and slept with them, that they were both very drunk; and that when they went away, the prosecutor took with him a shawl, a child's shirt, two padlocks, and four hooks,which had been used for roasting meat by the fire, and that they were perfectly innocent of the crime alledged against them.</p>

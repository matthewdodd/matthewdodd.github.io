            . My father keeps the Bull's Head, at Hitchen. Mr. Cetti had a box in our front room up stairs. I did not know what was in it. I saw the prisoner at my father's house, on the evening of the 2d of April; he was a stranger to me. He slept there on the 2d or the 3d, he was several times in the house, and went away on the 5th. I was not there when he left. The box was locked, and Mr. Cetti kept the key himself. He was in the habit of coming to Hitchen three weeks or a month at a time. On the 5th of April. I was at home, and my mother said,</p>
               <p>"Come up stairs;" when I went up, I found the box had been broken open. I did not see the prisoner again till he was at Bow-street. I am quite positive of his person. Late on the night of the 4th of April, I saw him go up stairs with a lighted candle, he slept that night alone in the room, where the box was deposited.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ten years old, and live with my parents, at 41, Beresford-street, Woolwich—they keep a baker's shop, and I am sometimes left alone to serve—on Saturday evening, 15th October, at four or five minutes past 7, the prisoner came in for a sixpenny cake—he gave me a half crown—I bit it, bent it and said, "I think this is a bad one—he said, "Oh no, it is a good one; put it in the till"—I gave him the change, and kept the half-crown in my hand—Charles Goodfellow, who works In the shop, came in, and I gave it to him—the prisoner had then gone out hardly a minute—my mother, who came out almost at the same time as Goodfellow, ran after the prisoner—I next saw him when I went to the Court.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a baker's shop, at 41, Beresford-street, Woolwich, and am the mother of the first witness—I came in at about five minutes past 7, and Goodfellow gave me a half-crown, and ran out—I ran out, and overtook him about five minutes' run from the shop—I first saw the prisoner coming out of a baker's shop opposite the Arsenal-gates—he did not purchase anything there—I next saw him come out of Mrs. Clarke's, and then he went to another shop—he came out, and went to where they sell oysters, Mrs. Thompson's—I kept in the road—I afterwards went into a shop where he was purchasing some cards, but they had not got the sort he wanted—a constable walked in with me, shut the door, and said to the prisoner, "I want you"—he said, "What do you want with me?"—the policeman said, "You have been passing bad money"—he said, "You can search me," and I saw him put something on a little desk—the policeman took him to the station, and on the road he struck the policeman on the mouth with his fist, and made his nose and lip bleed—I kept the half-crown, and marked it at the station—this(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it.</p>

On the 18th of October, about twelve o'clock, I was standing in the street, close to the prosecutor's door, and saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutor's shop with a roll of carpet under his arm. I stood at the boot-shop next door. He asked me if Mr. Wilson was within? I told him I knew nothing about it. He said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, I'll inquire a few doors higher up." He went to the corner of Craig's-court, and ran up there, I followed him, as I thought he had stolen the carpet. The court is not a thoroughfore, and he was obliged to return. I told Chapman to watch him. I ran to the prosecutor's to ask if they had lost any carpeting. I saw the shopman, and told him, he and I came out; Chapman secured the prisoner, and brought him back to the shop. An officer was sent for, who took him, and the carpet, which I saw taken from him. He had it under his arm.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Commissioners of Land and Assessed Property, and Income Taxes for the Tower division—the defendant was appointed assessor by a precept delivered to him, and he acted as assessor of that division—in the ordinary course forms are sent to persons in trade to make a return of their profits—these forms ought to be returned to the assessor for the district—I have the original assessment of this district from April, 1858, it is signed by the commissioners—on this original assessment being signed, a duplicate is made out—this original assessment is signed by two general and two additional commissioners—I know the hand-writing—a duplicate of it was made out; I produce it—this was delivered to Jay, and I received this document from him—this is the appointment and warrant, and would be his authority to collect the different amounts charged against those persons—it is signed by two of the commissioners for general purposes—on the defendant receiving this it would be his duty to collect the sums mentioned in this assessment—(<hi rend="italic">The warrant was here ready</hi>)—on the defendant receiving this it would be his duty to send a notice to the persons of the amount at which they are assessed, and to call at the houses, collect the money, sign a receipt, and give it to the person paying the taxes—I got this duplicate from the defendant—I called at his house in Pearson-street, Kingsland-road—I saw him and told him I had come by direction of my Board to take away the duplicate, and that he was suspended—he gave me the duplicate, and schedules A and B for the land and assessed taxes for the year 1858 and 1859, and stated that he had destroyed the others; and he said it was a bad job—I told him he was suspended on account of some irregularity in his accounts, and having received money that was not in the assessment—he was ill, and he directed his wife to go into another room and fetch them—he said it was a bad job and that it was through Mr. Levine—Mr. Levine was the crown surveyor of the district—I don't know what has become of him: as far as I know he has absconded—the duplicates which the prisoner said he had destroyed ought not to have been destroyed certainly—they ought to have been brought into the commissioners' office—commissioners are appointed who are called commissioners for general purposes; and they appoint assistant commissioners—the assessment is made and signed by the assistant commissioners and the general commisoners, and then it comes into the hands of the persons who collect—in this duplicate here is the name of Mr. Rose, of Holy well-street, grocer—the amount due from him under schedule D, is 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., from April 1858 to April 1859—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185912120033"></xptr>
               <p>the defendant would not have to collect a larger sum than this mentioned—here is no assessment of Mr. Stevenson—there is no duty payable by him—this duty payable by Mr. Rose is on 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—there is the name of James Hill, of Holy well-street, tobacconist; due from him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that is on 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is the name of White Brothers, of Holy well-street, tobacconists, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that would be the duty on 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the instruction is to collect these sums half-yearly—Mr. Rose's would be collected in two sums of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each.</p>

SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that the defendant has been twenty years collector of the land and assessed taxes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and of the income tax since 1842—with regard to the land and assessed taxes, I know of no complaint against him—Mr. Levine was the person appointed by the Board of Inland Revenue as surveyor of the districts; he had authority to overlook and supervise the collectors in reference to these taxes, including, of course, the income tax—the course of making an assessment is that parties liable to be assessed are to be returned, and for that purpose papers are sent out—I believe Mr. Levine to be out of the way—I don't know whether there are any proceedings depending against him, I have no means of knowing—Mr. Bunn was a collector of the adjoining district of the parish—he was suspended at the same time that the defendant was—I don't know whether there are any proceedings against him—Mr. Garnett, the Inspector General, is here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing any alteration takes place as regards the duties of the collector, besides this duplicate, does he receive instructions to collect from Mr. Levine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; as far as my knowledge goes, he ought not—Mr. Levine was in the habit of attending at our office before the com<lb></lb>missioners constantly—it was part of his duty—he had not the power of suspending a collector; certainly not—the practice was for the assessor to deliver a schedule wherein the person makes his return, and the assessor ought to bring it into the commissioner's office, but it is the surveyor's duty to see that it is returned—when all the returns are got in, they are in my custody, but they are never all returned—if he does make returns they are finally in my care—these duplicates are made in my office and sent out to the collectors—I may deliver one if the collector calls, but as a general rule I do not deliver them—additional duplicates are issued in cases where the parties liable to be assessed have been omitted altogether—I have not known instances where the amount ordered to be collected has been less than the amount that ought to have been—I am not down in this duplicate as liable to pay—I am not in that district.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many collectors were there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From recollection, I should say ten or a dozen—the only one in Holywell was the defendant—Dunn was in the adjoining district.</p>

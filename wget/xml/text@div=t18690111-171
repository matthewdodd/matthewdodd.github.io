                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Serjeant</hi>). On the morning of 21st December, about 5 o'clock, I went with Obee to the prisoner's house, 50, Wellington Street, Victoria Park—I saw his wife—I searched the front and back parlours, and I found in the cupboard in the front parlour three moulds (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) one is for half-crowns, one for a florin, and one for two single shillings—I took them to the station where the prisoner was in custody, and asked him how he came in possession of these moulds—he said, "He was a mould maker, and made them to make ornaments for sweetstuffs at Christmas.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Watkins, of 50, Welling<lb></lb>ton Street—the prisoner occupied the two parlours there, for which he paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he went away on Sunday night and was taken in the morning—I always thought him an honest respectable man—he is a carver and gilder.</p>

I am Inspector of Coin to Her Majesty's Mint—this is a mould for making four half-crowns, but it is imperfect—here is an imperfect mould for making two shillings—this is a mould for making a florin, it is in a more perfect state than the others—they are not such moulds as would be used in the manufacture of sweetstuff—they are ordinary moulds for coin making, and the coins used are the worst specimens that could be got; and if intended for sweetstuff or ornamental purposes the best coins would have been used—it is common to select the worst specimens, especially for half-crowns.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you mean if they can obtain new coins? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They can always do that, there are plenty in circulation—these would have never been used—the channels require cutting—this one for florins, could be used at once, but the others could not—I could make a florin from this.</p>

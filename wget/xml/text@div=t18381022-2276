                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Eaton, a silversmith, and live in Jewin-crescent. The prisoner was in his employ—about three o'clock on the afternoon of the 10th of October, I was in the work-shop and the prisoner came in with a soup-ladle in his hand—he put his hand into the skin which contains silver filings, and in bringing something out, some silver dropped from it—I mentioned it.</p>

                  </hi>. I have the care of the skin where the filings are—I missed 20z. 15 dwts.—I received information from Russell, and followed the prisoner down stairs—he went towards our fire-place, and he looked round to see if any one was following him—he took our spring tongs in his hand, but he had no work then in the fire—I was close to him—he went round to the entrance of the water closet, and there he attempted to get rid of a box from his pocket—I said I had information that he had got some of my filings—he said, "Nonsense"—he ran up stairs, then came down again, and I took him—he had the box under his apron—the filings were not in it—some were found at his feet—he had no business to go to my place and take filings.</p>

               <p>the shop—each man is responsible for his own filings, and takes care of his own can—we do not carry the can about at the bench I am in—he does sometimes—there are cans for every man—my place is called the filing place—other men never go and file there—they may on some occasions—I have seen them there frequently—I was not at my place at that time—I have been about fifteen months in my master's service—I was dis<lb></lb>charged two years and a half ago, as an unpleasantness occurred between me and a shopmate about a waistcoat—they could not prove that I stole it—I was charged with it—a policeman came, and I was dismissed in a day or two—I worked in one situation seventeen years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter to Mr. Eaton. I was at the place where the filings were dropped—the prisoner dropped them from a box that he took out of his right-hand pocket—they weighed 20z.—he was in the shop when he dropped them—the filings are here now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would not this box hold the filings that a man. might have in a day's work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but it is not a regular thing—this is what he terms a tobacco box—he told me he was in the habit of carrying his filings in this box—I have known him two years and a half—he always bore a good character as far as I knew—I heard him say to the Magistrate that he dropped a bit of lead into the skin, and put his hand in to take it out.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the counting-house—I saw nothing of this—I can identify these filings by their similarity to those in Chandler's skin—there was a peculiarity in the work he was doing that morning—there were scrapings as well as filings, which makes the similarity more apparent—the prisoner had been full four years with me—he had a good character.</p>

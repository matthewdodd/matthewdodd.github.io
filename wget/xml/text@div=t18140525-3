            . Q. Do you know the two prisoners - A. I do; they are mother and daughter. I have known them about two years. I met the mother about nine weeks ago, in Barbican; I had a little conversation with her. She invited me to her place, No. 4, <placeName id="t18140525-3-crimeloc14">Broad Arrow-court, Grub-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. When you first saw her, did she tell you the mode of her life - A. She said, she was going to make some base coin, that her daughter was going to Ireland with. She said no more at that time. This was the first time. This conversation was in the first floor front room; she took me to that room as her own room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day you went again - A. No, I cannot. On the day she was taken up I went there again, between twelve and one in the day, and I went there in the evening; I saw a little girl belonging to the second floor; she asked me who I wanted. I got up to Mrs. Dunn's door; I knocked at the door. The little girl asked me again who I wanted; I said I did not want her. After my knocking at the door, Mrs. Dunn aid to her daughter, Mrs. Leonard open the door, I do not mind her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181405250004"></xptr>Q. Did Mrs. Dunn know your voice - A. Yes. I spoke loud enough for any one in the room to hear me. The door was opened immediately. I heard the door unbolted. I went into the room; I found both the prisoners there, Mrs. Dunn and her daughter, Mrs. Leonard, when I went in. In the first instance, I saw two files and some scouring-paper on the floor; Mrs. Dunn took them up, and took them in the second floor herself. I sat down upon the bed, and had some conversation with Mrs. Leonard. While I was sitting down, Mrs. Leonard took several blanks from under the coverlid.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by blanks - A. I mean pieces of metal in the form of sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated, they were taken from under the bed-quilt - A. Yes. Some of them were round, and some crooked; they were not all of one size; they were all in the shape of sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you and 
               <persName id="t18140525-3-person65">Leonard</persName>
             any conversation about them - A. Yes; I asked her to let me look at them; she gave me two or three to look at. Upon my looking at them, I observed some of them had been coloured before; I told her so. She said, they had, but they had been spoiled, and Leonard said, she meaned to colour them again; she intended to make some to go to Ireland. She said, she intended to go there, and intended to make a sufficient quantity to go there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her do any thing with these blanks - A. I saw her crook them with her teeth. Dunn was in the second floor all this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Dunn was not in the room at this time - A. No. I observed they were small; Mrs. Leonard said, she could pass them better small than large.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you remain there - A. An hour and a half. Mrs. Dunn came down just as I was going away. Mrs. Dunn said are you going away; will not you stay to tea, or return to tea. I said, I did not know; perhaps I might. I went away. I went to Hatton Garden office, and passing along Clerkenwell, I met Read, junior, the officer; I communicated to him what had passed. He appointed me to meet him at six o'clock at Hatton Garden office. I met Read at the office at six o'clock in the evening; I then was taken before the magistrate, and gave information. I was to meet Read, senior, junior, and Limbrick, at the Black Horse, in Barbican, at seven o'clock in the evening. I went to the Black Horse; I met the Reads and Limbrick. I then went to Mrs. Dunn's; I found both the prisoners in their own room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were both of the prisoners there - A. Yes. I staid there about an hour, and returned to the officers; I gave the officers information of what I had seen. The officers went immediately to the prisoners house. I accompanied them to the door, and then I left them. I don't know any thing further.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. How long have you been acquainted with these two women - A. About two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your poor husband - A. He is in prison, for an eighteen-penny token. I have likewise been in prison for an eighteen-penny token. I have never been a witness upon any occasion before.</p>
               <p>Q. You know they are indicted for high treason, and that there is a reward, do you not - A. I don't know it.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you - A. I am a straw bonnet maker; I work for Mr. Medley, a straw bonnet maker, in Sloane-street, No. 145. I never heard of a reward.</p>

            , JUNIOR. I am an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman that has just stood down, give you any information against the prisoners - A. She did. She afterwards took me to the house, and there I found the prisoners at the bar, on the 21st of April, near eight o'clock; I found the prisoners door shut. I expected to find it open. A woman looked out of the window. I said, I wanted to come in; she said, she would let me in directly. I heard persons running up and down stairs. I threw up the parlour sash, and got in at the window; I broke the parlour door open, it being locked on the outside. I instantly let the other officers in. I heard a great noise of running up and down stairs, and I heard something fall, as if out of the window upon the tiles, I heard it jingle as money would; I heard something fall that I supposed to be money. After I had opened the street door, and let my father in and Limbrick, Limbrick and I went up stairs into the first floor; there we saw the two prisoners; the door was open. Mrs. Leonard had her cap and handkerchief off, and seemed much torn about, and much agitated; the other seemed very much frightened. I told them I had a search warrant, to search on suspicion of coining; they said, they did not know any thing about it; they did not do it there; they did not know what we meaned. We then searched about different parts of the room. I found eight shillings and sixpence in good money upon Mrs. Leonard; no bad. Limbrick searched Dunn, and found a quantity of halfpence. Between the bed and the quilt, I found eight blanks; in the tinder-box on the shelf over the mantle-piece, I found a coloured sixpence, and some cuttings of metal. Under the bedstead I found several more blanks, and some more cuttings, and more pieces of metal, apparently as though they had been sixpences before; they were blank sixpences, not coloured; they were in the chamber-pot; I emptied the pot. Here is one sixpence coloured, the same as what I found on the shelf over the the fire place. I found this whitening and cream of tartar together. In different parts of the room I found sand-paper, it is all over brass, and here is some yellow soap. In the second floor, I found a file; it is all over brass. Mrs. Dunn went and sat down by the fire place; I observed her hand go. I went to the fire immediately, and took a piece of saltpetre out of the fire. In searching the cupboard, I found this hammer and iron plate; at that time the iron plate was all over brass, and the hammer appeared to have been used recently. I then went up into the second floor; I found in searching on the shelf twenty-four bad shillings and bad sixpences coloured, and on the shelf I found cream of tartar, three bottles; and these clothes; they appear to have been stained with something wet. The prisoners said, they were innocent of what they were charged with. That is all I produce. Then I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181405250005"></xptr>the prisoners into custody. The two prisoners owned that they lodged together. I asked them whether they occupied that room; they said, they did; they lived together.</p>

            . I accompanied Read to this house.</p>
               <p>Q. We understand the younger Read got in, and opened the door - A. He did. I went in with the other Read. There was a window on the staircase open; it looked into the back yard; it is a small yard; there is a shed underneath the window; it adjoins the house. In that back yard, I looked out there by hearing a noise of something jingling; I was satisfied there was something thrown out there. In looking out of this window, I found this apron laying on the tides of the shed; I went and took it; it contained three files, a parcel of cuttings, and blanks.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the blanks - A. They are metal blanks for sixpences. I also found six sixpences finished; they wore on the tiles; thrown out in paper as they are now, in separate papers. I proceeded to look into the privy.</p>
               <p>Q. In the place where you found this apron, could that be thrown quite easy out of this window - A. Yes, quite easy; the shed is underneath. I then went to the privy; there I saw some cuttings on the seat, and these three files; on the teeth of them they were full of brass filings; they are the same filings as would come off pieces of this metal. In the privy I saw some blanks; Read will speak to that; he took it. Then I went into the house. There is a cupboard underneath the stairs, in the passage, I found this cup and this rag over it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what is in the cup - A. It is stuff for rubbing over the blanks to produce the colour of silver; there is aquafortis in it. I then went up stairs; Mrs. Dunn was in the room. She said; where did you get that from; I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you asked her any question about that cup - A. I had not. It was just as I came into the room; having it in my hand, and nothing being said to her, she made that observation in the room. I found these scissars; they have brass upon them, and this flat iron, with the appearance of brass on it now. I found this cloth, it is stained with aquafortis, with wiping off. These pieces of metal were in the room, and some sand paper. I perceived Dunn throw something towards the fire when I went into the room; I raked it out. I took out a sixpence, some cuttings, and some sand paper; that is all I found. Afterwards I saw Macdonald and Conner in the room; they were both taken up, and afterwards discharged. This table me and Read found in their room; it looked apparently as if they had been working upon it; there was the white stuff that I have described, some of the stuff out of the cup. It appeared to me as if they had been working on the table. The younger prisoner asked me how we came by out information; I told her that was not a fair question. She said, she supposed it was that b - y But Fewhey; for there had nobody else been in the room but her.</p>

            , JUNIOR. I was in company with Limbrick and my son. I saw Limbrick find these things upon the tiles. I produce two blanks; I took them off the tiles; they were scattered on the tiles, and one coloured, and wrapped up in paper, in that way. I found this cup in a tub, in the one pair of stairs room, nearly close to the table; it is the same sort of stuff as you had in the other cup. I searched Dunn. I found between seven and eight shillings upon Dunn, and a vast quantity of halfpence in the room. Both the prisoners told me the room belonged to them.

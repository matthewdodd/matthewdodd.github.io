                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Silberberg, a tobacconist, in Fleet-street. On Wednesday, 13th Oct., the prisoner came, about 6 o'clock in the evening, for half an ounce of tobacco; it came to three halfpence—he offered me a half crown—I gave him change, and he left the shop directly—I left the half crown on the counter; Mr. Silberberg looked at it directly—it was the same I had of the prisoner—he tried it, and cracked it, and put it on the glasscase—on Thursday, the 14th, the prisoner came again, about the same time in the evening—he asked for half an ounce of tobacco, and gave me a bad shilling—I saw it was bad directly, and told him so—he could not understand me—I rang the bell, and Mr. Silberberg came down—the prisoner ran out; he did not take his tobacco—I ran after him, and brought him back with a constable—when he came on the Thursday, I recognized him again—I am sure he is the same person who came on the Wednesday.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 194, Fleet-street. I received a half crown from my shopman on Wednesday, 13th Oct.; I found it was bad—I cracked it, and put it on a glass—I told my shopman to be careful, as the person who passed it would be sure to come again—the next day I received a shilling from my shopman—I sent him for a constable, and he came and brought the prisoner back—I put the shilling on the counter—the prisoner seized it, and tried to swallow it.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you tell her what you wanted the money for? - A. I pretended I wanted it to pass. She told me her mistress, Mrs. Connell, was not at home, I must come in the morning; I went on the Tuesday morning, and I saw Molly, she pulled a paper out of her bosom, and served me with six sixpences for a shilling; I asked her if I could have any more; she said, yes, whenever I liked; I might come again the next morning for some. She gave them me in a paper, and I kept them in my hand till I gave them to Mr. Hamilton, the officer. I was searched before I went, and I had no other money about me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What are you? - A. I work for my living; I neither go smashing, whoring, nor thieving.</p>
               <p>Q. And you endeavoured to trick this poor woman into the commission of this offence? - A. Yes, and I would do it again, for it is worse than a highway robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been employed on business of this sort before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You prosecuted the mistress here last night, and she was acquitted? - A. Yes; so much the better for her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You prosecuted the master as well as the mistress, and the master was convicted? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - A. Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street; on the 22d of October, Lewis gave me six bad sixpences, I have had them ever since. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Croos-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had not searched Lewis, upon this occasion, before she went? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore she might have bad money about her, for any thing you know? - A. I cannot say; I searched the prisoner afterwards, and found two parcels in a bag in her pocket, one containing two bad shillings, and five bad sixpences; and the other four bad shillings, and seven bad sixpences. I found this box of blacking, which is a composition made use of before the money goes into circulation.</p>

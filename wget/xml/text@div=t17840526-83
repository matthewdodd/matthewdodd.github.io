             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman in Bishopsgate-street, my brother watchman Brown told me two men had gone by loaded, and he thought were gone for a fresh load, this was about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Butt's; I went with him, and found the prisoners coming fresh loaded; I took hold of the prisoner John, and asked him what he had with him, he said he had found it, he carried it on his head; he turned round and seemed as if he would strike me, the two prisoners were then taken and brought with the bundle into the watch-house; George flung his bundle away, I saw him throw it away at the corner; I found in the bundle that John had two large lumps of sugar.</p>
               <p>What was in George's bundle? - Two small loaves I think they call them.</p>
               <p>(The lumps of sugar produced.)</p>
               <p>Court to Butt. Do you know them to be your's? - I swore to them by the mark, but they have been carried about so much, that the mark is rubbed out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester, Prisoner's Council. Shew us the mark. - They were marked with chalk, and marked upon the face of the goods equal the same, they were sold but not delivered.</p>
               <p>How many loaves did you make? - A good many.</p>
               <p>How many did you sell? - I sold them all; the sugar is mine, I know it by the quality and clearness; (the other sugar produced) they are marked No. 1.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. What countryman are you? - A German.</p>
               <p>In England you never saw any body mark No. 1, before? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>How do you distinguish your mark from another person's mark? - We make it by a tool we work with.</p>

               <p>And every sugar-baker works with the same tool? - They have different tools.</p>
               <p>Thank you for your information! but it is by the same sort of tools? - I cannot say that I have seen any of others that have been marked No. 1.</p>
               <p>They all mark their sugar with some instrument? why it is not difficult in Germany to answer that question? - No.</p>
               <p>Then why do not you answer it in England? - They may mark with a tool.</p>
               <p>Did not your master mark with a tool? - Very like so.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know; do you mean to say that no other sugar-baker in this City of London, marks the sugar any other way than with a tool? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How did your master mark his sugar? - Of various marks.</p>
               <p>He used to mark them No. 1, did not he? - I cannot remember, he may.</p>
               <p>Will you swear he did not? - I will not take upon me to swear that.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he did mark with No. 1? - I will not swear that, sometimes we began with one number, and sometimes with another.</p>
               <p>How many loaves have you marked No. 1? - As many as there are in a day's work.</p>
               <p>How many may be made in a day? - Why a hundred and upwards; these were all sold to one man.</p>
               <p>Now the boiling before that how many did you make of No. 1, then? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Is your marking of No. 1, a particular baking? - A particular day's work.</p>
               <p>Which day do you begin with? - Sometimes with No. 1, and sometimes 2; we have no particular day of making them in the week; sometimes we go as high as ten or twelve.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any other means of knowing these sugar loaves to be your's but by their being marked No. 1; how can you tell that these are not the sugar-loaves that you sold to your friend and correspondent? - By the marks and the make I know the goods.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the mark on the side that was rubbed out? - It was a mark on the sugar<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260105"></xptr> that was marked with a nail, I cannot perceive it here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Nothing else besides the mark with a nail? - I never saw any.</p>
               <p>Court. How many loaves have you sold marked No. 1? - They were sold to Mr. Naylor, in Bread-street, but none of them had been delivered; there were eighty-four.</p>
               <p>How many of the eighty-four were wanting? - Two of them.</p>
               <p>How many sugar-loaves had you delivered, marked No. 1, within these six months? - I do not know, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Speak within a few hundreds? - I cannot tell any thing about the matter.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you make these loaves of sugar marked No. 1, which you sold to Mr. Naylor? - About six weeks or more before this happened.</p>
               <p>How soon had you manufactured any before those that were sold to Mr. Naylor? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Were they marked with No. 1, or not? - I cannot remember.</p>

               <p>Butt. My Lord, that mark is off now.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. The question is, how far there is sufficient evidence given to identify this sugar; that is the whole of the question, I wish you would talk to one another about it, and I will sum it up to you, and put the prisoners on their defence, if you think the mark No. 1, was sufficient to identify the sugar.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Have you valued this sugar? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have you the samples that you shewed them by? - I have not brought them here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner George. We went and took a walk in the morning in the City-road, and my brother saw a bundle lay, and he called me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Did you know him before? - Never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Darkish? - No.</p>
               <p>Between light and dark? - At three in the morning it was day-light.</p>
               <p>The Prisoners called six witnesses, who gave them a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What length of time did you miss the sugar before the prisoners were taken up? - They were in the house on the Saturday, and on the Monday morning this was missed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman living at Stratford Place—on the evening of Boxing night, the 26th December, I was going to the Standard Theatre with my wife, my brother and his wife, and two friends—they left me to go to the Norfolk Hotel, and I was about to go to one of the stalls in the main road—my attention was called to several young chaps behind me, one said "George this hat does not seem to suit me to-night," and another one said "No"—I turned round to see if my hat was going to be taken from me, and as I did so I felt Lloyd's hand touch me, and then he laid hold of my chain—he was in front of me then—I put my hand up to my pocket to stop my watch from going, but he had got it out—I took hold of his collar and he threw me to the ground—while on the ground I was kicked by Lloyd under the right eye, and I received several kicks in the left shoulder and arm, and I can't do any work with it now—my coat was cut where I received the kick in the elbow—there was another one kicked me, and I believe that Sizeland kicked me—he tried to rescue Lloyd—I am not quite certain that he kicked me, my face was towards the ground—I held Lloyd and called out for my brother who was in the house—I held him till the constable came up and I gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. Williams. This was 5.30 in the evening—we were waiting to go to the theatre—there was a crowd—there were five men when I turned round when the remarks were passed about the hat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer at Sea bright Street, Bethnal Green—I was going towards the Standard Theatre about 5.30 on the evening of Boxing night—I saw four or five men standing round &amp; window—one of them, I believe it was Sizeland, took his hat off and said "George, I don't believe the hat seems to suit me somehow," and the others said "No it don't"—the prosecutor turned round and Lloyd snatched his watch-chain—he caught hold of Lloyd, and Lloyd threw him to the ground, and while he was on the ground he kicked him in the eye, and Sizeland came up and kicked him on the shoulder—the prosecutor called out to his brother "Soldier! soldier!" and his brother came to his assistance, and when they got to the public-house Sizeland came to the rescue of Lloyd—when the policeman came up Sizeland went away and Lloyd was taken into custody—I am positive Sizeland was the man who came up to the rescue.</p>

Soldier!" which is the name they call me on the water—I ran to my brother's assistance—he had got Lloyd by the neck—I seized Lloyd by the collar, and gave my. brother a chance to get up—he got on his feet and held Lloyd—when we got him towards the public-house door Sizeland came up and got hold of his coat and said "Let him go, he will stop till the policeman comes"—at that moment a policeman came up, and we gave Lloyd into custody.</p>

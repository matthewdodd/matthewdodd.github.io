I am the wife of Charles Boyd, of 19, North Bank, St. John's Wood—on 23rd June, about 10.40, I was in Grove Road, in company with Miss Dean, I saw two or three men approaching, the prisoner was one of them—as they passed one said to the other "Hold her tight"—he then, put his arm round my neck and cut my watch from my chain, I screamed out and put my hand to my throat and saved the chain, as I saw something flash—he ran away towards South Bank, he was afterwards caught in North Bank—the watch has not been found.</p>

I live at 59, Carlisle Street—at 10.40 on the night of the 13th I was in the Grove Road, I heard a scream of murder on the opposite side of the road underneath a lamp—I saw the prisoner with his arm round the lady's neck, dragging her to the ground—he then ran away towards South Bank; I followed, he doubled back and ran along North Bank; I followed him, I was about 20 yards behind him, he fell back in a gateway and pre-tended to be asleep—I accused him of stealing the lady's watch, he said "Me, I have just fell in here for a sleep, I have come from Camden Town"—I said "You are breathing too hard," and I took hold of him till the witnesses came up and identified him—before that I asked him what he had done with the watch—he said he gave it to his friend as he passed him in the Grove Road—I said "Then your friend must be found before you go"—he then said he threw it over a garden wall—the constable came up and I gave him into his hands—he tried to fight me and the other witness said "If you fight him I shall fight you."</p>

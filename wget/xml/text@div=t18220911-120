            . I live in Newby's-court, Spitalfields; the prisoner was my servant. I engaged with him on the 6th of August; I was to clothe and board him. He stopped with me two days, and then left me, with the coat, worth 2 s., which I had given him to wear, and a basket of sixteen dolls, worth 15 s. 11 d., which I had employed him to sell. He was taken on the 11th of August, at his father's. I asked him what he had done with my property; he said, he had them taken from him. I said,</p>
               <p>"Is it possible they could take coat and all?" He said, Yes.</p>

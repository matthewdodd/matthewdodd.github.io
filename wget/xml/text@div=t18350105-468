                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at Walworth. The prisoner was my errand-boy for eight weeks—on the 9th of December he was sent with twenty yards of kerseymere to Mr. Little's, in Leadenhall-street—it had been sent to us, but not approved of, and was to be returned—my son is in partnership with me—he sent the prisoner.</p>

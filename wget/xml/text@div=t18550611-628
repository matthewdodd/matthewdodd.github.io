                  </hi>. I am now a bookseller, carrying on business at 106, Great Russell-street, near the British Museum. I have known the prisoner about fourteen years, during which time I have been very inti<lb></lb>mate with him, and had great confidence in him—formerly I was not in the bookselling trade, but owing to matters between me and the prisoner, the house having been distrained for rent by the Duke of Bedford, I paid him out, and therefore became possessed of the business—it is my sole and entire business, I carried it on under the name of Atchley and Co.—my wife's maiden name was Atchley, and her sisters trustees, have advanced money to enable me to carry on the business—after I entered into the business, I entered into an engagement with the prisoner, and he undertook to get orders at 10 per cent, commission; and when they were obtained I delivered the orders to him to deliver to the customers; unless he had some of our own works when he had them out to show—publications which he had out with him he would sometimes sell—last Dec. a gentleman called on me to in<lb></lb>quire about a copy of Roberta's "Holy Land"—I understood that his name was Brocklehurst, and told the prisoner that he had better see him—he told me that he had called on him, and ascertained that it was not he who had called, but that he had become a customer—he is a member of Parliament, and lives in Milk-street, Cheapside—the prisoner said that he had bought two copies of Digby Wyatt's book, value eight guineas each—I believed his statement to be true, and delivered to him the two copies for</p>

               <p>Mr. Brocklehurst—a day or two after that, the prisoner left a memorandum for me, a further order from Mr. Brocklehurst, who, he said, had given a further order for two copies of "Belgian Architecture, "two copies of Roberts's "Holy Land, "and two copies of Finden's "British Gallery of Art"—the value of those six books was 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the after part of this account book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my writing; I have written underneath the order at the same time—in Dec. the prisoner came to me and said that the Earl of Bradford wished to see a coloured copy of the "Holy Land," to compare it with his own, as he wished to show it to a lady who wanted a copy—I had one copy in stock which I gave to him to deliver to the Earl of Brad<lb></lb>ford; it was arranged that the price was to be 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as it was rather scarce; it was worth that—on 5th Jan., the prisoner desired me to enter it to the Earl of Bradford, and he would pay for it—I have not seen that book since, and have not been paid for it—on Oct. 30th, 1854, the prisoner had one volume of the "Holy Land," to show to Lord Calthorpe, and brought me the order, that Lord Calthorpe would take it at 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I did not see it again till I found it at Mr. Sutherland's, the bookseller's—(I had sent it to Lord Calthorpe by the prisoner and a young man named Henry Smith, in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—about Nov., 1854, the prisoner brought me word that Mr. Leaf, of Old; 'Change, had recommended Mr. Cotton to purchase books, and also a Mr. Gurney; he then brought me an order from Mr. Cotton for "Naah's Wind<lb></lb>sor," coloured, value 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., publishing price; but he said that he had engaged to sell it at 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—afterwards he gave me a further order from Mr. Cotton, and an order from Mr. Gurney, of No. 7, St. James's-square, a friend of Mr. Leafs—in Jan. 1855, the prisoner ordered for Mr. Cotton, a copy of Finden's "Gallery of Art, "a coloured copy of "Mexico," and the "Land-Steward; "this memorandum that I am looking at is not in my writing, but I saw it at the time it was, written, it is a day book which I refer to hour by hour; the date I am looking at is Nov. 30th—the prisoner gave me an order for an original copy of Roberts's "Holy Land, "in four volumes, in reference to Mr. Cotton—he said that Mr. Cotton wished to present it to Mr. Hubbard; the name of Hubbard is put here over Cotton, and the pri<lb></lb>soner had the books for that purpose, the value of them is 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he also brought an order on 6th Nov., alleging it to come from Mr. Cotton, for two copies of Finden's "Gallery of Art" one plain and one India—the prisoner has been transacting business for a gentleman named Meesom—I have an entry here on 21st Nov., from which I remember that the prisoner had ordered a copy of a work on Belgium, value eight guineas, some time before I had got it—he said that Mr. Meesom also wanted a copy for Sir Charles Barry—on 23rd Nov. the prisoner said that Mr. Laws had ordered a copy of "Belgian Architecture and Sculpture, "the value of that is eight guineas—here is the entry—on 6th Dec he ordered a copy of the same work for Earl de Grey, and it was handed to him—since the investigation I have seen all the books that are in this list but one, Digby Wyatt's—I discovered this by writing for the account to Mr. Leaf, Mr. Brocklehurst, and one or two more, and in consequence of the replies I received, I spoke to the prisoner; either the same day or the day following; it was about the 5th Feb.—I said, "Mr. Brocklehurst and Mr. Leaf have written to me, that they have no accounts, and have nothing owing"—he said, "There must be some mis<lb></lb>take, I will go and see them"—I received a letter from Captain Leland, and about 7th Feb. met the prisoner in the street, and told him that I had received a letter from a gentleman, and had been with it to Messrs. Cox and Greenwood's, to see the secretary to Captain Leland, showed him the</p>

               <p>letter, and that he said it was a forgery—he at first denied it; he said, "No, it is not;" he afterwards said, "Come with me, and I will make you all the recompense "or "reparation I can"—I went with him to his house, in Berners-street—he said nothing going along, but when he got there he told his wife that he had used me very ill, and he wished to give up all that he had got; he went out of the house for a short time and brought back a quantity of duplicates which he gave me, merely saying that he had not used me well, and that was all he had to give me—in a day or two he came to my warehouse, and I asked him to go over the book with me, and say who it was that did owe me, that I might not write to them, and ask for what was not due—he did so, and said that the order he had given me from Lord Calthorpe was false; and as regarded Mr. Cotton, Mr. Leaf, Mr. Brocklehurst, Lord de Grey, Mr. Meesom, and Lord Bradford, the same; and that all others which he had given me were false—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of the duplicates I received from him; some of them relate to these particular books—the amount he has had upon them is about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi> by <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he unable to pay them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They had no claim on him—I bought his share—it was not the debt he owed them that I bought up—I will show you the deed (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I was not a sharer with the prisoner in the costs and profits of this work—I was with Danby and Bogue—the prisoner had a share in it before I purchased it, but not afterwards—I had to pay the amount to get the property—the partnership between the prisoner and Bust took place in 1845—1 sold the business in Great Russell-street to the prisoner and Rust in 1845, for l,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I believe—500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for the good will and stock—I had wished him to take it himself—he left the shop after six months, and went into the Strand, and I kept the shop on in my name at first, and after that in the name of Atchley and Co.—the name was changed because they made me a director in the Parcel Post Company, and had proceeded against me on that account—I did not apply under the Insolvent Act then, or at any time—I did pay the amount, and on that I put up the name of Atchley and Co.—they were not my debts, but they persecuted me, and I paid them—the prisoner and Rust carried on business in the Strand about four years, I think—during that time they published thousands of volumes, and thousands of pounds' worth of works—the prisoner is well known to all the publishers in London—he has always been a bookseller—after the prisoner and Rust ceased to be booksellers, the prisoner came to me, in Great Russell-street, and saw me—(while I was in Great Russell-street, and they in the Strand, they purchased of me, but I did not purchase of them; I could not, because I had sold them the good will—I gave a bond not to carry on bookselling within a certain range while they were in business)—he came to me; and said that he wished to come back again, and sell on commission—no agreement was made at that time—I did not instruct an attorney to make an agreement between myself Miss Emma Atchley, and the prisoner—the prisoner said that he had instructed an attorney to make an agreement—I saw it, and refused it—I made certain corrections—I carried on the business; Miss Atchley had nothing to do with it—it was "Atchley and Co." over the door—she had at that time given money to the carrying on Of the business—my father-in-law had no share in the business, nor had my sister; the whole firm was myself—there was not an arrangement that she was to advance money, and that I and Williams were to pay her so much—it was not understood that it was to be so; she could not advance money without the consent of the trustee—money was advanced to me by the trustee—the prisoner was not to pay interest as well as myself—when I commenced a second time with the prisoner it was in Great Russell-street—he was in the habit of taking out books, and so was one other person—the prisoner sold books and took orders—he had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, on all he sold—I paid him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent very often when he brought me the money—I carried on business in this way from 1850 to 1855—if the prisoner sold in cash he has had his 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, at the time, or it was entered so much less—I have paid him various amounts in cash; my books will show—I cannot say what I paid him in cash the first year, because I paid him at the time—I have given him a bill for his services once to accommodate him—the amount of it was 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—that was the only bill I paid him for his services—he was a married man—he lived not a great way from me—he, and I, and our wives, were very inti<lb></lb>mate—he used to come to the shop in the morning, and sometimes again in the evening—the first thing done was to see what books he would take</p>

               <p>to show—some of the noblemen who have been named, were on my books and I had known the prisoner to serve some of them during the first two or three years of his being with me—on those occasions I had received the money from the prisoner, but it was entered to the party whom he received it from—the cost price of the "Belgium" is 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I sold it for eight guineas—the real cost price was not 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the "Holy Land" was published at 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the difference between the cost and the selling price is 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent—sometimes as much as 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, is made on old books—I have never reckoned how many books were sold in this way by the prisoner in the course of the year—one of these accounts was upwards of twelve months, and the other six months—there was a settlement of accounts in 1853—I would not give any more commissions to the prisoner until the accounts were paid to me, but I continued at intervals to advance to his wife certain sums of money—no agreement was come to—after 1853 the business was carried on in the same way—during that period bills were not sent in to customers in the name of Williams, that I am aware of—I never sued a person named flower, in the County Court, in the name of Williams—I recollect the morning when certain duplicates were handed over to me by the prisoner—it was at his house—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the books which I have refreshed my memory by—no part of this agreement is in my writing, but the pencil marks are—I have seen it before—(This was entitled, "Minutes of an intended agreement to be made between Emma Atchley and John Willams, (as soon as the latter shall have obtained his certificate;) Richard Allen and R.

               <p>once only—it is in pledge now—I cannot say whether it has been pledged since 1853—it has been renewed every six months—the prisoner's last resi<lb></lb>dence was in Berners-street—he had a house there—I pat the furniture in, 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, and odd—I have had the furniture since—the prisoner had no other way of living besides what he received from me, that I am aware of, except letting his house to lodgers—he had money on account of me—I have received payment from him for part of the furniture—there was so much a week, amounting to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not still retain the furniture, the upholsterer had it back again—I had given him my acceptance for it—I paid him so much, and settled the rest by his taking the furniture back—he happens to be a tenant of my wife's.</p>

I produce a work called "Nash's Windsor Castle," pledged in Dec. last, by a man named Canham—I asked him some questions, and he referred me to the prisoner—I went to see him, and asked him if it was his property; he said, "Yes"—other books were pledged in Oct., Nov., and Dec, amounting to 117<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—T have one here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

Southgate's—those are the books I sent to Lord Calthorpe's—this is No. 4,601 of "Belgium," and is what I sent to Earl de Grey—I have seen Nos. 4,602 and 4,603 also; those are what I sent to Mr. Brocklehurst—I have seen a copy of "Finden's Gallery," No. 4,577 of the "Land Steward," and a copy of "Nash's Windsor"—those are what I sent to Mr. Cotton—I have seen No. 4,993 of Belgium; I sent that to Mr. Meesom—I have also seen No. 4,600 of "Belgium"—I am able to say that none of these books have been paid for.</p>

                  </hi>. About 30th Oct. I accompanied the prisoner to Lord Calthorpe's house—we left there six volumes of the "Holy Land and Nubia," coloured—we did not bring it away again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you accompanied Williams to other places with books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he has on some occasions left books, and called for them afterwards—I am aware of his selling books in that way—I was in Mr. Sprigg's employment in 1841, when he first had the business—I have seen the prisoner pay Mr. Sprigg money, and represent it as coming from the parties that the books went to—Mr. Sprigg has not, to my knowledge, spoken of the way in which business was done in Williams's absence—in speaking of a book, when I have said, "Who has had it?" Mr. Sprigg has not said, "John Stiles, or anybody," and told me to put it down, saying; "Never mind, Williams will pay for it"—I have heard him say that Williams would pay for it, and receive his commission on it—this paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is, I think, relative to some cash which Mr. Bailey received for Williams—this other paper is in my writing—I believe I have received 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Williams for books which had been entered to parties in some irregularity, and he paid me, and pot it to the parties' account, which was debited in the books—books were never pawned by Williams during the time I was at Mr. Sprigg's—I never pawned any for Mr. Sprigg, or Mr. Williams—I have done such a thing for myself, a book of my own—I have never owned books higher than 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I have done that six or seven times in eleven or twelve years—I know a person named Shoredrag, and recollect his giving me an acceptance—he did not pay it when it became due—Williams was not called upon to pay it—I think he sued in the Bloomsbury County Court, in the name of Emma Atchley—Williams had not afterwards to pay the money on the acceptance which I received from Shoredrag, because I put an execution in, and obtained the money—Williams had nothing to pay in money—I believe he paid it in commission, which forms part of the present entries before the Court, because Shoredrag repre<lb></lb>sented that he bad had the books, and he said that he did not receive them—I recollect a man named Flower, a customer of my master's; he was in debt three guineas to my master in July, 1853—I sued him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you sue him in the name of Williams? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Flower repudi<lb></lb>ated the account, and said that he purchased them of Williams, in Dec, 1853—Williams brought us the money as if it came from Flower—I know that he repudiated Atchley's invoice, and sued him in Williams's name—I recollect applying to Professor Hall, at King's College, for an amount for books, and afterwards ascertained from Mr. Guolf, there, that he had returned the books.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask Williams for the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I first of all stated that they repudiated the accounts, and afterwards I took Williams's acceptance—I believe these two promissory notes are renewals—I think the original of this was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe they were paid on their being given up——sometimes it was my duty when I took money to give receipts; but when Williams paid me money, I often credited the parties themselves—(<hi rend="italic">receipts read</hi>: "May 18, 1854.

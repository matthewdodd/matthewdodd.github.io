               <p>Q. Did you give your wife any bank notes or money on the 19th of August. - A. Yes; I delivered to her all the bank notes I was in possession of; there were four ten pound notes, two five pound notes (all of them bank of England notes), and a country note of five pounds; and there were some small notes, but I could not ascertain what quantity there was. The prisoner was the only person present when I delivered them to her; I gave them to her in the small bar; he saw me give them to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You have got a sum of money that was returned to you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. The notes were not sent to you by the prisoner. - A. Not that I know of; they were sent by somebody, I do not know who sent them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Do you know the prisoner. - A. I have known the prisoner some time; he is the proprietor of the Brentford coach as well as the driver.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether he has not bore a respectable character. - A. I never found otherwise.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. On this Wednesday when you gave your wife the notes, I believe you went out upon some foot race. - A. That is quite irrelevant to the question.</p>
               <p>Q.On that Wednesday you left home. - A. Yes. I returned the next day, Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. The race was on the Wednesday evening, where was that race. - A.On the road to Bath.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe on your return you met the prisoner. - A. I must have met him, but I did not see him. The moment I went home, I learned from my wife of the loss.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the prisoner that evening. - A. I did. I went to Kew bridge; I spoke to him on the subject.</p>
               <p>Q. He took out all the money he had in notes and offered them you. - A. He pulled out some, but whether he pulled out all I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not claim them as yours. - A. No, I had a higher opinion of the man.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner came to your house that evening. - A. So. I heard from my wife after I had seen him at the bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was announced to attend at Bow-street. - A. He was, the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. He was discharged them, and he came the second time voluntarily. - A.He was discharged through my interference.</p>
               <p>Q. But he kept his word and came again. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you gave your notes to your wife in a small bar, and he was with you. - A. He was. She put them in a box, which was her custom prior to my being married to her, for many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that she put them into a box immediately. - A. I do, while the prisoner at the bar was with me; he saw it, I am sure, or else I would not say it.</p>

Yes, four ten's, and two five pound bank notes, and a Bristol note for five pound; and the prisoner stood close by the drawer in which I put them in, and I put them immediately in the drawer and locked them up, and in the evening I put in four or five pounds in silver; there was nobody there but my husband, myself, and Mr. Weston.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you occasion to open that drawer. - A. About four o'clock the same day. I was going to put some silver in the box, the coach came up to the door, I put the drawer too, with the key in it; I went to serve a glass of liquor to a man that came in with

               <p>Q. Did you go out of the bar. - A. No, the man wanted a glass of gin; he came to the door of the bar, he did not come in the bar. Weston came to the spot where the drawers were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any part of the time that you lost sight of the man. - A. I went to the corner of the bar to give the man change for a shilling that had the gin; when he had got the change he went away immediately. While I was giving change I heard a rustling; I said to Weston, what are you about; the table linen and books fell down, they were placed on the top of the drawers; Mr. Weston went out immediately; on his going out he clapped his hand to his coat. I said why do you come in to knock my things down; I picked up my books, I went to put the silver in the box in the drawer; I found the property gone. It was all done in about four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. How was the drawer, open or shut when you went to put your money in. - A. It was shut, but the key was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found it out did you call to him. - A. No, I found he was gone; I sent to an opposite neighbour, Mr. Fletcher.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. This was the day after the race from London to Bath. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to be positive that there was no other person in the bar on the afternoon of that day besides the prisoner. - A. Not at the time he was there; he was only there a few minutes while the gentleman had a glass of gin, and I gave him change for a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not put your silver in during the time that he was there. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not some persons in the bar who had been seeing the race at the time he was there. - A. Not exactly at the time he was there; there was no other person there while he was there but another man at the bar; there were two or three men came in from the coach, but not in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not the prisoner come in the presence of some other persons and speak to you about the loss of the money. - A.

            . - Mr. Const. Q. What are you. - A. I am out of business at present, I live opposite Mrs. Lingard; she sent her servant who said she wanted to speak to me, I went over, she informed me that she had been robbed; I went to Kew-bridge to endeavour if I could learn any thing of the robbery, and in consequence of information from Mr. Smith I went down to the water side; I met the prisoner his carriage stood at the bridge with the horses heads towards the water; he was returning from the water. I said Weston how do you do, nodded to me and immediately went into Mr. Dunn's stable yard and set upon a place that is erected upon a dunghill. When he came out of there, Mr. Lingard came down and accused him of robbing him; Weston said he had not, and he was very willing that Mr. Lingard might search him; Mr. Lingard did not search him - Mr. Lingard and I went down to the water-side to see if we could find any of the property; we could not. I advised him to apply to a Bow-street officer; we went up to the turnpike-gate, and afterwards Bacon the officer came in about three quarters of an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you after that at any time go to the water side. - A. I went with the officer to the water side where I saw Weston come from; we went into a market garden this side of the water, there I found the bottom of a paper box. We there discovered two more pieces: I took them to Mrs. Lingard, she said it was part of the box that the property was in. The pieces of box were afterward given to Bacon the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The coach had stopped at Kew bridge some short time before you got there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The passengers had left the coach. - A. I saw no passengers.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way they went, or whether they went into the market-garden, you cannot tell. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was this market garden that you speak of; I understood it to be of the left hand side of Kew-bridge from London. - A. Yes before you get to Kew-bridge you turn round to the left hand.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first went to Kew-bridge you saw the prisoner coming from the water side - was that on the right hand side. - A. No, on the left; the same side as the market garden is.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of that garden did you pick up these pieces. - A. About two yards from the wall in the garden; the wall parts the garden ground from the road.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. There is a path-way by the side of it.</p>

When the coach got to the Roebuck at Turnham-green it was four o'clock; we stopped there, I was outside passenger, but when a storm of rain came, one got out, and I went in; the inside was full; that was this side of Turnham-green; two the coach stopped at the Roebuck Turnham-green; two of the passengers went out; I knew one of them, his name is Parker, we went in the bar, and Parker wrote a note; the third passenger went in the bar;

             the coachman went into the bar first, he was standing by the side of the fire place when I went in; and there was a thin elderly man. Mrs. Lingard doing of. - A. She was talking about the race; and serving her customers; she mixed a glass of brandy and water, and gave it to the coachman. I perceived that she never measured it; she put it into the glass, I said to Parker, that the landlady gave more for sixpence, then I could get for a shilling; she was all of a tremble; she drawed a glass of ale for the other passenger, and a glass of gin for me; I was in the bar about eight or ten minutes, and there were four or five coming in and out. The coachmen set on the right side of the fire, and the thin man on the left hand; the thin man was not a passenger. Parker sat in the left hand corner of the bar; the coachman asked the landlady of the house, if she knew the thin elderly man that she was talking to about the wager; she gave him four-pence out of his sixpence he said they will not do, he put them back; the coachman I think, came out first; we all nearly came out together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing falling in the bar. - A. There was not a thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any person has talked that there was only the coachman in the bar, that is a mistake, because you are certain that there were four in the bar altogether. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160018"></xptr>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. What day are you speaking of. - A. The wager was decided, Thursday, the 20th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Any particular reasoning for recollecting the day of the month. - A. I was going with Mr. Snowden a grocer, he had a little bill.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the man before. - A. I did not know the man at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You went away from the coach, how came you to hear any thing of the coachman. - A. I heard of him at night; I was at Kew bridge; I went so far home that night; I heard he was accused.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know it was your coachman. - A. They told me it was the coachman that I come down with; the landlady of the Star and Garter told us so; she saw me come out of the coach, the coach was about twenty yards from her door; she was out talking to a young woman.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you hear about the coachman. - A. They accused him of taking the money, I said I stopped there; I think it was impossible for it to be done; they said they had been after him they were suspicious that he had done it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Why did you say it could not be done. - A. Because I think it impossible, when so many people were there; there were four or five people there.</p>
               <p>Q. What size bar is it. - A. A largish bar; it is on the right hand side, as you go into the house; the bar would hold a dozen people, according to what I see of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did Mr. Weston find you out to be a witness. - A. The day before yesterday, by Mr. Parker mentioning of it.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PARKER. - Mr. Alley. You have seen Mr. Rice the last witness. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect accompanying him to Kew-bridge on the coach that was driven by the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you. - A. I am constable, beadle, and a shoemaker.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect going on to the prosecutor's house. - A. I recollect it very well; I went into the house, there were two or three there; there was another gentlemen besides Mr. Rice; the coachman went in first, I wrote a few lines there in the bar. I went there yesterday, for the purpose of enquiring whether it was the bar or not. As soon as I had done my writing they were all ready; the coach went off.</p>

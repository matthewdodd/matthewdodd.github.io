                  </hi>. I am servant to William Harris, of Foley-place, in the parish of Marylebone. I have known the prisoner about five years—he came to our house on the 10th of August, 1836, between eight and nine o'clock, to see if there was any job wanting to be done—he is a carpenter—I had a box, which had something the matter with the lock—it contained</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183710230183"></xptr>
               <p>twenty sovereigns, in my purse—I saw it two or three days before he came to me—I had not lost the key, only I was turning it, and it would not open—I gave it him to open—he took something out of his pocket to I open it—I left him for a few minutes in the kitchen opening it, while I went to answer the door—on my return I met him coming up stairs—he said nothing to me, but went out—when I went down I found the box open, and the money and purse gone—I have lost it entirely; nobody else could have taken it.</p>

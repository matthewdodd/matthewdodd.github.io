The witness, Foort, had been six or seven weeks in my service - Stiff hired him, and caused him to be discharged. Foort charged Stiff with stealing hay. I said then I was satisfied it was not true, and was ready to give him every assistance to punish the boy for so false a charge. About two days after Stiff took a warrant out against him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. The charge for stealing hay was made by Foort, after Stiff took him before a Magistrate for an assault - A. No: he informed me of it two days before.</p>

            . I was stable-boy in Mr. Alston's service. The first week I went into his service, about six o'clock in the morning, I saw a cart drawn up to the loft-door, and hay pushed into it - I did not see Lucy with the cart then, but have seen him three times with it before, at the same place. Stiff put three or four trusses of hay into it, apparently - nobody but him had an opportunity of doing it - the loft communicates with his bedroom. When the cart drove away, some hay was scattered over the ground, and Stiff swept it up to the dunghill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you come from before you lived with Mr. Alston - A. I came from Ruslip parish, but had only been in town a short time. I told Mr. Alston I had lately come from the country.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard you was to be discharged, did you not use violent language to Stiff - A. No: I only d - d him, and said I would talk to his master, and then I should be sure to do him. I made no charge against him before, because I thought he had got me the place.</p>

            . I am uncle to the last witness, and in the service of Mr. Ricardo, whose stable-door is exactly opposite Mr. Alston's. I have seen a cart there once, or twice, early in the morning - hay was put into it, and it was trod down - the cart was filled. Stiff pushed it out of the loft into the cart, - it was rubbishing, loose hay, not trussed.</p>

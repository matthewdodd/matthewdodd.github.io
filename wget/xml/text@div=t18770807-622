                  </hi>. I am a medical student, of 88, Newman Street, Oxford Street—on 12th July, about 12.40 a.m., I called at a stationer's shop facing Middlesex Hospital—I had left a bottle there for some oil to replenish my lamp—the three prisoners came in with another man and the prisoners called for some lemonade and wanted me to toss them for some cigars—Thomas, the cabman, made offensive remarks about my trowsers and said that I was like a shoeblack—I took no notice and he pushed his black felt hat in my face—I told him if he did that again I should hit him—he pushed his hat again in my face and I pushed him back—he then hit me with the glass out of which he was drinking lemonade—we got out into the street—Williams held me on one side and Thompson on the other—the one who escaped held me round the waist while Thomas was attacking me—Thomas struck me, and directly they let go of me I put my hand to my pocket and my watch was gone, which was safe five minutes before; I pulled it out in the shop when Thomas asked me the time——I called "Stop thief!" and the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187708070024"></xptr>
               <p>prisoners went away as quick as they could—Williams was at the corner of a street and said "The man who has got the watch has gone down that way"—Thomson jumped on the cab to drive it away—Thomas drove by the side of it, and the witness Bower turned it back—I went to the station and gave the prisoners in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FRITH</hi>. I had been to see some friends—I did not hear Thomas ask a man to hold his horse, I was inside the shop—when Thomas put his hat in <hi rend="italic">ray</hi> face I said I would throw him over the railings if he did it again—he said that he was <hi rend="italic">Young Hundreds</hi>—he hit me across my face with the glass and cut my lip—after that we went into the street—I <hi rend="italic">squared</hi> up at him and he struck at me many times; that did not last half a minute, because I was seized by the other people—I did not hear the cabman say he had lost his hat and must look for it, as a policeman was coming and he should be summonsed for loitering.</p>

Thomas cut my lip and I got the lemonade over me—I did not strike him outside till he struck me—I was in the shop nearly ten minutes before the prisoners came in and ten minutes afterwards—I did not hear the expression "There goes your cab," or "They are driving your cab off"—one policeman came first and another afterwards—one took Thompson and the other Williams—one policeman told me to get into the cab and Thomas drove me half way to the station and then said he would not go further unless I paid him his fare—he was on the box when he said that; I do not know whether he said that through the square hole—I then got out and walked to the station—I do not know how Thomas got into, the station, but he was watched—the acting inspector heard my charge and said "Do you charge the cabman as well?"—the cabman was the acting one of the lot—I made the charge against him first—I did not feel any one touch my watch.</p>

               <p>struck him with the lemonade glass across the lips-—they tusled and got outside—I went outside but not near them—I saw the other three holding Dixon while Thomas was punching him—when they let go of him the man not in custody ran away, and directly afterwards I heard Dixon say "My watch is gone"—I ran as far as Union Street but could see nothing of him, but Williams ran out—I saw a constable run from Tottenham Street, and then Williams said that the man who had run away had gone up Union Street—I omitted to mention that when Thompson saw the other man run, away he got up and drove the cab off—another witness ran after him, followed him as far as How Street, and caught him—they at last all came back except the third man—some constables came up; one took Williams and another took the other two—I went to the station and heard the charge made.</p>

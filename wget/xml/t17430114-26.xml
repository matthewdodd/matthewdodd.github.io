               <p>Daniel Bridge The Prisoner came to live with me in February last, and left me in July, and I have not seen her since, till I took her this Day se'nnight; I missed the Things while the Prisoner lived in my House; there is the Soosee in Court which Mrs Witts had of her, and she owned she pawned the Ring to Mr. Martin, and he produced it and said he had it of Mrs. Carr.</p>

            . Some time in February last, that unhappy Woman, the Prisoner, brought me a Piece of Scofee: I did not care to buy it; but at her Request I lent her half a Guinea upon it. Mr Bridge owned it to be his.</p>

            . The Prisoner brought this Ring to me to pawn; she said she wanted a little Money to buy something: I asked her, whether it was her own? She said, Yes, and that a Gentleman had made her a Present of it. I lent her a Guinea and an Half upon it, and did not know before this Day se'nnight that it was not her own Property.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I did not design to steal it. I never intended to defraud them. Here are Ladies in Court whom I have lived with, that will say I never wronged them of any thing; but I was distressed to pay for my Child's Nursing, and I pledged the Ring to do it, being deceived by some Friends. Mr. Martin, you have known me a great many Years, did I ever bring any thing to you that was not my own before?</p>

               <p>Martin. No, never that I know of.</p>

            . I have known the Prisoner ever since she was six Years of Age: She had a virtuous Education in her Grandfather's Family, who was a Minister: I have trusted her with a great deal, and never found she wronged me of any thing. I have a great Value for her, and so had the Prosecutor; but now she is poor, and her Money gone, they are turned against her: She is a Widow, and hath a Child to provide for. Kath. Louch gave her the Character of a very honest Person. <rs id="t17430114-26-verdict138" type="verdictDescription">

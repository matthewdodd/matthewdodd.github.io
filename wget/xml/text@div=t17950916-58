               <p>I am the officer of Hackney; after the prosecutor had lost the watch, he sent down to my house; I then went and pursued after the man, and I took him in the corn field, under the hedge, near Clapton; I believe it was about five o'clock; when I went to him I asked him where the watch was? he said, what watch I said, the watch of his shopmate; I insisted on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160165"></xptr>his giving it me, and he then put his hand into his pocket and gave it me immediately, and I have kept it ever since.(Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He let me have the care of the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It never was in his care, I am perfectly sure I never lent it him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he and you worked together? - Three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. To Bayley. When you see him did he say he had no watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to the field? - I had some suspicion by his being a same man, that he would not go to London, and so I pursued him down the field.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When Mr. Bayley came to me, he asked me what I was doing there? I said I went out to take the air; he said where is the watch? I said, here it is in my fob, and I gave it to him. I am perfectly innocent.</p>

I did not miss them till the next day. They were cut in single yards for a particular use: they were cut the 9th in the morning, and tied up together.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any of them since?</p>
               <p>Evans. I was at Justice Welch's, and was there shewed five pieces, that is, five yards; but they had been washed, so I cannot say they are the identical pieces.</p>

            . I, the prisoner, and another (not taken) went out on the 9th of August, between two and three in the afternoon, to take a walk. The prisoner went into a shop in Bond-street, there she brought out three muslin handkerchiefs, and a silk and cotton one. After that she went into the prosecutor's shop in Oxford-road, and asked me to go in with her. She brought out six yards of cloth in six pieces, tied up with a piece of packthread, under her apron; I think it was Irish. Then we went to Mrs. Flyn's shop; we sold her them, and five yards of cloth, for 10 s. 6 d. for the whole. We had the money between us; after she had bought them, she said they should not be known, for she would put them in water, and wash them directly. I saw five yards of them afterwards at the Justice's; the other yard was lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She carried the cloth in herself, and took the money for it. I was in the street at the time.</p>
               <p>Jones. We both went in together; she had it tied up in a silk and cotton handkerchief. I took and opened it, and shewed it to Mrs. Flyn.</p>

            . I keep a sale-shop in Monmouth-street. The prisoner and Jones came with the pieces of cloth. I bought them of Jones, and paid the money to her; half a guinea. There were five yards of cloth, and three muslin handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the cloth?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Had it been in the piece, it might have been worth 18 d. a yard; but as it was cut in pieces, it was not worth half the money.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Flyn. I said I should wash them before I made them up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Coming from my mother's, I happened to meet this Jones in the street, she asked me to go and drink a pint of beer; I went in with her and drank; after that she asked me to go with her to Monmouth-street; I asked her what for; she said she was going to a house to do a little business. She went in at Mrs. Flyn's house, at a back door, and pulled this cloth out of her pocket. I had none of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jones. What door did you go in at?</p>
               <p>Jones. We went in at a back-door.</p>

               <p>Court. Was that horse that you found at Dinmore's your horse? - Yes, he had a mark on the round bone by the hips, where he had been find, and I knew him by that; I had had him a year, or a year and a half, he was a black horse, with a long switch tail; on the Monday morning I made affidavit to my horse, and the man was brought out of the New Gaol to me before Justice Blackborough, I told him I know nothing of you, I only know I have lost my horse; he said before the Justice he bought him at Kingston, I said it cannot be, because it was in my custody on Wednesday; no, Sir, says he, it was on Wednesday that I bought him; says I that cannot be, the horse could not travel so far.</p>

               <p>Being informed about a horse, I went to Sharpe's-alley, and there I saw the witness Shovel with the horse, not the prisoner; I then told him when I saw the horse, says I, I believe that is a stolen horse, I insist upon it you do not boil him; his master a horse boiler, then we went into Smithfield, and there the prisoner was apprehended; Shovel shewed the prisoner to me, he said he came from over the water, I told him I would take him in custody till I sent a person over the water, then he said it was fourteen miles off, it was at Kingston, or near that; the horse that Atwood found at my house afterwards was the same that was in the possession of Shovel.</p>

               <p>Court. Is not this horse worth more than twenty-two shillings? - I reckon he is worth about thirty shillings, or one guinea and a half.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He was a horse almost worn out, he might be worth a guinea and half, he was a horse of no value at all.</p>

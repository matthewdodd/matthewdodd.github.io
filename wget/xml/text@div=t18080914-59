            . I am a publican, I live at the Horse and Groom, King street, Seven Dials. On the 13th of August in the evening, the prisoner and a woman came in with some oysters, he pulled out some bank notes, the woman asked him where he got all that money; he did not seem to wish to give an answer; the woman insisted on knowing where he got the notes from; he burst out a crying, he said he had robbed his master of sixty one pounds; I made him turn his pockets out. Here are the notes that were produced at that time.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went with some company to Sadler's wells; we went to a public house, where I had something to drink; when we came out I went home with them; one of them gave me a night's lodging, two of them were brothers. In the morning we went out to a public house by Bedfordbury, we changed one of these five pound notes; when we came back again one of the young men said he would have nothing to do with the notes, because they were stolen. I had a ten pound note in my hand, one of the young men asked me for it, I gave it him, he went off. In the afternoon we went to a public house, where the young man got the ten pound note changed; they said he had been gone about half an hour. The next morning I saw him, I asked him if he had changed it, he said yes, he asked me whether I would have a guinea of it; I said no. There was a man snatched a two pound note out of my hand; I went into Mr. Patrick's house, I had something to drink, I had a five pound note; a young man said he knew Adam Patrick very well; I changed the five pound note there, he kept two pounds for himself, the young man did; they kept me drunk all the time. I went in the house with a woman, a young man came in and asked me if I had robbed my master. A constable was fetched, and I was taken.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Dockyard Constable</hi>). I am on duty at Woolwid Arsenal—I know Fair, a labourer in the Arsenal, working in the store department, where the candles and soap are dealt with—he has recently been working at the place where the candles are packed—on labourers leaving the Arsenal, a policeman stands at the gate to touch them, and they are seached in the lobby as they leave work—the prisoner belongs to the working corps attached to the Arsenal—it was his duty to mark the cases sent out from the place where the candles were—that was the same place where Farr was working—the prisoner was provided with a military cloak—he would not be liable to be searched, nor would persons going in and out at that particular part—I know Farr personally—on Sunday morning, 7th April, I was at the Woolwich Arsenal Railway station about ten o'clock, and saw Sarah Cathway carrying a parcel to the down train for Gravesend—I examined her parcel, it contained sixteen paraffin candles—I went to her brother-in-law, Farr, at 32, Waterman's Fields, Woolwich—I knew that he lived there—I saw him and his wife there—I searched their premises and found 205 stearine candles, 25 1/2 lbs. of soap, and other articles—Farr is not a prisoner now—he went with me to 2, Walpole Place, Wool<lb></lb>wich, which is about twenty yards from Waterman's Fields—the prisoner occupied the second floor there; he came in while I was there—the land<lb></lb>lord lives there, but not in that room—he is married, I saw his wife on the first floor—the second floor front is occupied by the prisoner and his wife—I found two boxes, one over the other, placed as a table, with a covering over them—I removed the top box and found a box underneath containing caudles and soap very neatly packed away, under which were two large parcels of brown paper containing 133 stearine candles, 103 moulds, 88 paraffin, and 42lb. soap (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); the stearine and mould candles and soap found at Farr's were the same quality as those found at the prisoner's—the pri<lb></lb>soner came into the room, and I said,"I have found these candles and soap</p>

               <p>in your room, I have also found a great quantity at Farr's house; he states that you brought them out of the Arsenal and gave them to him; how do you account for those which were found in your room?" (Farr was present)—the prisoner said, "Oh! I can account for this"—I said, "I think there has been a System of robbery carried on for a long time in stealing these from the Arsenal; I am a police officer, you must consider yourself in my custody, you will go with me to the Arsenal"—he said, "Very well," but in the confusion of moving the boxes of stores a great number of people assembled and the prisoner ran away—I kept Farr in custody, took him before a Magistrate, and he pleaded guilty—I tried to find the prisoner from Sunday up to Tuesday morning—I went back to the place where he lived with his wife, but could not see him; I also sent other people there—he was not in the Arsenal, and was returned as a deserter from his regiment—on the Tuesday I traced him to 93, Upper John Street, Clerken-well, where I found him in bed about eight a.m.; I said, "I have got you at last; why did you make your escape? you had better have stopped and, defended your case in the best way you could"—he said, "You came so quick upon me, I wanted time to consider; in fact, I should hare been out at the window now, if I had had half a chance, before you got me; I decline answering any further questions, because I know you will use it in evidence against me"—I took him in custody and brought him to Wool wich—he said, at his house, when Farr was there, that he had had these candles and soap some two or three years ago.</p>

                  </hi>. I have charge of the stores in the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, where Farr and the prisoner worked—candles and soap of precisely the same description as these were in the stores—soap is missing, but I cannot exactly say the quantity—the candles were being packed for abroad—53,0001b. of stearine and mould candles have been sent in since September—stearine candles are not a modern manufacture, they have been I in some years; paraffin candles are rather more modern, but they have been in some few years—this soap is marked "Hearns's Soap Works"—Mr. Hearns is our contractor, and I believe he is the manufacturer also—I took stock at the commencement of October, knowing that I had a large quantity coming in, and once or twice since—since this occurrence I have taken stock again and find no deficiency, because I reckoned that the full amount of candles have gone abroad—that does not apply to the soap—there is a deficiency of seventy or eighty pounds in the soap—Farr and the prisoner worked in other stores besides mine—the prisoner was a marker in the same store.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any bank notes - A. I have lost bank notes at different times; I do not know who had taken them; I rather suspected the prisoner that he was spending more money than was his own. One day I saw the key in his box; I opened it; I saw some one-pound notes in it, with my own hand writing upon the notes, I can say no further then on four one-pound notes, there was my own hand writing upon them; the name of the person I took them of, and the date; I left them in his box, and sent for an officer; the officer came, and took him in custody. I put my notes in the till after I have endorsed them, my till is not locked, it was left open. I can swear to my having taken these notes since I paid the prisoner any money. I send all my notes to the bankers two or three times in a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you paid these notes to the prisoner - A. Not to the prisoner I did not; I cannot say whether I paid them to any body else, or whether they were taken away. I knew nothing of the notes until I saw them in the prisoner's box, and that I had taken them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. It is possible you might have paid them to persons that you paid money to - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the number of the other young men that you have in the shop - A. I have four or five; I occasionally keep five persons.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you a character with the prisoner - A. Yes; I was satisfied with his character; it was a four years and a half character.</p>

            . On the 19th of December, I took the prisoner into custody; I searched his box, I found in his pocket-book seven one-pound notes, twelve half-crowns, two dollars, six three-shilling pieces, seven shillings, some sixpences, and a ten-pound promissary note. I asked him how he came possessed of so much money; he told me he wanted to speak to his master. I told him I should not allow that, I should take him before the magistrate; I did, and Mr. Bynner picked out four of the notes that he had endorsed. After the examination, I locked the prisoner up, I then asked him again, how he came possessed of so much money; he said, he took from the till a few shillings at a time, and when it amounted to a sum he changed shillings for notes, sometimes he got the notes out of doors. I told him he had four that had Mr. Bynner's hand writing upon them. I asked him if he could account for that, he said, he would give no account for that. I produce the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the notes - A. These four notes have my hand writing upon them, they are all marked in the front; my writing is the name of the person I received them of; there is one Ellis 3rd of August.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. This note has on it the 33rd of August, it is 33 August, that is an inaccuracy - A. It is for the 3rd of August.</p>
               <p>COURT. You say you do not remember paying them to any body - A. I remember nothing of them until I saw them in the prisoner's box.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin, If these notes were stolen, they might be taken before the 24th of November - A. On the that day probably.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner knew it was your habit to mark each note - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You never found the notes until the 19th of December - A No.</p>

               <p>Q. They had your master's writing on them - A. I cannot say. I was indebted to the prisoner's brother; his brother authorised him to receive it; I paid the prisoner four pounds, two of the four in one-pound notes that I had received of my master.</p>

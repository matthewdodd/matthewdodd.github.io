               <p>CHARLES WHALEY, the younger, sworn. -On Saturday the 18th of June, about ten o'clock in the morning, there were four trusses of hay found in the sheep barn, where we used formerly to keep sheep.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this? - A. At <placeName id="t18030706-5-crimeloc29">Potter's-Bar</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18030706-5-crimeloc29" type="placeName" value="Potter's-Bar"></interp>

The witness and I sat to watch between nine and ten in the evening; we sat up all night, and nobody came; we sat up again on Sunday night, and nobody came that night; we sat up on Monday night, and on Tuesday morning, about four o'clock, the prisoner at the bar came and took the four trusses away; about two hours after that he came into another barn adjoining that where we sat up, what we call the draught barn, with a ladder he got up into the lost window.</p>



               <p>Q. Were you in a situation to watch both barns? - A. Yes; he went in at the lost window, which goes into the wheat barn, where we sat; he put his hand over the window to open the window; he saw me, and then he went away, and took the ladder with him. The prisoner was my father's servant, and he had been binding hay that day; the colour and quality was exactly like our's; we could not miss it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Are you in partnership with your father? - A. No, he has no partner.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner lived with your father? - A.Four years next Michaelmas; he was carman and hay-binder.</p>

               <p>Q. How near to you was the person who was carrying this hay? - A.Not more than thirty yards.</p>

               <p>Q.Was it moon-light? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. It was a cloudy night? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>THOMAS LORD sworn. - I work for Mr. Whaley; I sat up to watch in the wheat barn with young Mr. Whaley on Saturday night, and Monday and Tuesday the same. About two o'clock on Tuesday morning the prisoner came and took four trusses of hay from under the stubble in the sheep barn, and carried it away; I don't know what he did with it; I have known him these three years.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.This was a cloudy night? - A. Yes, but it is never very dark at this time of the year.</p>

               <p>Q. You do not mean to say that at thirty yards distance, at that time of night, you could see the man's face? - A. Yes, I am sure it was him.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not follow the man? - A.No, we staid to see if he would take any thing else.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you never said you could not see distinctly who it was? - A. Yes, I told the prisoner so.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not tell Mr. Warwick so? - A. Yes, I did; I said so, because the prisoner should not be resolute; I did not like to handcuff him, as I knew the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Warwick is a respectable farmer? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060005"></xptr>Q.Why did you tell Mr. Warwick so? - A. Because I had told the prisoner so; I had no particular reason.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not tell Mr. Warwick that Mr. Whaley could not see him too? - A. I do not know, I might.</p>

               <p>Q.Perhaps what you told Mr. Warwick was the truth? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you quite sure you tell us the truth now? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>SARAH - sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Wharley: On Saturday morning the 18th of June, I found four trusses of hay covered over with dubble, which is a very unusual thing, in the sheep house, close to the rick-yard.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the charge.</p>

               <p>For the prisoner.</p>

               <p>- WARWICK sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a farmer; I have known the prisoner ten years; he was in my service two years; he has always borne the character of an honest and industrious man. <rs id="t18030706-5-verdict30" type="verdictDescription">

            , at Brighton. I wrote a letter to her; I got an answer to my letter, which induced me to take him; he came into my service about the middle of May; he had almost a new dress of livery; besides that he had a new blue coat with gold lace button-holes on each side of the collar, and a new linen jacket; he had a dress livery as good as new, that he left; he took with him the new blue coat, two waistcoats, and also two new pair of breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you had some friends to dine with you on Monday the 23rd - A. I had to dine, and sup; I had not a vast deal of plate; the knives and forks must be in use. On the 24th I was out to an evening party in Saville-row; I was disappointed of my friend calling for me; when I came home I called for my servant; he was not at home. I was determined to set up until he did come home; indeed I let him in myself. He had the new livery on. I told him that was the last time that the door should be opened to him. The prisoner quitted my service the next morning. I never saw him until after he was apprehended; he never applied to me for any wages.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your ladyship know whether any of your plate was missing - A. I went and examined it, and found the articles missing in this charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you competent to speak to the value of this property - A. No, I am not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140045"></xptr>MARY HODGKINSON. Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I do; he came to live in lady Hunloke's family about eight weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he an inventory of the plate delivered out to him - A. He had, a day or two after he came. I compared the plate to the list, and counted it out to him; I saw that it was right; he was to keep it in the plate cupboard, in his own room; it was all right when I delivered it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a silver cup among the articles - A. - A. Two, four tea-spoons, two silver soup-ladles, twenty-five silver forks, six silver dessert-spoons, six silver dessert-forks, six dessert knives, seventeen table-spoons, a plate and waiter, one large waiter, one small, and a marrow-spoon</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with these articles - A. Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. When lady Hunloke had a party was the plate used on that occasion - A. I saw both the cups I am sure; I am not certain as to the others. I saw the plate in use; I did not make any particular observation.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner being out late and coming home on the night of the 24th - A. Yes, he came home between two and three in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go to bed that night after coming home - A. That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not refused a Imittance - A. No. I heard what lady Hunloke said to him when he came in; she told him it was the last time he should come into the house; I expected to see him about in the morning, but he did not make his appearance; in the morning I went into his room myself about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the bed appear as if any body had been laying in it - A. Yes. I looked at the plate-closet, the plate was intermixed one thing with another, it was all confusion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you compare it with the list - A. I did; after a time I think I went up stairs and I told her ladyship; she sn me for her nephew, Captain Digby; he came and we counted it; I counted the plate, and missed the articles in the indictment. The plated coffee-pot was missing, one silver goblet-cup, four tea-spoons, a soup-ladle, eleven table-spoons, were gone; one silver fork, two or three dessert-forks, and one salt-spoon was missing, and the small plated waiter was gone, and the marrow-spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find lady Hunloke's livery missing - A. One of the new livery, not the dress livery.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the plate that was left where it was his duty to keep it - A. It was; he never returned to lady Hunloke after the 25th any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any apparel that he left - A. Yes, a coat, a waistcoat, an old pair of breeches, and an old shirt; I believe the clothes that he has on were left behind.</p>

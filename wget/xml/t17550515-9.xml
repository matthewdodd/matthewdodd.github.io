            . Last Sunday fornight a boy brought the prisoner to my house in Duke's-place, knowing me to be a constable; the prisoner had this silver spoon (producing one); he asked me six shillings for it. I asked him what he would have an ounce for it? He said four shillings per ounce.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175505150007"></xptr> I asked him if he came honestly by it? He said he did, and his name,

            , was upon it; I saw it was only M. H. upon it; then I took hold of him, and said he should go to prison. He said he would make me a present of the spoon, if would let him go. I said I would not, and took him to the Compter that night, and the next day before the alderman, and he was committed. I have advertised the spoon twice, but at present it has not been owned.</p>
               <p>The prisoner being a foreigner, and pretending not to know English, an interpreter was sworn. His defence was as follows:</p>
               <p>I came over from France to go to Holland, and having never seen the rarities of the king's going to Holland, I wanted to see it, so I staid for that purpose. I went and lodged in St. Martin's lane two days and nights. When I came here I had but two shillings, and I could not go beyond-sea, so I thought of going to sell the spoon; it was on a Sunday, and as I heard the Jews might trade on Sundays, I went into Duke's-place. I asked six shillings for it, or four shillings per ounce. I had not been in England above a fortnight before. The spoon I bought in France.</p>

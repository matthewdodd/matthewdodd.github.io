                  </hi>. I am counter clerk at the Vere Street post-office—on Wednesday, 25th October, about 2.50 or 2.45 the prisoner came in and asked me for a half-crown's worth of <hi rend="italic">Id</hi>. stamps—he put down a good shilling, a good sixpence, and a bad shilling, which I noticed, and went round to the other side of the counter and stopped him—I told him why I stopped him—he said he hoped I would not give him in custody, he would give me a good one—I said "This is the second time you have been here, you came here last Saturday and passed a counterfeit florin and I shall give you in custody "—he made no answer—he had asked for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of stamps on Saturday, the 21st, about 2.45, and put down a good florin, a good shilling, and a bad florin, which I noticed at the time, and he gave me two good shillings in return for it and I let him go—on the last occasion I submitted the matter to my superior officer and the prisoner was given in charge with, the coin.'</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have four assistants—it is common for four or five peo ple to be waiting at each department, but we are very slack on Saturday afternoons—I sell a great many stamps in a day, and it is not uncommon for people to come to the wrong counter and ask me questions, and yet I can tell a person who has been there only once before under special circum<lb></lb>stances—I have had many bad coins offered to me and I may have taken them and offered them at a shop—no one was there on the 21st but the prisoner, and on the 25th the prisoner and another person, but others came in while they were there—I have a good knowledge of coin, but there is a possibility of my taking a bad one.</p>

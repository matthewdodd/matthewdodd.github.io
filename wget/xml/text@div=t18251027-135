            . I am an artificial-florist, and live in Milk-street. On Saturday, the 24th of September, I was going along Goswell-street-road, towards Islington, a little after twelve o'clock, and saw the prisoners before me, talking together, standing still - they came towards me, and passed me in a contrary direction. Having my suspicions, I turned round, and saw them standing at the window of a small shop - they appeared to me to be cutting the glass of the window; Wade came from her companion at the window, and went round to the door, which is at the side, turned the handle of the door, and went to look through the window again, then returned, opened the door gently, went in, and closed it after her; Moore remained at the window, looking through. I went to inquire for an officer, but could not find one. When I returned to the house again, I saw Moore come from the window - (I was not gone more than a minute) she opened the shop door - Wade came out - they both ran off together - I immediately crossed the road, ran after them into Parr's-place, went up to them, and told them to return, for they had got what did not belong to them; they rather hesitated, but returned with me. When I got back to the shop, I asked the person of the house if she had lost anything. When I took the prisoners, one of them looked very cunningly in my face, and said, "Pray let us go;" the other said, "Do, sir, we were hungry." I took them to the shop - the person said she had lost a new gown. Wade put her hands under her shawl, produced it, and laid it on the counter - they both asked the mistress of the shop forgiveness.</p>

On the 24th of September, between twelve and one o'clock, I was in the parlour, behind the shop; I had a little girl, twelve years old, and a lodger in the house. Wade came in, and asked for black ribbon; I told her I had not the width she wanted; she went out, and shut the door after her; it was on the latch, and could be opened from outside; I went into the back parlour to stir the fire, heard a noise in the street, and found the shop door open; I saw Mr. Inskip with the prisoners - he said he thought they had got some of my property. Wade laid the gown on the counter - it is new; (looking at it) it is all made, except putting together, and is worth 15 s. 9 d.; here is a gown, body, sleeves, and skirt - I am sure they are mine.</p>

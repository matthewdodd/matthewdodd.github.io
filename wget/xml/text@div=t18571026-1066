I live with my father, at No. 3, St. Michael's Alley, Cornhill I shall be fourteen years old next birthday—on Friday, 25th Sept., I was on Finsbury Pavement, about a quarter before 12 o'clock—the prisoner came to me, and said if I would go on an errand for him, he would give me a shilling—I said I would—he took me across the road; he gave me a paper, and told me to take it to the Union Bank of London, and to come back to him at the same place—I went to the Union Bank—I saw Mr. Lewis; I gave him the order, and he gave me a cheque book—I took</p>

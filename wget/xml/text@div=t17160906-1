             depos'd, That the Night before (viz. the 23d of July last) after he had shut up Shop, he went out for his Supper, and at his Return found several Watchmen at the Mug-house Door, which occasioned a great Mob, and he saw them throw Stones at the Windows, upon which two Gentlemen came out with their Swords drawn. Next Morning he saw the Windows broke very much, so that there was scarce 4 Panes whole; but saw none of the Watch endeavour to prevent the Mischief. After this he saw the Prisoner and a Grenadier go from the Mug-house Door to the End of Salisbury-Court, but were drove back by the Mob. Then he heard the Proclamation read, upon which the People advanced with great Shouts for the space of 3 Minutes, and then the Prisoner fired, the Mob being within 20 Yards of the Prisoner's House, the Deceas'd about 10 Yards before them, and the Prisoner 5 from his House. That he could not remember any particular or general Cry used among the Mob, but believed the Deceased did not belong to them, and that he had no Stick in his Hand; however he had heard he was a Mobber.</p>

             depos'd, That he was at the Mug-house the Night before, between 6 and 7 a Clock; and about 9 a Constable and several Watchmen drew up in a Rank against the Door, which occasioned a great Mob; and as Gentlemen came to the Mug-house, they hiss'd them; upon which he went to the Door to know why they hiss'd, but they threw Stones at him, and at the Windows, which had been broke once before to the Value of 7 s. 6 d. That afterwards being in the Coffee-Room, a Stone hit him on the Leg, and then he went to the Constable, one overs, and asked him, if he was not ashamed to suffer such Things, having Authority and Watchmen enough to prevent it, by securing such Persons as threw the Stones; who answered him, I was the People in the Mug-house that did it, and broke their own Windows; that his Hour was not come, viz. 10 a Clock. After this Mrs. Read sent a Quart of Ale to the Watchmen to drink the King's Health, but another Constable who was there then refus'd it, and forbid his Watchmen to drink it. Then one Mr. Hucks offered them a Crown, saying, Come, these look like honest Watchmen, there's a Crown for them to Drink; which they took, but the Constable made them return that also. Then a Constable who was in the House read the Proclamation, upon which the other with his Watch came in, and demanded the Reason of that Rout, and was answered by the other Constable, There was no Rout but what was made by your Mob, and therefore they had just read the Proclamation to disperse them; to which he replied, he was no Constable in that Ward, and therefore was not to direct him, and went away. A little while after some Mischief happened at the Swan Ale-house, and Mrs. Read beg'd the Favour of some Gentlemen to stay in her House all Night, as he and some others did; and about 6 a Clock the next Morning the Mob began togather, and continued till 9, throwing Stones at the Windows, and seemed inclined to do more Mischief; upon which the Deponent ventured out to them to reason with them, and to desire them to be easy and quiet, and not ruin a Man who had done them no harm; in which Time he received two Knocks by Stones, one of which broke his Head and made him bleed very much, whereupon he ran into the House for a Stick, and drove them, but struck no body but the Person who hit him with the Stone. After this, being informed that an armed Mob was preparing to pull down the Mug-house, they sent two Expresses, one to the Lord Mayor, the other to the Lord Townsend; and it was not long before a great Mob armed, with Sticks and Clubs, appeared in Fleetstrees making up the Court; whereupon they consulted what had best to be done for the Security of the House; and it was his Advice to attack them before they joined the Mob in the Court, and became too formidable; and so they did, having a Blunderbuss which was brought to them about half and Hour before in a Coach: He and the Prisoner went out, and after they were repulsed, the Prisoner bid the Mob have a Care, stand off, near a quarter of an Hour before he fir'd, which was done about a Yard and a half from his House, and then he went in to make a Barricade.</p>

That a Constable was there with his Watch, but did not discharge the Duty of his Office, but encouraged the Mob by Connivance. Next Morning about 8 a-Clock, the Mob (Men Women, and Children) began to show their Colours, by crying out, High Church and Ormond for ever, and Down with the Mug-house. At last, about 11 a-Clock, their Number was very great, and he having his Arms, drove them from the Door 2 or 3 times into Fleet-street. Then the Proclamation was read, which served but to encrease their Rage and Number, who threw Stones so thick, that the Gentlemen were obliged to go into the House; and then he with the Prisoner, who was also armed, went out and presented their Pieces, bidding them he gone, true a Care, stand off, &amp;c.6 Minutes, during which Time they were pelted with Stones, so that they could take no Aim; the Mob still advancing upon them, and hollowing out Down with the Mug-house, and then they both fired; after which he posted himself for the Defence of the House, but in a little time some of them broke into it behind, and pushed him into the Court; and then he was so beat with Sticks and Clubs, and dragg'd along the Channel, that had it not been for the Guards and the Care of Mr.

And being ask'd whether many of them said so, he answer'd, It was universal. Then he saw the Prisoner come to the Door, and lean there; and the Deceas'd with a Stick held up with his two Hands like a Quarter-staff , and he was making up to the Prisoner when he fell.

That he went to give the People of the House an Account of it; and the Mob having arm'd themselves with Clubs to their Satisfaction, and thrown away their small Sticks, they went directly to Salisbury-court; and after the Proclamation was read they press'd forward, but were beat back by the Grenadier; but growing stronger they return'd to the Charge with a very great Shout. Then he went up to the Mug House and hear'd the Prisoner say, Stand off, Have a Care, &amp;c. and in a little time the Piece fired, the Mob at the same time throwing Sticks and Stones at the Prisoner and his House.</p>

             deposed, That he was going home about 10 a Clock on the Monday-Night before this Action happened, and heard a Noise in Salisbury-Court, where he had been informed their was a Mug-house, but he had never been in; and saw a Constable and some Watchmen there, who he thought incouraged and encreas'd the Mob. by taking no Care to keep the Peace, or to prevent the ling Stones to the Windows, tho' the Persons who threw there just by them, and all the Action done in their fight, and Stones were brought in Baskets and laid down by them. Being asked what Constable this was, he said some told him his Name was Johnson. That after the House had been battered some Time, the Gentlemen came down, and desired him as well as he could understand them (being at some distance) to do his Duty: but he went away, and left the Mob there. Next Day about Noon coming from his Chambers in the Temple, he saw a great Mob in the Court breaking the Goods of the Mug-house, and throwing them out at the Windows; and as they were gutting and pulling Things down, he heard some of the Mob say, just thus will we pull King George from the Crown, which is none of his own.</p>

               <p>Then Dr. De ls Coste said he had something more that was material to offer, and standing up, depos'd, That he heard too some of the Mob say, the Duke of Ormond, and some the Duke of Berwick, was landed with 20000 Men. That the Friday-Night before he was Chairman at the same Mug-house; and he received Information, that the Mob threatned to pull it down that Night; and fearing he should want Assistance, he sent a Messenger to the Loyal Society in Tavistock-street , desiring their Company and Assistance if Need should be, on that Occasion, who came very readily and disperst the Mob, so that no Mischief was done that Night; but a few of them went by with a Harp and Fiddle, playing The King shall enjoy his own again. Then the Court told him, that since he said he had been Chairman of that Mug-house; he would do well now he was upon his Oath to give an Account of their Orders and Behaviour. Upon which he told him, That about 8 a Clock at Night the President generally enters the Chair, and after profound Silence is made, they always begin a hearty Mug to the Health and Prosperity of His Most Sacred Majesty King GEORGE; some time after that another to their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales and their Issue, and all the Royal Family; a third to the Glorious and Immortal Memory of the late King William, and seldom or never miss a fourth to the Prosperity of the Church of England, sometimes with a supplement, as wishing she may never want Power nor Inclination to protect and encourage all Protectants, and sometimes without; for the rest, if any are inclined to stay longer, they fill up the Time with other Loyal Healths of lesser Note, as the Chairman or President shall think proper; but never to the Confusion or Damnation of any Person or Thing, as the Enemies to the Government and theirs have falsly given out.</p>

That a Constable (whose Name he did not know) and some Watchmen being before the Door, he desired the Constable and his Watch to keep the Peace; who replied, they in the House occasioned the Breach of it themselves; which was false, they having done nothing that could give a just Offence.

He also heard this Constable say the House deserved to be pull'd down; and then one of the Watchmen took hold of him, and would have pulled him out of the House; after which they came in, and made a Bustle and Disturbance in the House, so that he was obliged to read the Proclamation, the Mob throwing Stones at him all the while.

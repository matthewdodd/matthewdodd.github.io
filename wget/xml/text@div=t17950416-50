He came to my shop with a young lad about seventeen; he asked to look at some worsted gloves he asked for some blue washing gloves; there were some worsted gloves that lay in the window; the window from the door to the counter is enclosed with a little grating, and inside of this grate were laid some silk handkerchiefs, gloves, and several other articles. I saw the boy very busy at the grate and I suspected him to be a thief, and presently he cried out to the other, come on James, and went out. I knew he had taken something, but I did not see what he had in his hands. I immediately asked my wife what she had lost from the window.(The prisoner did not go along with the boy he staid talking with my wife,) she said the other handkerchiefs were lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the hearing of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she mean by the other handkerchiefs? - I had part of the same piece stole on the Tuesday evening before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they silk handkerchiefs? - Silk. At the moment the boy went out of the shop, I charged the prisoner with being a thief, and an accomplice of the lad that was gone out, and I shut the door to at the same moment.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say? - He said he had no knowledge of him, he never knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come in together? - The prisoner come in first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy follow him close? - As close as possibly he could be.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had been in your shop the evening before, was any body in company with him then? - The very same lad.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they inquire for then? - The same articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they buy any thing either on Tuesday or Thursday? - No, on neither of the days. He attempted to go from me; I said he should not go from me, till he had got somebody to give him a good character. I then sent for a constable and he searched him, he had a brass shilling, a good shilling and a knife that I found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it the prisoner tried to rush out of the shop, before you took the things from him? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did you search my fob there? - I did not see him search his fob; I did not take notice.</p>

               <p>Mrs. HARRINGTON sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of the 12th did you see the prisoner at the bar? - I did; he came in with a boy; he asked me for some gloves; I shewed him some; he said he did not like them; I told him to give them back again if they would not do; I went round the counter to take some worsted gloves, to shew him and I see a silk handkerchief laying by the side of the gloves.</p>
               <p>Q. How many handkerchiefs were there? - Two handkerchiefs were on the counter and the boy asked what was the price of them? I took the gloves and shewed them the prisoner, the boy had the handkerchiefs laying down by the side of him. The prisoner asked me the price of the worsted gloves; I told him fourteen-pence, that instant the boy went out at the door, and my husband came into the shop; he was not in the shop before, and asked me whether I missed any thing?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing? - I did, two silk handkerchiefs from where I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160102"></xptr>took the gloves; the boy in running out said, come along Jem, or come on Jem.</p>
               <p>Q. You searched the prisoner, when he was taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. What is the value of the handkerchiefs? - They cost four shillings and sixpence each.</p>

I asked the woman if she had any blue gloves? She shewed me some. I see a boy coming into the shop, and while I was talking about the gloves, I see the prosecutor come from the other end of the shop and he said to the woman, did you see the boy that run out take any thing away? and she said, she did not. He said to me, did you see the boy take any thing away? I said, I did not. He then said, you are an accomplice; they immediately sent for a constable, and searched me. I had half a guinea and six pence in my fob, which they did not search. I have several people to my character. I never was taken up in my life before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Messrs. Pontifex, of Shoe-lane. On 16th Sept, about half past 5 o'clock, when we left off work, I followed the prisoner—he went to Tabernacle-row, and went into a public-house—I spoke to an officer, and when he came out I gave him into custody—he had been a metal washer, and a dirt washer as well.</p>

In consequence of what Donagan said to me, when the prisoner came out of the public house I followed him down Tabernacle-row, stopped him, and asked him where he worked—he said, "At Mr. Pontifex's, in Shoe-lane"—I told him I suspected something was wrong, and asked if he had anything about him—he said, "No"—I told him to take off his hat, and in it I found this bag, containing brass and copper—I asked how he came by it—he made no answer—I showed it to Donagan, and then took the prisoner to the station in Old-street, and them to the factory, where I searched him, and found four or five pieces of copper in his pocket—I afterwards went to his lodging, No. 11, Baltic-street, St. Luke's, and there found a quantity of metal buttons and brass knobe—I produce all the things.</p>

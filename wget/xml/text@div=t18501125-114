                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Erwood, of 3, Tottenham street, Kingsland, in the parish of Hackney. The prisoner Erwood is my daughter, she is nineteen years old; she lived with me. On Monday, 11th Nov. I went out about three o'clock in the afternoon, leaving no one in the house—I locked the first-floor front room—on my return I let myself in, I had taken the key of the street-door with me—I found the door of the front room up<lb></lb>stairs burst open, and three boxes were gone, which I had left in that room when I went out—they were locked, and contained four gowns, two bonnets, eighteen handkerchiefs, four shawls, a table-cover, a sheet, a parasol, a necklace, five petticoats, two bed-gowns, three nightcaps, some Orleans stuff, a shift, some aprons, and other articles—I do not know Wright—my daughter had slept in the house the night before—she did not come home that night; I had not seen her since nine in the morning—next day I saw both the prisoners in custody at a coffee-shop in the Harrow-road—I went with the officer, and when I entered the room, I said, "Dear me, Sarah, what have you done with my things?"—she said "The officer has got them"—the value of the property I lost was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On 12th Nov., in consequence of information, I went to a coffee-shop in Warwick-place, Harrow-road, and apprehended the prisoners—they were together—they were alone in the passage when the door was opened; there was no man with them—I told Erwood she was charged with robbing her mother of three boxes, and a great deal of property—she said, "It is all right, come up<lb></lb>stairs"—I went up<lb></lb>stairs, and she showed me three boxes, and said, that was her mother's property—I asked Wright if she was the female that came from Kingsland with Erwood—she said she was sorry to say she was—she then took this guard, two keys, and a bead-necklace, and threw it from her person on to the bed—the keys do not open either of the boxes—I took the prisoners and the boxes to the station—I produce two duplicates which Erwood gave me in the bedroom, at the coffee-shop—they are for three gowns and a whittle, and seven yards of Orleans cloth—the boxes were opened at the station, and all these things were found in them—(<hi rend="italic">produc<lb></lb>ing them</hi>).</p>

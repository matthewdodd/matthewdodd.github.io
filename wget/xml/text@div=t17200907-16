Smart graved on them (whom he knew, and intended to have called on him the first Opportunity, if he had not come to him) that he asked the Prisoner where he had them, who told him of Capt. Smart for Sword Scabbards; he said surely it is not so low with the Captain as to make you take Pistols for your Scabbards; the Prisoner answered, Yes it was, and if the Captain was not broke it was little better. That the same Night he pawned them, he (the Prisoner) stole all the Weights out of his (this Evidence's) Shop, and gave them to his Whore who betrayed him.

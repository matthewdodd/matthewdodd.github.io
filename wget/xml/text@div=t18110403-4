            . I am an officer of Queen-square office. On the evening of the 12th of March I saw the prisoner at the top of Cockspur-street, he was coming from towards Piccadilly, he had this bag on his shoulder; I stopped him, I asked him what he had got upon his shoulder; he said, some flour, he had got it from his master, he was going to take it to a man at Charing Cross. I asked him the name of the man and his business; he said he neither knew the name or business, nor yet whereabouts at Charing Cross he lived; I asked him his master's name, he refused to tell. I told him I was sure he had not brought it far, we would go back, and I would find out his master. We walked back again, we passed his master's house forty yards, there I found him shuffle the bag, as though he wanted to get it off his shoulder. I told him it was no use. I took him into the Sun public house in Hare-street, and handcuffed him. Mr. Lawrence, a master baker was there, he saw the bag and knew the bag. The prisoner then said, he was sorry for it, he was going to give it to a man that had three children; he had never done so before. Mr. Lawrence went for his master. The next morning I weighed the bag, it weighed sixty-six pounds. I have had the bag in my possession ever since.</p>

In about a quarter of an hour after he was gone I was sent for to the Sun in Hare-street, I there saw the prisoner, he was in the custody of Gillmore. The prisoner had a bag with some flour in it, the bag is marked W. O. This is the bag and the flour that I saw at the public-house; it is my bag, and I had flour of the same description on my premises. The bag is worth one shilling and sixpence. The prisoner gave no account how he obtained it.</p>

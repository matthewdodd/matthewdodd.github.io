               <p>On the 21st of July I was robbed of a silver watch, half-a-guinea, and six shillings in silver, one was bad; the value of the watch was two guineas. I believe it was a woman that robbed me, she appeared as such; I was coming from the Borough, about ten or a little after, I was going to Limehouse, I met a dozen of them at <placeName id="t17820911-43-crimeloc222">Salt-Peter Bank</placeName>

The landlord and landlady turned me out, and said where I was robbed, there I might go. He knocked me down six or eight times, and beat me as long as he liked. The woman owned to my watch, after she was taken up.</p>

               <p>We found the prisoner in bed with a glass-blower, the prosecutor knew her directly; and in her pocket there was some silver, and a crooked shilling marked with vitriol. The prisoner said he was at her house the night before, and left his watch upon the table.</p>
               <p>PRISONER.</p>
               <p>I asked a young woman for a bed, and this gentleman was in her room, I went to a public-house with a young man, and he gave me 6 s. The prosecutor when he took me up, said he would not swear to any of the money; but the justice's man said here is a remarkable shilling, swear to that; he said he would not, I was not the girl that robbed him. I have no witnesses.</p>

               <p>Jury. Was the half-guinea found as well as the silver? - No.</p>

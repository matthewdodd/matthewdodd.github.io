                  </hi>. I live in Noah's Ark-court, Standgate, Lambeth—I am in the employ of Mr. William Cubitt, who is repairing Westminster-bridge. On the morning of the 28th of April I was on the bridge, and saw the prisoner in a barge—he drew a piece of timber off the platform, and threw it into the water—he afterwards towed it through the arch with a boat which he was in, took it to the stairs of the bridge, and left it—I pointed it out to George Maynard.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Henry-street, Kennington-lane, and am a lighterman to Mr. Cubitt. On the morning of the 28th of April I heard something—I went to Westminster-bridge, and there saw the prisoner, who was pointed out to me by Perring—he had a maul hammer in his hand—I saw this piece of timber—he had knocked a large nine-inch spike out of it—I asked him what he had done with the timber—he said he had picked it up afloat—I gave him into custody—I knew the piece of timber, which I found to be Mr. William Cubitt's—it is over the way now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had been to Hungerford-market; I was coming across the water and the piece of timber was driving by; I picked it up, towed it ashore, and left it there; I went to see if I could find who it belonged to; I could not, so I came back, Maynard came and collared me, and said he had seen me take it off their premises.</p>

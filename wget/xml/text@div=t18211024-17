            . I am a green-grocer, and go round Hackney with a horse and cart. On the 12th of October, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was right opposite the nursery gate, and saw the prosecutor coming up the yard with a pitcher of water in his hand, a bullock was coming, and about two hundred people following - I saw the prisoner with two more stop, when they saw the prosecutor come up the yard, (they had passed me) I think the prisoner was one of them, I was about ten yards from them, they stopped at the gate, then turned back, one went past the gate, and stood at the post, then two went in front, and one pulled his watch out, the other slipped behind him, and hit him on his right cheek, it was not the man who pulled the watch out, I think the prisoner is the man who struck him - they ran off. I am certain he is one of them.</p>

               <p>Court. Which of them snatched the watch out of your pocket? - I believe it was the second man; then a third came up and put his hand in my left-hand breeches pocket, and took out a piece of coin, then came up a fourth and got hold of me, they lugged me about the street till I fell down, and when I fell down I cried out murder, and one Mrs. Belson, a lady that lives close by me, lifted up the sash, and cried out murder, murder, they are killing

               <p>Court. They did not appear to have any fire-arms, did they? - I did not see any arms, I kept one by the collar, and I tore a piece off his coat as he was running away, which I have in my pocket; they got clear off.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know who any of these men were? - I believe the coat to be the property of the accomplice.</p>

               <p>On last Saturday morning I heard a gentleman had been robbed in Hermitage-street, and I saw the piece of the coat which the gentleman had tore off, and knowing Hall wore such a coat, I concluded it must be him, and I went and took him out of a house of ill-fame in Nightingale-lane, I searched for the remaining part of the coat but could not find it; after he had been in custody about an hour, he said he would acknowledge the whole matter.</p>
               <p>Court. Stop a little, do not tell us what he acknowledged; where did you sell the watch? - In Duke's-place.</p>
               <p>Is the person to whom it was sold here? - No, he is upon bail, he is not here, he is not indicted yet.</p>
               <p>Court. You know nothing of the prisoner but from the information of Hall? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find the coat of which the prosecutor had a part? - No.</p>
               <p>Is there any further evidence? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Do you know any thing of the persons of either of these prisoners? - No, my Lord, nothing at all, it was very dark, I could not discern who they were, nor any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the rule of law, which is founded on very wise reasons<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140019"></xptr> is, that no man shall be convicted on the single evidence of an accomplice, unsupported by other circumstances, for nothing would be so easy, if the law were otherwise, as for any man taken up under circumstances against himself, to get himself admitted a witness, and so save himself by a false accusation against others; so that, though the law will admit the evidence of an accomplice to explain and connect evidence, yet, without that, the law will never suffer any man to be convicted on the evidence of an accomplice only.</p>

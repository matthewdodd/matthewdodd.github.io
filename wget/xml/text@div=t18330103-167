             (Police-constable S 50). On the night of the 30th of December I was coming down Grenville-street, Somer's-town - I heard the noise of some poultry in <placeName id="t18330103-167-crimeloc953">Grenville-mews</placeName>

             (Police-serjeant S 22). The prisoner was brought to the station, and at half-past eight o'clock the next morning I heard him making a noise in the cell - I went and opened the door - he seized me by the collar, got me down, and nearly killed me; the reserve man came to my assistance - the prisoner then got these two lanterns off the shelf, threw them at us, and broke them all to pieces; we struggled with him, I suppose twenty minutes, and were then obliged to throw open the doors, and call for assistance - and several people came to our aid; he was very violent indeed before we handcuffed him.</p>

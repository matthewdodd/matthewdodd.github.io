            . I am a Thames Police-surveyor. On the 18th of July Mary Clark was brought to me with this copper; I said, "Mother Clark, where did you get that; have you brought it from your son's shop?" - she said Yes, but that her son knew nothing about it, as he was out bathing, and it had been brought last night (her son keeps a marinestore shop in Cable-street); I asked if she knew the man that brought it - she said No, but he was a dark man, and looked respectable; I went to her son, and said to him -"I suppose you know your mother is in custody;" he said Yes - I said, "It is for some metal" - he said Yes; I said,"Did you send her with it" - he said, "Yes, I did, it is mine, and it is all right;" I said, "Where did you get it?" - he said, "I bought it last night of a very respectable man, I have seen several times, and I believe his name is Watson"- he said he did not know where he lived, but he was to meet him at one o'clock, in Whitechapel; I said, "We will go and see for him" - as we were going, he said, "I am sure it is all right, for I have a bill of parcels;" I said,"Did you get it last night, or to-day" - he said, "Last night when I got the metal;" I said, "This is one of Mr. Glasscott's bills, it is in two hand-writings, and here has been an erasure of a name" - I went to Mr. Glasscott, and in consequence of what I heard there, I went to Mr. Norbury's, and in going along, Clarks said to me, "I did not get the bill last night, but after you had stopped my mother, I went to Mr. Norbury's clerk, and told him my mother was stopped, and he must give me a bill to satisfy the officer; he took this bill, and erased the name, and gave it to me" - I went to Mr. Norbury's, and saw Woodeson there (I had left Clark with a friend of mine, but not an officer, and he made no attempt to run away) - I said to Woodeson, "I want you for stealing some metal;" he said, "Me, I know nothing of it" - I said, "Do you know a man named Clark;" he said No - I then fetched Clark in, and said, "Do you know this man?" he said, Yes, I said, "Do you know this bill of parcels?" he said "Yes, I gave it to him" - I said, "Did you alter it?" he said, "Yes, I did" - Mr. Norbury was present, and Woodeson said to him,"I hope you will forgive me, Sir; if you knew what I did it for, you would;" I asked Woodeson how he got them off the premises - he said he put the two flanges under his waistcoat, and the other articles in his pockets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you quite sure that neither you nor Mr. Norbury told him it would be better or worse for him to tell you? A. Yes; he never gave any account of any person who had brought these articles in.</p>

               <p>"SIR, - I will lay the whole truth before you that relates to my present horible situation, with all the circumstances attendng my guilt, and then if you still withhold your pardon, I shall indeed despair. I, a short time since, received a summons from Moore, the shoe-maker, which I did not at the time attend to, and fearful of it coming to your hearing, I, on Saturday last, paid him for a pair of shoes out of my week's salary; and on Sunday I lent my mother 7s., which she promised to return me on the Tuesday, but which she was unable to do; the master of the house at which I boarded, from my not having paid him the full amount of my week's bill, declined giving me credit this week; and thus, by a mere act of carelessness, I was placed in a situation of vexatious unpleasantness, and without the means actually of procuring my regular meals. I, on Tuesday, considered what was to be done; I knew my mother would send me that money on Friday, at the farthest, but a few shillings untill that time, I could not do without. On a sudden, the wicked idea came across me to take a few pounds of copper, which could I dispose of, it would not, I thought, be ever missed, and would relieve me from the only chance I had left, to ask yourself for a few shillings. I recollected this shop in Cable-street, from my having inquired my way to Stone's, the carman the other day. I went at teatime, and representing myself as an engineer, inquired whether a small quantity of copper bolts, which I wanted to sell at a sacrifice, being pressed for money, could be purchased; after considerable hesitation, I was told to bring them, and he would consider. Before I left in the evening, I hastily seized on the first light things that lay in the way, and tremblingly, and in a guilty manner, I left the shop, and took them to Cable-street; the man was out, and I received no money. - I was desired to call in the morning, but so frightened was I at what I had done, that nothing on earth could have induced me again to go there. I had resolved to pawn my silk handkerchief at dinner-time, and was happy to think I would no longer continue in the course I had so wickedly thought of the night before. What was my horror then to see the man enter the counting-house, and hurriedly inform me that I was found out; that nothing could save me but giving him a printed bill of parcels, I did so, and the rest I need not relate. WILLIAM FANE WOODESON.</p>

               <p>Clerkenwell Prison, Thursday.</p>
               <p>Woodeson's Defence. It would be almost impossible to convince the Court that I did not take them with a felonious intention, though I certainly did not; I wrote that letter at Clerkenwell-prison, thinking that if Mr. Norbury knew the whole truth he would forgive me; I did not even offer to obtain money on the property - it was left for them to tell me the price of it.</p>

On Thursday, 6th December, about six in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at the corner of Golden Lane—he had a large parcel containing ninety-two yards of flannel—I asked where he was going with that parcel—he said to a carrier's in the Goswell Road—I asked what carrier's—he said he thought to a carrier's of the name of Sutton—I asked where he had got the parcel from—he said from his employers, in Wood Street—he did not mention the name—I said there was no carriers that way, and, knowing that Mr. Sutton's place was in Aldersgate Street, I said, "I shall take you to the station, and charge you with the unlawful possession"—on the way to the station he said, "Oh! do let me go, I found the parcel in Huggin Lane"—at the station the Inspector asked him to account for the parcel, and he said, "I was coming down Huggin Lane, I saw the parcel between two houses, I picked it up and was going to take it home to see whether there was any reward offered for it"—in the parcel I found this invoice directed to Mr. Stevens, of Woolwich, from Eales and Metcalfe, 29, Aldermanbury.</p>

I am receiving clerk in the employ of Joseph Hornby Baxendale and others, in Gresham Street—I received this parcel from Sarney directed to Stevens, of Woolwich—I passed it to one of the porters, and he placed it on the platform upon which our desk stands, about five or six yards off, about twenty yards from the gateway in Gresham Street—any one could come in—I missed the parcel about half-past seven. <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I have persons to speak to my character. I had been out of work three weeks. I was passing through the street, and a man I knew said, "Here, carry this for me, and I will give you half when I sell it. "I went in to get it, and he placed it on my back, and as I was going along I was taken into custody. I knew then that I should be charged with robbery. I did not know what to say, so I stated that to the gentlemen. It is the first time I have been in trouble.</p>

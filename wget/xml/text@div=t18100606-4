            . Q. You are an officer of Bow-street - A. I was; I am not now. In consequence of information from the last witness I went with him and Croker to a house in Charles-street, Drury-lane, in a back room on a ground floor; there were two women; the prisoner was one of them, she was sitting on a chair by the fire; I asked Callow which was the woman; he pointed to the prisoner; the other woman went out. I think Croker then asked her if she sold that man any silver, pointing to Callow; she made no reply; I asked her if she knew him; she said, oh, yes, he is my husband; Callow denied it; she had the appearance of a blue handkerchief in her hand, I asked her what she had got there, she gave me no answer; I attempted to take it from her, she resisted, and in the struggle a quantity of silver fell into her lap, and on the floor, which I took up, and Croker took the handkerchief from her; I picked up twelve counterfeit shillings, these are them; I searched the room, and in a cupboard I found this counterfeit dollar, and in a drawer in the room I found another counterfeit shilling, and a small piece of metal; she was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any shillings that Callow the last witness gave to you - A. Yes; two that he gave to me at the

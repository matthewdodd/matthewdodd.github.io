            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 21st of October, about 4 o'clock, the prisoner at the bar came with a watch, and offered it to pledge; he brought the watch in one hand, and the key in the other: I had some suspicion of its not being his own, and he not answering cleverly to some questions I put to him, increased my suspicion; I thought proper to stop it: he went away, and said he'd fetch the man that owned the watch; he returned in about a quarter of an hour, and said the man that owned it was a cook at a tavern in Covent-Garden, that he was not at home. In the morning, one of Mr. Fielding's men came and told me it was a stolen watch. I knew the prisoner before; he appeared to be then much in liquor.</p>

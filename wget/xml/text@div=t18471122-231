On Friday, 12th Nov., about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw a cart standing in Cross-street, Horsleydown—Clark was standing at the back of it—I saw a sack, containing something is it—I went into Fair-street, and watched Clark—he went to Mr. Phillips' shop, remained there two or three minutes, came out, went to the cart, and took the sack into Phipps's shop—it had about a bushel and half of some<lb></lb>thing in it—I saw him go through the shop into the back parlour—Phipps was sitting at the table in the parlour—Clarke remained two or three minutes—he put the sack down, and came out—I remained outside a few minutes, them went in, and asked Mrs. Phillips if she had any corn brought within the last hour into her shop—she said she had not—I asked her if a man with a white smock-frock who walked lame, had brought anything there—she said he had not, but she knew that man—I went into the back parlour, and saw this sack there—I asked her who brought it—she said she did not know, it was brought when she was putting the children to bed—I asked her what time she put the children to bed—she said an hour and half age; that when she came down she saw it there, and did not know who put it there—Clarke had taken it in about three minutes before—I have shown this sack to Mr. Shott—it bears his name—it contains about a bushel and a half of beans, oats, and chaff.</p>

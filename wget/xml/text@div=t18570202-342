                  </hi>. I am coachman to the prosecutrix, Mrs. Davis. I live at Camden-lane, Leytonstone—on Tuesday afternoon, 20th Jan., I saw five fowls, that were her property, safe, locked up in her hen house—I went there the next morning, and they were gone—some tiles were taken oft, making a hole big enough for a man to get through—I saw some foot marks—they were plain—the ground was soft—we traced them from the hen house to the ground where the impression was made in the field—we traced the marks from the hen house—it was gravel round there—I traced them on the border of the garden, in the garden, about fifty yards from the hen house, I mean the border of the garden, round the gravel work—I saw it sufficiently to notice that the footmarks came along the gravel, and on to the path where I traced them—they were marks made by a common shoe—I could not tell by the mark that it was a blucher boot—I saw some boots compared with the tracks afterwards—I put them in, and they corresponded—the police<lb></lb>man did not make an impression that I saw—I saw him put some plaster of Paris into the print of the shoe—it got quite dry—he then turned it up with a spade, and washed it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you ever see me near Mrs. Davis's place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Many times—there is a lane which is free for everybody—I saw you at work on Mrs. Davis's premises on 15th and 18th March.</p>

               <p>the prisoner's house—his mother called out to me, and I went along the road after that till I saw the last witness—I received information of a robbery—I afterwards went to the premises of Mrs. Davis, in company with the last witness—I saw that the fowl house had been broken open—the tiles were gone, and I saw footmarks—there had been a slight fall of snow that night—the footmarks were clear on the border—we could trace them both coming and going back, over into the forest; just round the out-side, where they got over the fence—there is very little grass where the cattle come—after I traced that, I covered some of the plainest footmarks over very carefully on the border near the fowl house—I then went to the Bell public house, with police constable Benton, to find the prisoner—Benton asked him what time he was at home the night before—he said, "About 9 o'clock;" that he then went to bed, and did not get up till 7 o'clock next morning—I said, "Why, your mother asked me this morning if you had been locked up at night; I asked her why she asked me; she said because you were not at home that night"—he said, "No, I did not go home that night, I slept out in the forest, under a bush; I was tipsy"—I said, "Just let me look at your boot"—I have it here, and the castings—I saw them taken from the marks in Mrs. Davis's garden—I saw Benton make the marks—I saw several feathers on the prisoner; small ones; I have not got them here.</p>

I went, on 21st Jan., with Addington, to the Bell public house, and apprehended the prisoner—I asked him what time he went home last night—he said 9 or half past 9 o'clock—I said, "Now, be careful; what time did you get up in the morning?" he said, "I went to bed, and did not get up till 7 or half past 7 o'clock in the morning"—then we told him what his mother had said, and he said then about sleeping under the bush, in the forest—I had once seen an impression of a footmark, taken by a gentleman, and said that I would do it if the mould was good.</p>

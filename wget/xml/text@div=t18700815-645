                  </hi>. I live at 13, Hebrew Place, Whitechapel—I was in the prisoner's service three weeks, in May, and the deceased child, Joseph Lipman, was in my charge—when Mrs. Lipman had her meals she used to give him a slice of bread and butter, and a drop of water, and one day he began to cry, and she went over to him and said "As soon as Hannah is gone I will get rid of that little b——"—Hannah is the child's mother—she left him some clothes—the deceased slept on a little bed with shavings and wood, between the cupboard and the bureau—it was changed every morning—it used to be taken down the yard—the child's skin was peeling off with the hardness of the wood, and I asked her to go to some corn<lb></lb>chandler's to get some straw—she said "B——r him, the little sod, let him die"—the child's face was wiped with a flannel every morning; his mother left him a bath before she went away, but it was only used on Fridays, for Mrs. Lipman to wash her clothes in; the child was not washed at all, only his face wiped—his mother left 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw that—I do not think he had enough to eat and</p>

In consequence of information I re<lb></lb>ceived I went to 11, Boar's Head Court, on 24th July, at 10 o'clock at night, and found the deceased alive, lying in the left-hand corner of the first-floor front room, in a small space between a cupboard and a chest of drawers, upon some rags or old garments—he was very emaciated and thin, and ap<lb></lb>peared very weak, and in a very filthy condition—there were numbers of bugs, lice, and fleas on his body, and scabs on his head, apparently old sores—I called in the divisional surgeon.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are the prisoners Germans? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The male prisoner is an English Jew and his wife is Irish—I first went to Mr. Findlater, the relieving officer of Whitechapel; he refused to interfere because it was not in his district—I then went to Mr. Steddeford, the relieving officer of the proper district, who was not at home—I can scarcely say that there was a great appearance of want in the room, it was what you usually see in a poor man's room; there were a few chairs, tables, and a very good bed and bedstead.</p>

I am the wife of Joseph Lipman, a traveller, of 5, Churchfield Place, Margate—I am the mother of the deceased, and the male prisoner was his uncle—I gave the child into the prisoners' charge in May last, as the male prisoner offered to take him, and I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the ten weeks he was there—when I parted with him he was very weak, but perfectly clean—I made no arrangement to pay so much a week, but I was to send to him when I could any nourishment that he might require—he took him as his own, and I was to send some money when I could—the child could eat anything large out of his hand, such as a slice of bread and butter—he was an idiot, he never spoke in his life—I did not see him from the time I parted with him till his death, I was not in London—his hair was quite close to his head when I parted with him—there was no vermin in his head, and he never had a sore that I know of.</p>

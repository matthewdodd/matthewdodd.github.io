Mr. Johnson was a customer; on the 11th of June last I saw the prisoner, (who was engaged in his duty of delivering beer) bring an empty cask from Mr. Johnson's house, in Friday-street. He accounted to me when he came home for what he had received, and paid me 5 s. 6 d. for Mr. Johnson. I said,</p>

               <persName id="t18240715-45-person440">Johnson</persName>
             a customer of our's?" - he said, Yes, he had been, but he had discontinued his custom, and he had not left a cask of beer there for about six months. The prisoner had never accounted for any money received from Mr. Johnson, from the 26th of December to the 11th of June; he should account for it every evening, or the first thing in the morning. It was my business to receive the money - Mr. Hilder never received any.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. Have you the superintendance of the concern? A. If I am not there, no one takes the money - the prisoner keeps it till I return; since I have been there no one has taken money, or entered it, but myself; there never was any deficiency in his accounts, that we know of; when he takes out beer, and receives money, he gives a receipt.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were you when you saw the prisoner with the cask - A. I was in Cheapside, and saw him at Mr. Johnson's door; I settled with him that evening for 5 s. 6 d., which he said he had received of Mr.

             that day; the entries in the book seemed to be correct; none was given him to deliver to Mr. Johnson, but he might have delivered him beer if he had any orders from him; I have received these bills and receipts from Mr. Johnson.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Johnson, and lived there from the 26th of December to the 11th of June last; the prisoner used to bring beer there; he called every week, and I took beer of him about once a fortnight; I used to pay him when he delivered the beer, and had a bill and receipt of him; for this cask of the 19th of March I paid him 5 s. in shillings - I am certain they were shillings.</p>
               <p>MR. DREW re-examined. Q. On your oath, on the 19th of March was Mr. Johnson indebted to you. - A. No - the prisoner had never told me of it; all that he took out to my knowledge, he accounted for. I took the account of what beer was returned, and found it tallied with the brewer's account of what went out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The beer I took out was accounted for in the morning, and again at night - I was never deficient in any cask.</p>

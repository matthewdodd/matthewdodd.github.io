                  </hi>. I reside at 29, Euston-square—on 25th March, about a quarter to 1, the prisoner came to my house to engage some lodgings—he agreed to take them—he wrote his name down on this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)"Charles Mansfield,"—he produced a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to me and offered, if I got it changed, to pay a deposit for the lodgings—I suppose on account of the rent—I could not get the note changed—I sent across the road to the public-house—they could not change it—it was brought back to me, and I placed it on the parlour table where the prisoner was sit<lb></lb>ting—I did not notice whether he took it up or not—I do not know what became of it—I afterwards saw the witness, Frank Perry, come with some goods, and the prisoner gave him a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in my presence—I never saw the prisoner from that day until he was taken into custody—he has never come to occupy my lodgings since, or before he came on that day—he never slept there—he took them weekly—he was to pay me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter-carriers at the General Post Office—the prisoner was a letter-carrier there in January last—a letter despatched from Edinburgh on the afternoon of 25th January would in due course arrive at the General Post Office about 5 in the morning of 26th—if a letter addressed to Paternoster-row was to arrive at that time at the General Post Office, it would first be taken out of the bag with the other letters for the same district, stamped, and then sorted—Walding was the letter-carrier who delivered letters in Paternoster-row that morning—the prisoner was also a letter-carrier in the same section—the 4th section—that would include Paternoster-row and the Temple likewise—the prisoner's own walk was the Temple—he was on duty in the Post-office on the morning of 26th January, from 5 till about 7 o'clock—at 7 he would leave to de<lb></lb>liver his letters—the general despatch is about 7 o'clock—during the time he might have had access to any letters in that section, to a letter addressed to Paternoster-row.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How would that be? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might have been mis-sorted to him—letters are frequently mis-sorted from one man belonging to another—he might have picked it off the floor—the Temple walk and the Paternoster-row walk are very near each other—it might have dropped on</p>

               <p>the floor—packages and letters frequently drop on the floor—Walding or the collector might have dropped it in bringing it with others from the other part of the office—the collectors are men appointed to clear from one part of the office to another—it might also have come as a package, being rather thick, and the pigeon-holes for packages are very near the Temple walk, and it might have dropped on the floor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the letters are taken out of the bag are they first stamped? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and then sorted by the letter-carriers in letter trays—they are then taken to the letter-carriers' table, where they are set up by the letter-carriers for their walks—setting up means arranging them for the con<lb></lb>venience of delivery; they do that at their own seats, at the letter-carriers' table—it often happens, when letter-carriers come to set up their letters, that letters belonging to one walk have been included in another walk—a letter from the Temple might be sorted to Paternoster-row, and <hi rend="italic">vice vered</hi>—when a carrier finds a letter mis-sorted to him, not belonging to his walk, he ought to return it to a place called the blind sorting table, and then the blind sorter gives it to the proper letter-carrier to deliver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence</hi>. I had nothing whatever to do with the letter. There is a desk between the Temple walk and the Paternoster-row walk, and two rows of men, and there are two walks nearer to the pigeon-holes than the Temple walk, so that I had no means of getting at it in that way. It might have been mis-sorted to any one of the 150 men in the office. I found the nine 501. notes. Having occasion to go into the City on Monday, 28th January, for some money that was owing to me the previous week, and passing through Lothbury, I found the bundle of notes. I put them in my pocket and kept them till 25th March; then I did try to purchase a watch and chain with one, I must own. The others I gave to Mr. Russell, except the one I gave to the landlady at 29, Euston-square. The gentleman says that he gave a description of the person presenting the cheque; it varied very much from me. He said it was a person twenty-five years old, I am twenty-two; of sallow complexion, mine is fair; with blotches, I have not got any; 5 feet 8 inches, I am 5 feet 10 inches; brown hair, that would do certainly, but then anybody can perceive that I have curls, which would have been put down if they had been perceived. I know nothing whatever about the cheque or the notes presented at the Bank of England. I read the account in the paper, and it stated they were presented by a man of fashionable appearance. The gentleman from Glyn's says it was the personal appearance of the man that made him suspect. I know nothing about the letter stolen, the cheque, or the notes presented at the Bank. The only thing I know about is the nine notes; those I found and have given up, and I am very sorry that I did find them.</p>

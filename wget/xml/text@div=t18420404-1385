                  </hi>. I am the daughter of last witness. I saw the prisoner when she was living at my brother's, and slept with her and the child for upwards of a week—she was very kind to it—she used not to nurse it much because the doctor ordered it to lie on the floor on its back—I saw her when she was in Easton-street—I slept there from the Friday till the Monday—the child was ill—she said it was like that from three months old, that she put it out to nurse, and the people tied its arras down, and made that deformity in the arms—when I saw her in Easton-street she was very kind to it, the same as usual—she bad only been in the room two nights when I went to sleep with her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you account for her going out in the morning and leaving it all day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was obliged to, to get work, and she had but 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I pledged some things for her—from what I saw, she treated the child well—it was ill, and used to pine and cry all the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shirt-maker, and live in New-court, Old Bailey. I employed the prisoner about the 10th of January, and she continued to work for me about eight or ten weeks—she came at eight o'clock in the morning, and staid till seven at night, never later, but she has frequently taken home four or five hours' work at a time, and done it at home with her own hands, I am certain, and nicely done—I never saw the child till she was taken up—she could not earn more than 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, working as hard as she could, needle-work is very badly paid for—I know that she</p>

               <p>had nothing to eat herself, but dry bread, while at my house—she always conducted herself with propriety while with me.</p>

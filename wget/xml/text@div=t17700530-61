We went up stairs; the first room was for company, (it is a public house) there we found nothing. In the next room we came to there were several boxes, several of them were opened; at last we came to a box that was locked; we asked to have that opened; Fox pretended he had not the key. We wrenched it open; in it we found some little bits of cloth which I knew to be my own; the pattern was my own, and had not been exposed; none of that pattern had ever been sold, not being finished; they wanted a fortnight's bleaching. There was another great trunk; they pretended not to have the key of that, and talked of sending out for a key; at last the key was found in a breeches pocket, hanging in a closet joining to the room; we were ten minutes before we could get that. The chest was opened; there we found two pieces of white cotton, with my name at the end; they were not quite clear in the bleaching, nor were they in a marketable condition.

She brought down a bundle, which was mine, and a gown, and two pieces of purple colour, in bad condition; this appeared to be made up into a gown. She gave information that Marckle, who kept an alehouse in Chissel-court, had dealt with Hampil; and she said,

This is cloth never sold, nor never used for the purpose; they had cut it into table-cloths, pillow-biers and sheets. The cloth is very improper for that; they are not white, and they are very nappy, and very improper to be used for any such purpose. We got a warrant to search Marckle's house. We went there, and asked him if he knew one Hampil; he said, he did not. We said, he certainly must know him; he said, No. Have not you bought any cloth of him? No; he had not. We then told him, we had a warrant to search. We went up stairs, and found the door locked; that was opened. There was a line on which a whole piece was hanging, wet and dirty, as it came out of the field, not saleable; it was cotton and linen yarn. Some of the marks were cut off, and some appear on them. Mrs. Fox was an evidence in Essex against Hampil, but against her husband she cannot.</p>

Jagger went up stairs in Fox's house, and shewed me the things; he could not find the key a long time, at last he found it in a breeches pocket of Fox's. Jagger was sent by Sir John with us to shew us the house where he lived. Mr. Williams went up stairs with us; we searched several boxes; some were open, some locked. Some of the drawers were open. Jagger and Fox too, said they could not find the key of a large box. We found white cotton cut out, which Mr. Williams swore to. Then we went from there to Marckle's, and in a back room up stairs, we found a whole piece of white cotton, wet and dirty; he said, he had not bought it. When I first went into his house, I asked him, where the cloth was that he bought; he said, he bought none. He was asked if he knew Hampil; he said, he did not. He would not tell us of any goods till we went up and found them.</p>

I said, I dare say he did. He asked me my reason for thinking so, I said, Did not you know him when he was in the Hanover service? He said, Did you know him then? I said, I did. Then he, said, I do know a little of him, not much. He asked what was the matter; I said he was taken up on suspicion, and it was a pity a man should be hurt if he was accused wrongfully. Then he said, if I can be of service to him, I will go down. Then he went; Sir John examined him. I think he at first said, he had lodged in his house some time, and had never known any harm of him.</p>

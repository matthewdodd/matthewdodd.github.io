             was at home, and she asked me to drink some spirits, and handed me a glass; then Cooper came up, and asked me how I did, and said, he had not seen me this month; then he asked the woman how Johnson did, though Johnson was the room door at the same time; I saw him at the door; Cooper asked me again who these things belonged to; I said, to a man at the other end of the town; I took the waistcoat out of the bundle, and threw it on a chan, I took the other things under my arm, and Johnson came in, and pretended to be very drunk, and he looked, d - n you, says he, this is my waistcoat, and he put it on; I thought to go out of the house, and Cooper came before me, and said, d - n it, Johnson, you must try these things on; and they forced these things from under my arm; Cooper laid hold of it first; then they gave me a shove, and forced it from me; Johnson put the waistcoat on.</p>
               <p>Did the woman do any thing at this time? - No, she said, they must be mad, or very drunk; that is all she said: then Johnson put on the clothes, and insisted on having his watch, and a looking glass; says he, I am a fine gentleman: and he put his watch in his pocket, and never staid to button his breeches knees, but set off and never returned.</p>
               <p>Who was it that put on this waistcoat? - Johnson.</p>
               <p>Had he put it on before he shoved you or afterwards? - Before.</p>
               <p>What passed then? - When he put on the clothes he made off.</p>
               <p>What did Johnson put on the coat and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210126"></xptr>breeches in the presence of Mrs. York? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did the other man do? - They both went off.</p>
               <p>Did they go together? - No, Johnson was the first man that went down.</p>
               <p>Did they go off in company? - Cooper went after him; I said, I did not understand being robbed, and I would go for an officer; Mrs. York said, she believed she could find him at Mr. Welch's, at the bottom of Holborn-bars; and Mr. Cooper, at Saffron-hill, Chick-lane. where he lived; she came came out, and I ran after her; she walked out pretty sharp, and she said, she was very sorry that such a thing happened; she came to Mr. Welch's, and I stopped at the door; she went in; Welch said, they had not been there since eleven o'clock; then she went to Chick-lane, and she went up stairs; I did not go in at all; then I went home, and said, I was robbed, and got two men, and went in; I pursued them till eleven at night, and could get no account of them; in the morning I went and took a man with me to the place where I saw the woman; and there was Johnson, and the woman, and a little boy.</p>
               <p>Was Cooper there? - No.</p>
               <p>How soon was this after you lost your things? - It was early the next morning, Sunday; then I took an officer, and went again; it was a long time before we could get in, and Johnson was taken in my presence with the coat and breeches, and the waistcoat on; they were all locked in, and the officer broke open the door, and took them, and they were committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Were they committed for the felony? - I do not know what they were committed for.</p>

               <p>Was not that the charge? - That was the very words I told the Justice.</p>
               <p>Then at that time you did not know you had been robbed? - I did indeed; upon my word, I tell nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Did you take up Cooper? - I did not find him.</p>
               <p>Has he ever been taken up? - No.</p>
               <p>Is he under any bail at this moment? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>He lived in Chick-lane, and you have seen him a dozen times; upon your oath, have not you said, that you would put him in the indictment to take off his evidence? - Upon my oath I never did.</p>
               <p>You are an Irishman by your tongue? - Well.</p>
               <p>What persuasion are you? - I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>What religion are you, if you have any? - I am a catholic.</p>
               <p>Did not Johnson belong to the clothes club with you? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did not he get from that club a sum of money to furnish him with that great coat? - He paid seventeen shillings to the club two years ago.</p>

               <p>Did not you receive that money for the coat? - No never.</p>
               <p>Who was to pay for it? - The man that run away, his name is Hadnail; I borrowed half a crown of Johnson, that is all I borrowed of him, upon my oath; I was not in Johnson's debt before these clothes were ordered, he was in mine.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, had not you owed him three guineas for a twelvemonth when he got this coat? - Upon my oath I did not.</p>
               <p>Then upon your oath, last January you was not at all indebted to the prisoner Johnson? - I was not, I was indebted to him the guinea that he gave to me while the coat was doing; he gave me a guinea earnest for the coat, and the woman paid me ten shillings and nine-pence the remainder; the cloth was six shillings a yard, yard-wide, I bought the cloth.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210127"></xptr>Was there any pattern chosen for this coat? - Yes, she agreed; she said, six or eight shillings was no object in the breeches, make the best.</p>
               <p>The prisoner tried the coat, waistcoat, and breeches all on? - Yes, he said I owed him money, and I knew very well that if I left the clothes, he would not pay me; that was what Cooper said, that I owed him some money; Cooper said, that Johnson told him, that I owed him money; Cooper told it to the person that there was money due, Johnson never told me so.</p>
               <p>Who was that person? - A person that lives on the other side of the water.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you that there was an account between them, and they went to fetch Welch to settle it, because they were ignorant men? - Upon my oath there was no money between Johnson and me at the time; neither of them said any thing of the kind to me; I was to make the clothes without measuring, and to make them to sit Johnson.</p>
               <p>Had not you taken Johnson's measure? - No, not since I took it for the great coat, which was the 17th of January; she told me if I could not make them without the measure, she would buy them ready made, because they were going out of town.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cooper. What conversation had you with Burgess about this cloth? - Burgess has lodged with me half a year; he is an acquaintance of theirs: Burgess and he used to wear one anothers clothes, so I said I would take measure of Burgess; I never received any money, but a guinea; I did not owe him any money.</p>
               <p>When did you first think this to be a felony? - I said the very words I said here, and the Justice put it in that manner.</p>
               <p>Were they discharged? - No, they were committed, they were bailed.</p>
               <p>How came you not to get a warrant against Cooper? - I had no warrant against any of them, I only told the officer; I sent an officer after Cooper; I could not not take him; I saw him before this week; he came the other day, but he ran away; I had no officer.</p>
               <p>Did you go to his house in Chick-lane? - No, I never was inside the door; he was not at the house, I was told so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cooper. I can bring witnesses to prove that I never left my house all the time? - I was several times there that night, I could not find them, and in the morning I was there before they were up, that was about seven.</p>
               <p>What o'clock were they taken up? - About a little after one; I had been waiting all the time, they could not go away; they had the door locked, and would not let us come in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cooper. Did not I go to your house that night for linen from your wife that washed for me at the same time, and did not you come in and abuse me? - He run in to get the remainder of his things, and I came in, and said, oh, says I, there is one of the robbers that took the clothes from me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cooper. The prosecutor wanted me to keep out of the way till the trial was over, for he did not want to hurt me.</p>
               <p>Did you say so? - Upon my oath, I never did.</p>

               <p>You are what they call a runner? - No, Sir, I am not; I am a parish officer.</p>
               <p>You attend the office? - I have been twenty seven years a housekeeper; I have been chosen these nine years, and I am a man of character.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this man but once before the Magistrate? - Not that I know of, and then I heard the prosecutor charge him with taking the things by violence; what I say, upon my oath, is a fact.</p>
               <p>PRISONER JOHNSON'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I worked in a sugar house at the time this man kept a club; this winter I used to help him; he was in distress; and his wife was brought to bed; and I lent him a guinea; and he was to give me clothes for it; and I stood godfather to his child; and I brought his wife a new gown; and he got quite jealous of me, and threatened to get forty pounds for my life.</p>
               <p>PRISONER HORSEMAN'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dailey brought the great coat to my room; I washed for Johnson; and I paid him ten shillings and nine pence more for it; I told him to make a brown coat; he desired me to come up and chuse my colour; on Friday, about twelve, I went up to Mr. Dailey's; there were several people in the room which were sending for gin; there is one of his lodgers that has been shot through the thigh for a highway robbery; he was drawing on a red jacket, and sent for a half pint of gin, and I sent for another half pint; when his wife came in about five in the afternoon; he brought these clothes; I was ironing; says I, have you seen any thing of Johnson? not this week, says he; says I, he is not within; Cooper came in, and I asked him after Johnson; says he, if he is not come up stairs, he is gone backwards; Johnson came in, and the clothes lay in the window; says Johnson, this is my waistcoat; yes, says Dailey; then he took the breeches, and he said, they are too long for me; he loosed the waistcoat, and put on the breeches, and buttoned them up; says Dailey, do not put on them old clothes, put on these new ones; Johnson went down and ordered a gallon of beer, and went away; Dailey afterwards wanted me to settle it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER COOPER'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I came into this woman's room, and the taylor sat with the clothes laying on the chair, loose, and the waistcoat on the outside, uppermost; I never went nigh the prosecutor; I went and sat down in the chair; the woman sent the little boy for half a pint of gin; he got up and fitted on the clothes, and asked if they did not fit well, and he stroked them down; and he went down to order half a gallon of beer; and he staid rather long; and I went down, and he said, I will go to Welch's to bring him to balance the money due, the three guineas he owed to me in Pall-mall, and seventeen shillings; that was the club money: I had been married that week, and he went and exposed me, and said, I had robbed him of a suit of clothes.</p>

               <p>I lodge in Dailey's house; I remember this coat; Dailey told me that he owed Johnson three guineas.</p>
               <p>Was that before the clothes were sent home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you been present at any time when Johnson has been asking Dailey to make him clothes for the money that he owed him? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Did Dailey tell you that he was afraid Johnson would stop the money? - Yes, he did; he mentioned the sum of three guineas, but not at that time; and seventeen shillings, the club money.</p>
               <p>Have you often seen Johnson and Dailey together? - I have; Johnson was always asking Dailey for the clothes, and he promised to make them as soon as he could.</p>
               <p>Dailey. My Lord; I only owed him half a crown.</p>
               <p>Did you ever make such a declaration? - I never did.</p>
               <p>You never owed him in your life any thing but the half crown? - Nothing but the half crown; and the club money, seventeen shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Johnson ever ask you to make any clothes for the money that was owing? - Johnson never asked me for any thing, only for the great coat of the club; that is the coat.</p>
               <p>Did you ever promise any clothes to Johnson from time to time? - Never.</p>
               <p>Did this last witness lodge in your house? - He does at present.</p>
               <p>The prisoners Johnson and York called five witnesses to their character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Cooper called one witness to his character.</p>

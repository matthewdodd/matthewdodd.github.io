             confirmed the same; and farther deposed, that when they came just by the Coffee-House the Prisoner took the Wig of him, carried it into the Coffee-House, and went out at the other Door; but he seeing him going down Holbourn, followed him and took it from him, that the Prisoner did not run; and that he delivered it to him without any resistance, as soon as he overtook him. The Prisoner said, that the Gentleman not being there, as he was coming out at the same Door he went in, he saw a Creditor of his, who lived over-against the Coffee-House, looking out at his Window, therefore he turn'd back and went out at the other Door, but not with a Design to run away with the Wig.

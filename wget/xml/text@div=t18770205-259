I saw no omnibus then on the metals As soon as I got across the collision occurred, smash. My left fore wheel came in contact with the milk van, but I do not know what part of it, as I was thrown off the van. My horse and van was straight with the pavement, about 2 yards from the kerb. I was going to-stop at the Artichoke to get a glass of ale. I always called at the Artichoke I was some distance from the milk van when I crossed the metals. At the time of the collision my hind wheels were not on the tramway, nor in the gutter by the kerb. My horse and van were straight in the road. When I crossed the tramway I was pulling up, not going more than three miles an hour.")</p>

I am a milkman, of Brixton—on the evening of the 29th December I was driving a cart from London Bridge towards the Elephant and Castle—I stopped at the bottom of the Boro Road, near the police-station—I got down and adjusted a milk-can and got up again—that was 2 or 3 yards from the Artichoke—I was driving at about 5 or 6 miles an hour—that is a slow pace—I had with me in the cart a blacksmith named Blackman, and a lad—an omnibus passed on the right-hand side, near the Artichoke, meeting me in the middle of the road, and going towards London Bridge—keeping my proper side of the road, I should leave him there on my right hand—no other vehicles passed me, but I saw a horse and van, behind the omnibus, driven by the prisoner, which was passing my horse's head from behind the omnibus, when I first saw it, and going towards London Bridge, when it came on the wrong side of the road; it was crossing the bend of the road, between the metals and the kerb, towards the kerb—I pulled my horse's head to avoid its running into me, but I could not do so because of the omnibus on the other side—the result was that my van came into collision with it, and one of his wheels caught mine—the prisoner had a female with him who was pitched out and was picked up dead—I afterwards saw her dead—she was leaning on his shoulder at the time—the collision broke the shaft of my van and the prisoner's horse ran away—I got out and saw the prisoner there—he was thrown out, I believe, for I saw mud on his back—I asked him his name and address; he told me to take it off the shaft of his cart—he asked me for mine; I offered him one of my cards, and he said he would have two or three of them—I offered him two or three, but he would not take them—I noticed that he had been drinking—I had—not been been drinking; I was a teetotaller at that time—he and I both went with</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I also said "The milk-van could not pull up because he could not know the defendant was going to come out from behind the 'bus as he did; if Watson had pulled up, the milk-van would have gone into Watson's broadside"—I was speaking of the time when the accident was inevitable—it was the near hind wheel which skidded—the accident was inevitable from the time that his front wheels were off the metals.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in King-street, and saw the prisoner, in company with two others, following the prosecutor; I saw one, who is not in custody, take the handkerchief, and give it to the prisoner; I ran after the one who took it, but lost him; I then went under the Piazzas, and soon afterwards saw the prisoner; I had before that spoken to the prosecutor, and got his name and address - he came up again while I had hold of the prisoner, and saw me take the handkerchief from his trousers, which he owned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Covent-garden Theatre, and just by the snuff-maker's I saw the handkerchief laying - the officer came and took me as I was going back to call on a young man.</p>

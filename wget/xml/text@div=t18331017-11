            . I was on duty at Mile-end, as a policeman, on Sunday morning, the 8th of September, and observed about four o'clock the three prisoners; Marryatt was standing at the prosecutor's window, with the shutter slipped on one side; it had been forced on one side over the other one - Wood was standing by the side of him taking things from Marryatt, and Green was standing on the other side of him; Wood seemed more towards the curb, looking out; there was plenty of light shone on the house, but I was standing in the shade of the wall - I saw it distinctly; Wood at last perceived me, as I suppose, and they moved off up the road on the same side a few yards, when they came to the grating of a drain; I saw Wood and Marryatt step over the grating, they seemed putting things down the grating and trampling on the things with their feet; I then moved across towards them; Marryatt and Wood were on the grating, and Green a little further down the road; I immediately went across towards them, and after a sharp run for a few yards, I laid hold of two of them - Green was the first who ran; they all three ran at a pretty sharp pace for a few yards - I laid hold of Wood and Marryatt, and Green was then standing under a gas lamp at a very short distance from us - sergeant Harrington came up and laid hold of Marryatt from me; I then pulled out my rattle and sprung it; another officer came up, and I saw Green run off - I pointed to him, and the other officer followed him up the road; he was taken to Mile-end station-house - I found him there in about a quarter of an hour; I found two snuff-boxes on Wood, and one in his breast coat pocket; and on the place where Green stood, I picked up two or three more snuff-boxes, and a cigar case; and on the grating, I found this piece of broken china pipe;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170015"></xptr>I marked two of the boxes; when I laid hold of Marryatt, he said, "It is all right Bob, let us go;" I have known him some time; he said, "Let us go, we have only got a few boxes;" Green said as we were going to the station-house, that he had got into a mess, and must get out of it as well as he could, and he should answer no questions to criminate himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was anybody else present when Wood was searched? A. Yes; I never had any quarrel with either of the prisoners - not the slightest; I never had any transaction with them, except when on duty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ARNOLD. Q. You were standing in the dark shade of the wall? A. Yes; I was the width of the road from them - not exactly opposite them, but within a very few yards of being opposite; it was less than an hundred yards - I will swear it was not seventy yards; I did not measure it; Wood and Green stood with their faces towards me - I did not stay long to look at them - perhaps it might be two or three minutes - it was about as much as a minute, but then, mind, I never lost sight of them - it was Green said, that he had got into a mess; I did not say I believed he said so - I said, he said so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any doubt he said so? A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Marryatt. Q. When you conveyed me and another to the station-house, how many boxes were produced there? A. Three; I saw three taken from Wood - two were in his coat pocket, and one in his breast coat pocket; I cannot say how many were put down on the paper as being taken from Wood by the night officer - I did not put it down; only one was taken from you, the prosecutor could not identify it, and it was given back to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think this one is it? A. I think it is - I did not search you at all.</p>

             (policeman). I followed my brother-officer - it was about five o'clock - I saw three men at the shop window; in front of the shop window - I kept my eye on two of them, they walked away very fast - I never lost sight of Marryatt and Wood till they were taken into custody - I don't know anything about Green - immediately after they were taken, on the way to the station-house, I saw Wood drop this box from his left hand; Marryatt directly said, "I am all right, you will find nothing on me;" and just before we got to the station-house, Marryatt said, "We are hard up," or words to that effect - immediately after they were taken, I brought them back close to the house - I observed the shutter pulled out, and forced on one side - a pane of glass was broken; I noticed the window inside, it was lined with paper, and it was cleared as far as a hand could go in.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see Wood searched? A. I did; I saw one or two boxes found on him; I am not positive whether there was anything else found on him - Saunders searched him - he attempted to drop two in the street - I cannot say whether it was a foggy night; it was not very dark - it was not dark.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there any gas light? A. Yes, a pretty strong one.</p>
               <p>Marryatt. Q. How did you know the robbery was being committed? A. I had information of it - I saw Mr. Unwin there - I was with Saunders when I saw this.</p>
               <p>ISAAC UNWIN. These boxes are my property; I have no private mark on them; I have had them a long time in the house; I have had some of them ten years.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you buy them from any manufacturer? A. It was a long time since; there would be time for similar boxes to get into circulation.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the price of them? A. I sometimes sell them for one shilling each; this one would be eightpence.</p>
               <p>Green's Defence. I leave it entirely to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Marryatt to HARRINGTON. Q. How many boxes were produced to the magistrate? A. I don't know; I produced all I found; I found none on you - there was a tin tobacco-box, which you said belonged to you, and the magistrate ordered you to have it again - I cannot tell how many boxes Saunders told the magistrate he found on Wood - he did not tell the magistrate to my knowledge that he saw you throw a box away - no property was found on you.</p>
               <p>Wood's Defence. I leave it to my counsel.</p>

             I am the prisoner Green's brother, and a weaver; I live in Camden-gardens, Bethnal-green-road; he came home about one o'clock in the morning of Saturday the 7th of September, and went out again at four o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far is your home from this place? A. I suppose about a mile - he has two aunts living two miles from Romford; he was frequently in the habit of going to see them on a Sunday.</p>

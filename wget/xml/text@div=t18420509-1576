                  </hi>. I am groom in the service of Mr. William Webster, of Bell and Horn-lane, Old Brompton. About six o'clock, on Thursday night, the 28th of April, I shut the hen-house up, behind my master's house—he had three fowls there—I missed them next morning—they have since been found—the prisoner is a private watchman—he had a key that would open master's gate, but we had a lock put on that this key would not open—I do not know whether he would have an opportunity of seeing the fowlsat my master's.</p>

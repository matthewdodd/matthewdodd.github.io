               <p>Q. You knew that your husband had a tin box. - A. Yes, and the last time I saw it it was in Mr. Barnfield's hands, he always carried it about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he had any money in this tin box, on the day he met with his accident. - A. I am sure of it, he shewed it me, it was a very remarkable thing for him to do so, I saw three seven shilling pieces in it, and I gave him change for a crown piece, I did not see it after the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the house fall in. - A. It fell in just after the bell rang eight in the evening.</p>

About<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170058"></xptr>one o'clock on the 28th my son came to me, told me that Mrs. Male the wife of Mr. Male was at the door, and wanted an order to see her her husband; I told my son to send her into me at the counting-house, she immediately came.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the prisoner called herself the widow of Male; the widow of the man who was crushed by these houses, who lay at the workhouse. - A. Yes, she said she wanted an order to go into the house to see her husband, that she had been there, they had refused to let her in without an order, which is the custom of the house, I gave the order; we had a good deal of conversation on the subject before she went over to the house; I asked her her whether it was true of the danger they were in, she stated that her husband came home a little after eight o'clock, that she represented to him what people said, what danger the houses were in, he flew in a great passion, said she was a great fool, she asked him if he meant to go on that way, he said he did not, he meant to go out all night and get drunk; she then took on, and said she had lost her daughter who was buried in the ruins; she had been over to the public house where the people had been very kind, and had given her the gown she had on her back, as the other was torn off being dug out of the ruins; I then asked her what stockings her daughter had on, she said her daughter had white stockings, I then told her the young woman that had been dug out of the ruins could not be her daughter who was lying dead at the house, she had black stockings; I then told her to go over to the house with this order, to see the body, and if the young woman was not her daughter to send the master of the house over to me; very soon after the master of the workhouse came over to me, and told me that the young woman was not her daughter; I went to the house and found the prisoner apparently in distress, taking on exceedingly, she said she had seen her husband, but she had not seen her daughter, I asked her what she would do with herself, she appeared far advanced in her pregnancy, I asked her how long she had to go, she said about three weeks, I told her she had better stay in the house till she was delivered, she said she was very much obliged to me, but if I would give her her husband's watch, and tin box with two seven shilling pieces and some silver which was taken from her husband, she would go to her sister who kept the Ship public house, Leadenhall-street; believing the story to be true, I directed the master of the public house, Mr. Chapman, to give her the money, I saw him open the box, I saw there were in it two bits of paper with two seven shilling pieces, I told her I did not think there was any watch; immediately upon the delivery of that she went away; I did not know at that time that Mrs. Male was taken from the ruins; after I found I was imposed upon, and being directed to the place where Mrs. Male was laying in bed from the bruises that she had received.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards found the real Mrs. Male. - A. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the witness that has just been called up. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you see the prisoner again. - A. I immediately left the spot with the officer, in hopes to find her, I turned up the alley where the workhouse is, I met the beadle, he told me he had seen Mrs. Male, he had been treating her with part of his dinner and beer; I went into the public house and charged her with being an impostor, of defrauding me of the tin box and fourteen shillings, I directed her to give me the money, or of course she would be searched; in the course of the time the beadle was gone she had changed one of the seven shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. You received the tin box and one seven shilling piece. - A. Yes, this is the same that she delivered over to me.</p>
               <p>Q. She persisted that she was the widow of this man. - A. She has always said that, she did before the lord mayor, the lord mayor remanded her for two days, in order for her to send to Chelmsford for her register.</p>

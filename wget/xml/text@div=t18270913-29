The prisoner was above six years in my service; she was my only female servant, and had the care of my plate.

            . I am servant to Mr. Muncaster, pawnbroker, Skinner-street - I know the prisoner perfectly well. I have a silver soup-ladle, pawned by her, on the 12th of January, for 30s., in the name of Pyne, Creed-lane; she described herself as a lodger - I have known her three or four years; it has never been redeemed since.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that her master had failed in lending her 1l., which he had promised, and she had pawned the ladle, depending on a friend to enable her to redeem it.</p>
               <p>MR. FLEMING. I paid her punctually, within a week of her wages being due; nothing was due to her in January - I have lent her money.</p>

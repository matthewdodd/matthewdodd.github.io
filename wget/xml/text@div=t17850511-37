               <p>I am servant to Dr. Burney, between six and seven in the morning, I came into my master's study, as I always do in a morning; whilst I was there opening the shutters, I heard a great noise, and I went to go down stairs, and I saw a table that stood at the bottom of the stairs thrown down, and the great kitchen poker laying along side of it, and a silver tea-pot and a silver salt cellar laying down altogether; when I saw that I ran up stairs directly to call my fellow servants, I begged them to come down, I ran down again, I saw a candle burning in the back parlour, and a poker jammed into the back parlour door, I ran up again; there is a door that goes out of the parlour into another room, this other room they had been endeavouring to break open, and they had left the poker in the door; then we went into the kitchen and we found the sash window open.</p>
               <p>Where did this communicate to? - Into a little area, the bar appeared as if nothing had been done to it; then a gentleman came over, and looking over the rails, says he, there is an iron bar sawn in two, and we found it was so, and there were two coat buttons laying in the area, the same time the bar was cut in three or four places; it was very easy to take that bar up and lay it down the same, the buttons were yellow; I had not been in that area the day before, it is not an area we go into frequently; I think I have seen those buttons before, upon the coat of a young man that lived there before, that was

               <p>The bar communicated with the area, I understand? - Yes, the sash was lifted up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know, Sir, whether that sash was fastened over night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Angel. Was that sash shut down when you went to bed? - Yes, but not fastened; there are iron bars go across the shutters, but there were no fastenings on one end, the shutters were not fastened only shut?</p>

               <p>I am a smith, I know Dr. Burney's house, and know this bar; I was sent for that morning.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observations how it was cut? - I observed this bar was cut at three or four separate times, and withinside to the best of my knowledge, because every time it was cut it was rusty, because the snow laid upon the ground, there is a difference between cutting a thing up-handed and down-handed; and when I got it home I examined it, and to the best of my knowledge it was cut withinside.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are you much employed in cutting bars that are fixed? - Very seldom.</p>
               <p>One of your reasons for thinking it was cut withinside was, that it was cut slanting? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that to the best of your knowledge, as a man of knowledge and experience, it is impossible from the outside to cut it in that way? - I think it is.</p>
               <p>Is not it necessary to cut it slanting, if it is to be laid on again? - It was cut close to the wall on the right hand.</p>
               <p>Did you ever cut through an iron bar with the assistance of aqua fortis? - No.</p>
               <p>Suppose a man was to take a sharp instrument to cut iron, and in order to make way, was to put aqua fortis? - It was cut with a saw.</p>
               <p>Over-handed or under-handed? - Under-handed.</p>
               <p>This is a bar over the area? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How wide is the open of the area to the street? - It may be a yard and quarter or half from the wall to the kirb stone of the area.</p>
               <p>How many bars are there over that? - That I never counted, I do not know; they run across the area.</p>
               <p>Then what may be the length of the opening? - About three yards long, or may be not so much.</p>
               <p>What distance distance may the bars be asunder? - About four or five inches may be not three, I did not measure.</p>
               <p>Were there more bars than one cut through? - No, it was cut as nigh as could be to the house, within four or five or six inches of the wall of the house, I think it was slanted from the wall, I would not be too positive, I did not take much notice.</p>
               <p>Which was the freshest part, the upper or the under? - The top part; the first part was rusty, the other was less rusty, and the other was quite clear; that appeared to me to have been done that morning.</p>
               <p>Could you form any probable guess how long before the other might have been done? - I could not; my judgment is it might be cut the night before, it had not the appearance of being cut some weeks longer, but a day or two longer.</p>

               <p>Was he examined in your presence? - Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110058"></xptr>What was found upon him? - Two parcels of money; the first was fifteen guineas in a purse, which appeared to me to be the foot of a silk stocking, I searched again, and in a little while after I found twenty-four guineas in another purse, which I should not have seen, but for a boy, who said he had dropped something green in his pocket; I had no conversation with him where he was going.</p>
               <p>(The money produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Let it lay on the table, if it is evidence, it lays there.</p>
               <p>Doctor Burney. This man had several times asked me for money; he had been in my house but three weeks before he asked for money, he had money several different times during the time he lived with me, and when he quitted my service he had but 43 s. to receive.</p>
               <p>(The buttons produced.)</p>
               <p>These are the buttons, one is broke in the shank; I was present at the prisoner's first examination, nothing particular passed at that time, but the circumstance of the money being found upon him.</p>
               <p>Did he give any account how he came by so much money? - He said he had saved it in his different services; he was asked, if he had ever shewn this money, or told anybody he had such a sum of money; he said no.</p>
               <p>Did anything else pass? - I do not recollect anything; he said he was going to France, in expectation of getting a place at France, through my son-in-law's interest, but he had no letters of recommendation from me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have in fact a son-in-law in France? - Yes.</p>

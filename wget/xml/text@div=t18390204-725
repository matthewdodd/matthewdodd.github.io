On the 8th of October last I took a quantity of booth-furniture from a fair, to Mr. Kimber, an ironmonger—I give him a sovereign a year for taking care of my things—there were five tilts, some green-baize, and trimmings—the prisoner had been in my service part of two years—I did not write this order—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—nor authorize any one to write any letter for the purpose of getting my property delivered to the prisoner, or to me—I never sent the prisoner with any letter or message to Mr. Kimber—I never received from the prisoner any of those tilts.</p>

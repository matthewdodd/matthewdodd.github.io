                  </hi>. I am a cab proprietor, at Long Lane, Bermondsey—I bought a dark-grey mare on 27th November—her tail was shortish then, and she had bad knees—I should say they had not been blistered—the prisoner came with her and another man, who, I have heard since, they call <hi rend="italic">Ginger Jarvis</hi>—I did not know him before—he asked if I would buy a horse—it came in a cart—the other man was driving—he said his name was Jones; that was the name on the cheque—I said the mare had got very bad knees, and asked how it occurred, and Jones said, "I was in Scotland, and I bought her, and put her into the railway truck, and getting her out of the truck she met with that accident, stumbled"—I replied that it ought not to be his loss, that the Railway Company ought to compensate him, and he said, "Unfortunately, one of my men led the mare out, and by that means I cannot make any claim on the company"—the prisoner was close by all the time—I told one of my men to got in the cart and go with Jones, to try her for a half-mile or three-quarters—the man did so, and when he brought her back I said I did not much like to buy a horse in that state, with such bad knees, and I said, "I won't give more than 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," for it took a long while to get well—he asked 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said she cost him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Scotland—I asked Jones where he lived, and he said, "Up near Victoria Park"—since then I have found that address to be false—the prisoner was within hearing all the time—I gave Jones a cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to order—Jones gave my man a shilling, and I gave the prisoner a shilling to give his stableman, at home—they left the cart in the yard, and came back, in three or four hours, with a pony—I was asked to buy the pony—they would have filled my stable with horses, if I had kept on with them—I did not buy the pony.</p>

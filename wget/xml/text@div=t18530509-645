                  </hi>. I live in Church-street, Greenwich, and sell boots and shoes. I missed two odd boots—they are here—I have got the fellows of them—I know these boots—I saw them safe on Thursday night, 7th April, about 8 o'clock, and they were missed at 10 o'clock—the fellow boots were beside them on the shelf—each boot if worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the shelf on which they were, is 1 should think three or four paces inside the shop—the door is open—the shop is never left without some one in it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 186). On Saturday, 9th April, I was called to the shop of Mr. Sharp, a pawnbroker, at Deptford, about half past 12 o'clock in the day, I found Catherine Taylor there—the pawnbroker gave these two boots over to her, and I took her with them—the pawnbroker said he had had a description of these boots given to him—that Catherine Taylor came to pawn them, and he would not take them in—I asked her where she got them; she stated they belonged to Taylor, and that he sent her to pawn them—Taylor is the man she is living with.—I told her she must go with me—I took her to the station—I knew the two prisoners before, I have seen them together—I know they were living together—I knew where Taylor lived—I went to Pope's-buildings—I did not find him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Can you pledge yourself that they are not man and wife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I go by their own words—on their examination before the Magistrate, Catherine said so, when she was asked whether she was married to Taylor—they were not both discharged in the first instance, Taylor was—I did not see him the second time—the pawnbroker gave the shoes back to Catherine and said, "I will not take them in"—he had told me at the shop door that he had had information given him—Catherine was then in the side door, the private entrance—the pawnbroker spoke to me at the shop door, part of the conversation was out of her hearing—when he went in he gave her the boots back, and told her he could not take them in; he believed they were stolen property—she said, "They belong to Taylor, he gave them me to pawn"—I know the prisoners keep one lodging house; I believe they keep two, one in Pope's-buildings and one in Mill-lane—I know that very humble and poor characters lodge there—I do not know that it is common for poor persons who go to seek a lodging to leave part of their apparel in pledge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, R</hi> 2). I know the lodging house, No. 5, Mill-lane, very well—I am one of the inspectors of lodging houses—it is a registered house—I know the man Taylor, and the woman very well; they lived together in that house, and passed as man and wife; I believed them to be man and wife—on Saturday, 9th April, I was at that house in the morning, but I did not know anything about the robbery then—in the afternoon, at half past 3 o'clock, I had information from the inspector on duty at Greenwich—in consequence of that I went to No. 5, Mill-lane—I did not find Taylor there—I went to the house next door, which is also a lodging house; and there, under a bed in the front room at the top of the house, I found Taylor—that is not one of his lodging houses, it is kept by a man of the name of Darling, who is also a marine store dealer—I told Taylor that he must come out and go to the station; that his wife was in custody, charged with having some stolen boots in her possession, which she had offered to pawn—he said he had them from a man who went there to lodge the previous night, and that he had given him 35. and his night's lodging for the boots, and being short of cash in the morning, he had sent the woman to pawn them—he said the party, or the female, I am not sure which, but I had motioned that his wife was locked up—he did not say wife—he said, "I did not know they were stolen, or it is not likely I should have sent them to pawn so near home"—I then</p>

               <p>took him to the station—these are the two odd boots—they were produced at the station—one of them is much longer than the other—on their being produced the inspector said to him, "Well, Taylor, how about these boots?"—he then repeated what he had stated to me, that he had given a man 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and his night's lodging for them—the inspector said, "How do you account for their being two odd boots? "he said, "I did not notice them particularly, the man took them off his feet, and I gave him an old pair to put on"—these appear to have been worn—the soles are dirty, but there has never been a lace in the holes—I believe the two prisoners were taken before the Magistrate, but I was not present.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do not you know that the man was discharged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was discharged on Monday, the 11th—the Magistrate remanded the woman till Thursday, and gave instructions that the man should be taken—I told Mr. Trail that I could not find him, and he took the woman's own recognizance to appear that day fortnight—I apprehended the man in the second instance—I met him on Deptford Bridge on the 19th—I said to him, "Taylor, where are you going? "he said, "I heard I was wanted; I was going to the station to give myself up"—I returned with him to the station—he was going towards the station when I saw him, and was within 200 yards of it—when the female was discharged on her own recognizance she went back to him—between the time of the man being discharged, and my meeting him on the 19th, he had been at home—I had spoken to him in his own house—the next house to his is kept by a man named Darling—I saw Taylor there going under the bed—I said, "You must come out, and go with me"—I know that poor persons sometimes leave articles for their lodging.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant</hi>).

               <p>CHARLES FLACKNEY. On the 3d of April, about eight o'clock at night, I was within eighty or ninety yards of my own door, in <placeName id="t18280410-245-crimeloc1305">Bethnal-green-road</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you sober? A. I was - I had been to four public-houses, and drank at all of them, but very little; I went to two public-houses in Holborn, and then to the Black Dog, public-house, Bethnal-green: I went to two houses before I met him; my apprentice fetched me from the Black Dog about eight o'clock; the prisoner followed me out, saying he would go home with me; I said I would go alone, but he said he would go, as he had come so far. I was certainly the worse for liquor, but not drunk.</p>

            . I am a weaver. Between eight and nine o'clock on the 3d of April I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running - he stooped down at Short's window, and I heard something chink on the iron bars; I went home, and told my father, who sent me there next morning, and I saw three sovereigns down the area - I saw Capon, and told him of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not rather dark? A. Yes- several people were running, but the prisoner was first.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's apprentice; my mistress sent me to look for my master; I saw him and the prisoner sitting at the Black Dog; I went home, and told mistress master would not come - she sent me there again; I found the prisoner still with him - the prisoner came out just after us, and kept behind us till we got near my master's; my master was talking; I saw the prisoner spring from my master's left side to his right, but I did not see him take anything; my master turned round, and called Stop thief! the prisoner ran by Mr. Short's, and was taken two doors beyond there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there people before the prisoner? A. Yes, but not running; he was not tipsy, but a little fresh; for he could run after the prisoner.</p>

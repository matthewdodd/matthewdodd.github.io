                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at Southall in the precinct of Norwood. On Sunday morning, 11th June, I left my cottage with my wife about half-past ten o'clock—I locked the house up and put the key into my pocket—I returned about two in the afternoon, found some panes broken in the window, which was unbolted—a person could put their hand in through the broken glass and unbolt it—some provisions had been brought from the pantry into the front room, and a portion had been eaten or taken away—one tea-caddy had been broken open and another had been unlocked by a false key—I missed two silver watches, two gold seals, two keys, and a ring; a seal with "W. H." on it, a brooch, an eye-glass, several teaspoons, some black clothes, a silk handkerchief, and shawl, one sovereign, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver—I gave information to the police.</p>

On Sunday morning, 11th June, I met the prisoner and two other men going along the canal, in the direction of Bennett's cot<lb></lb>tage, and about one o'clock I met him again alone, as though returning from that direction—I know him very well—I cannot say whether he had any<lb></lb>thing with him the second time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 99.) On 11th June I heard of the robbery, and went to Bennett's cottage, which adjoins the canal—I traced some footmarks from the canal side, five or six yards from the back door, to a field and to a hole in the edge—I went into the garden—I noticed top pane of glass broken and the bolt pulled down, and the bottom pane broken and the bolt slipped up—on going into the house I saw the things all turned upside down and scattered about—my brother constable apprehended the prisoner on the 14th—I took him to the place, and put his foot down close alongside the old footmark, and they corresponded—I noticed the impression of pretty well every nail in the shoe—it was hardly so plain when we came back again, because there had been a little rain, but the length of the foot exactly corresponded.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Primer.

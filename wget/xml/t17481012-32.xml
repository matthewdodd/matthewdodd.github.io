            . I keep a house in White Cross Street, at the Angel, and sell old clothes; on the thirty-first of August, the two prisoners came to my house about five in the afternoon, and she had her apron tucked up, and she opened a little bundle of linnen, for she had divided them into several parcels, and she took the bundle out of her apron: The man [Presgrove] stood at the threshold of the door, and she said it was her husband, and she said come in Will ; he did not come in directly, but stood leaning upon the hatch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bring you all the things that are in this band-box?</p>
               <p>Webb. Yes; and a great many more.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give her for them?</p>
               <p>Webb. I cannot tell whether I gave her 50 s within one, or one shilling over 50 s.</p>
               <p>Q. So you paid her either 49 s. or 51 s?</p>
               <p>Webb. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her how she came by these things?</p>
               <p>Webb. Yes; and she said the lady was dead that owned them, and that the linnen was all to be sold; and that the cap belonging to the laced handkerchief, the lady was laid out in; I had no suspicion of her coming dishonestly by them, for she said to the man, she believed she should not make her money of the things, and she consulted with him about it, and she said to him, well, shall I take it? and he consented to every thing that she said, she did nothing without his consent , and she had a blue woollen apron, and she said you must buy this too, for I had them all together: this gave me a suspicion, for it was not likely that the laced goods, and the woollen apron should come together, [the band-box of linnen was produced]</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these things?</p>
               <p>Webb. If they were to be kept by any body, they are worth six pounds, and to be sold to any body to sell them again, they are worth about three pounds; I heard there was an advertisement with a reward for these things, and upon that, I sent Mrs. Leach with them to Mr. Jackson's, and I said, though the gentleman had offered a reward.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174810120027"></xptr> I thought it was enough for him to lose so much, and I would not take the reward.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the gentleman paid you the money you paid for the things?</p>
               <p>Webb . Yes; and I did not desire any more .</p>

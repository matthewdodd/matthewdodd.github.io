               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. She is a bad person. On Monday the 13th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, me and my husband were coming<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120050"></xptr>home with another soldier, we met this prisoner in Rope-maker-street; she asked me to have something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before - A. Yes; we went to the Jack of Newbury the corner of Bunhill-row, to drink with her; we had half a pint of gin between four of us; I told her if she would go along with me I would give her a drop in return. We went to the White-horse in Old-street; we had half a pint of rum there; then there were three of us; just as I called for it I fell down in a fit, I am subject to fits; when I came out of the fit I was very cold, and while I was putting my hand in my pocket to pay for the rum, I went into another fit; the purse fell out of my hand; when I came to I called for my purse; the landlord gave it me; when I went home, this good body went home with me; she held my left side, where I put my purse in. I went into my own house, this body was with me, and when I arose in the morning my purse was gone; I did not feel for it on the over night.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you accuse her with it - A. Because there was nobody in my company when I left the public house; my purse contained seven shillings in silver and a meat ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your purse again - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Are you really married to this man you call your husband - A. Yes; at Shoreditch church.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this you were coming home - A. Between ten and eleven at night; we had been to East Smithfield, where we had two pots of beer before.</p>
               <p>Q. I should like to know how much you drank that day - can you tell me how a decent woman should go with your husband, invited by a bad girl to drink - A. She asked me to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whatever a person is, if they ask you, you drink with them, good or bad - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are subject to fits - you put your hand in your pocket, and took out your pocket-book to pay for the rum, and down you fell dead drunk, and when you had recovered from your fit you was obliged to be led home by this good body - this woman was living in the neighbourhood - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were in fits the whole night - what do you take generally for your fits - A. I never go to the doctor.</p>
               <p>Q. Now if you were so bad in the fit, how could you tell that you put the purse into your left-hand pocket - I know I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not walk steady, was not that the reason of your being led home - A. No, it was the fit.</p>

I was met in the footpath in the field by the two prisoners at the bar. I saw they had two short bludgeons in their hands; I did not much like the looks of them. I passed them; I met them near some hay-stacks; I said something low that I wished them a good evening, or something of that sort; they said something low in reply, I cannot say what; I walked pretty fast across that field; I had a great mind to run, but was afraid; I looked behind me several times going across the field, and I saw them turn up towards the hay-stacks: I came forward and walked pretty fast across that field; just as I came out into the next field there was a gateway but no gate; I saw one of them come through a gap in the hedge; he ran across the road and ran up to me, and took hold of my collar with both hands; knowing him to be one of the persons I was a good deal afraid, thinking the other man was near; I did not see the other directly; he said,</p>
               <p>"have you</p>
               <p>"got any money in your pocket?" I rather smiled and said, what do you mean by asking whether I have any money in my pocket? then he said,</p>
               <p>"d - n your blood, I will have it</p>
               <p>"before you go any further:" I told him I had got but a little in my pocket; I took my purse out of my left-hand pocket, there was a guinea and a half guinea in it; I held it out to him, and he took it; he said,</p>
               <p>"d - n your</p>
               <p>"blood, you have got a watch:" I said, yes, I had; while these words were passing, I looked over my shoulder, and saw the other man that I had seen before come out of the same gap; he came up with his stick in his hand and directly struck me over the left leg, and said,</p>
               <p>"d - n your blood;" the other then took the watch out of my pocket: the second man kept beating me over the leg; just as the first had got my watch out of my pocket, I was turning my head round, and the other that had been beating me before, hit me a blow upon the temples that brought me to the ground. I lay a little upon the ground, my senses were gone for a considerable time; I got up; after I recovered myself I found them both standing by me; they swore I had more money in my pocket; they searched my waistcoat and breeches pockets; the fellow swore all the while, and kept beating me; after that the second man that beat me, said,</p>
               <p>"d - n your</p>
               <p>"blood, why don't you go along?" the other had hold of my collar at the same time. I said, I could not go while he held me by the collar; then he let me go, and the other said,</p>
               <p>"d - n</p>
               <p>"your blood why don't you go along," and then they went away.</p>

               <p>Hillier. I took particular notice of both their faces; I always said, I should know them, if ever I should see them again.</p>

            's?</p>
               <p>Hillier. I saw one of them in a back room over at the publick house; I knew him immediately; I afterwards saw him before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was that?</p>
               <p>Hillier. Bevans. I immediately charged him in the office with being one of the men that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was it?</p>
               <p>Hillier. A double case silver watch; it had my own name engraved in the inside of the case, and the date of the year 1756, it had a steel chain, a seal, and a brass key.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you going from Hampstead to London, or from London to Hampstead?</p>
               <p>Hillier. I was coming from Hampstead to London?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130031"></xptr>Q. You say you met two men, they were going then from London to Hampstead.</p>
               <p>Hillier. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You passed them instantly, so could have no great view of them then?</p>
               <p>Hillier. What made me take more notice of them was, I saw they had two short bludgeons.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time of night the light was not good?</p>
               <p>Hillier. It was not day-light nor dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not be half after nine o'clock?</p>
               <p>Hillier. I will not swear to a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were the hay-stacks off?</p>
               <p>Hillier. Only a small distance.</p>
               <p>Q. You walked pretty fast?</p>
               <p>Hillier. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance might this gateway be from the place you first met them at?</p>
               <p>Hillier. About four hundred or perhaps five hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. The men you met were behind you then as they were going a different way.</p>
               <p>Hillier. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see any thing of them?</p>
               <p>Hillier. When I got across the field.</p>
               <p>Q. You said one came out of the gap?</p>
               <p>Hillier. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know which that was?</p>
               <p>Hillier. Bevan.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance of time did you see the other?</p>
               <p>Hillier. In a minute, or minute and an half after.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see where that other man came from.</p>
               <p>Hillier. As near as I could see, it was the same place; I saw Bevan's coming before Jenning's some time before he came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he walking or running?</p>
               <p>Hillier. A running. I did not see him till the moment he came out of the gap of the hedge.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you from that gap then?</p>
               <p>Hillier. Between twenty and thirty yards, I believe.</p>

There had been a robbery committed the night before Bevan and Jennings were taken; they were taken the beginning of August; a man had been taken before that, who answered the description that Mr. Hilliard had given of Jennings: when Mr. Hilliard saw him, he said he was not the man; he was therefore discharged. I was at the office after the prisoners were taken; Bevan only was put to the bar. Bevan called for Jenning's; when he came, the prosecutor said he was the other man who was concerned in the robbery, and particularly, he said he was the man who beat him.</p>

            . I am hostler to Mrs. Bevan.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Lord Pomfret having any horses of Mrs. Bevan, on the 3d of July?</p>
               <p>Hughes. Yes, it was on Monday, the horses went out of the yard a little after four; they went off about half after four, and I returned into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did Bevan return with his horses that night?</p>
               <p>Hughes. Between nine and ten; above half past nine.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose when the horses go with a gentleman to Hounslow, they generally stay some time to bait?</p>
               <p>Hughes. Yes, they generally go into the stable and bait, and wash their shoulders, and come gently back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they seem to have come gently back?</p>
               <p>Hughes. They came in cool. The prisoner took off the horses after they came back; watering and cleaning, and every thing, takes up about three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him, I suppose, after that?</p>
               <p>Hughes. No.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to be so certain that it was the 3d of July?</p>
               <p>Hughes. Because we book every bey that goes out; I have the book here.</p>
               <p>Q. Who books it?</p>
               <p>Hughes. My mistress books it, it is put upon the slate, I carry up the slate, and she books it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was on the slate?</p>
               <p>Hughes. I believe, two horses and a saddle horse to my Lord Pomfret.</p>
               <p>Court. (inspecting the book) Is this your mistress's hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Hughes. I do not know whether it is my mistress's or Mr. Brown's.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing about keeping this book yourself?</p>
               <p>Hughes. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gascoin. Are you clear that it was on the 3d of July?</p>
               <p>Gascoin. I am very clear of it. My Lord Pomfret came to town on the Sunday before, which was the second.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury to Hughes. Can you write?</p>
               <p>Hughes. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why are you so particular to the 3d of July, more than any other day?</p>
               <p>Hughes. Because I set it down on the slate, and it is carried up at night, and put in the book, and rubbed out of the slate.</p>
               <p>Court. At half after four they set out.</p>
               <p>Hughes. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they are an hour and quarter going to Hounslow, that brings them there about a quarter before six. When you send to Hounslow,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130033"></xptr> how long do you allow the boy to stay there with the horses?</p>
               <p>Hughes. An hour, or an hour and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from half after four, should you not reasonably expect this young man home before nine o'clock?</p>
               <p>Hughes. No, we always allow the boys four hours and a half to go to Hounslow; that is the usual time.</p>
               <p>Counsel. They do not usually come home very fast?</p>
               <p>Hughes. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has the carriage back?</p>
               <p>Hughes. Ourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Then perhaps the boys may stay some time to get something back?</p>
               <p>Hughes. As they like.</p>

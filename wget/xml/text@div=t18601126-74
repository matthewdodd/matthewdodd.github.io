                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, L</hi> 2). I took Renwick into custody about half-past ten, on the morning of the 21st in Vauxhall-road—that was at the time the other two prisoners were being conveyed from Tower-street station to Lambeth-street—he was following them with a woman, who I knew to be connected with Bell—I told him I should charge him with being concerned, with the other two men, in committing a burglary, at 7, Mill-street—he said, "I know nothing of it, I know who the other man is that was with them, I saw them all three leave the George public-house, in Castle-street, Leicester-square, at half-past six, the evening previous"—he said, "Give me a fair chance"—I said, "I will, I will put you along with other prisoners"—I did put him with five others—I then took the witness Taylor into the yard; the witness Hall not being present at the time—Taylor went and picked out Renwick—I told him to put his hand on his shoulder, and he did, and Hall went and did the same thing afterwards—the same five persons were present then.</p>

Q.</hi> Was I not seen by Hill before I was placed by the others? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he did not see you through a window—he saw nothing of you till he was brought into the yard—I went to the George public-house, and after<lb></lb>wards told you before the Magistrate, that the landlord said you were there between seven and eight in the evening; but he could not say whether you were there between the hours of eight and half-past eleven, but you were there again at half-past eleven—you said nothing to that, but referred me to the potman.</p>

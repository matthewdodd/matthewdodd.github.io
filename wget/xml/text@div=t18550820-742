                  </hi>. I am a musician, and live at No. 12, Fallow-street North, Kingsland-road. About 20 minutes past 12 o'clock, on Monday night, 2nd July, I was at the Eagle Tavern, in front of the bar—I had an umbrella under my arm—while putting my hand into my pocket to pay for something, I observed the prisoner Jones taking my watch; he put his hand into my left waistcoat pocket, and took it—it was fastened with the Albert chain, which I have on now—I felt the chain hanging down without the watch—I said to Jones, "I think you have got my watch;" he said, "I have got nothing of the kind"—I seized him by the arm—he struggled to get away, went on the opposite side of the bar, out at the door, and ran across the road—I went after him, shouting, "Stop thief!" and he was stopped by a waterman and a policeman—it was an old fashioned silver hunting watch, double cased. I have never seen it since—I did not see Jones with it; he had his hand clenched, and there was a crowd of people in front of the bar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brass finisher, of No. 18, Gloucester-terrace, Whitechapel. I was in Mr. Edroff's company, at the bar of the Eagle Tavern, in conversation with him—the moment we got in, Jones rushed up to Mr. Edroff, took his watch out of his pocket, and then rushed past me towards the prisoner Roberts—he passed something to him, and he turned round to some females who were there—I did not see him take the watch—I rushed up to Roberts, who was standing at the end of the bar, about three yards from Mr. Edroff—I thought I saw something like a silver watch pass from the shorter prisoner to the taller one.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When Mr. Edroff said that he had lost his watch, and charged a person next him with stealing it, did not you hear that person indignantly deny having anything to do with the robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not hear him say anything; I was about three or four yards away—there were fifty or sixty people there, men and women, all carousing together round the bar, and drinking—I do not think that there were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185508200010"></xptr>
               <p>people between me and Edroff—it is a very large bar—I will not swear that there was not a space of three or four yards between me and the forty or fifty people in front of the bar—I should not like to be too positive that I saw something in Jones's hand; I did not see anything distinctly—I can<lb></lb>not swear positively that I saw the watch in his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able to tell whether, when you saw the hand of Jones, it contained anything, or whether it was empty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It contained something, because I saw him pass something to the other—his hand was closed, so that I could not distinguish what it was; there was something in it, but I saw nothing but his hand—he passed up to the tall prisoner, who appeared to me to turn round to seven or eight women who were at the door, and the short one ran out at the door—I could not see what the tall prisoner handed to the females—I kept him in sight till a policeman came, and told him I believed that he had got the watch, and he was taken into custody—he said that he had not got it, or had not had it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">N</hi> 364). I was about twenty yards from the Eagle Tavern, heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and ran after the prisoner, who was running in the direction of the City-road, from the Eagle Tavern—he was about five yards from the Eagle when I first saw him—Edroff was running after him, hallooing, "Stop thief!" he was stopped by the water<lb></lb>man at the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stand, and I took him into custody—he said, "You fool, what did you catch hold of me for? I was running after the thief"—I said, "You are the man, I never lost sight of you"—the other prisoner was taken by another constable who is not bound over—I did not see him taken, bat I saw him shortly afterwards—I went back to the Eagle, and he was iden<lb></lb>tified by the prosecutor.</p>

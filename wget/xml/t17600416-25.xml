            . I live in Cockspur-Street, St. Martin's parish. I lost the goods mentioned in the indictment. I advertised them, and in about a week after a gentleman came and told me the persons that robbed me, as he supposed, were before justice Welch; I went there and saw the prisoner; she had one of my handkerchiefs about her neck. She took it off and I swore to it. She said she had another that hung upon her door at home. She owned she bought them of the two men cast last sessions, Guest and Smith. I think at first she said she gave three-pence each, but at last she said, she gave a shilling each; I gave half a crown for them myself to the wholesale merchant, but that about her neck I had the misfortune to tear down about a quarter of a yard.</p>

               <p>S. Stafford. No, she did not, but came with one of them on when she was sent for to the justice.</p>

            . I live at the Kings arms, Oxford-Road. I have known the prisoner three or four years; she did live in my neighbourhood, but has lately gone into this way of buying and selling old cloaths. Had she known the handkerchiefs to have been stolen she would not have bought them. What she has done I believe was through ignorance.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bilson. I live by the Seven-Dials; I have known her upwards of sixteen years; she nursed me of three children; now she sells old cloaths in a cellar, in Monmouth-Street. I believe her to be a very honest woman.</p>

I went to bed. I did not go to sleep for some time. About a quarter before one I heard a knock at the street door, and then another knock at the street door. About one o'clock the watch was going past one; he called me and said the shop was robbed. I got out of bed, and came down stairs in my shirt. I found the things were gone, and the window was cleared in front.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the person get in - A. By making a way through the shutters, and getting into the shop. The shop was entirely open; I lost fifteen pair of shoes out of the shop, and a pair of boots.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know anything of the prisoner - A. Yes, he is a neighbour of mine; he lives right opposite, and keeps an old iron, rag shop, and sells old clothes old clothes. And while I was contriving to fasten the shutters, the constable of the lower liberty came to me, and said, what is the matter; I said, my shop has been robbed; he said, is it a shoemaker's shop; he then said, the goods and the thief is at the watchhouse.</p>

            . I am the patrol of Hatton Garden. I took the prisoner a little after one o'clock on the 25th of March last. I was at the top of Hatton Garden; I heard a comical noise; it seemed to me to be towards Leather-lane, up Hatton Wall. I looked up Hatton Wall; I saw but one man coming along, that was the prisoner. I saw him have a bundle under his right arm. I asked him where he was going with the bundle. He told me I might see if I had a mind to go with him. I asked him what he had got in his bundle; he said, a parcel of old shoes. I said, it is an unseasonable hour to carry a bundle at this time, where are you going with it. I understood him to say Saffron Hill. I said to him, are you going to Clerkenwell; he said, yes. I took him to the watchhouse, and when I got him to Hatton Garden<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200059"></xptr>he threw the bundle from under his arm, kicked it, and said, take it. I still kept hold of him; I said I will take it, and you too. I called a watchman; I told him to take the bundle to the watchhouse; he did, and I took the prisoner to the watchhouse. The watchhouse is in Little Saffron-hill. When we got into Saffron-hill he threw some shoes out of his bosom; he said, take them, you'll get more by them than you will by me. I told the watchman to pick them up. I told the prisoner I meaned to take them and him to the watchhouse. The watchman took them up. I kept hold of the prisoner all the time. The watchman brought the shoes to the watchhouse, and I took the prisoner.</p>

            . I am the watchman. I produce the shoes that I picked up. These are the three shoes that were thrown out of his bosom, and these are the shoes that were in the bundle. I accompanied Hancock to the watchhouse with him. In going to the watchhouse he said the shoes would be of more service to us than taking of him.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BFNNING. I am the watchman that gave the alarm to Mr. Palmer. I am the watchman of Baldwyn's-gardens. About one o'clock, as I was going round, I saw Mr. Palmer's shutter was broken, the grove of the shutter was cut; these holes were bored in the shutter. This is part of the shutter. They put their arm through, and took what they could out, I suppose. I found the shutter broken; this piece of wood is part of the shutter. When I went to the door, I found the knocker of the door tied to the scraper with a rope; I ent the rope, and called Mr. Palmer down stairs, and let him know of it, and two officers were at the door; they enquired what was the matter. I told them the shop had been robbed; they said, they had got the man and the property. They came to the house, saw Mr. Palmer, and took him to see the property.</p>

            . I was constable of the night at the watchhouse. I searched the prisoner. I found more shoes in his breeches and in his bosom, in his pocket four gimblets, and this iron crow, it is a sawyers dog; the gimblets fit the holes in the shutter. This piece of board was quite out of the shutter; it laid on the stone.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the shoes - A. They are all mine; they are bespoke shoes; they have the names of the customers on them. They cost me five pounds.</p>

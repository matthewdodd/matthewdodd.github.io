I watched the loft where the corn was kept; about four in the afternoon I saw Kelly's boy come into the yard with the cart; I knew the boy and the cart, it was Kelly's cart. He

             the cart under Mr. Isaac's shed, in the yard of the Roebuck; presently afterwards I saw Kelly come; Kelly made a place in the front of the cart, he cleared the front of the cart which was then covered with rags and iron. In the course of five minutes I saw Beadle come with these oats that I have in the sack here; he come out of Mr. Isaac's stable adjoining the shed, with a sack which I afterwards found containing oats. He put it into the cart; Kelly was by at the time, he stood at the hind part of the cart with his back towards me; I was concealed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether any payment was made - A. No, I did not. After the oats were delivered in the cart, the cart was immediately drawn out of the yard; the sack was left in the front of the cart as it was put. I saw Kelly cover the sack with the rags and iron, and Beadle stood by the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the cart go out of the yard - A. Yes, a few yards from the Roebuck. I stopped Kelly and the cart; I told Kelly he was my prisoner, he asked me what for, I told him for receiving the corn belonging to

I apprehended Beadle as he was on the premises doing his work two or three hours afterwards; Beadle was by when I took the oats out of the cart; he heard what I charged Kelly with; Mr. Isaacs ordered me to take Beadle into custody; I charged him with giving this man the corn; he said there was nothing amiss, there was nothing broke.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Does any person keep oats in the stable besides yourself - A. No.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Flower, and live in Church-lane, Whitechapel. On Saturday, the 26th of Oct., at twenty minutes to one o'clock in the night (our shop had not been shut up above a quarter of an hour) the prisoner came in with a penny in his hand, leaned one arm over the counter, and stared very much at me, as if to frighten me—he dropped the penny, and with both hands made a grasp at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had put on the counter—he took the whole up, but dropped half a crown—I had made it up in piles of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I screamed out—my husband ran after him—I described him to the policeman last Sunday morning, and saw him afterwards at the station-house in Spitalfields—I am</p>

               <p>quite certain he is the man—his appearance was impressed on my memory from the alarm I was in—he went to speak on the Sunday night, and, from his manner and appearance, I am positive he is the man—he had a white jacket on.</p>

                  </hi>. I was near the parlour door facing the shop when this matter occurred—I saw the man taking up the money in his hand—he laid down a penny, ran out of the shop, and ran away—the prisoner it the man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I saw the prisoner on the Saturday night, about half-past eleven o'clock, in High-street, Whitechapel, dressed as he is at present—between twelve and one I was standing near Whitechapel church, and heard a cry of "Stop thief!" in the direction of Mr. Flower's house—I saw a man running—he crossed the road from Spectacle-alley to Angel-alley—he was about fourteen yards from me—I gained on him in Angel-alley—he turned into Went worth-street and George-yard, and I lost light of him there—Mr. Flower came up to me in George-yard—I did not see the man's face—I noticed his manner of running—I am well acquainted with the prisoner, and his manner of running—the man ran like the pri<lb></lb>soner, but several others run in the same way—he winds a little, he does nut run straight—he was not dressed as I had seen the prisoner dressed an hour before, but as I have seen the prisoner dressed at former times—he had been dressed so for some time past—when I saw him an hour before be bad a jacket the same as he wears now, and appeared to be going home—Mrs. Flower described the man she had seen, to three or four of us; and from her description, I looked after the prisoner, but did not find him—the man who ran away had a corduroy waistcoat, with a kind of whitish fustian sleeves—I know Hearne—he very much resembles the prisoner—I have seen him since the robbery—he was dressed very much as the person I was running after—he asked me when he saw me on Wednesday, "Do you know me?"—I said, "No"—he said, "It showed you had not s——in your eyes"—he is just about the prisoner's height, and the same description—he and the prisoner know each other—I cannot say they are intimate—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner five or six weeks before he was taken, dressed as I saw Hearne—he told me he had been hopping.</p>

               <p>on Saturday night—he said he was not, that he was at Gage's public-house having some beer with <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Sullivan—he said he was living with his mother in the back alley of Houndsditch, and he was at home and in bed at half-past eleven.</p>

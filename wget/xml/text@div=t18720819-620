                  </hi>. I am a fireman on board the steam ship Antenor, which on the 11th of July was lying in the Victoria Docks—on that even<lb></lb>ing I met a number of the crew at a public-house near, kept by Mr. Corduroy—the prisoner and the deceased were there, and I saw the deceased afterwards have a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with one man outside—he was the quarter-master on board the boat—I stayed in the house from 8 o'clock till the shutting up time—the deceased had been drinking, but was able to knock about and <hi rend="italic">row</hi> as well as the rest—I don't think he was either sober or drunk but he was in his shirt sleeves—about 10 o'clock there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with a lot in the street, but I did not go outside the door—I did not see the prisoner do anything, but as soon as Bates came in he began <hi rend="italic">rowing</hi> with us the same as he had done with the persons outside—the prisoner said nothing whatever—the deceased afterwards went out and laid down in the gutter, and I picked him up and brought him in, but he went out again—I asked my mates to come home, and as we were trying to get Bates up, a policeman came and took him by the ear—when he got up he struck the prisoner three or four blows, and knocked him across the street, saying "You b——, I will make you hop yet"—we had some more drink, and then Bates, a man named Roberts, and I, went towards the dock gates, and we were not admitted—we went across some fields, and Bates was then slightly ahead of us—when we reached him Curwin said "What occasion had you to strike me at the public-house?"—Bates replied "You b—, I will give it to you again, and he gave it to him properly, striking him four or five blows in the face—the prisoner set back from him, and said he would not fight any more—Bates fell, and Curwin ran away, but returned, and Kneeling down by the side of the deceased said "You're a wicked man to fight with me."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Bates had been very quarrelsome the whole night—he was in his shirt sleeves, and wanted to fight everybody he came across—the prisoner all along declined to fight, but Bates kept striking him very hard blows—me, Cook, Roberts, and a man named Goodman were from five to ten yards off at the time—when Bates left the public-house he did not seem to be any more in drink than I am at the present moment—there were no persons but Goodman, Roberts, and a girl of whom I had inquired the way, present at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fireman to Mr. Carey, coal merchant—I live at North Woolwich—on the night in question I was returning from the London Hospital, where I had been to see a man who was struck by lightning, when I heard a disturbance between Bates and a number of men—I heard Curwin say to him "What did you strike me for? I said nothing to you," when Bates replied "I have struck you before and will strike you again"—he commenced fighting at Curwin, when Curwin ran back about twenty-five yards, and said that he would not fight any more—then he returned and made a plunge at Bates, and hit him a very heavy blow</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187208190068"></xptr>
               <p>—I said to him "If you cannot fight you can lot jolly hard"—Bates began to groan, and then staggered and fell to the ground.</p>

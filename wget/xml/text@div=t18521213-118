                  </hi>. On Sunday night, 21st Nov., I was at the Ship and Rising Sun, in High-street, Shadwell—I saw the prisoner there, and Hutch<lb></lb>inson and Reed—the prisoner had his brother and a young woman with him—the young woman went in a fit—she came to again—after she came to the prisoner hit Reed in the eye with a glass, and broke the glass—it was a half-quartern glass—the size of a wine glass, and had a foot to it—Reed had not done anything to the prisoner—after that Hutchinson put his hand on his shoulder, and said, "You villain! what did you do that for?"—the prisoner laid hold of him by the scarf, at the back part of his neck, and hit him two or three times over the back of the head—the prisoner's brother took him out at the door, a man was standing outside, and be threw the glass at the man—it was between 10 and 11 o'clock—the prisoner was not the worse for liquor—after he threw the glass be ran down Gold's-hill—they followed him—he fell down, and got hold of two handfulls of oyster shells—when he fell they caught him—the policeman was at the corner, and he took him—he did not throw the oyster shells—Hutchinson bled profusely.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital. Hutchinson was brought there suffering from an incised wound on the back of the head; he had only one wound—I should think it was such a wound as might have been inflicted by this broken glass—it was a large gash three or four inches long, and half an inch deep—he was bleeding a great deal, it might have been dangerous in its consequences—he was an in-patient from 21st Nov. till 6th Dec, when he was discharged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Then it would appear that what inflicted the wound had been drawn across the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I referred to erysipelas coming on—that will occur from very trifling wounds sometimes.</p>

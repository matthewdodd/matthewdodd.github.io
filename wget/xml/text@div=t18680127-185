I am barmaid at the Sugar Loaf, Great St. Helen's—on 16th January, about two o'clock, the female prisoner came for three half-penny worth of gin, and paid with a shilling, which I put in the till—about half-past three a Miss Bovington came into the bar to relieve me—I came down again about four; she then handed me a bad shilling, and left the bar—shortly after the female prisoner came in again for three half-penny worth of gin, and then gave me a bad shilling—I said, "This is a bad shilling"—she said she was very sorry, she did not know it was—I took it to Mr. Poole—I told the prisoner that one was found in the till before—she said she had never been in the house before—I am quite sure she had—she afterwards said she had been in and had forgotten the house—I told her a man had been in trying to pass a bad shilling, and it looked rather suspicious—she said she knew nothing about him, and the male prisoner came in a few minutes after and said she was his wife—they were then given into custody—Mr. Poole gave the shillings to the constable.</p>

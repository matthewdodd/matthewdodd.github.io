            . I am a cloth cap-maker. The prisoner lives opposite to me, on Saffron-hill; she worked for me for about three weeks - I had sent her on an errand on Wednesday, when the officer took her. On the Monday, before she was taken, I sent my boy to tell her to come and assist me at work - she was in bed; she got up, and came about half-past ten o'clock, and was not out again till after ten at night - she was with me all day on Tuesday, from between twelve and one o'clock till bedtime.</p>

I am a shoemaker, and work at home; she went between ten and eleven to Wiltshire's, and returned about ten at night: I had got up between six and seven o'clock, and breakfasted about eight - she was ill in bed, and had no breakfast at all, and on Tuesday she went to Wiltshire's again, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning - I am certain of that; she then breakfasted with me: I have a daughter, who is servant to a laundress, named Wiltshire - she does not live with a nam named George; she is a decent good girl - she is very much like the prisoner in face, and two years older.</p>

               <p>MARY BATES. I went to Wiltshire's, and saw the sister, on the 21st, they are very much alike: I think this is the girl - that is my firm belief; she was dressed in a black gown - the sister had a blue one.</p>

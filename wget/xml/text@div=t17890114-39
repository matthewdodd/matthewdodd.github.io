The prisoner crossed to an iron shop, one Cowell's and I secured him and the property. He said he worked for Mr. Caney, at fifteen shillings a week; the next day his master came and saw the property, and said it was his.</p>

               <p>About eighteen months I lived a servant with Alderman Swain; having a wife, mother, and child to maintain, I took two lower rooms in Long-alley, and paid eleven shillings per month; I bought and <rs id="t17890114-39-deflabel185" type="occupation">sold houshold furniture</rs>

I kept it on about six months, and took another house in Long-alley, and paid fourteen pounds a year, and bought some other things; then I used to stand under Whitehall Chapel; and there I bought these things of a lady. At this time, the Lord was pleased to afflict me with a fever, and I was obliged to depend on my benefit club; and after the Lord was pleased to raise me out of my affliction, I came to enquire for work of Mr. Caney, and I took a room just by, and brought all this property into the room; and last Friday evening was a week, I was carrying a load for my master, and one of my shoes burst open, so I could scarce walk; so I said to my wife, I will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140053"></xptr>go and sell this property, and buy a pair of shoes. The things were bought of different people; the lady I bought some of lives at the house adjoining to Whitehall.</p>
               <p>Court. Is she here? - No. After they stopped me, they asked me why I did not throw it down, and run away; I said it was my own.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I swear to this mark; it is my sister's hand-writing. I know nothing of the pewter, only there is pewter missing from the place where it stood.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

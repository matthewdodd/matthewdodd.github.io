                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in New-cut, Lambeth. The prisoner was seven months in my service, and came as a single man, but he is married—he lived in the house till within about six weeks or two months—I frequently missed articles from the stock, and watched a female who came on Saturday the 15th of May, she came to the shop when we were very busy—she did not ask for anything, but tendered him half-a-sovereign—he gave her 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of it—I stopped him, and asked him if he knew her—he said, certainly not, that he never saw her before in his life—she said not ask for anything—he gave her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of goods, and gave her 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of a half-sovereign—I charged him with robbing me—the women said in his presence that it was a sovereign she gave him—she bolted off, and never came back—I went to the prisoner's lodging and asked for him—they said he was not within—I asked for Mr. Griffin, they said she was within, and to my surprise I found a wife and three children—I had previously seen two or three sove<lb></lb>reigns and two half-sovereigns in the till, and the half-sovereign he put in would make three half-sovereigns—I stood by him, and am certain he took half-a-sovereign from her—I found half-a-sovereign more in the till than there was a minute before—the women left her basket behind her—she went away to fetch a witness to prove she had a sovereign—I found from four to six pounds of sugar at the prisoner's lodging—I cannot swear to it—having received half-a-sovereign, the prisoner pretended to give change for a sovereign—he gave more than the change.</p>

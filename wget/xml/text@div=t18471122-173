                  </hi> I am wife of Theophile Prusinowski, a chair-maker, of Bayham-street, Camden-town—he rents the house, it is in the parish of St. Pancras. The prisoner was in our service—on 18th Oct. I left her with the child in the house, and I went out about three o'clock in the afternoon, leaving no one else in the house—she had been in my service four weeks that day—I told her to light a fire in the bedroom—I came back about four—the street-door was fast as it was when I went away—I knocked several times, nobody came—the child was crying bitterly, and I let myself in with a key which I had—the prisoner was gone—nothing had been got ready for me—I missed a gold watch and chain from the side of the fire-place, which were perfectly safe when I went out; also a black-silk cloak from the children's bed, a black silk scarf from the side of my bed, and a silver watch from over the mantelpiece in the back parlour—they were all quite safe when I left—the prisoner went away without her wages, and left her clothes—3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was due to her—she did not come back.</p>

I took the prisoner in Russell-street, Bermondsey—I told her what it was for—she said she was very sorry—I asked her if she had any property about her—she said she had got what she had got in her hand—it was half-a-crown, two halfpence, and a farthing—she said that was all she had got—I am sure of that—I took her to the station.</p>

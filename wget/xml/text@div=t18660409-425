                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Bridport Old Brewery Company, Belvidere-road, Lambeth—the brewery is at Bridport—the business has been established nearly one hundred years—on 2d January, Kelly and Ellis came to the office at Belvidere-road—Kelly came first, at about half-past 10</p>

               <p>or 11 in the morning—I saw Ellis in the clerk's office subsequently—I don't know at what time he came, but it was about the same time—Kelly said he was a bottled beer merchant and gave the name of Holland, of St. John's-court, King-street, Snow-hill—he said he had just bought a bottled-beer business, and wished to buy some of our ales for the purpose of bottling—William Holland and Co. was the style he meant to carry it on by—he ordered ten barrels of ale, and five barrels of stout—five barrels of the ale were Burton, and five pale ale—that is the invoice made at the time—the value was 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. exclusive of the casks, fifteen guineas; together, 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he told me to send them to his stores, at St. John's-court, Snow-hill—he gave me a card—I have not got it, I gave it to Wheeler, our collector—it was Wheeler's custom to introduce customers to us—he was our traveller—he introduced these people to us—since this has taken place, he has absconded—I told Kelly the money must be paid in three days—he said he had no objection, as it was a small quantity, and he would pay in three days—he did not do so—on 8th January, I went to the stores at St. John's-court—I found there a board, with the name of "William Holland &amp; Co." over the stores, which were locked—I knocked at the door, but could not make anybody hear—I made further inquiries of an ostler at the premises, and came away—on 2d January, Ellis gave me an order for twenty barrels of beer, value 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the casks; together, 102<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he told me to send it to his stores in New Ormond-street—he gave the name of Ellis—he mentioned that he had just bought a bottled-beer business, and wished to bottle some of our ale—I told him the way to pay for it; one half in fourteen days, and the remaining half in twenty-eight days—Ellis and Kelly were in the office together—they did not appear to know each other—I did not see them speak to each other—on Saturday, 27th January, I went to 17, New Ormond-street to see Ellis because the money had not been paid—I found Kelly there—I asked him if his name was not Hol<lb></lb>land—he replied, "Oh no, my name is Kelly"—I then asked him if he was not the man who came to the Bridport Brewery Company, and bought some beer in the name of William Holland &amp; Co. on 2d January—he replied, "Oh no, I don't know him, my name is Kelly—I am quite sure he is the man who came—I had entered the stores by the steps, which was the only entrance, and he was going to pass me to go up those steps, but as soon as I mentioned the name of the Bridport Brewery Company he went out at the further door, apparently leading to the back part of the house—hearing footsteps going up stairs, and believing he was going out at the street door, I ran up the step—I saw him going down the street, and followed him—I missed him for a time, and found he had gone into a grocer's shop—I waited about till he came out, and then went up to him, and said that I had no doubt he was the man, and he must come over to the stores with me—as we were going along he said, "My name is Kelly, I am the Company of Holland &amp; Co."—he also said, "We are all apt to act indiscreetly at times"—he said, he supposed that all I wanted was payment for the beer; that he had disposed of it, and was going to get a bill in payment of it, and would return the casks—I replied that payment was not sufficient for us now, and we must inquire further into his proceedings—I took him to our stores, and left him there with the store<lb></lb>keeper—I then went to the stores in New Ormond-street, with the object of seeing the others—I saw a cab drive up with three gentleman in it—they got out, and went down the stairs—I saw them take away some parcels—the name of Haines was over the door—I didn't see the name of Ellis there—I went out and got a warrant against</p>

Lime-street, and Kingwell, coach builder, St. Martin's-lane—when I was disengaged I found you talking to the clerks—I invited you into the room—you asked me if the references were satisfactory—I said I didn't much like much William &amp; Co., but I was satisfied with Kingwell, and would send in the ale that afternoon by one of Pickford's vans—after that I took the order for 30 barrels, half in 14 days, less 12J per cent, off; and half in 28 days, with 10½ off—I should observe, that I was satisfied with Kingwell's reference on the statement of Wheeler, our collector—when the first pay<lb></lb>ment became due you did not call on me shortly afterwards—on the 16th August you asked me to take a bill—I refused to have anything to do with them—the second time you called I was engaged, and came out to speak to you—you did not tell me you were not in a situation to pay, but asked whether Mr. Wheeler had left our employment, and if he had been dis<lb></lb>missed—I am not aware that you said you couldn't pay—I didn't wish to hold much converse with you—you said you would come again next day, and tell me something that would astonish me—I found Kelly in thestores at New Ormoud-street—I don't know whether they are your stores or not</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, at 89, Leadenhall-street—on 19th December, Ellis came to my shop, and asked me to trust him for a month with stationery for his offices at 17, New Ormond-street—I supplied him—I afterwards called there, and saw him—I called again after that, and saw Dancer—he said that he had bought the business of Ellis, and owed him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he would get Ellis to allow him to pay me—three weeks afterwards, when I called again, the offices were closed, and I saw Mr. Jenkins the landlord—I met Ellis some time after that in Fish-street-hill, and told him what Dancer said—he said Dancer had no authority from him to pay me—he did not pay me—Ellis told me me he was the agent of the Bridport Brewery Company.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Ellis. Q.</hi> How long have you known me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two years—we have had many glasses of ale together when you were a traveller—we had some ale in the shop that morning—the stationery came to two guineas—you took it away with you in an omnibus—I called upon you a short time afterwards—I don't remember whether I went with you to a public-house in New Ormond-street—I did not supply these goods—I made further enquiries, and was not satisfied.</p>

            . In 1817, I was keeper of the County Gaol, at Horsham - in the spring assizes, that year, George Stuart was committed to my custody - he was tried at the spring assizes that year, and pleaded guilty to the indictment - he was afterwards reprieved, and I put him on board the Captivity, off Portsmouth, on the 6th of May - I have an acknowledgment, which I took from the hulk, for him among other prisoners whom I delivered there - I cannot recollect who gave me the receipt, but I had it on board the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Allowing for the change seventeen years make in a man, look at the prisoner, and tell me whether you believe him to be the man? A. I am inclined to think so, but I should not like to swear it - seventeen years is a great while.</p>

            . In 1817, I was guard on board the Captivity hulk - I am now chief mate of the Leviathan - I remember Smart bringing a number of transports on board our ship, from Sussex - this is the receipt given for them - I have a perfect recollection of the prisoner - I have not a doubt of his being one of the men brought by Smart on that occasion - he was sent to New South Wales, in the ship Lorkins - I speak from a perfect recollection of his person - he is the man and no other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you go out with convicts? A. Not now - I did then - I did not go out of the country with the Lorkins - he was on board the Captivity from the 6th of May till the 11th of July - and then went in the Lorkins - I cannot tell how many men there were - they were brought at different times - I cannot tell how many were brought at one time - Smart and other people brought them, but generally Smart - he always had assistants with him - I cannot say whether he always came - I am certain Smart came when Stuart came - I cannot exactly remember the names of the others that came - I remember the person of Richard Stuart, who came with him - there was something remarkable in it, as they were supposed to be soldier officers - their manner, dress, and appearance, were respectable, and they were particularly noticed - many persons came to see them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever stated that Stuart had a wen on his hand? A. I have said so - according to the written description given, it was so, but a wen can be removed without incision - there was a projection on his right hand - that I have a distinct recollection of - he had a projection, whether from a strain or not, I cannot say - I do not know that I ever said myself that it was a wen - it was entered in the description book as a wen, by the steward of the ship - I have looked at the description book since my attention has been called to the prisoner, but I had a perfect recollection of him before that; and having seen it in the Hue and Cry, I was first applied to about this, in July last - I had not then seen him for seventeen years - I saw him in Newgate on this charge, not before - I was not in London till I was called on this occasion - I should think not less than 8,000 male convicts have passed through my observation since 1817.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I presume Smart only brought the convicts from Sussex? A. Certainly, no others - he brought the Sussex convicts generally, and I believe always - I never had the least hesitation or doubt of the prisoner - when I heard he had escaped from New South Wales, which was about 1829, I said, I should know that man again, see him whenever I might - I believe it was 1829.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you remember seeing him in Newgate? A. Yes; I saw him in the presence of Mr. Cope, in July - I said, in Mr. Cope's presence, that I should know him by a wen on his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you speak with hesitation about his identity until you looked at his hand to see if there was a wen? A. No; at his first appearance, I said, "That is the man, I will swear to him" - I had no hesitation about him - I said I should know him by the wen, but as soon as he entered the door, I said, "That is the man, I will swear to him" - it was before that, I said I should know him by the wen on his hand - I believe it was before I saw him, I said so - I examined his hand to look for a wen, after I had expressed my confident opinion that it was him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was there a wen on his hand when you examined him? A. No; I had not the least doubt of him - I know him by his face and his make, independently of the wen.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040092"></xptr>MR. BODKIN. Q. Is there, according to the practice, a reward given on conviction of persons under these circumstances? A. I am not aware that there is, I have no knowledge of it - I have never been on a trial of the sort - I am certain there is no reward for me - I have heard of rewards being given, but I do not know it for a fact - I never knew any one receive it - I do not expect to get one farthing.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The time from the first conviction of the individual named, is seventeen years - there is no evidence but the guard - you have heard his observation as to not expecting a reward: till that question was put, it must have entered your minds that he was influenced by the hope of reward or favour of some kind - how is it to be supposed that a man can take on himself, after seventeen years, to swear to an individual he never saw since? - would any of you gentlemen do it? and, if not, you ought to consider that no other man could conscientiously do it - therefore you will be pleased to weigh the matter in your minds - here is an elderly man, whose foot is on the border of the grave, he will not attempt to do it; but the other man is in the habit of guarding felons, and has become as callous as any of them.</p>

            , Esq. I am a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment, can a wen or excrescence be moved from the hand of a man, without leaving some mark? A. I have paid great attention to such cases - I must say, though surgery has advanced very much indeed, we have not the art of disguising an operation, so much as to leave no mark - it is my decided opinion if a wen is taken off, you must see a mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing it was a swelling, which exhibited a general appearance of a wen to an uninformed person, might that be removed without a mark? A. Certainly; I am assuming there was a wen; then there must be an incision.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. An ignorant person might call that a wen which is not one? A. Certainly; all I say is, if there was an incision, there must be a mark - there has been no operation on the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>JOHN NEWMAN re-examined. When the convicts are brought on board, they are generally examined by a surgeon, but not so particularly at that time as they are now - the description entered in the book is done by the surgeon.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether it was a wen do you know? A. I do not - the steward keeps the book - I recollect a projection on the back of his right hand, but I think it must have been a sprain.</p>
               <p>MR. CARPUE. A wen may be taken up into the system, and not be taken off by an operation.</p>

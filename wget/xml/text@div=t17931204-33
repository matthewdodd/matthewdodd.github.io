               <p>I know as far as this; I was coming by the door and the woman was coming out of the house, Mrs. Barrow came out after her, and gave orders for her to be stopped, for she had robbed her of three pair of stockings; she was brought back and she gave her three pair of worsted stockings, and said, that she had taken them out of distress; I saw her take the stockings out of her shop; she said, she hoped Mr. Barrow would not hurt her as she had brought them again, and that she had taken them out of distress.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This is entirely done through a little malice that passed about a month ago between the prosecutor and me; I <rs id="t17931204-33-deflabel187" type="occupation">sell fruit in Covent-garden market</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17931204-33-defend397 t17931204-33-deflabel187"></join>, and the prosecutor came and asked the price of some fruit; I said, it is to dear for Irish people, it is only fit for English people, and so she went and took an oath that I struck her. It is entirely through spite that she has brought me here; I had no money to send for any friends, or else I could have got them here to speak in my behalf, where I have lodged for five years.</p>

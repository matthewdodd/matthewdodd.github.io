On the 7th of August, I went to the White Lion public-house, in Old-street, St. Luke's, between one and two o'clock in the day—the prisoner was there when I went into the room with two other persons—I sat down, and called for a pint of porter—he sat at the same table, and entered into con<lb></lb>versation with me, and in about ten minutes he said he had a quantity of metal solder to sell, would I become a purchaser—I asked him the weight—he said about 20lbs., and I had better come home to his lodging and see—he asked me if I was a right man—I said, "Yes"—I understood him to mean with respect to buying the metal at a fair valuation—I asked how he became in possession of it—he said he worked for Howard, of Old-street, the tin-plate workers—I suspected him, and went to his lodging—I sat there an hour or two, and then he produced six pieces of metal—his mother and another woman were in the same room—until he produced the metal—they were then ordered out of the room—he produced it from a cupboard in the room—I do not know whether it was locked—the women left the room before the metal was produced at his request—I was to have purchased it for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was solder in ingots—I took it away with me—I went to the station-house in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and then came back with Palmer the constable and took him—he made use of very bad language, he said he would knock me down, and said I had sold him like a bullock—he had told me that he got the metal from his employers—that he brought it away a piece at a time as he could get it, and he would give me a supply every week if I liked to take it at a price.</p>

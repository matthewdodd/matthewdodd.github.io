I am a tile fixer, of 221, Pentonville Road—on 15th January, I had been at my aunt's, in Compton Street, and left about 7 o'clock to go home—I was going into the Hunter's Arms, and before going in took out my money to look at the smallest coin—the prisoner then came out, used most profane language, and asked what I wanted there—I said, "A glass of beer," and that I would give him one if he liked—he knocked a sovereign out of my hand, struck me on my side, and knocked me down—I got up I saw him pick up the money and run away—I called out, my aunt came up, and the prisoner plunged through two men and gave me a blow in the forehead, which knocked me down again—I identified him at the station, ten minutes afterwards, among other men—I was perfectly sober, and noticed him minutely when he spoke to me—my forehead was cut; I became nearly insensible—I was attended by a doctor, and I still feel it.</p>

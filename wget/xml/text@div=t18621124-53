                  </hi>. I live at 19, Englefield-road, West, De Beauvoir Town—it is the dwelling-house of my father, Samuel Brown—on Tuesday morn<lb></lb>ing, 28th October, at about half-past 1, I heard a noise—I came down and found the back door open—I went into the front room and found the cheffionier open, and I missed out of that room three spoons, which had been used the evening before—I went down four stairs and found the door of a closet open and a candle inside—I then went down to the breakfast-room below, and found a closet door broken open there, and I missed six silver spoons, a silver thimble, four salt spoons, and a pair of sugar tongs; these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—they are my father's property, and have his initials on them—I called in a policeman, who went over the premises with me, and then I closed the house again—there were one or two burnt matches on the dresser, and a slight mark on the window, as though a knife had been put under the window catch—in the back garden there were foot prints that corresponded with a boot taken from one of the prisoners—I saw them compared—I went to bed at about 11 that night, and the house was then locked up and safe—I made the comparison of the foot marks about a quarter-past 8 or 9—nobody had been out of the house before that time.</p>

On the morning of 28th October, I saw the prisoners at about twenty minutes to 2, in the Culford-road, about 200 yards from the prosecutor's house—I followed them some distance towards Dalston-lane—I went up and asked where they were going—they said, "Going home"—I asked where they lived—Jones said, "I live at Stepney," and Undtrwood, "I live at Dalston"—I said I should take them to the station-house on the charge of loitering about to commit a felony—I took them to the station—on searching Underwood I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the lining of his coat, and on further searching, I found these spoons (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) down his legs—there was nothing found on Jones—as soon as Jones saw the spoons, he said, "I know nothing about those"—hearing of the robbery, I went down to Mr. Brown's in the morning, and found the knife would fit the mark on the front window, ledge—I went back to the station-house and fetched a boot off both of the prisoners, and they corre<lb></lb>sponded exactly with the footmarks—I compared them by making a mark at the side, and not by putting the boot into the mark—Jones's boot has <hi rend="italic">gutta percha</hi> bottom, and it is quite flat—Underwood's has half a tip.</p>

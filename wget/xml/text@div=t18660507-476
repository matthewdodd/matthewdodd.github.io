                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 260). On 20th March, I was on duty in the East India-road about eleven o'clock, and saw two omnibuses opposite the Sailor's Home, one coming from London and the other from Blackwall—I heard a smash, they were then both together on the off-side—there is a tramway in the centre of the road—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a very good plan of the road—there is about twenty feet on each side of the tramway for vehicles to pass—I have not measured it, but the road is about fifty feet wide and the tramway about ten feet—no other vehicles were near—one omnibus belonged to the General Omnibus Company, and the other to a person named Emanuel—when I heard the smash I ran towards Emanuel's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> which was going towards London—it had extricated itself and was drawing off on its journey—I spoke to the driver, it was the prisoner Payne—I saw the deceased, Haffler, outside the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—he called out, "Oh! my leg is broken"—I saw blood and a wound on his leg—his trousers and stocking were torn—he was taken to the hospital—I took the number of the other driver, Carter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cowkeeper—I was about ten yards off when the collision took place—the omnibuses were close together when I saw them coming in opposite directions on the same tramway—I cannot say whether it is usual for the omnibuses to use the tramway—there was room for four or five <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> to pass each other on each side of the tramway, and either of the drivers could have pulled out; they had plenty of room to do so—I did not see them till they were close upon each other—the horses' heads had passed each other when I saw them, and then there was a crash—the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> coming towards London had been pulled off—the driver pulled off after the collision, but the other stood still—it was raining, and rather a dark night, but it was light enough for either to have seen the other at a distance of ten or twenty yards—I heard Carter sing out to the other one to stop, and Payne was in the act of stopping.</p>

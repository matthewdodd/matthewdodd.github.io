On Saturday, 12th June, the prisoner came, between 10 and 11 o'clock at night—she asked for half a peck of peas; I served her, and she gave me in payment a shilling—I was about looking at the shilling; a bunch of turnips laid there, and she asked me how I sold them, and said she would have 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth; that drew my attention from the shilling, and I put it into my pocket—I had not sufficient coppers to give change, and I sent the boy for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of coppers—theprisoner seemed very anxious to get away, and she had 1lb. of potatoes—I still had not sufficient change, but a neighbour came in, and I got from her 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I gave the prisoner, and she went away—directly afterwards I found the shilling she had given me was bad—I put it by itself in the cupboard, away from other moneys—On Monday night, the 14th, the prisoner came again, just after I had lighted the gas, about half past 9 o'clock—she asked for a quart of gooseberries—I knew her before I went out to serve her—Iserved her, and she tendered me another shilling; I found it was bad—I told her so, and that I had got the one that she gave me on the Saturday night—she at first denied having been there on Saturday night, but I told her she had, and I enumerated the articles she had had, peas, turnips, and potatoes—shethen owned to purchasing half a peck of peas—a constable came up, and I gave her into custody, and gave him the two shillings.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner at the bar. On the 26th of August, the last witness, Harris, came to me as the constable of Chelsea, and informed me that the prisoner had had a child, and had murdered it, and asked me what was best to be done? accordingly I told him I thought it was proper she should be taken up; this was about nine or half past nine in the evening; accordingly I went, and he informed me that she lived <rs id="t17940917-46-deflabel236" type="occupation">servant</rs>

We both went down to the house, but the gates were shut, they were gone to bed; there was a garden before the house, the doors were all locked, but they were not all in bed; I got over the rails of the adjoining house, and knocked at the door; and they looked out and asked me who was there? there were two servants, the prisoner was gone to bed, but the other was up; I told them my name was Sanders, I was the constable of Chelsea; and they opened the door, they knew my voice, I suppose most people know me at Chelsea. When the maid opened the door, the old lady came out, an infirm old lady; I told her not to be frightened, I was come for one of her servants, but she had not been guilty of any thest; she desired me to walk into the parlour. I then informed her that her servant had had connection with some man, and that she had had a child, and had made away with it; by which means they called her up; she was gone up stairs to bed; and she said as she was coming down stairs, she was very happy I was come, and seemed very willing and desirous to go with me; she called me by my name. I took her home to my own house, because being a decent servant, and I put her in the next room with me, and put her to bed, and fastened the windows, for fear any accident should happen. The next morning I took her to Bow-street, but on my journey, I stopped at <placeName id="t17940917-46-crimeloc237">No. 7, Renelagh-row</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did she say what happened in consequence of her putting her finger into the child's throat? - She did not; she only told me that she put it in, to prevent the child crying. I went on to Bow-street, immediately after she informed me where the child was.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the necessary from the house? - About the length of this court, as near as possible. At Bow-street the justice committed her for further examination, till the child was found, to know if it could be found. As soon as I returned from Bow-street, I went and got two bricklayers to take up the vault, and they did so; I was there at the time; in about half an hour we found part of a child; the left leg and left arm was perished, separated from the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the leg and arm? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear that the child was born without that leg, or did it appear to be naturally perished? - No doubt it had naturally perished, for the rest part was nearly the same way.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course then you could hardly observe any appearance of any marks on the child? - No; I believe it was out of the power of any of the faculty to tell whether it was born dead or alive.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not mean to make away with the child, I did not know what I was about. Here are some things that I made for the child; a shift, cap, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sanders. That was what I was going to mention. When she went up stairs she shewed me a vast quantity of child bed linen, plates, clothes, and money; you see, says she, Mr. Sanders, I want for nothing; but I am an unhappy wretch; and I want to be out of the world. She asked me if I thought God would forgive her, and take her back again, if she took a book and prayed? I told her no doubt, my dear, God forgives every person that truly repents of their sins.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you the sex of the child? - She did not; I found it out after it was was washed and cleansed, it was a male child.</p>

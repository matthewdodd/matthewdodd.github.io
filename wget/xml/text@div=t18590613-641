                  </hi>. I am barman at the Elephant and Castle tavern at Newington—on 12th May, between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, the prisoner came for a glass of ale—he gave me a shilling in payment—I put it in the till, gave him the change, and he left—our house has two entrances, one into Newington-causeway, and another into the Walworth-road—a few minutes after he had gone out, he came into the house at the Walworth-road entrance—he had come in before at the other door—he came for a pint of ale, and offered me a shilling—I broke that shilling with my teeth, and told him it was a bad one—I then went to the till and took out the other shilling, and told him it was a bad one, and that he had been there before—he said he had not been in the house before—there was a constable at the bar at the time, and I gave him into custody—I gave the constable the broken shilling, and also the first shilling—I am sure there was no other shilling in the till when I put the first shilling in.</p>

My husband keeps a pastry-cook's shop at 12, Bedford-row, Walworth—about 4 o'clock on Thursday the prisoner came to my shop—I served him with two-pennyworth of pastry—he gave me a shilling, which I saw was bad—I tried it in the detector, and bent it across—I then told him it was bad, and he said, "Is it!"—I returned it to him, and he paid me with a good half-crown—I gave him the change, and he Went away—I saw him again in a cell at the police-court on the 18th.</p>

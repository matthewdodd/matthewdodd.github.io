                  </hi>. The deceased was my husband—on Saturday night, 19th July, I was returning home with him, about 12.30—when we got within a few yards of our house, he left me to go and open the door; but when he got to the door, he found he had not got the key; I had it—he afterwards returned towards me, following two men—the prisoner is one of them—they were making their escape from the door, where they had assaulted him—I did not see them assault him, but he told me so—I heard my husband ask the prisoner how he came to assault him—he had not interfered with him—he seemed to stand in a fighting position—I said to my husband, "Don't fight"—he said, "No, I am not going to fight"—he turned to one of my boys, who was with me, and said, "Go to the police<lb></lb>station and fetch a policeman," and as he said it he took hold of the pri<lb></lb>soner's</p>

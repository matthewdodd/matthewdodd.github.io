                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 105.) I hare been an officer for some years. On the 17th of May I was on duty in Hooper-street, Lambeth—between eleven and twelve o'clock I was walking towards the Farm House beer-shop there—I had heard there had been a man robbed of his watch there, and was going towards the house to make inquiries—about ten yards before I got to the house I was met by the prisoner Popham, who I saw come from a house of ill-fame opposite—I knew his person—he came up to me and said, "You b—, you shall never reach the house," and instantly struck me a violent blow on the side of the face with his fist—I had offered no violence whatever to him, either in language or act—after be struck me I endeavoured to seize him—he was making his way towards the door of the Farm House—I laid hold of him and struggled with him, in the course of which he knocked my hat off with a life-preserver, which begot out of his left-hand breast pocket—he then made another blow at me, which cut me just above the temple, on the left-side—it was a very heavy blow—it cut my head, and blood followed—I still kept my hold of him—he made another blow at me—I caught the life-preserver with my right-hand, and saved the blow—I continued to struggle with him, and whilst doing so I saw the prisoner M'Phane come from the beer-shop—I knew his person—he drew something from his pocket, and struck me a violent blow on my cheek, just below the temple, which felled me to the ground—it appeared to be another life-preserver—that was whilst I was straggling with Popham—the blow was on the same temple—it tore my cheek and fetched blood—I still had hold of Pophara, and we both fell together—while I was on the ground I received another blow from M'Phane, which took effect on the arm, and made me leave go of Popham—I should say it was with a similar instrument to the one I had taken from Popham—it was not his fist, it was something more heavy—as I was raising myself to get up, I received a blow on the hand from M'Phane—I was then at<lb></lb>tempting to seize him—Popham had got away from me—the blow cut my finger in two places—he struck me two or three blows on the hand—while endeavouring to secure M'Phane, Donoghue came up—Popham had then got away—M'Phane only was with me—I saw Donoghue come from the beer-shop, while I was on the ground, and he kicked me very violently about</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184106140180"></xptr>
               <p>the body—I was not struggling with M'Phane at that time—I could not lay hold of him, because of the blows on my hand—he was going away at the time Donoghue came up—I did not get hold of M'Phane at all—Donoghue did not make use of any expressions at the time he kicked me—he kicked me several times—I also knew Donoghue's person well—I was exhausted with all this beating, and they all three got away—I was not able to seize Donoghue from the state in which I was—I was on the ground about five minutes after they left me before I was able to help my<lb></lb>self—I then got assistance from Jones, 141 L, and went with him to the Farm House, where I took Donoghue into custody—he was stand<lb></lb>ing at the bar when we went in—as soon as he saw me come in he ran into the tap-room, and hid himself behind the door—after securing him I went with Murphy to the lodging of M'Phane, in Short-street—I observed there was a light at the lodging, which was extinguished as we went in—I went into the second-floor front-room, and found M'Phane there in bed—I took him into custody, and told him what I took him for—he said, "I knew I should be <hi rend="italic">nailed</hi> for this—I shall only be fined—if it is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I can pay it, or if it is 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I can pay it"—I did not myself take Popham—a warrant was lodged for him at another place next day—we found where he was in about a fort<lb></lb>night, in the City—he has been brought here by Habeas to be tried—here is the life-preserver which I took from Popham—I went to Mr. Wagstaff, the surgeon, and he kept me off duty for five days—I felt very weak—I lost a deal of blood—for seven days after that I was only on reserve duty at the station—I have entirely recovered now.</p>

On the 17th of May, Watmough came to me about half-past one o'clock in the middle of the night—I observed a good deal of blood about his head, a cut on the left-side, and the head and face altogether a good deal bruised—he appeared to have lost a great deal of blood—his cheek was slightly cut—from the appearance he pre<lb></lb>sented, he had decidedly been much beaten—the cut on the head was very near the temple—I consider it a dangerous spot for a man to receive a blow—I think it a blow very likely to have been inflicted with the life-preserver produced—it was not a sharp cut—I anticipated concussion of the brain—I kept him off duty for five days, and he was seven days only on reserve duty—the reserve duty does not come under my direction—if the blow had been on the temple, it would have been very likely to have deprived him of life.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Cooney, a cooper in Short-street, Tower-street—M'Phane lodged with me for nine months. On the night of the 17th of May, he came home in his usual manner, about eleven o'clock, or a little after, I cannot say to a minute or two—I that was generally his usual time—he was dressed in blue trowsers, and a frock-coat, blue, I think, but I cannot be positive, although I have seen it repeatedly—it was the one he has always been in the habit of wearing at my place—when he came home he retired to his room—he was perfectly sober when he came in—I heard no more of him till a quarter to twelve, when I heard a great noise going by my door—I opened the door, and saw my brother Matthew Allen in custody with Watmough and several more of the police, and they were beating him very cruelly—I cried and made a great alarm, and went to the stairs, and cried out, M'Phane came down immediately and hallooed out, "What is the matter, is there a fire?"—I said, "No, but my brother is gone by with the police; oh dear, what has be done?"—I called M'Phane down by name, as my husband was not in-doors at the time—he came down in his trowsers and stockings, and no shoes, and went out as far as a ditch at the corner of my place—he met with a person, and said, "What has Matthew Allen done?"—he said, "He is taken into custody for beating the police"—he returned and told me and said, "Never mind, don't fret, it will only be a fine in the morn<lb></lb>ing"—he then returned to his room, and I heard no more of him till a quarter to one, as near as can be—several of the police then came to my door, and knocked at my shutters—I and my husband were in bed—my door was fastened—I asked what they wanted—they said, "Open the door, or else we will have it open"—I wished them to tell what they wanted—I heard them say, "Bring the crow<lb></lb>bars, open the door, or we will have it open immediately"—I said, "Don't burst open my door, I will open it, who is it you want?"—they said, "Make haste"—I got up and opened it, and the police all rushed in with their staves drawn—I saw a person named Chapman outside the door—he is always in company with the police—I heard Chapman say, "He lives in the second floor front room—go straight up, and I dare say he is at home now, for I saw him some time ago at the corner of the ditch"—a great many policemen went up into the room, and Chapman and a policeman staid down at the door—I was too flurried to count how many went up stairs—I heard M'Phane say he was in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184106140184"></xptr>
               <p>bed—the policeman said, "Come, get up"—he said, "What for, what have I done?"—they said they would soon let him know when they got him to the station—I heard every word that passed, except what was said in the room—I could not hear that—M'Phane never said, "I shall be <hi rend="italic">nailed for</hi> this, but I shall be only fined 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or if it is 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I can pay it"—I am confident he never made use of any such words, or any thing like it—he only kept saying, what had he done, or what was he taken for—they then took him away.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many persons lodge in your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are four families—there are no women—I heard Watmough say when he went out just now to speak to the solicitor, that I kept a house of ill<lb></lb>fame—I have six rooms—I live in the parlour—that is my sleeping room as well—my husband came home about half-past eleven o'clock that night—I cannot say to twenty minutes—he came home before M'Phane was taken, and before he went to bed—not before first let M'Phane in, when I gave him the lucifer and candle—I swear that—a shoemaker and his two children live in the first floor—M'Phane and his wife live in the second floor—he came to me as a married man—I cannot be answerable for it—I cannot tell how he has got his living—his grandfather is a hatter, in Gloucester-street, and he has worked for him—I went there as a reference—he keeps a hatter's shop there—I do nothing for my living—my husband keeps me—he is in the employ of Noble and Rolls, varnish manufacturers, and has worked for them nine years—M'Phane first came home about eleven o'clock or a little after—I have a clock hanging up in my room, so I of course could notice the time—know by the time he came in, and the time I had my supper it could not be more than eleven, or a little after—it was a quarter to eleven when I sat down to have my supper—my clock is always going—I wind it up night and morning—I am confident it was right, because my husband comes home regularly to his meals, and I am obliged to have it hit—he comes home to breakfast at half-past eight, to dinner at one, and to tea about seven, and then he does not go any more to work—I do not know where he had been that night—I did not ask him—I did not look at the clock when M'Phane came in—I did about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards—it was then half-past eleven—I did not go before the Magistrate—I intended to have gone—several of the persons went to speak on my brother's behalf, and I was going to speak for him and M'Thane, but was too late, the case was heard—my brother lives at No. 24, Cheston-street, Cheston-square, very near me—he is not here, nor is my husband—I know the Farm House beer-shop—I have been there for years—I was not there that night—I was there in the morning—I left about six in the evening—I went there I dare say about five, or a little after five, after my brother and sister who were there—it was a little after eleven when M'Phane first came in, and a quarter to twelve when I called him up—the police came about a quarter to one, as near as can be—I stood at the door when he went to the corner of the ditch—the ditch is not five steps from my door—I stood at the door with the door in my hand till he came in—when my brother went by in custody I made a great alarm—I did not particularly call M'Phane—he came running down, hearing my noise, and asked what was the matter—any other of the lodgers might just as well have come down as him—they might well be alarmed, for the police beat my brother so cruelly—the shoemaker on the first floor looked out of the window—no</p>

               <p>one else came down but M'Phane—ray brother did not bleed at all—he complained of his chest, where they beat him, and they rushed him against the posts at my door, and Watmough stated that he was positive my brother was the man that struck him—I heard him say so down at the hall—he said to me, "What have you come down here for?"—I said, "I have come down to see about my brother"—he said "Your brother won't be hurt—I shall not hurt your brother"—I was summoned here by that gentle<lb></lb>man (the prisoner's attorney) I have seen Popham before, not at my house—I have seen him at my door—he has not been in my room, nor in my house, only at the door—I am quite sure of that—I cannot tell whether he was an acquaintance of M'Phane—he must have been—it was not after me or any one belonging to me that he came—when Popham has been to my door it was after M'Phane he has come—I cannot tell how often he has been there—not three or four times a week—I have not seen him twenty times, nor half twenty—I will not say how many times, but I know he has not been twenty times—I know Donoghue perfectly well in the neighbourhood—he knows M'Phane by sight, but as to being any companion of his or not, that I cannot swear—I nave known Donoghue from his birth pretty well, and I know M'Phane never associates with him—I am confident of that—I do not know M'Phane's associates, but I know Donoghue is not an associate of his—my brother went to school with Donoghue, and when they come home from work they are generally to<lb></lb>gether—I believe Donoghue has been in custody for felony—I have no doubt about it—I know it perfectly Well—he was brought up a very good steady boy—he ought to have been so—my brother works hard for his living—he has never been in trouble, nor any of our family—I never knew M'Phane before he took my lodging—his wife came after the room—I cannot say how soon it was after M'Phane came that I saw Popham—he was a long time there before I saw Popham—I have not known Popham—he is an entire stranger to me except seeing him at my door—I never saw him at my door before M'Phane came there, nor any where else—I should not have known him from Adam, and I am sure I do not know him.</p>

On the night of the 17th of May, about half-past eleven o'clock, I was up at my window, and saw Watmough coming down Hooper-street, towards my house, talking to three young girls—I told him he would soon be wanted, there being a disturbance at the Farm-house—Watmough replied</p>

I said, "No, you have not"—I said I should speak the truth when I went up to Horsemonger-lane, where he told me I was to go—he told me to prepare myself for Monday—he has not subpœnaed me—he threatened me at Horsemonger-lane, if I appeared here—he took me into a little room, put his finger up, and said, "You had better mind what you are about, or you will get severely punished"—I told him I could not be punished for speaking the truth—that was all he said.</p>

On Monday afternoon I was in Portman-market, standing over the other side of Mrs. Stevens's, not very far from Mrs. Rowghans' shop door, about as far as across this Court—I saw Medhurst and Self with a bit of iron—Medhurst took it from Self, and put it into the lock, and broke it open—Self was helping at the time—as soon as the lock was broken the door was opened, and Self and Burke ran in and took some oranges—Medhurst also went in, and took some oranges—I informed somebody of what I had seen—Med<lb></lb>hurst was taken up by a boy named Shelley—he had some oranges in hit pocket at the time, and the padlock—I picked up the iron—I saw Cannell there, but did not see him do anything—he was standing there at the time the shop was broken open—I did not see him go into the shop—some oranges were thrown out to him, and he picked some up.</p>

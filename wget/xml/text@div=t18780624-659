About 1.15 a.m. on 16th May, I was on duty in the Gwynne Road, Battersea—I heard cries from the direction of Totteridge Road—I went in that direction and saw the prisoners and two women—the prisoners were fighting—Edwin had his coat off and was bleeding over the left eye from a large bruise—another man was present—I parted them and told them to go home—Edwin hit me in the mouth a violent blow with his fist—I took him into custody—he struggled violently—Harding, another constable, came up—before Harding came, Alfred tried to rescue Edwin—when Harding came up, Edwin became more violent—he took out a knife; Harding took it from him—I was thrown down by Alfred and two women—Alfred left me—I got up and went to Harding—I heard a cry "Rip the b——s up"—I heard Harding cry out that he was stabbed—Alfred took Harding's truncheon away and hit me on the head with it, and felled me to the ground—Harding had put it up for protection, using it behind—when I was on the ground, Alfred struck me across the thumb with the truncheon and ran away—he threw Harding's truncheon away—I had my truncheon—I found Harding's truncheon near Alfred's own house—we got assistance and followed the prisoners to 38, Totteridge Road, where they live—constables Golding and Beard came—the sergeant knocked at the door—before that one of the prisoners said the first b—policeman that came in they would rip him up—the sergeant and two constables went in and took them into custody—Edwin was violent—Alfred was quieter—they were both taken to the police-station and charged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>.

(<hi rend="italic">The witness put on the coat</hi>.) This belt is not the same—I never saw the prisoners kicked by the police—I could not say how many people were about—I did not hear a policeman say "Now for your b—game, if that is your b—game," nor see one strike Alfred with some instrument—I never heard the words "Now, <hi rend="italic">Mac</hi>, for your stick, let him have it," nor see either of the prisoners hit by a policeman.</p>

Edwin was helplessly drunk—I cannot say I heard any bad language—in the house I saw a graze on Edwin's forehead; there was blood over it—I did not see other bruises on him then, nor when he got to the station—I call necessary violence this: when a man says "I won't," or lies down, and we have to drag, push, or carry him along—I have no mark of violence on me—Edwin kicked, struggled, and resisted—I felt the kicks—when I came up I did not see a single individual till a man came up, and I told him to go to the station for assistance—I do not know the man's name—he is not here—I heard no complaints of the police.</p>

               <p>several minor contusions—Mc Brine had the most severe, and Harding had the stab which might be caused by a knife—the prisoner Edwin had some contusions on the head; blood was flowing down his forehead; over the right eyebrow he had an abrasion three or four inches in length and about half an inch in width; his nose was bleeding, and his hands and face were covered with blood—the prisoner Alfred had contusions on the head, his nose was bleeding, and his hands and face were covered with blood—all their noses were bleeding—the abrasion was from a fall, and the bleeding of the noses from blows—Edwin had been drinking very much; the other prisoner had been drinking to a certain extent—it depends upon what they fought with as to whether all the injuries were consistent with the fight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, and live at 38, Totteridge Road, Battersea—I gave evidence at the police-court—on this night I had been with the prisoners all the evening—they had a few glasses of ale, but were not drunk—I am a teetotaller—they began jollying one another on the way home—in about 200 or 300 yards they had a tussle—Edwin ran at Alfred, and they both turned round sharp and fell to the ground—I saw no blood then—the police came up while they were on the ground—a policeman caught hold of Edwin's collar and used him very roughly, and said he would take him into custody—I have since learned the police<lb></lb>man was McBrine—Edwin asked him what he had to take him for, and said "I suppose you want a charge"—Mc Brine said "Yes, and I mean to have one"—I and the prisoners' wives asked him to let us take the prisoner indoors—he would not, but said he would take him into custody—Edwin then tried to get away—another constable came up—the wives screamed—as I was talking to the wives I heard Edwin scream out that the police were choking him, three or four times, and for a knife to cut his necktie with—I left the wives and saw Alfred doing something to his brother's neck; I could not see what—a policeman said "If that is your b—game," at the same time striking Alfred with a stick or a staff, which felled him to the ground—he must have struck him on the head—he then turned to the other constable that had hold of Edwin's left side, and said "Now, <hi rend="italic">Mac</hi>, for your stick; lot him have it," and the constable hit him on the head and shoulders about four blows—then there was a regular scuffle between the whole lot—all four fell down—Edwin got up—a</p>

I did not see the constables struck—I and the prisoners had been in the Bell Inn, Wandsworth, a great part of the evening—I said before the Magistrate that the prisoners were not drunk, but pretty comfortable—I meant they had had a few glasses of ale and were sociable together—I stayed with them from about 8 o'clock till this occurred—there was no fight between the brothers—I did not see Edwin hit his brother in the nose—the women called out to the police, "Don't, don't."</p>

I am a tin-plate maker, of 12, Totteridge Road—I was awakened by this disturbance—I looked out of window and saw Edwin in the custody of two officers about 20 yards off—they were dragging him along with such violence that I heard him cry out for them to release their hold, as he felt they were choking him, and he said "Some one cut my shirt-collar," or "my collar"—when he got opposite me he could hardly repeat the words, he was almost strangled—I kept my eyes on the officers—I told them they were brutes to do it, loud enough for them to hear, so did my neighbours—I recognised 348 as one of the constables who held Edwin's collar—I watched them as far as the light would permit me, and the blows were repeated—I heard a female say repeatedly "You will kill him"—I heard the blows struck, they sounded too hard for the fist—I have no knowledge of the prisoners.</p>

            . I work in the brick-fields, and have four or five brothers. I was taken up on this charge, but discharged; the prisoner lodged with me - I was with him at Cooper's on Saturday evening, the 17th of December; I live about a mile and a half from the public-house, and when I got home it wanted half an hour to twelve o'clock; the prisoner went with me home - my wife was up; the prisoner went to bed down stairs, and we went up stairs; I was not out with him after that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he remain in bed all night? A. I cannot say - there are four rooms in the house; no one sleeps with the prisoner - Foy and a great many more were with us at the public-house; the prisoner is a brick-maker- I had a brown rough great coat on that night; the prisoner had a white smock-frock on - I know Mr. Austin keeps pigs; we came by his mill to go home, between eleven and twelve o'clock - I did not take the key of the door: the prisoner might have got out.</p>

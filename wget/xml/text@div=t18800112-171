                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant N</hi>). I watched Pratt's Road—I saw the prisoner going towards the post-office; when he saw me he ran away—I followed him—I was in plain clothes—he ran back to 21, Pratt's Road—I followed him—I knocked at the door, and after some time I got admittance—I said to the prisoner "What is your name?"—he said "My Dame is Harris, and I live with my mother and father in the Mile End Road"—I said "Where did you sleep last night?"—he said "Upstairs"—I then went upstairs into a small room with the prisoner; there was a table and a bed, and on them were these papers; these post-cards, addressed to different people, and signed Mean and Co., a copy of the Live Stock Journal of 28th November, with a caution inserted of complaints of Mean and Co.,21, Pratt's Road; this card, "George C. Long, Brickwood Cottage, Upper Addiscombe Road, Croydon. Fowls sent this day. yours, Mean and Co.," and the address—the two cards of the Brook Road, Dalston, address of "A. Reeves, Horticultural Builder, portable greenhouses, &amp;c.;" this circular of "G. Mean and Co., Bicycle Agents, &amp;c.;" this price list of pigeons and this draft for printing "Mean and Co., Insurance Commission and Bicycle Agents, patentees, machines, and miscellaneous dealers, &amp;c.;" also this circular of "Co-operative stores for all kinds of machinery;" also in the same handwriting this poem commencing, "Cast away, thro all the silent day, his dear one far away, the fierce sun hoary beaming, the ocean round him gleaming, the shipwrecked sailor lay alone"—I saw the prisoner's father, and in the prisoner's presence I asked him "Dou you know the prisoner?"—he said "Yes, be is my son."</p>

Chapman was with me during the conversation—I did not go up and tap the prisoner on the shoulder, but went to the door, which was opened by an old woman—after the conversation I sent for the inspector—the prisoner was not then in custody—I did not watch Victoria Park Road at all—I believe the prisoner was the same person who advertised from that address—I believe that place was watched—his father came in about 8 o'clock in the evening—he lives there, and not in Victoria Park Road.</p>

In consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion I received I gave directions to Chapman and Cane to watch 21A, Pratt's Road—on the 5th of December I was sent for to go there—I got there about 3 p.m.—I went upstairs into the bedroom where the prisoner was—I said "What is your name?"—he said "Harris"—I said "Do you know Mean, or where he could be found?"—he said "Mean has not been here for about eight days, and I do not know where he lives"—the bed and also the table in the room were covered with addressed post cards, letters, papers, copies of the <hi rend="italic">Exchange and Mart</hi>—I saw some post cards bearing the date of that day—I said "If Mean has not been here for eight days</p>

               <p>who has written these?"—he said "I wrote some of them"—I said "Which?" and he took up this envelope addressed "Messrs. Thomas Bradbury, 140 to 148, High Holborn, London"—I said "Why they are all in the same writing"—he made no answer—I said to the officers in the prisoner's presence "Remain here till you see whether anybody comes to the house, and whether he may be Mean"—the father was not present then—I returned at 9 o'clock—the prisoner was then alone with the officers—I sent for the father and brother-in-law—I said to the father "Is this lad your son?"—he said "Yes"—I said "A number of people complain of having been swindled by a person of the name of Mean, and this lad appears to have done all the writing; do you know who Mean is?"—he said "I do not, I am engaged all day, and I do not know how he (the son) has been employed"—I asked the brother-in-law his name, and he said Stone—I said to him "Do you know Mean"—he said "I do not, I am engaged in the City all day; I know nothing about the matter"—I then produced the papers in Jubb's case and showed them to the prisoner—I said to him "You will be charged with obtaining 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mrs. Jubb, of Halifax, by false pretences"—he said nothing at that time—he was taken to the station and the charge formally read over to him—he then said "I wrote these papers for Mean" (the papers were in his hand at the time) "but I know nothing more about it"—I and Chapman had taken possession of the papers and they were brought to the station—I have been carefully through them—the draft in the name of Mean is in the same writing as all the other documents, including Jubb's papers—the 41 letters of complaint is an analysis of the <hi rend="italic">Exchange and Mart</hi> Black Book—the receipt of this post-office order signed "R W. Whitehead" is also the same writing; also the signature to this way bill—I have tried to find if Mean exists and I have failed to find him—I also called at 140, Park Road—I saw a woman that I now know to be the prisoner's mother; also Mr. Reeve, the father—the first complaint of Pratt's Road was in October—the prisoner's parents left Victoria Park Road in July—in the intermediate time they were at Reeves's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a meat salesman in Newgate Market, the prisoner was in my service as clerk for twenty or twenty-one months—his duties were to book the meat that was sold, and to receive money for it from various customers, and to pay the money to whoever came for it, and pay it into the bank—he had to make entries in his cash-book and to account to me for the money in the book—this is the cash-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I find no entry here of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from George Miller on 6th November, or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Samuel Stacey on 5th October, or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Bannister on 28th September—the prisoner has not accounted to me for those sums in any way—he left on 6th November without notice, and I never saw him again till he was in custody about a fortnight since.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the prisoner assisting or was he the only clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was clerk—he had nothing to do with selling, merely receiving and paying money and keeping the accounts—the customers pay the money to him, not to the man who weighed the meat; that may some<lb></lb>times happen on a Saturday, when we are very busy—the prisoner did not go out collecting money, except when I have occasionally told him to do so—these entries are in his writing—the sums stated here are a number of small items—I have not the day-book here—I will send for it—Mr. Miller is Mr. Wiseman's man; this 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was for meat had some time previously—the cheques are entered here separately—the cheques paid were drawn by the prisoner and signed by me—these moneys were all received by the prisoner, whether in cheques or not, and by him sent to the bank—sometimes I don't check my accounts for a month, sometimes once a fortnight, and sometimes in not above a day or two—he was not in the habit of taking the money to the bank—he has done such a thing when the other men have been busy—I have my bank book here, showing the exact sums sent in each day—I have examined that and find it correct according to this book—I began to go strictly through the books when I found these deficiencies on 7th November—I have six men in my employment—the prisoner sits in a sort of counting-house—the men do not take the money to him—they have nothing to do with the money—we generally commence business about five in the morning; sometimes the clerk will have done by one o'clock, sometimes two or three, and on Saturday it is generally later, at seven—the money is generally sent to the bank the same day, when it is convenient for him to make it up, sometimes as late as three, sometimes at one—during the week some thousands are paid in—I have now got my day<lb></lb>book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have known the prisoner for a long while—he was out of a situation when I took him—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week to start with, and I rose him to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe all these entries in the day-book on Saturday, 28th September, are the prisoner's entering—he kept all the books; that</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printers' warehouseman, and live at 12, Bath Place, Addington Square, Camberwell—on Tuesday, 12th September, about 12.15 a.m., I was. in John Street, Smithfield, and was attacked by two men; one caught me in this way, and the other over the shoulder—I think I said "What do you want here? What! another one on me, too!" and before I had time to speak I was down, and struck my face on the ground, and my nose bled—I got up, and missed my watch and guard—the men went away as fast as they could, and a policeman came and sent me to the hospital—I was hurt very much; I got my eye blinded, and had to be shut up for nearly thirty hours—the prisoners are the men, I am positive—that I absolutely swear—I picked them out from thirteen or four<lb></lb>teen others, and am positive of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am night watchman at the Dead Meat Market—on Tuesday morning, 10th September, just at 12.15, I was in St. John Street, turning out of St. John's Lane, and heard a feeble cry of "Stop thief!"—I looked round in the direction of the sound, and saw an old gentleman on his hands and knees, getting up, and three men running away from him—I stood still, and they ran by my left—I caught a momentary glance, and then turned round and saw their backs—the prisoners are two of them—I had seen their faces about there previously—they were not perfect strangers to me—I was called to the police-station, and saw Gardener with about a dozen others—I said that, to the best of my opinion, Gardener was one of them, but I could not swear—Gardener pulled a paper out of his pocket, and said that he had been at work—I pass by Peter's Lane night and morning, and that made me fear I should be molested—I went there again on the Saturday following, and identified Gee—I have not the least doubt that he is the man.</p>

On 9th September I was on duty in Peter's Lane, St. John Street, and saw the prisoner Gee—I knew their names when I was before the Magistrate, but I made a mistake—I am quite sure the man I mean is the man here, I called him Gardener—I saw him between 11.30 and 11.45—I heard cries of "Police!" proceeded to the spot, and found the prosecutor lying on the pavement with his nose bleeding; he was just getting up—he complained, and I took him to the hospital; the watchman came up at the time.</p>

I took Gardener on 10th September, took him to the station, and told him I took him for being concerned with two others, not in custody, in stealing a watch from an old gentleman, and assaulting him, between 12 and 1 o'clock in the morning—he said, "I know nothing about it, I can bring witnesses to prove that I was at work all night;" he afterwards said, "What time did you say it waif"—I said, "Between 12 and I this morning"—he said, "I was at home and in bed at the time"—I took him to the station, he was placed with fourteen others and let go, because Best did not identify him—Gardner lifted up his hand, shook it, and said, "Mind what you are saying for I am a respectable man"—I re<lb></lb>apprehended Gardener on the Saturday evening.</p>

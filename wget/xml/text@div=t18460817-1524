Pocock, "with the word "apoplexy"written on it—this is it (produced)—I took the information from her where he died, and where he was interred—she made a statement, from which I wrote down the registry, except the word "apoplexy, "which I took from the paper—she signed the entry—I have it here—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>, "No. 170; died, 29th of May, 1846, at No. 79, Golden-lane, John Palk, male, 53 years, warehouseman, apoplexy, certified, signed Jane Palk, present at the death")—she signed this herself, and I gave her the certificate now produced—I asked why she let it stand so long after the death, why she kept him so long before she buried him, the weather being warm—she said her circumstances would not allow her to bury him before—I</p>

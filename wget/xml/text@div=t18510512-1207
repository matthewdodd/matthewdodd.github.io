                  </hi> I am a widow. I carry on the business of a painter and glazier, at Blackheath—the prisoner lived five years in my ser<lb></lb>vice—his wages were 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he was in my service up to the 29th April—from time to time things were missed out of my shop—in consequence of something that occurred I took a policeman to the prisoner's house on 29th April, about eight o'clock in the evening, and gave him in charge—he was not employed by me to paint the house next to where he lived—he had been working for me that day, and had left about five—the policeman searched his house, and produced these articles—I believe these suckers are mine—this hose belongs to my pump—I had not misted it—I forget when I had seen it last—there is no mark <hi rend="italic">on</hi> it, but my son-in-law put it into the pump. and found it exactly fitted—I can speak to this glue-pot—I was looking for it for some time—I had asked the prisoner to look for it for me, and he told me he could not find it—I thought that a person who worked in my employ had borrowed it, and told the prisoner to go there and look for it—he went, and said he could not get it—the prisoner had not the smallest authority from me to take any of my things to his house.</p>

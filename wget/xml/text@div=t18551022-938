                  </hi>. I am buyer in the hosiery department to Messrs. Leaf, of Old Change—Mr. William Leaf has more than one partner—the prisoner was in their service, and was in my department as salesman—he managed the fancy department, and had authority to purchase goods for the house—it was his duty to examine goods brought in with the invoices, to put ticks to each item, and pass the invoice to me—the ticks would be a voucher to me that the goods were in stock—I am acquainted with his ticks, and believe these to be his (<hi rend="italic">looking at an invoice</hi>)—I received</p>

               <p>this invoice the same evening—I have looked for the goods, but cannot find them in stock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is the prisoner the only person in your department who has the power of ticking these things off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it is the tick to the left, in pencil—about eight persons tick invoices off, but only the prisoner in that department—if he was away, perhaps I should do it, or I might send some one—nobody but myself could send anybody to supply his place—I am certain he passed the invoice to me on that day, and I believe I saw him, but cannot say positively—I have been in the habit of seeing his ticks for four or five months in that department—I can tell they are his by the way they are done—the hosiery is my department, and I authorise him to buy these little things, but it is named to me first if there is any large amount—he has general authority to buy articles of a particular description—he has purchased to a great extent at different times—he has been with Messrs. Leaf seven or eight years, and five or six months in my department—before that, he was general salesman in the hosiery—it is since his removal to this department that he has been a purchaser—this invoice is dated 19th Sept, and was presented to me on that night, and passed to my drawer—we had not many crochet sleeves at that time—I have looked at the books to see if these goods have passed our books; that was a few days after he left—he left three or four days after the invoice came in—the invoice was sent in with the goods, and sometimes before, and if we write into the country for goods, we generally have the invoke two or three days before the goods—from a week to a month may elapse before we pay—we have bought of H. and F. Nathan for a year or two—I have nothing to do with paying them; they have it when they apply for it—supposing this to be a genuine transaction, the goods may have beet delivered two or three days before the invoice was sent in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose on 1st Sept. you had twelve dozen or twenty dozen crochet sleeves, and on 15th Sept. you found you had none, have you any entries by which you would be able to discover on what day, and to whom they are sold? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they are not here—we make all sorts of entries—it is a wholesale house only—I should find the goods entered in the Journals as being sold—the entry in the Journal is in my department—I am speaking from my own knowledge—goods are sometimes sent in two or three days before the invoices, and the invoices are sometimes sent in before the goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a manufacturer of fancy goods, at No. 58, London-road, and have been in the habit of furnishing Messrs. Leaf with crochet work and sleeves. On Wednesday, 19th Sept., I saw the prisoner at their warehouse—I have been in the habit of taking goods there, and giving the invoices to the prisoner—I went there to solicit orders, and he told me he had taken a quantity of goods for a debt of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he had no means of disposing of, that Messrs. Leaf would not purchase them of him, and he had no way of getting rid of them without sending them into the house—I asked him what I was to do—he said that he wanted me to make out an invoice for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him whether I should send the goods—he said, "No, I have got them here; the stuff is cheap enough;" meaning the goods—I asked him to give me a copy of the invoice, as I did not know what he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220051"></xptr>
               <p>meant—he gave me this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to copy it from, and told me to make out an invoice and send it to him, which I did—this is the invoice—my sister made it out by my directions, believing he had 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods there—he said, "I wish you would receive your account sooner than usual, as I am rather short of money"—he meant my monthly account there was an account due to me at the end of the month—I sent the invoice on the next day to Messrs. Leaf by my servant Mary Pockson—it was Tuesday, 18th Sept., that I was there as far as I remember, and on the following Saturday the prisoner came, but I did not see him the first time—he came a second time, and said that he was discharged from Messrs. Leaf's—I asked him what it was for, and he said, after some hesitation, that it was in consequence of giving a bill, similar to the one he had given me, to a person named Myers, and if Messrs. Leaf said anything to me about, I was to stoutly deny it—he said nothing about the bill being paid—I said, "Why do not you sell them to them yourself?"—he said, "No, that will not do; they would not buy them in my name"—that was the reason that induced me to send them in in my name—afterwards my suspicions were aroused, in I went and told Mr. Leaf.</p>

Leaf's—I receive bills one a month—there might be twenty bills due—sometimes they pay a sum on amount—when the goods are sent in, and the bills passed, the statement of them is pat on one paper at the end of the month and sent in, and they pay the whole amount—before seeing the prisoner on Saturday, I had sent in goods amounting to 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was on Friday—I was paid for that the week after—I have been in business a year and ten months, and have served the house ever since—I have known the prisoner about five months—I never saw him before he was in that department—he was in the habit of giving me orders as buyer.</p>

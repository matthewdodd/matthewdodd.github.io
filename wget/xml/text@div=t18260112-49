On Friday, the 16th of December, about eight o'clock in the morning, I found the iron-grating of the front kitchen window broken, the sash forced open, and three rabbits were gone from the hutches, which were in the kitchen; I had seen it all safe between ten and eleven o'clock the night before; the railing and sash were secure. On the 21st I found my rabbits at St. Luke's watch-house, and am sure they were mine.</p>

I opened the shutters, got in, and found the two prisoners up stairs, and four rabbits running about the room - they both said they did not know where they came from.</p>

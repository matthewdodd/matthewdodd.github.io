                  </hi>. I am a spinster, and live with my mother at 9, Princes-road, Lambeth—we occupy the two parlours—on Sunday morning, 5th May, we went to bed about 11 o'clock—our two parlours were locked up and the door between them was buttoned—the shutters were shut and bolted, I believe, and the window was shut—between 3 and 4 o'clock I heard a noise in the front parlotir, and on looking round I saw a young man getting over my bed—I began to scream, and he said, "Stop a bit, what is the matter?"—I kept screaming, and he turned round, fastened the door again, and buttoned it as usual—I was in the back parlour—he still kept in the front—he was getting over the bed—I called for assistance, got a young man in, and asked the prisoner what business he had there—he said, "I want my property"—I said, "What property?"—he said, "My two bags"—I know nothing of him; never saw him before to my knowledge—I sent for the police—he told the policeman that he was subject to tits, and did not know how he got there—he had no shoes on—the shutters had been opened, but were shut to again—the hearth rug was turned on one side—it was moved.</p>

The prisoner has lodged with me more than two years, up to the present time—he left about eight months ago, but used to come and see me—he came a fortnight ago, and had a fit at my house—he serves the shops with toys and has three or four bags, but he generally carries two—he is subject to very curious fits; not exactly like fits—sometimes he has them three times a-day, and he would lie down and go to sleep for three hours before they go off—he is more like a person out of his mind, at times—he had them every fortnight, but when he was taking medicine they were not so strong—I remember his coming in at the window instead of the door, and he took his boots off, and lay down in the parlour—that was a twelvemonth before—he went to sleep for three hours, and was taken to bed.</p>

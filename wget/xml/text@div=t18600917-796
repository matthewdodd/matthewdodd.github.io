On Wednesday, 20th August, I went with Huggett, another officer, to 16, Laystall-street, Clerkenwell, and found the prisoner Smith—he carries on business there as a boot-maker—he his a bed-room on the top floor, and a workshop in the back kitchen—I said to him, "I understand, Mr. Smith, you have been selling a quantity of uppers to the trade, in London and in the country; of whom did you buy them!" telling him that I was a detective—he said, "I bought them of a short man, who I should know, if I saw him again"—I said, "Do you know his name!"—he said, "No; I do not"—I said, "Have you any more uppers by you?"—he said, "Yes; I have"—he then went into the workshop with us, where there were several men at work, and Mr. Joseph, who was with us, pointed out eight pairs of uppers for women's boots, saying that they were his—they were on the lasts, being worked up—we then went to Smith's bed-room,</p>

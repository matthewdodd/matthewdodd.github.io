            . Q. You are the deputed mariner on board the Rattle Snake. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you so on the 15th of September last. - Yes, she is a lugger belonging to the customs.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 15th of September you were on board of one of the boats of the Rattle Snake. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any boat that attracted your attention. - A. Yes, in the Walmer road, a little before eleven at night; we chased the boat and came up with her, when she found that we came up with her, she ran on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was she to the shore when you first saw her. - A. She was about thirty rods off.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it turn out that she contained. - A. Spirits in half anchors. She was full when I seized her first.</p>
               <p>Q. You seized her. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. After she got on shore you actually seized her. - A. Yes, the boat's crew were with me at the time, I saw the mob assemble on the beach, I cannot tell what number they were. I sent after the soldiers directly, I went up on the beach, and told the mob to keep off, if they did not I would fire into them, they gave three huzzas and ran down to the boat, and began to take out the tubs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what number they took out. - A. No, I cannot say, I judge that there might have been about sixty taken away, because the boat was full when I seized her, and afterwards there were left but thirty-two. When I saw them take out the half anchors, I fired a couple of pistols over them, that was for a signal for the other Custom house boats to come to assist; d not desist, I ordered the boats<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300033"></xptr>crew to fire in upon them, the fire was not returned just at that present time; finding that I could not keep them off, I ran up to the barracks, the soldiers were just coming out, they came down with me, the serjeant is here of the 21st Regiment, he came down with a party and assisted, then when I came I fired my piece, and ran round the boat, and the mob left it, they ran up behind the boats that laid on the top of the beach, the mob did, and then they fired two or three pieces, the mob did, we could see the flashes but not see the people, we tried to get the boat off, at the time they fired I ran up on the top of the beach, there I saw Leonard, he told me he took a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man. - A. Yes, I told him to take care of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the man. - A. I did not know the man then, I knew him since, I saw him on board our lugger the next day morning.</p>

            . I am a private in the 23d Light Dragoons.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 15th of September, were you stationed at Walmer barracks, near Deal. - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Custom-house officer come to your barracks for the assistance of the military. - A. Yes, about a quarter before eleven o'clock, at that time there was firing going on at the beach, I and others went to the beach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go between the public houses called the Good Intent, and the King's Head. - A Yes, the firing was going on then, I think it proceeded from different parts, right and left; the fire was mostly on the left, but some on the right, Smith was with us, he told me to fire to the left, I fired twice accordingly to the left, I had no more ammunition I drew my sword, I then observed firing at my left, about twenty yards off or better; I instantly ran to the spot where I had seen the flashes of that firing. I found three men standing there behind a boat, I struck one of these three men with my sword, somewhere about the shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q Was that man the prisoner at the bar. - A. I cannot say, it was dark.</p>
               <p>Q Upon your so striking that man somewhere near the shoulder, did that man speak to you - A. Yes, I do not think I touched the skin. I left a mark upon the jacket, the man said soldier, do not strike me, I am a man of Deal, and have a small family, I seize him directly, and made him my prisoner, I delivered him over to Serjeant Lamshire.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any doubt whatever that the last firing, by the flash of which you ran to that boat, proceeded from that boat where these three men were. - A. I should think it was, I have no doubt of it, it must be some or one of them, the last firing I think was only one piece discharged at the spot to which I ran.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were the three men to the boat when you came up to them. - A. They were all three in the rear of the boat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You fired all your ammunition, and then drew your sword. A. Yes, I was about twenty yards from the boat from which I saw the flash come, and so far from the Custom house boat.</p>
               <p>Q. The persons that were in the boat could not tell but that it came from the other boat. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So there were distinct parties firing on the ground</p>
               <p>Q. You struck some man on the shoulder, and you did not touch his skin, but you think you cut his coat. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That man had not any stick. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any ammunition, or guns, or any thing of that sort. - A. No, not about the place.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor in the boat. - A. No.</p>
               <p>SERJEANT LAMSHIRE I am a Serjeant, I was on barrack guard at Walmer barracks, I belong to the 23d Dragoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the last witness Leonard - A. I did; when I went out first there was a great deal of firing from the left of our party, there were firing from different places.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the smuggling vessel - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any firing from them - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being between the public houses, the Good Intent, and the King's Head - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did you hear any firing - A. I did, at that present time I gave orders to my men to fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any person that Leonard had in charge - A. He gave me up the man he took, which I supposed to be one of the smugglers, it was very dark but I think it is the prisoner, it is the same man I delivered to Riley, I heard him say to Leonard when he struck him, Soldier, have mercy. I am a man of Deal, and have a small family.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. When you were between these two public houses, the Good Intent and the King's Head you heard a firing, you could not say from whence it came. - A. No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to say that you did not hear any firing until you came there - A Oh yes, I heard different firing as soon as I came out of the barrack gate before I got to the two public houses, but more when we got between the two public than there were before.</p>

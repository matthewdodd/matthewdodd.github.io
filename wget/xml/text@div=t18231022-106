I told them I had none. The prisoner struck me on the left temple with his fist, and made me stagger; he then took my hat off, and ran away with it - the other man followed him. I pursued, and got my hand round his neck, endeavouring to get my hat from under his right arm - he threw me down; I held him, and he fell down also - he got my fingers into his mouth, and bit them. I called out Watch and Murder; the watchman, a young man, and several others, came up directly - the other man ran away. The prisoner was secured with the hat under his arm. I held him till the watchman came up, and then let go - he ran some distance, but the watchman secured him; somebody picked the hat up, and gave it to me. I never lost sight of him; he appeared very drunk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. He is one of Mr. Pickford's men - A. Yes. I did not think he was larking; his companion laughed. I did not throw stones at him. He came up to me in a reeling drunken way.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He had a cut on his head - A. Yes; he fell against the wall and cut it. He was very much intoxicated.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was all a lark. The boy was saucy, and I knocked his hat off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Castle-court, Badge<lb></lb>row. The prisoner worked at my place—I saw a piece of mahogany framing at Mr. Griffiths's last Saturday fortnight, which was mine—after the prisoner's wages were paid I watched him, and saw him go into Griffiths's shop, and re<lb></lb>main there a very short time—he then brought out the mahogany panel—I let him carry it as far as Cannon-street, then stopped him—it was mine—I brought him back to my shop, gave him a reprimand, and let him go—I searched his premises on the Monday, and found a number of pieces of mahogany veneers, rosewood and other wood, and other things; in consequence of which, I charged him with stealing this panel, which I had bought three or four days before.</p>

A</hi> cabinet-maker and auctioneer—I am not a furniture-broker—the prisoner was fourteen months in my service up to the 24th of June, he then left, till within three days of this robbery—I had no character with him—his nephew asked me to give him work, and I knew he knew nothing about his character—he assisted me at sales at times—I never had a sale where there was this description of wood—I never allowed my men to take what is called the clearance of sales, or refuse of property sold—I never give them anything, nor take anything myself—I leave three or four blank lots in a catalogue for any thing that may be omitted—everything is sold—when I let the prisoner go I told him I had found out the thief, though he had been accusing other men—I had discharged other men on his account—I had not a man but what he taxed with robbing me—he said it was true, and he was very sorry for it—he did not say he took it for firewood, as he considered he was allowed—I had seen the panel between twelve and four o'clock that day—it is worth about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is Spanish mahogany—I went to the prisoner's house, and saw his wife—I said, "I would do anything for you, <hi rend="italic">Betsy</hi>, as I have done for the family for years; but for him, never let me see him"—I did not say, "if the prisoner is got rid of," nor "The sooner you, or we, get rid of him the better," nothing of the sort—I believe I shook hands with his wife—this was before he came in—I believe I never spoke to Betsy after he came, except "Good bye"—I always call her <hi rend="italic">Betsy</hi>—I said nothing about getting him transported, or getting rid of him—I do not think I shook hands with her more than once—I did not say, "I will do anything for you;" "but let us," or "when we get rid of him"—his wife was formerly in my service, and I knew her when a child—she came to my house, I think, the day after he was given into custody—I swear I have not seen her more than twice at my house since he was taken into custody, or elsewhere, except in this Court—she came to my house, and asked me not to appear against him, to speak in his favour, and have mercy on him—I told her they had put things out of my power—she was a year and a half or two years in my service—she is about thirty years old—she is not related to me—when she came to my house I saw her in my shop, never up stairs—she was there five or ten minutes—she came to fetch her husband's tools—I did not see her more than once—I did not say I would assist her with money, nor tell my son to say so—I have not been to the prisoner's house since he has been in custody—I do not think I should have prosecuted him, if I had not found at his house the very things he charged a servant girl with stealing—that was some harp-strings—I discharged both servant girls and every man I had, on his account—he taxed every one with dishonesty—I cannot suppose his wife knew the things were at the house, from the respectability of her family—the mother was present—I said I must get rid of him, not to have any more to do with him—I did not use the word" first"—I have known the family thirty years, and felt an interest for them—I believe his wife to be a virtuous woman.</p>

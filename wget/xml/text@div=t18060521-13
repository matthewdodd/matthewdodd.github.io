On the 12th of May the prisoner came to me and asked me if I would go with her and buy a gown, and to pay so much a week, I told her I bought things of Mr. Tray, I took her to his shop, and after the gentleman had taken down two pieces of cotton I saw my young master coming, I followed my master, he went to my room, and I went after him, I forgot to go back to the person I had left in the shop: I had been home ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before I found that she had taken this bit of cotton.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Phillips) You had not agreed to let her have a gown to pay so much a week. - A. I had not.</p>

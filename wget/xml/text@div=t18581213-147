               <p>I was in Mr. Ingleby's employment—I had been in his service three months, doing the house work—since I have been there I have sold things to the prisoner, such as grease and bones—I do not know that he knew in whose employment I was—on 18th November I took these four finger-plates to him—I had taken them off the doors at Mr. Ingleby's house, and the</p>

Yes; I was a pot-boy formerly, but have left—I was four years with Mr. Sprule at the Druids' Arms as pot-boy, and I now drive a horse and cart for Mr. Stubbs, a grocer at Greenwich—I am his weekly servant—the prisoner was taken on the Friday evening—I did not know that he was taken until after he was taken—I heard it on the Friday evening about 9 o'clock—there is not a trade society meeting at the Druids' Arms, but it is a general rule that I make to look in there in the evening; and perhaps two or three times a day—the prisoner was standing in front of the bar when I entered—he did not remain till 11 o'clock—he went into the parlour, and so did I—the Druids' Arms is, as near as I can say, a hun<lb></lb>dred yards from his shop—I have known him about two years—I was pot<lb></lb>man at the house when he came there, and he was a customer—he remained in the parlour till 11 o'clock that night, with me and others—I was there the whole time from 6 till 11—I was amusing myself at a game of dominoes, and the prisoner was one with us—we played a four-handed game, and I was his partner—we played for a pot of porter—I cannot say how many games we played—we played at dominoes from 6 till 11; for pots of porter the whole time—we played for one pot, and when one game was done, we commenced another; the prisoner being my partner from 6 till 11—a young man named Franling, was against us, and Neale, a soldier—they remained our antagonists the whole of the time; but we did not play all the evening—sometimes we sat for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and then played again—I left the room once for half a minute, to go out backwards—the waiter attended to us in the parlour; he is not here, that I am aware of—I did not notice that the landlord was serving at the bar—I am not aware that anyone is here from the public-house—I was asked to come here last Saturday evening at 8 o'clock—I have not spoken to anybody about this matter, to my knowledge, from the time it occurred, until last Saturday evening—I have seen the prisoner at that public-house twice or three times a week—I have seen Franling there frequently, and Fuller.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you know the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have known him about two years; he is a neighbour of mine—I have not been in the habit of visting him; I know him to speak to; I was out in his company once—White's mother paid me for his board and lodging; she did not lodge with him; he was put under my care; his, mother afterwards took him from me—I would not believe him on bis oath, from two or three instances which I have had—he spoke very falsely of my daughter—I do not know that I am obliged to say what it was—he also said that I had beaten him very much, and I have never lifted my hand up to him; his mother told me that he said that—on another occasion he brought a candlestick to my house, and stated that his mistress gave it to him; afterwards he said be found it on a dust-heap—he is at my houee now—I am truly sorry to say this of him, because his parents are respectable, and the mother in particular.</p>

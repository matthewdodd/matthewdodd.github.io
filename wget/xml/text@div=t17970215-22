               <p>Q. Have you any partner? - A. None; the shop is mine. On Wednesday, the 25th of January, between the hours of four and five, I was robbed; I was in the shop; I saw nothing of the robbery, I can only prove the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you then lit your candle? - A. No; I believe we had not: on that day, between three and four o'clock, I sent my eldest apprentice across the way, to watch for the prisoner at the bar; I had seen her, several days before, attempt to take the things from the door, I believe, for nearly a fortnight; I am sure it is the same person.</p>

             sworn. - I am an apprentice to Mr. Buttenshaw, in the Minories: On Wednesday, the 25th of January, between four and five o'clock, I went over the way to a brother of Mr. Buttenshaw's, nearly opposite, and saw the prisoner come and look at the shawls, and draw them three or four inches over the iron; they were printed muslin shawls; she did so a second time, and a third time she came and reached up and took them; she pulled them off and put them under her cloak; I then ran over, and when I had got within a few-feet of her, she saw me; she pulled them from under her cloak, and flung them down, and ran away; -</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150041"></xptr>Q. Are you sure she completely pulled them off the rail? - A. Yes; she had got several yards when she threw them down; I left the shawls, and ran after her, and caught hold of her within two or three yards of where the shawls laid; I never lost fight of her; a little boy picked up the shawls, and brought them to me; the constable has them now; Mr. Buttenshaw gave them to him; I gave them to Mr. Buttenshaw.</p>
               <p>Did you put any mark upon them? - A. No; I shall know them again when they are produced.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of them? - A. Forty-five shillings; they cost that.</p>
               <p>Richard Tippen, the constable, produced the shawls, which were deposed to by Mr. Buttenshaw.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am a hard-working girl; I am a foreigner; I came from Amsterdam; I was never guilty of any such thing; I went to an acquaintance of mine; I never took a sight of the property.</p>

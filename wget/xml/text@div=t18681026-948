I live at 37, Fashion Street, Spitalfields, and I mind carts in Newgate Market—on Saturday, 1st August, I had a horse and cart in charge, belonging to Mr. John Kern, butcher, of Lower Road, Deptford—he came to Newgate Street about 6.20 in the morning—some meat was put into the cart; there were five pigs, a quantity of beef, and some suet—the prisoner came up to me about 8 o'clock, and asked if I had seen his <hi rend="italic">governor</hi>—I said "Who are you?"—he said "Kern"—I said I had not seen his <hi rend="italic">governor</hi> lately—I went away, and came back in four or five minutes—the prisoner was still there; he was taking the nose-bag off the horse's head; he called me and said, "Here is the penny, tell the <hi rend="italic">governor</hi> I have gone on steady"—he gave me a penny for minding it—he got up into the cart, and drove away, meat and all—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I saw him afterwards at the Kennington Lane Police Station, and picked him out from a number of other men directly I saw him.</p>

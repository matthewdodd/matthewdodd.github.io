On the 5th of January I went to bed at eleven o'clock at night; I sleep in the back room, on the parlour floor; I was awoke about half-past two o'clock in the morning, by my wife, who had heard a noise for some time - we have a cat and dog in the room, and thought it was the cat playing with the weights of the clock; I listened, and heard them moving and then the clock stopped - I got out of bed, and heard my room door shut; I opened my back parlour door, and saw the clock was gone, and five drawers pulled out - the parlour window wide open, and the half-shutter wide open; I saw a Policeman, and asked him if any body had gone out - he said No; he came into my room, and said the property must be on the premises - he turned his lantern round, and there was a red comforter on the second stair; the privy door is behind the street door - I pulled the privy door open; the Policeman turned his lantern round, and the prisoner was sitting on the seat of the privy, with my clock, tied up, at his feet, and a bundle at his feet, tied in a red handkerchief; the clock was going when my wife awoke me - he must have got in at the window, which was shut safe when I went to bed; here is the clock and the two bundles - it is all my property.</p>

            . I am a drover. I was at Holloway on Monday morning, the 13th of August, at about seven o'clock; I saw the prisoner driving the sheep through Holloway while I was taking a pint of beer. I asked him if he wanted any person to help him to drive them, and he agreed to my assisting him. Going along, he said, he was going to Smithfield. I asked him whose sheep these were, and he said, they were his own, and he was a farmer, at Bowden Green, below Northampton, from whence he had brought them. I asked him, who was his salesman at Smithfield, and he said, he had no one in particular; I recommended Mr. Ealand to him, and he agreed to him. When we came to Smithfield, I spoke to Mr. Ealand, and he spoke to the prisoner, and entered the sheep into his book. In about an hour and a half, the officers came in search of the prisoner, and he was taken at the Fortune of War public house.</p>

            . I am a Smithfield salesman. Application was made to me by the last witness to seel these sheep, on the morning of Monday, the 13th of August; I was introduced to the prisoner, who told me that they were his own, and he was a farmer, at Bowden Green, below Northampton. I asked him if he was a dealer in sheep, and he said, no. He said, that there were six score; they were all marked J. L. I asked him his name, and he said, it was Wright. He then asked me if I was a regular salesman? I told him, I was; and he said, very well, he should put the stock in my hands, and I must do the best I could for him.</p>

            , ESQ. After I had received information of the loss of my sheep, I went up to Smithfield immediately, and we took the prisoner at about eleven o'clock at the Fortune of War public-house. These sheep were worth one hundred and ninety-two pounds; that was what I gave for them; but I should be very sorry to take that for them.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. In consequence of an information being given me against the prisoner; I took him into custody, at a little after eleven, at the Fortune of War. I asked him what his name was, and he told me it was

            . On searching him, I found a paper, and asked him from that, if he did not live at Redburn, and he said, he did, and had worked with several farmers there. I then asked him if his name was not Draper, and he said, it was. I asked him what was his reason for taking so many sheep; his answer was, that as " he was determined to be hanged, he might as well be hanged for the whole flock, as for two or three. He said, he had shortly before come out of Hertford gaol, where he was imprisoned for three years before, for sheep stealing. I then took him to Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If there had been twice as many more, I should have taken them, for I was quite insane at that time. About sixteen years ago, I was bitten by a mad dog, and was dipped in the salt water at Gravesend for it, and I am always insane in the months of July and August. I really do not know how I came by these sheep at all.</p>

On 10th July I was in King Wil<lb></lb>liam Street, City, with Halse and Gilbert, and saw the four prisoners sitting down—Johnson went by the side of a lady, where some new pavement was being laid down; Simmonds stood partly in front of her, and the other two prisoners were a little distance away—Johnson put his left hand in the lady's pocket, but did not appear to take any thing—they continued loitering for some time, and Read and Carter went to the other side of the road, and came round the other side—Simmonds and Johnson remained where they were—Johnson placed himself by the side of a gentleman, who was standing by the edge of the kerb—Simmonds was partially in front of him, and Carter and Read three or four yards away on the gentleman's right—Johnson put his left hand under his arm, laid hold of the chain, and drew the watch out—he was immediately seized by Halse—Simmonds was walking rather hurriedly away from the crowd, and I caught him—Gilbert caught the others, and we pushed them all into an office till we got further assistance, and took them all to the station—we had seen them all together the previous day, with another.</p>

On 9th July I was with Down and Halse, and saw the prisoners together—on 10th July we were at the corner of Gracechurch Street, and saw the four prisoners—they surrounded a lady, but I was not near enough to see what they did—I saw Carter and Read cross over and surround a gentleman, but I cannot say what they did—from what Halse said I seized Carter and Read, and pushed them into a door<lb></lb>way—I afterwards told them it was for stealing a gold watch.</p>

It was close upon 2 o'clock, and I turned to go away, and saw a lot of people stooping. I saw the detective pick up something close to my feet; I did not know it was a watch. When I was taken he shouted out "Stop, Jim, I have got the watch." I never saw the other prisoners before in my life. The prosecutor says he took the watch out of my hand, which is false.

               <p>Q. Did the woman go to bed too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was sober enough to know that? did she undress? - Yes, and I missed my money, ten guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss your money? - Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; the girl was then gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen your ten guineas over night? - At six o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been at six o'clock in the morning? - I got ten guineas, I had it in my pocket some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that all the account you can give of this ten guineas? - I had it some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you as a post boy driving about on the road carry ten guineas about you? - I had had my box broke open a little before at my lodgings the Coach and Horses, Charles-street, Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man of the house know that you had your box broke open? - No, it was broke before I brought it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it broke open? - At the Thatched House in Red Lion-street, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the people of the Thatched House that your box was broke open? - I did, his name is Tomkins.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you say you got these ten guineas, did you get it all at once? - No, I saved it at service.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see it at six o'clock in the morning? - I lost half a guinea with the first woman, I was with another woman before this.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110174"></xptr>Q. Was ever any of this money found? - No.</p>
               <p>- TREADWAY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer, I searched the girl and found no money on her at all, but I found this piece of paper which he swore to being the paper that his money was rolled up in.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was there any thing wrote on that paper? - No, nothing that I know of, only it had a bit of a slit.</p>
               <p>Court. This is a rather remarkable piece of paper, it is a piece of music.</p>

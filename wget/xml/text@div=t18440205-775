                  </hi>. I am a carrier to Wickford, in Essex. On the 25th of Jan. I was returning from London with my cart and two horses—I stopped at the Rabbits, at Ilford, about half-past ten o'clock at night—my son was with me—I went into the public-house, leaving my coat on the hind ladder of the cart underneath the tilt—I sent my son out to see that the horses and things were all right, and when I went out I missed my coat-while I was in the public-house the prisoners came in together—they asked the landlord to trust them with a pot of beer—he said he would not, and they had nothing—I do not recollect seeing any one else there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman to James Vivian, at the Anchor, in Farringdon-street. On the 4th of December I saw the prisoner with another man, who called himself Leman, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon—the prisoner asked for a pint of beer, which was 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a bad shilling—I saw it was bad—I asked him whether he knew what he gave me—he said, "Yes," and he had taken it of me half an hour before—I knew him before, but I had not seen him for the last three or four months—I kept the shilling—he told me not to keep it—that he had taken it at the Robin Hood—his companion offered to pay for the beer—I sent for a policeman, and then the prisoner paid me in copper—I gave the shilling to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the father of James Vivian. I was sent for to the Anchor public-house when this happened, and went—the constable asked me if I meant to press the charge—I said, he ought to know best, it was my son's business, not mine—the prisoner said I ought not to press the charge, as I knew him to be an old customer—he then said, "I suppose you to be a man of intellect, I know it is a bad shilling, I have other bad money about me, you ought not to do it"—I then told the officer to do his duty, and search him—the officer said, "You must go with me, to my Inspector"—he said, "I shall not go, till I think proper"—the officer sent for more assistance, and they took him away.</p>

I was called into the Anchor public-house, and the prisoner was standing at the bar, with another man—I told the prisoner, he had much better pay for the beer—he said he would not pay for it—I asked him again—he said he would not—the other offered 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay for it—the prisoner took the 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of his hand, and said he should not pay for it—the prisoner paid for the beer himself, with that 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I received this shilling from Leney—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—when Vivian was sent for, I heard the conversation between him and the prisoner—I heard him tell Mr. Vivian, "You are a man of intellect, you ought not to do it"—he said, "Do what?"—the prisoner said, "To press the charge—I know it is a bad shilling, and I have other bad money about me"—he was not searched, there being two together, I detained them till the arrival of my sergeant—he went very quietly half-way up Skinner-street, and then made use of very bad language, tried to force himself out of my hand, and threw himself on his back—I held him by the collar with my right hand, and with my left held his left hand—he struggled very much to get his left hand at liberty—I was present when he was searched at the watch-house, and something went down his trowsers—I picked a purse up, and gave it into the hand of my sergeant—I saw a good half-crown and a bad one, and two good sixpences taken from it.</p>

At the request of the pot-boy of the Robin Hood, I went to Tower-hill to get a ship—we went into the Queen's Head, and made inquiry there whether they wanted recruits for the navy—the landlady said no, they were full—after having two or three pints of beer we returned home—I changed half-a-sovereign at a house near the Minories, and received a half-crown, four shillings, and five sixpences—we then went home—Leney, the boy, said we would have half-a-pint of beer—we went to Vivian's—I tendered a shilling, and he said it was bad—I did not state it was taken from him—he said he should send for a policeman, and I was taken—this half-crown I had received in Leather-lane a fortnight before, and had it knocking about, and on the day stated I put it into my purse—I live at No. 2, Hole-in-the-wall-court, Leather-lane—if I had been disposed to escape I should have paid for the beer and got away—it is evident no person could attempt to pass it as it is now.</p>

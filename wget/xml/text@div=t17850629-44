               <p>This is what I took from the prisoner Richardson, I and one of the patrols of Spitalfields took it from him this day three weeks, a little before one in the morning; we were going our rounds, and happened to see the prosecutor, who said he had been robbed by two fellows, one had got a bundle and the other had not; we asked him which way he thought they were gone, and he pointed up the street, and we pursued them, and in about two hundred yards, we saw these two men standing up nigh a wall, and I stopped Richardson, and in searching of him, these halfpence, and the piece of sixpence dropped out of his waistcoat pocket, I took it off the ground.</p>
               <p>Richardson. He said first, he found it in my right hand waistcoat pocket, and I shewed him I had no pocket in that waistcoat, then he said, he picked it off the ground.</p>
               <p>Mr. James, Prisoner Richardson's Council. When you came up to Richardson, he was standing still? - The officer came up to him before me, when I put my hand in his pocket, the halfpence and piece of sixpence dropped down.</p>
               <p>In that pocket there was a great hole? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Richardson. I know nothing of this prisoner Greenow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Greenow's Council. Pray who pays the expences of this prosecution ? - Billings is to pay it, he paid for the bill being found, we paid our own expences, and the prosecutor paid us.</p>
               <p>Have you settled what share of the reward you are to have if it goes on? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. James. When you was before the Justice, you did not say that you found the money in Richardson's pocket? - I said, the money was in his pocket, and in searching his pocket it dropped on the ground, when I put my hand into Richardson's pocket I found some halfpence.</p>
               <p>(The money produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was two pence halfpenny and a farthing, or three pence and a farthing in copper, and there was one halfpenny bent both ways, it was rather crooked, I cannot swear to the halfpence, they look to be my halfpence, and the sixpence looks to be the same.</p>

               <p>I was the officer of the night, I was going my rounds with the patrol, we met the prosecutor, he said, he had been robbed by two men, one of them had a bundle with something in a handkerchief; we followed them down the next street , I thought I heard them, and we went up the street as fast as we could go, they were standing against a wall; I laid hold of them, one of them who had a bundle, and the patrol searched them while I held them, and puting his hand in his pocket the money fell down on the flag-stones.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, both the prisoners must be acquitted, the point of law goes to the acquittal of both of them; for the boy says, when they came up, they accosted him in an insolent way, and they asked him for his money, but when he said he had but two pence halfpenny or three pence, one of them said, do not take that; therefore, supposing two men attacking a man with intent to rob him, if one repents in the moment, if the other man takes the money yet it will be no crime in him who changes his mind, but, says the prosecutor, which it was that took my money I cannot tell: this is like a case from Ipswich, where five men were indicted for murder, and it appeared upon a special verdict, that it was murder in one, but not the other four, and the Jury had no evidence which committed the blow, and says t he Court, if you cannot positively fix by evidence which is the man that is guilty, we cannot punish any one: besides, in this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290053"></xptr> case, the boy was pointedly examined about the sixpence, and said nothing of it at first, and after that it is material for the sake of justice that you should not suffer him to mend his evidence in so essential a point as the property which was lost, and he expressly said at first that he lost only twopence half-penny.</p>

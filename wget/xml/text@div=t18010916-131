               <p>SARAH RODWELL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am the wife of Henry Rodwell, who keeps a chandler's shop, No. 46, London Wall: On Friday evening, the 4th of September, about eight o'clock, the prisoner and another man came into my shop; he asked me for a quarter of a pound of ham, a three-penny loaf, and some onions, which amounted altogether to ten-pence half-penny; he then threw down a crooked half-guinea for me to give him change; I looked at the half-guinea, and perceived it to be a good one; I sent the half-guinea by my daughter into the little room behind the shop, where a young woman was sitting of the name of

            ; I thought it was a good one, but I sent it in for her opinion of it; she called out to me that it was a good half-guinea; I looked out the change, and was about to give it to the prisoner, when the prisoner said to the man that was with him, he would rather he would pay for it, for he did not wish to have change; I then called for the half-guinea back, and returned it to the prisoner; he put it in his pocket; the other man could not find money enough to pay, and the prisoner then said, he must change; I then looked out the change I was going to give him before, which I gave him, and then he gave me another crooked half-guinea, but much lighter than the other; I immediately perceived it to be a bad one, I am certain it was not the same half-guinea that he tendered me before; I immediately said to the prisoner, here is a bad half-guinea, and they both immediately went out of the shop as quick as they possibly could; I then called out to the young woman, Judy, here is a bad half-guinea; she immediately pursued them, and the prisoner was brought back with the change in his hand; I saw him searched, but cannot say what he had about him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the second half-guinea - the bad one? - A. I gave it to

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I lived at Mrs. Rodwell's; I examined the half-guinea that Mrs. Rodwell sent in to me; I called out that it was a good one; just after that she called out to me, here is a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q.Could you at all see the person of the prisoner? - A. Yes, but I did not take any particular notice; I threw down my work immediately, and ran after them; when I got out, I perceived the prisoner and another man running across the road; I ran after them, and cried, stop thief; Mr. Bond came up, and stopped him, after he had ran near a quarter of a mile from the house; I never lost fight of him, the other man got away; he was brought back, and a constable was sent for; Mrs. Rodwell gave me the bad half-guinea, and I delivered it up before the Lord-Mayor on the Monday following; Prior has got it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BOND sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live in Princes-street, Finsbury-square; I heard the cry of stop thief, I saw the prisoner running in the middle of the street, and I took him by the collar, and stopped him in Little Moorfields; I caught him by the collar, and held him till this young woman came up; she charged him with being the man that she pursued; as soon as I had stopped him, I heard something drop from him, which rattled like money; I did not pick it up, somebody picked it up, I cannot say who; it was brought back, and delivered to the constable.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a constable; I was sent for to Mr. Rodwell's, to take the prisoner in charge; before I got there, Mr. French, another constable, had been sent for, belonging to another ward; he searched him, but I was not by; he delivered over to me a quantity of bad half-guineas, and Mr French said, here is one I have taken out of his waistcoat pocket, the prisoner was then standing close by; I asked where the half-guinea was that Mrs. Rodwell had given change for; she said, I will take care of that myself; I said to the prisoner, have you any more about you; he said, no; I said, you are sure of that; he said, no; I then proceeded to take him to the Compter; there was such a croud round the door, I was obliged to take him to the watch-house, which was close by; I again asked him at the watch-house, have you any more about you; he said, no; I then proceeded to search him, and found two more half-guineas and three shillings; I also found a good crooked half-guinea in his coat-pocket; before the Lord-Mayor, I received from Judith Pedley the half-guinea that she had.(The witness then produced the various articles of money, which were all proved by Mr.

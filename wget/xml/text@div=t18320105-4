            . I am a clerk in the General Post-office. On the 21st of November I was on duty at the branch-office, Lombard-street - it was part of my duty to mark the postage on paid letters; (looks at a letter) here is a mark in my writing, of 3s. having been paid for this letter - a letter received at five o'clock would be sent to the office at six; a bill goes with them; (looking at a paper) this is the bill which went with the letters from the branch office to the General Post-office on the 21st of November; it contains the total amount and number of paid letters - when they arrive it is usual to examine the sum total on the bill, and to re-tell the letters; the amount is 7l. 1s. 2d. - if the amount and number did not correspond with the letters the bill would be altered and signed by two persons - this has not been altered: it is precisely in the state in which I sent it.</p>
               <p> - McMAHON. I am a clerk in the General Post-office. I was on duty on the 21st of November; (looking at the six o'clock bill) this has my signature - it is the bill sent from Lombard-street on the 21st of November; it was my duty to cheque it - I told up the letters, and found the amount corresponded with the amount stated in the bill, or it would have been altered; the letters are then handed to the sorters by me or the messenger - a letter for Falmouth coming with that dispatch, would be forwarded that evening.</p>

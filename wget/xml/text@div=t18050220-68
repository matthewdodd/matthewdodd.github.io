             sworn. - This is the same goose that the last prisoner took; on Saturday, the 26th of January, when we returned from the Mansion-house (where we had been with the last prisoner), about six o'clock, the goose being an article that would not keep, the officer brought it back; I did not lay the goose out directly, I put it out on the board; I was shewing a couple of fowls to a lady; I heard some paper rattle behind me where the goose was laid on; I turned round and saw the prisoner at the bar with her cloak on, which she partly threw over the goose, and with her left hand she 
               <persName id="t18050220-68-person646">drew</persName>
             the goose over the board; I saw the best part of the goose move from the board, she did not go away from the shop; I asked her what she had got there, she said, she had got nothing; I put my hand to her side and there I felt the goose; I took it from her, and gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of this woman before? - A. I have seen her before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going through the market, to provide for me and my family, and there was a cry about this goose; I saw several people stand to see what was the matter; I was standing there because I could not get through; this young man came to me, and said that I was the person that took the goose.</p>

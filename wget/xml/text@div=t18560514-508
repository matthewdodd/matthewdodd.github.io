                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Ochme and Lloyd, solicitors No. 124, Bishopsgate-street; they have also a place of business at Calcutta, On 8th April I was in the back office on the second floor, near 2 o'clock in the day, and heard footsteps crossing the landing; I went on to the landing and saw the prisoner descending the stairs, with a large canvass bag on his shoulder, apparently heavy—I went into the front room, and missed ten volumes of Bittlewood's "Conveyancing Precedents" from the shelves—I immediately pursued the prisoner, and overtook him at the bottom of the second flight of stairs—I called out, "Drop them; I have got you"—he immediately dropped it, and ran off—I pursued him about fifty yards, and, after a considerable struggle, brought him back, sent for a policeman, and gave him into custody—the books were lying on the mat; they were the pro<lb></lb>perty of Mr. Ochme, which I had missed—when I brought the prisoner back, he said, "You had better let me go, and go after the other man; he is going up the street"—I saw no other man.</p>

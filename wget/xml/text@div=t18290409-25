            . On the morning of the 5th of March the prisoner was in the shop - I saw her unpin a gown; she waited a few minutes and left the shop; I missed the gown, and followed her down Robert-street; I accused her of having stolen a gown - she said she had not; I held her child while she turned up her cloak - it was not there; I said she was the person, but as she had not got it I must let her go; I then turned to go back, and saw it hanging over an area close to where she had been - no one else could possibly have put it there; I then ran and overtook her in South Molton-street; I mentioned many things which we had lost - she said she had not taken them, and ran into a public-house; I sent for the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many persons were there in the shop? A. Perhaps about twelve; I must have passed this gown in the area, but my eyes were intent on her; she had only gone one door past the area-other persons left the shop while she was there, but I was induced to watch her; I cannot tell whether I was serving any body, I might, and yet looking at her; I did not see her take the gown, but I saw her unpin it; nobody but her left after she did unpin it,</p>

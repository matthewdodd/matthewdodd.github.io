            . On Wednesday evening, the 11th of November, a few minutes after six o'clock, I was going home to my apartments in Brianton-street I was hustled by five men, just <placeName id="t18121202-23-crimeloc130">by the watchhouse, crossing Oxford-street</placeName>

He rushed me back into the middle of them, and immediately I found the prisoner pull my watch, chain, and seals.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him - A. I did. I immediately called for the assistance of the watchman, and told him that I had lost my watch-chain, and seals.</p>
               <p>Q. One of them pulled your chain, did he - A. Yes; the chain and seals were broken off the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the consequence of pulling your chain - A. It came off from the watch. I called the watchman to my assistance. The person that hustled me stepped between the prisoner and me, as meaning to release him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, did you see the prisoner distinctly at that time - A. Distinctly. I never left him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not collar him, did you - A. No. I called the watchman. The watchman came. They were just coming out of the watchhouse. The watchman took the prisoner from me. I said, that is not the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020015"></xptr>right man; this is the man that robbed me; meaning the prisoner. The watchman took the prisoner. I went with him to the watchhouse. The prisoner was searched at the watchhouse. There were neither chain or seals found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you saw the prisoner - A. Yes, distinctly.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, the chain broke, and the seals were gone - A. Yes; the chain broke close to my watch. I never saw the seals afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what way these people came - A. They came quite close, altogether, and seeing them in the way I made way for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, in this sort of business were you under any sort of apprehension or fear - A. I certainly was, because I gave way for them to pass me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all comprehend what their purpose was - A. It struck me, seeing so many together, that they were pick-pockets. I made no resistance. I put my hand upon my watch, or else my watch would have gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, by putting your hand in that manner, you secured your watch - A. Yes, and the chain broke from the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. This must have been done with some strong force - 
               <persName id="t18121202-23-person287">A. </persName>
            Very strong force indeed. The top of the watch-pocket was a little tore. I know nothing more than taking the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner was the person that took your seals - A. I am quite certain of it. There were three that stood behind him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. You say, you kept your hand upon your watch all the time - A. It was my arm. I shewed you how I put it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you say your hand if you meant your arm - A. It was my arm that I put upon my watch-pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you - A. I have been a servant. I have been out of service four or five months.</p>
               <p>Q. The young man was searched - A. He was. There were two five-pound notes found upon him, and a handkerchief, but none of my property.</p>

            . Q. Were you present at the time the prosecutor has been speaking of - A. No; I came up. I was going to cry the hour of six, on the 11th of November. I was crossing Marybone-lane, in Oxford-street. As I came up, Mr. Ellis said, watchman, take charge of this man. There was a second person stood by Mr. Ellis. He was coming in between Mr. Ellis and the prisoner. I seized that man. Mr. Ellis said directly, watchman, that is not the man that robbed me. Directly I let the other man go, and seized the prisoner. Mr. Ellis had hold of the prisoner by the arm, and he gave him me in charge. I laid hold of the prisoner in like manner, and took him to Marybone watchhouse. He went very willingly. He said, he was sorry that we did not take the rest of the men as well as himself. I put him safe in the watchhouse. The constable searched him in my presence; no seals or key were found upon him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been at my uncle's in Paddington. He asked me to stop, and drink tea with him. I left his house at six o'clock, and was going home to my father. When I arrived at the end of Marybone-lane, a mob got me in the centre of them. I told them, they had better be off; and instantly I spoke, that gentleman said, that is the man that robbed me. I have a better way of getting my bread than picking pockets. So help me God the gentleman did not lay hold of me until the watchman did.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the night of the 9th of May, the warehouse was broken open, and all the ribbons stolen, amounting to about 300l. On the 15th of May, I went with the officer, and found part of them at the prisoner's house, at Bethnal-green.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL MILLER. I am an officer. I went to the prisoner's house with a search-warrant, and found the ribbons in the shop-drawer - He keeps a haberdasher's shop in Bethnal-green-road. The prisoner came in soon afterwards. I asked him where they came from? he said he did not know, but he supposed his wife had bought them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I believe his wife manages the shop; they were not concealed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My wife manages the business; she says she bought them of a hawker. If the officer had come a little later they would have been hung in the window.</p>

               <p>March among the other children in the workhouse—there were about twelve children in that particular ward under a nurse, who was under my superintendence—those were all the sick children under my care—I prescribed for this child poultices on the chest, and a mixture to relieve the cough and difficulty of breathing, and a slight mercurial powder—it got so much better under my care that on 8th February I was able to allow itto go out and go to the Police Court when I was examined—I said that "It was in considerable danger for four or five days, suffering from irritation of the brain"—at that time there was very little to be said about the lungs except that the immediate effect of cold had congested them—inflamation of the lungs had not taken place then—cougestion is what is called in popular language a cold in the chest; it may vary in degree, and in children it is difficult to ascertain the exact condition—I have no recollection of having said anything then about the lungs—the signs of inflammation of the lungs are difficult to perceive, especially by non-medical people, so that a weakly child may have been ill without people discovering it—I was examined here on: 3rd March, and if I said nothing then about any chest disease, the inflammation I have no doubt had at that time passed away, leaving the consolidation of the lungs of which I spoke—I montioned the consolidation of the lungs before the Coroner, and also the softening—I examined the child on 19th March, and found inflammation of the membranes of the brain—the inflammation of the brain would come under the description of inflammation of the <hi rend="italic">arachnoid</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pia mater—I</hi> know Dr. Tanner's "Index of Diseases," and agree with him that "Inflammation of the arachnoid and pia mater may arise without apparent cause"—an influenza cold might be accompanied by some inflammation both of the head and of the bronchial tubes—we are exposed to influenza colds at any moment—congestion does not follow upon inflammation; it is the other way; inflammation follows upon congestion—where there has been congestion for some time, inflammation is very apt to follow; it is an effort of nature to throw off congestion—inflammation might possibly occur in any person who had been suffering from congestion on being restored to a better state of health—I do not think any medical attendant was with me when I made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—I had nothing to do with the charge before the Magistrate, and I was not consulted as to the state of the child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons—either the inflammation of the brain alone or the inflammation of the lungs alone, would amply account for death—the inflammation of the lungs had materially weakened the child and rendered its state more serious—the other organs were healthy—I saw the mark round the throat—I do not think a handkerchief tied sufficiently tight to make that mark would affect the inflammation of the brain in any way.</p>

It was in considerable danger for two or three days, and after that it rallied occasionally but it never fully recovered, and the bruise on the scalp remained, and after death I found it affecting the soft tissues down to the brain—that was on 13th Jaunary, and it lived till 18th March—it was about nine months old when it was taken to the workhouse; it then appeared to me to be a fine and a strong child—the injuries on the head extended down to. the skull, and the inflammation met it—I am not able to say what might not have been coming on before the bruise, or whether inflammation was actually present before—the softening had been coming</p>

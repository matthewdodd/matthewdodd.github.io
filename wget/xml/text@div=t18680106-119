                  </hi>. I have kept a beer-house at 10, Bull Inn Court, Strand, going on for four months—I was a builder before that, and the latter part of the time on my own account—I have known the prisoner about twelve months—when I first knew him he was a builder, building some houses at Hackham—he was not in my employment—I had met him two or three times, not more—on 18th December I met him in Commercial Road, Whitechapel—I had not seen him for three months; he said, "Halloo! ain't that Reed?"—I said, "Yes"—he asked me how I was getting on, and said, "I have twopence in my pocket, we will go and have a pint of beer"—he paid for it, and I paid for the next one—he called me on one side, and showed me a shilling which he said was counterfeit, and that he had taken it; he asked me to pass it, I said no; he told me to put it in my pocket, and that he had something more to tell me—I paid for another pint of beer, and put the shilling in my waistcoat pocket—I had no other coin then—he then gave me a counterfeit half-crown, saying, "Here is half a crown, I can supply you with lots of them," and after that a packet containing shillings, saying that he could get me a thousand pounds for as many shillings, and a thousand shillings for as many pence, and that he knew people who had done it for years and got a good deal of money at it, and that I might make from 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week by being careful, but he likewise warned me that I might be found out the first time I tried it, or I might have gone on for years; that if I went in to pass any, and it was all right, I was to walk out with my hands behind me, and if it was wrong I was to take my hat off and scratch my head—I did not open the packet of shillings—I put it in my pocket—we left the Nag's Head, and went towards the City—going by a baker's shop, there was a little girl serving behind the counter, and he said, "I think one will go here;" he produced another half-crown, and told me to walk three or four doors off while he went in—he went in and an oldish man came in, the prisoner then picked up his half-crown, and came to me, and said, "Will you go in as my boy?"—I said, "No"—he still kept the half-crown, and we went on to the White Bear, and had two or three drops of ale there—I left him there and went home—I spoke to my brother-in-law next day, and in consequence of what he said I found out Mr. Brannan's address, and gave him the packet—the prisoner called at my place on Friday, the 20th, and told me he could get me some coin—he wanted some</p>

               <p>money—I gave him a shilling, and we went to the Three Tuns, Aldgate, and had some drink, but he could not get any coins—I left him and went home, he making an appointment to meet me next morning—I saw Mr. Brannan next morning, and he gave me some directions—the prisoner met me at my own house, that was Saturday, the 21st, he merely called and had a glass of ale and left, and on the Monday or Tuesday he called again—we went out together, and he wanted 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to buy the coin—I said I would not give him 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we went down to Old Nichol Street, Spitalfields—he told me to go into a public-house and wait there till he came back—I went in, but came out immediately, and saw him go into a house in the same street—he handed me back the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said, "There is one delivery at a quarter-past four, and another at half-past eight," and he could have them then—we then went home—I saw him the same evening at about 6.30—he wanted 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I did not give him any money—I had a parcel to take to a relation, and we went to Man<lb></lb>chester Square—we went to a public-house, and he produced a pocket-book with a cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and an insurance paper for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he wanted me to take them and leave them with my relation as security for 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I refused, and he said that be would sooner do it with a relative, because it would be safe, as he would not prosecute if the cheque was not met—he said that if I could get the money we would go down and get the coin, and by both working make 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., so as to be able to pay the money back by Thursday morning—I declined, left him, and went home—he called on me on the Friday, and I made an appointment to meet him on Saturday, the 28th—I saw Mr. Brannan again, and got further direc<lb></lb>tions from him, and on Saturday, as I left the White Bear public-house, the prisoner tapped me on the shoulder; we went to the European and had a pint of porter—he produced a half-crown, and asked me to pass it—I said, "It is not good enough here"—we came out and went towards the West End—we met Inspector Brannan in the Strand—I touched him on the shoulder, and walked on—I afterwards passed Sergeant Ackrill, and gave him notice of it—I walked on, and they stopped between the prisoner and me and took him in custody.</p>

               <p>him again next day, and gave him directions, and on the next day, the 21st, he made a communication to me—I then saw him frequently, and was a couple of days waiting about in the neighbourhood—on Saturday, the 28th, I was waiting in the street with Ackrill, and saw the prisoner at a little before five opposite Somerset House—Reed pointed to him—I called Ackrill, and we took him in custody—I saw Ackrill take from his right coat pocket this bad half-crown (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I followed Reed to his home, and took the prisoner there with me—I told the prisoner my name, and that I had received instructions to look after him as a dealer in counterfeit coin, and that he would be charged with the possession of that half-crown, and five shillings—he made no reply, but he said to Ackrill, "I am sorry for this, I did not think that Reed would <hi rend="italic">round</hi> on me like this"—if those were not the words, they are the substance.</p>

I never told him to circulate them, and never circulated one myself. The seventh remained in my coat pocket till I was taken.</p>

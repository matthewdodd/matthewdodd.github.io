                  </hi>. I am living now at Liverpool—I was, on the 24th April, staying at 59, Victoria-terrace, Union-road, Southwalk—on that day I met a woman in Newington-causeway, and went with her to 17, Revel's-row, but she did not stop—I saw prisoners there with a third wonsan, who got away—they asked me what I would give them to drink, and I gave them a shilling twice to get rum, of which I drank about a quarter of a glass—when I had been there about three-quarters of an hour, the one that got away forced me on to a bed and put her hand to my face; one was on one aide and one on another, and Mason held my feet—I was completely senseless, though I could see everything they were doing—I am quite confident the two prisoners were in the room—there was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and about 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver in my pockets—Frost took the money out of my right side pocket—they knew the money I had with me—the party I went with told ma to take care what money I had got, and I counted the whole of my money which they saw—previously to forcing me on the bed, they used a white handkerchief to me that had chloroform, of which I know the smell quite well—I was paralysed—I remained helpless after that—it was between 5 and 6 before I came to myself—I went to the police-station at half-past 6.</p>

               <p>sort handed to me, but it was not my conditions at all—I saw that paper, but I did not accept of it—I did not show it to Hussey, the pot man—I have been offered money, but I would not take it, on certain conditions—I do not think it was likely I should say, I would go right away if I got a certain sum of money; I was bound in 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to appear—I never made that offer in the presence of' Hussey—I know a woman who goes by the name of Mrs. White—I did not say to her, I would accept 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to forego this prosecution—I had been to the house in question before—I went there between 3 and 4—I gave Frost 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get drink twice, giving her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on each occasion—no one else went for drink—there were three women in my com<lb></lb>pany when the robbery occurred—there was one before, but she did not stop long, only about five minutes—I did not remain with her half an hour; she did not give me her company—she merely came to the door, and went inside, and spoke to me, and went away—I found the prisoners there when I went, and another woman came about ten minutes after I arrived there—she did not come at my request—she remained about a quarter of an hour—I bad seen her face before, bat do not know her name; she was the one who contrived with the two prisoners to rob me—it was nearly six when I left—I had not been into any public-house before I went—I had taken a glass of half-and-half for dinner at my sister's—I had nothing in addition—it is some years ago since I acquired my experience of chloroform; I have smelt it—I have never inhaled it; nor undergone any operation which rendered it necessary—I knew Dr. McCree some years ago, and have taken out a bottle, and smelt It—I should think the day in question was the second time I have been in this house since I have been in this country—I went out to Asia Minor in October, 1860—I saw five persons during the time I was in this house.</p>

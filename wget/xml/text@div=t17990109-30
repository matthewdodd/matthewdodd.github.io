             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am an officer of Excise, in Cornwall.</p>
               <p>Q.On the 12th of April, were you on duty at Broad Oak Down? - A. I was; between three and four in the morning, in company with Hicks, another Excise officer, we saw five men driving four horses loaded with ankers; the prisoners at the bar are three of them; the other two were Richard and William Petherick; I knew Heals before very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you to be an Excise officer? - A. I think he did, he had seen me before.</p>
               <p>Q.How did they carry these ankers? - A.Slung with ropes, some holding seven gallons, some seven and a half, and some four and a half; some of them marked with B, some with G; having a suspicion that it was smuggled spirits, we demanded to examine the goods, and Heals, particulary, struck my horse three different times, and struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the horse keep his legs? - A. NO, my horse sell.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of an instrument was it that he struck you with? - A. A large pole, three yards in length; after I had received these blows, I was obliged to retreat as well as I could, the other four men were driving the horses off, and heals went after them.</p>
               <p>Q.How long after this was it before you met with Mr. Couthe? - A. About a quarter of an hour, and we agreed then to follow them, and examine the goods by force; we came up with them about a mile from the place where I first saw them; when we came up again, they took out their sticks again, each of them had nearly the same sort of weapons, and drove the horses up into an angle.</p>
               <p>Q. What weapons had you? - A. I had a stick about the size of the one I have in my hand; Hicks had a stick also, and Coutne had a hanger.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first demanded an examination,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090034"></xptr>when Couthe was with you, was that hanger drawn? - A. It was not; they beat us in a very cruel manner; I lost my senses in a very short time, and I lost a great deal of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you knocked down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any fire-arms about you? - A. I had pistol, but what became of it I cannot tell; I recovered my seses some time after, and they took me to a public-house, where I got medical affistance; I was confined about six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the common sort of ankers, and slung in the usual way that smugglers carry them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that it was brandy and gin? - A. I have not; Heals said, he would give up a part of the goods, if we would let him have the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. The word goods is a technical word? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell them you were Excise officers? - A. Yes, we did; I told them the consequence of their conduct, and Heals said, he could not be worse off than he was, conceiving himself in poverty, I should suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you doubt in your mind of their being the persons? - A.None.</p>
               <p>Q. The two Pethericks have not been taken? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This transaction happened as long ago as April last? - A. Yes, about eight months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Before any thing commenced, you told them you were Excise officers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your habit - do you tell smugglers that you are Excise officers? - A. We do, if they do not know us.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity of seizing the goods? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore all you know about their being exciseable commodities, is from the appearance of the ankers? - A. Yes. Q. Do you mean to swear that B and G necessarily denominates that it must be brandy and gin? - A.They were the usual sort of ankers.</p>
               <p>Q.But of course ankers of that description and size would contain oil or any thing else? - A. if it was oil, they would have looked greasy.</p>
               <p>Q.If they had water in them, that would not be greasy, and the only opportunity you had was seeing a B and a G marked upon them? - A. Yes, in the usual way.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know Chapman and Avery before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.When you came up the second time, Heals did not them strike you? - A.Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kanapp. Q. These persons were taken up before a Magistrate in Cornwall? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They entered into recognizances to appear? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. And here they came to surrender themselves up for trial? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Heals was not taken up till about three weeks or a month ago? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of that? - A.We understood he was gone away.</p>
               <p>Q.But you did not take the trouble to enquire? - A. No.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - Examined by mr. Knowlys. I am an Excise officer; I was with Morris on Broad Oak Down; we saw five horses loaded with casks, such as are used to contain smuggled spirits.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you benn an officer? - A. Nine or ten years; they had such marks upon them as all smuggling casks used to have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the persons who were with these horses? - A. Yes, Heals, Chapman, Avery, and two other of the, names of Pethrick; the prisoners are three of them; I have known Heals a great many years, and I have known Avery and Chapman before, for they have beat me off before when I have been wanting to examine their goods; Morris and I went up to them, and endeavoured to seize the goods; upon coming up to them, they turned their horses up to the side of a-hedge, and told Morris we had better be contented to take a small part of the goods; Mr. Morris said, he would insist upon examining the goods; and as Mr. Morris was attempting to examine the goods, to take out some of the liquor, Heals made a blow at his mare, he knocked her back to the ground, and made her nose bleed very violently.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of weapons had they with them? - A.Heals had a large pole, better than two yards long, the other had all long sticks and whips; he knocked the mare to the ground, and struck Morris on the arm; Morris then told Heals he had done a bad job, and he would take the law of him; Heals said, if he sent him to h-ll he did not care, he could not be much worse, for he could not afford to lose it; then Morris and I gave up the contest, and gave it up for lost; when we had got a little further, we met a young man, we call a pupil, an expectant, of the name of of Robert Couthe, and we agreed to go after them again; in about half an hour we came up to them, I did not get up so early by two minutes, I believe, as the first got up; Heals was beating Morris: I got off my horse, and began upon Heals, and struck at him: upon that two others sell upon me, and struck me such a blow as brought me to the ground, and struck the stick out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what they did to Morris? - A. No; while I was knocked down, Morris received<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090035"></xptr>or blows that laid him to the ground; I did not see the blows given him that brought him to the ground; I had seen him not a minute before fighting with them, I saw him lie bleeding upon the ground; Heals then looked at Mr. Morris upon the ground, and said, I am ruined, I will give up the goods if the rest will; Morris had a pistol which stuck partly out of his pocket; they said one to another, take away his pistol, and one of the Pethericks then took it from him; they then gave an huzza, and began to drive off their horses; then this Petherick that had the pistol went to urge the horses on, and Couthe took out a pistol, and they presented the pistols one to the other as they passed, but what pasled between them I cannot say, I found Morris bleeding upon the ground, not being able to stand, or speak a word of sense; I then bound up his wounds with handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were his wounds chiesly? - A. All over his head; I then, with the assistance of Couthe, got him to a neighbouring house, and got him to bed; then I took Mr. Morris's mare to Leskard, to get a surgeon and a chaise, and the next morning we took Mr. Morris to Leskard in a chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem to be sensible while he was removing to Leskard the next morning? - A. He was insensible all the night, and we could get very few words sensible out of him till after we got to Leskard.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you apprehensive of his dying? - A. Yes, I had no idea he could live.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What arms had you? - A. A stick.</p>
               <p>Q. What had Morris? - A. A pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a pistol the first time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What had Couthe? - A. A pistol and a cutlass.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if they could see the pistol in his pocket? - A. I cannot say, I did not see till after the bustle was over.</p>
               <p>Q. Chapman and Avery had nothing but sticks, which were not like the stick that Heals had? - A. They all had large sticks.</p>
               <p>Q. But not so large as that Heals had? - A. It was not likely they should.</p>
               <p>Q. The pistol in Morris's pocket they saw? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. When you came up the second time, you attacked Heals? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he attacked you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And not till after you had attacked him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was Heals active in attacking the officers before you meddled with him? - A. He was fighting with them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You know Heals lives at Stratton? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from Port Pennant? - A.About forty miles.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.How far is Broad Oak from where he lives? - A. It is a cross country, I cannot exactly inform you; it is about thirty-six miles.</p>
               <p>ROBERT COUTHE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I met with Hickes and Morris, I told them the five men had passed me, and we went up; I went first to a gate at the head of the horses, to come at the goods, and they struck at me before I spoke to them, with a long pole, it was Heals that struck me, and several of them made blows at me, the three prisoners were three of them; I could not get at them with the hanger I had, and Heals said, he would be d-d if he would not kill me; then young Petherick said, kill him, kill him; then Heals made a blow at me with a stick again; I defended the blow with my arms, and knocked him down the blow with a hanger, and then he said he would yield, he would give up his goods if I would not strike him while he was down; then young Petherick engaged me; Heals got up again, and caught me by the collar; now, says he, d-n you, I will do for you now I have got you; I I wrestled with him and got him down in the ditch, and then he said he would yield again, and, while I was down with Heals, young Petherick struck me several times upon the head; I got up, and as he was coming to me again, I made at him, and cut his arm, and then he said he would give up; then I went to look for Morris, and I saw Avery and Chapman fighting Mr. Morris upon the ground with their long poles, with both their hands; young Petherick was upon him at the same time; I thought he was dead, I did not think any other; I then made a blow at Avery with a hanger, I believe he has got the mark in his head now; then four of them sell upon me; young Petherick was searching Morris's pocket, he took the pistol out of his pocket, presented it at Morris's head, and then afterwards seeing I was engaged with the rest, he came over the bridge, cocked the pistol, and said, as he was coming towards me, I will be d-d if I do not blow your brains out; I then took a pistol out of my pocket, and told him, if he did fire, either I would kill him or he should kill me; after I had said so, he said, if you will let me go over the bridge, I will not fire; I was between him and the other four, I let him pass me over the bridge, I kept my pistol cocked, but he did not fire; I then said to Heals, I thought you said you would give up your liquor; says he, I will give up my liquor if the rest will give up theirs; I did not hear them make any answer to that, and then they whipped off their horses and went away; then I assisted Morris; we were obliged to keep three hands up to his head while the doctor sewed up the wounds in his head.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090036"></xptr>Q. Did you know any of the party before? - A. I knew the three prisoners before; I had seen them a great many times loaded with goods at Port Pennant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the marks upon the ankers? - A. Yes, I understood the marks very well, I have seen thousands of them; there was C P for Christopher Prieux, the Guernsey merchant, and there was a B upon some of the kegs, and G upon some for brandy and gin; and there is another Guernsey merchant of the name of Lukey, he marks with the letter L.(Mr. Knapp addressed the Jury on the behalf of Avery and Chapman, and Mr. Gurney on the part of Heals; as did the Attorney General in reply.)</p>

            . I was minding Mr. Pearson's shop on a Friday - the prisoner came in and asked for Mrs. Pearson; I said she was not at home, but I expected her in every minute- she waited about half an hour; I remember a frock and trousers hanging near the shop door - I had seen them safe about half an before hour she came.</p>
               <p>MARY PEARSON. I am the wife of George Pearson. I left my shop in the care of this witness on a Friday - I left a frock and trousers hanging at the door; I was out about two hours, and on the following morning I missed the frock and trousers.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH CASSERS. I keep a clothes-shop in Kingsland-road. On a Friday in March, the prisoner came to my shop, and brought a frock and trousers - she asked 2s. for them; I gave her 1s. 6d. - I asked if the frock was her own; she said Yes, she had three children, and they wanted bread - I hung them up on the Saturday, and on the Monday the prosecutor claimed them.</p>
               <p>JACOB LEVY. The prisoner offered me, on a Friday in March, a frock and trousers - I refused to buy them; I think it was on the 5th of March.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JACOBS. I am a Police-constable. I went to Cassers' shop, and found the articles there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought them of a person in the street - of a person who was in tears, and said she wanted bread; I did not want them, and sold them again.</p>

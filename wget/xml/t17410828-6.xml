            . I took the Prisoner in the Broadway, Westminster, on the first of August between 3 and 4 in the morning. He had a bag with 8 geese in it, on his shoulders, which he threw down when he saw me. There was another person with him, but he made his escape, and in pursuing him we found a bag of fowls thrown over into a yard, which together with the geese were carried to the Beadle's house, where they were own'd by the Prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Keeling. I saw the geese at the Beadle's house and know them to be mine by a particular mark in the webs of their feet.</p>
               <p>- Bates. Between 3 and 4 in the morning, I saw the last witness lay hold of the Prisoner; and he dropp'd the geese, and said he would swear a robbery against him for taking them from him. They were carried to the Beadle's house, where the Prosecutor own'd them.</p>
               <p>- They were all hot when we took them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going to see for harvest work, and pick'd this bag of geese up; but as to the fowls I know nothing of them. <rs id="t17410828-6-verdict37" type="verdictDescription">

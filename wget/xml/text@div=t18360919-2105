                  </hi>. I am a butcher at Twickenham. About eight o'clock on the 28th of August the prisoner came into my shop to buy a piece of salt beef—I afterwards missed a piece of beef, and sent the officer, who took her, and brought back two pieces of beer, which we both mime—I had not sold her either of them.</p>

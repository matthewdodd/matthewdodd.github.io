On the 25th of April, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw Sullivan by Shadwell church; he kept following me behind and before, and sometimes by my side - I was in liquor, but not very drunk; I could not get from him: he followed me for five hundred yards - I then asked if he would have any thing to drink - we went into a public-house together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Magistrate that you went into a public-house? A. No; I recollected it since, but I hardly know what happened, I was so far gone. We had a glass of liquor, and came out together; I considered then that I had parted with him: I went down <placeName id="t18250519-116-crimeloc695">Limehouse</placeName>

            . I am a costermonger. I was serving a customer in Queen-street, and saw Jerry Sullivan knock this man down - I knew him before by sight. I saw him take Worsdall's watch from his fob and run away; I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190040"></xptr>Jem Grinwell on the other side, watching - he was ten yards off.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you followed him? A. No; I went and told the officer in about an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You had not time to stop him? A. No. I had my oranges to sell, and did not follow.</p>

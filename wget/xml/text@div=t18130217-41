            . I keep a public-house in Belton-street. On the 21st of January last, the prisoner came to my house about a quarter before eleven at night; she had two bundles in her apron, and seemed exhausted. She asked me to let her have a glass of liquor to revive her, for she came all the way from Gravesend, and she had not a farthing of money; she was going to lodge at the next door, and if I would let her have a little liquor she would leave the small bundle with me till morning, to secure me for the money for the liquor. What liquor she had that night came to two shillings and a penny. She left one bundle. She came in the morning, she said she was going to part with the things. The officer came and demanded the bundle. These are the things, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Kingsland-road, St. Leonard, Shoreditch. On Monday evening, the 18th of July, I went to bed about eleven o'clock or half-past, having gone over my premises, and seen the shutters, doors, and all the fastenings correct—about one o'clock in the morning, my bell rang—I looked out of the window, and saw some<lb></lb>body standing in the street, in consequence of whose information I dressed myself, got a lantern and examined a window which is at the extent of my premises in Union-walk, and found the shutters forced open—I do not sleep in that part—my servants do—there is a covered com<lb></lb>munication between my dwelling-house and the warehouse—I have three houses made into warehouses, and they communicate internally—part of the brickwork of the area grating had been disturbed, and the window at the extremity of the house was broken—if they got into the area grating, they could go up some stairs into the room where they forced open the shutters—the shutters had been fastened—I imagine they were opened by the force of the hand, or some small instrument—the win<lb></lb>dow was up, so that a person might get in or out—nothing was missed at that time—I have since missed the leg of a table—two servants sleep in No. 1 warehouse, which communicates with Nos. 2 and 3.</p>

               <p>committed the day before—the Magistrate told him it was necessary for him to be brought up next day, for what reason I do not know—he was brought up next day, and I tendered myself as a witness before the Magistrate—he said there was no occasion for any witnesses to be examined, "save the witnesses for the Jury," they might be of service to him there—Margaret Draper is a young girl the prisoner keeps company with—he came from the play that night—he had told me he was going in the afternoon—I do not know what sort of a night it was—it was not raining—I did not look outside—I do not know whether it was moonlight—I have been charged before a Magistrate with being tipsy, and making a bit of a noise in Brick-lane, Spitalfields, three years ago—I was then in custody and locked up—I was never tried before a Jury, nor ever charged with felony, or tried for anything—I have been living three months in the same house as Delaforce—I do not know the landlord's name—he em<lb></lb>powers a person to gather the rents—I swear I have only been in custody once, that was the occasion in Brick-lane—I recollect that this was on the 18th of July, because I had my wife at home, working at the cotton work, and when she receives work from her master, she always makes it out in a book—I was never a witness before—I do not know what Magistrate I went before—I went to Worship-street—Margaret Draper went with me, and the prisoner's master—we met there—we did not meet to go there—when I got there I found them waiting there—it was four o'clock in the afternoon when I got there—I waited an hour—I had some conversation with the master before I went there—he said his journeyman was in cus<lb></lb>tody, and he was waiting to see if there was any character wanting for him—I did not say I had come to prove he could not be the person—I told Margaret Draper so—we were not before the Magistrate then—we were out in the street—we did not go in to the Magistrate at all that day—the depositions were made out for Newgate the day after he was taken up, and when I went before the Magistrate I was not examined—I told the master on that occasion, that I had come to prove an <hi rend="italic">alibi</hi> for him—I did not tell him that before I went there—he and Margaret Draper did not know of my coming—I did not meet with them till I came to the office—I had not seen either of them from the time Delaforce was taken till I went before the Magistrate—Union-walk, Kingsland-road, is a half or three quarters of a mile from where I live.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Half Nicol-street, Spitalfields. I know Delaforce—I remember going with him to the play on Monday evening, the 18th of July—I was with him from twelve o'clock in the forenoon—we went to the play at six, to the Garrick in Red Lion-street, White<lb></lb>chapel—we remained there till about twenty-five minutes to one, and then came straight home—I parted with him at the corner of Pool's-place, where he lives—I then went straight home—he was in my company all that time—it was one o'clock when I parted with him.</p>

               <p>him good night, just before he got home—he had not knocked at the door—he could not have done so—I cannot say whether Clutterbuck had a candle—it was dark—he was up Pool's-place—I saw him, and he called, "Charles"—that is all—I bid Delaforce good night directly, and parted with him—it was a fine moonlight night—I could not have seen down the court if it had not been moonlight—I first heard of his being in custody on Friday the 5th of August—his mother told me of it—I did not know he was in custody till the Friday after he was taken—I was not before the Magistrate on Thursday or Wednesday, nor at all—I went to Worship-street on the Friday, but did not go in—I went by myself—I saw Clutterbuck there, standing in the street—I got there about twelve, and saw him there between twelve and one—I parted with him about five—I remained there about four hours, and returned home at five—I did not see Clutterbuck before I went to Worship-street—I met him there acci<lb></lb>dentally—he asked me what my name was—I told him—he asked if I knew Charles was in trouble—I said, "Yes, his mother told me"—I have only known Delaforce between two and three months—I have been out with him three or four times—I believe he was keeping my company—I have been about twice to his house, not more—he had on a fustian jacket and hat when we went to the play—I never saw him in t blue peaked cap—he never wore such a thing, to my knowledge—if he had I should have known it, for I used to see him go backwards and forwards to his work, and never saw him in a cap in my life—he is a weaver—there was nobody at Worship-street for him but me, his mother, and Clutter<lb></lb>buck—Mr. Archer is the person he works for—I believe he was there, but I almost forget—he spoke to me—he said nothing to me, nor I to him—there had been no rain on this night, that I know of—there was none as we went to the play, nor as we came home—I was never a witness be<lb></lb>fore.</p>

On the 25th of June last I put into a bag five and twenty pounds; it consisted of eleven guineas, sixteen half guineas, and forty half-crowns; I had it in my pocket; and the man that was to call for it did not: the prisoner was drinking in my house the best part of the day; and what liquor he had I was obliged to give him credit for: I believe the prisoner saw me put the money into the bag; I never had any part of it since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You did not give this to your wife, nor tell her you should put it there? - No: I left it in a drawer that was not locked; the key is lost: I was out about an hour.</p>
               <p>How many people were there gaming, and playing at whirligig, and tossing up for liquor? - There might be three or four tossing up for ale.</p>
               <p>Was not this man drunk? - I do not think he was; he had only five pints of ale, and some he gave to the cobler.</p>
               <p>How many hours might these fellows be drinking and gambling there? - Three or four hours.</p>

               <p>I am wife of the last witness. On the 25th of June, a little after five, my husband went out and left me in the tap-room, with the prisoner and another man that had been drinking; a few minutes after that the prisoner went out; I was then sitting in the tap-room, which commanded both the doors: when the prisoner went out I went to the top of the tap-room, to count the pots; I had not been but a very little while before I heard the bar bell ring very softly; upon which I looked up, and saw the prisoner directly at the bar door, which rung; he was very much confused at the sight of me; he paid me two-pence, for a quartern of anniseed, in halfpence: when I went into the bar I observed the till open: the prisoner watched me amazingly; he stared, and looked confused; that I knew he had been doing something, but I did not know what: the prisoner and the other man went away immediately: this was between five and six in the afternoon.</p>

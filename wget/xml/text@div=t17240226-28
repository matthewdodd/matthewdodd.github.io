Two Evidences depos'd, That they were present at the first Marriage to Hutchinson, and one of them depos'd, That Hutchinson was at her House the last Week; two other Evidences confirm'd the second Marriage. The Prisoner did not deny either, but in Extenuation of the Fact alledg'd, that her Husband Percival Hutchinson was taken from her within two Hours after she was married to him, and they never bedded together, and that Hutchinson had married another Wife, and that Nichols knew that Hutchinson had married her, and went with a Warrant to take him up to prosecute him for it, before he married her himself. The Prosecutor Nichols did not deny it, but acknowledg'd his Folly, and want of Consideration of the Consequences. The Jury <rs id="t17240226-28-verdict141" type="verdictDescription">

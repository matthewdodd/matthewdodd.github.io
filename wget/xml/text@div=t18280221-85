On the 15th of January I was informed that some silver-filings were in a paper, in the corner of his skin, where he worked; I went there and found those filings, but he had drawn away the paper, and was pushing his skin up with his knee, as if to prevent my seeing them; I asked where the filings were; he said it was the first time, and he hoped I would look over it - I cannot swear to particular filings, but I am sure these were not his making, as he works pearl or tortoiseshell with them, and there are no appearances of that among these; besides, here are more filings than he would make in a month - he could earn 5s. a day.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. On the 15th of January I went into the shop, and saw the prisoner with the can in his hand; there were two other men and four lads in the shop - the prisoner was taking it from his skin to where it usually stands; he went to his work, and I went to work next to him; in about three quarters of an hour I heard a rustling of paper in his skin;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210080"></xptr>I looked round, but said nothing; in a few minutes I heard it again - I looked round, and asked him what he had got; he said it was the first time, and told me to say nothing: I told Mr. Taylor there was something wrong - he came and found the filings in his skin; but before he came the prisoner had pulled away the paper, and thrown it away - I did not speak to him when I saw him with the can, as I did not know but he might want it to sweep some filings into it, though that is generally done on Saturday night - these are exactly the same sort of filings as are in the can.</p>

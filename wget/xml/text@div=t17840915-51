But whether she dropped the paper or not you do not know? - I was close by her petticoats, and in the scuffle, I suppose, she must have dropped it: we took her to the watch-house and had her searched, and two other women came rubbing against her, and said, what was the matter? I told them to keep clear of the woman, they would not leave her, so I took all to the watch-house; the watchman searched the prisoner in another room, but I was not there.</p>

               <p>the fact of the prisoner's drawing these various sums is openly and plainly entered, showing that he had that money—a sum of 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing to his late partner, is included in the trade debts—I believe bills were given to purchase the trade and good will, it does not appear in the accounts—good will is entirely a theoretical matter, we never put it in a statement of affairs—I should say the good will had pretty well departed—I think 1,650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is too high an estimate for the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. debts—the prisoner put his accounts into the hands of our firm.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a woollen warehouseman, of 34, Golden Square—I am one of the prisoner's creditors, and was appointed trustee of his bankruptcy on 30th April—I first knew that he was in embarrassed cir<lb></lb>cumstances late in February—a Mr. Price came to see me, and I saw Mr. Herbert, the solicitor—he told me that the prisoner was under certain obligations to his cousin and late partner, and that a bill of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was coming due; that Arnoux was unable to meet the bill, and had been advised to consult him in reference to his affairs; that he (Mr. Herbert) had communicated at once with Messrs. Waddell, the accountants, in order to ascertain the true position of his affairs, and that as soon as the statement of affairs would be ready, he would call a meeting of creditors—at the same time he said that Arnoux had a certain sum of money at the Union Bank, but not sufficient to meet the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—it was suggested that that money should be protected against any claim which might be brought against it by the holder of the bill, and Mr. Herbert agreed with. me that the account should be closed and transferred to the joint names of the two principal creditors, Mr. Bidgood and myself, for the creditors—I believe I first knew that the money had been drawn out of the bank on 28th February, the day after—I did not know at that time that any part of that sum had been retained by the bankrupt—the creditors did not authorise him to retain it—I ascertained what the amount was, by sending privately to the bank on the 28th—I was present at the first meeting of creditors. I think on 7th March—I asked for the defendant's pass-book at that meeting; it was produced by Messrs.

               <p>on 31st October—I did not charge him then with removing furniture—I did not know of it—I heard about the piano, that was the only thing—a fellow-creditor told me about it and complained that Arnoux was surreptitiously removing it—I understood it was removed by daylight—we found so many things against the prisoner that we felt it our duty to have him arrested—we believed the bankrupt had assets in bonds or securities, and finding we could get nothing without force we ordered his arrest, hoping we should get some assistance in the investigation—I applied for an increase of bail on finding a letter after his arrest saying that Guigues and his sister were expecting him in France, and that they had prepared his house and received his furniture—it was then believed that the prisoner intended to decamp—I knew I had sold his furniture, but as the prisoner had assets without my knowledge I though the would have furniture without my knowledge—he was made a bankrupt on his own solicitation—it was very much opposed to our wishes—we would have accepted a reasonable composition provided the bankrupt had given us security—not being able to give that security, the creditors requested that he would make an assignment of his estate for the benefit of his creditors—the prisoner was in an adjoining room, he agreed to make an assignment, and the creditors left in the belief that he would do so—I am trusting to my memory—the nest day the prisoner declared that he preferred bank<lb></lb>ruptcy, and my impression was that after paying 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would be clear—any paper that he signed was in the presence of Mr. Herbert—I never saw him sign any—if he had consulted his creditors we would have arranged to stave off this debt of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and have given him a reason<lb></lb>able time to meet his liabilities, and he would have come round—I com<lb></lb>plained to Mr. Herbert of the prisoner's having withdrawn the balance at the bank, and Mr. Herbert told me that that 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be placed in my name and that of Mr. Bidgood, pending the meeting, which had not then taken place—I heard of the withdrawal from a creditor—most likely I consented to the prisoner keeping some of the money to go on with, because then we thought that the man's embarrassment was only tem<lb></lb>porary, and that when we saw a statement of affairs, we should be able to arrange for his going on, since he had a business which we thought good, and it was reasonable not to object to it at that stage, but he wilfully threw himself into bankruptcy—the arrangement was this: Mr. Herbert promised to protect the estate, and gave us his word that he believed in the statement of the bankrupt, and that he would do nothing to the prejudice of the creditors, and we gave no opposition to his retaining the balance for the payment of the rent and rates and carrying on the business—the withdrawal of the 375<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was on the 27th of February—he consulted his creditors through his solicitor on 23rd February—nothing passed between me and Mr. Herbert to justify the withdrawal—if Mr. Herbert says so he is not accurate—2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing, and 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due, I say is not a fair proportion to be considered solvent on.</p>

I live at 12, Cornelia Street, Bloomsbury—from 14th August to 25th March, 1875, I was clerk to the defendant—I kept his books—he looked at them frequently—he made entries—he took them home on a Sunday—I never saw the banker's pass-book—he was his own cashier—all cash that I received I handed over to him at once. (<hi rend="italic">Cheques put in</hi>.) I have seen Mr. Charles Guigues sometimes—he is the defendant's brother-in-law—I first saw him in October, 1875—I then cashed a cheque for M.

"The brother-in-law was in London, but I cannot say if he was at that interview—he had travelled iron Gap—the prisoner wanted 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the travelling expenses—Mr. Herbert said it was too much for coming from Gap, and the creditors would protect against it, and besides the prisoner had no right to keep a penny, and if he did he should be responsible for it at last—I think Mr. Herbert went away with 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he protested—I saw 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes handed to Mr. Guigues by the prisoner—on the 27th March, 1877, the bankrupt had a piano—on 20th February, 1877, wrote this letter at his request to the carrier of George Yard: "Will you be so</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I am senior physician of the Hospital for Epileptics—I have known the defendant seven or eight years—I have attended him for epilepsy—he was subject to epileptic fits—loss of memory is one of the consequences attending these fits, more or less, according to the badness of the attack—the degree of epilepsy from which he suffered would be a very great impairment of memory; it is what we call specific epilepsy—I know of no case of prolonged epilepsy where memory has been retained in perfection—the fits the defendant suffers from vary in degree, sometimes very slight, sometimes very severe; for the last twelve months very bad—I did not see these that he suffered from here—a severe one is measured by results—if he received a sum of money immediately after one of these fits he would certainly not be able to account for it—if he received it in February I think he ought to be able to account for it in March, if he had been free from fits—the effect of epilepsy would be to make his memory always defective—he is a man of excitable disposition—this is a form of epilepsy brought on by syphilis probably acquired 30 years ago—he has been getting worse from year to year because of his irritability—he has been subjected to a great many annoyances which have militated against his recovery—he is lit to be a good servant, but not by any means fit to be a master, nor has he been for years—I should say, from his state of health, it would be perfectly impossible for him to collect his ideas on any subject for any length of time—it is one of the characteristics that he cannot keep himself together for any length of time—I don't think he has been in a reasonable businesslike state of mind for some time, indeed I think he has hardly been fit to be about for the last six months—he is certainly not capable of taking are of his own affairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He has been to see me once or twice a month, some<lb></lb>times twice a week—I attended his wife once in consultation with Dr. Ayling—I don't know whether he was their regular medical attendant—I think the prisoner might be quite capable of calculating the interest of his property if free from fits for some time.</p>

            . I am servant to Thomas Sowerby, pawnbroker, who lives in Chiswell-street. On the 16th of January, the prisoner, Gale, brought a remnant of cotton to pledge at our shop. Suspecting her, I asked her what she gave for it? she said, 2s. a yard, and that she bought it at Shoreditch. We said we must know more about it-she appeared agitated. The prisoner, Clarke, came in, and looked significantly at her. He said his name was Dee - We determined to detain him on suspicion of being concerned. He ran out, and went up a court which had no thoroughfare - I secured him there. He said the things were his property.</p>

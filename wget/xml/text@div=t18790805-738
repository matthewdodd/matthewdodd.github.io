                  </hi>.

                  </hi>. I am in the service of the London Tramways Com<lb></lb>pany—the prisoner was then horse-keeper—he had 70 horses in his charge—I noticed about the middle of June that their tails were very thin—I had to cut them off to make them look decent—I charged the prisoner with pulling them—he said that he had pulled some of his own—we had some American horses with very long tails, some of them dragged the ground—this hair is similar to theirs; it is pulled hair.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> On 24th June I gave Albert Woodley the privilege of trimming the horses' fetlocks, but not their tails—he is not here; he quitted our service the next week after you were given in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I was horse-keeper in the employ of the London Tramways Company, 52, Greenwich Road—I have left now—the prisoner was a horsekeeper there—I saw him pull the tails of a little chesnut horse</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187908050134"></xptr>
               <p>and a bay horse in May—some of this hair may be from a chesnut herse—on 25th June, seeing him with a parcel of hair tied up in a handkerchief, some of which was sticking out, I said "Well, Jim, you are doing well;" he never spoke, but walked on and left—I made no report, it was not my place—he said that he sold it to the man who buys our dead horses, but he did not say the name—I saw him taking out two parcels on 24th June, but I cannot say what was in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw you do more than was necessary to the horses' tails—I saw you do it with a rake, with four teeth; if you had done it with a comb only I should not have spoken about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. Rakes are not commonly used to horses, I never saw one used for combing the manes, and the Company do not allow them—the rake has four prongs and a handle, the teeth come downwards; it belonged to the prisoner, he was there years before me, and he claimed it as his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner.</hi> I found it on the Company's premises. Re-examined. The foreman had to cut the horses' tails to make them look decent to the public, they were so scandalously pulled—it was not neces<lb></lb>sary to remove the hair to get their tails in order, and if that amount of hair did come away the prisoner had no right to dispose of it; he ought to return it to the office.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). No rakes are kept in the Company's service, but a small quantity comes out with the curry comb—orders are not given to the horse-keepers when they come into the employ that the hair combed out is to be taken into the office—I have been there 12 years, and have taken in 2,000 horses, and never saw one pulled like that—the prisoner has been there 18 months, not as horse-keeper but as feeder.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> It is a horse-keeper's perquisite to have what he combs from the tails and manes; is it likely that I should steal hair and tell Campbell that I was going to sell it to a person who is employed by the Company every day?</p>

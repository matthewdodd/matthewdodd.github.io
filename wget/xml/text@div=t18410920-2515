                  </hi>. I live in the same house as the prosecutor. On the 16th of September, a little before seven o'clock in the evening, I was sitting at the window, and saw the prisoner standing on the opposite side of the way with two other men—when the prosecutor arrived with the lady she knocked at the door, and as they were coming in the prisoner rushed over and hit the prosecutor two blows on the head with a stick—the first blow was very hard—he knocked his hat down—I ran for as<lb></lb>sistance.</p>

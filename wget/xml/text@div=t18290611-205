I was in a street in Lisson-grove, about eleven o'clock; I had left home to take a walk, between nine and ten - I do not know the name of the street; the prisoner Stephens came to me, and asked me to go with her; I had never seen her before - whether she met or overtook me I do not know; she asked me to go for a walk with her - I went; she said she would take me home, and after taking me through several streets, she wanted me to go to a house to dance with her - I told her I would not; she did not point out the house - she persuaded me, saying she would dance, and at last I consented, and went; I do not know where it was - it was a public-house; we went into a room - there was a fiddler there; she told him to strike up - I took a seat, and she danced with several men; there were seven or eight men there, but no woman but her; she danced with several men; I staid there some time, and after dancing she came to me, and asked if I was ready to go - two or three men left the room just before that, and I think the prisoners were two of them, but I had not much noticed the men there - they left two or three minutes before us; we then left - she had hold of my arm; she took me through several streets, and in North-street I asked how much further she was going to take me; she said, "Not far, only just round the corner;" after that we turned the corner, which took us to the end of the building - it was not a street, but open ground; we stood there a minute in the open air - she then made a sort of cough, and I was instantly knocked down by four or five men; some of them came from the end of the building.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she cough designedly? A. It was a sort of cough, and they came up instantly from the side of the building; I did not know where they came from - there was no lamp very near; they knocked me down, and two of them, whom I believe to be the prisoners, held my throat and mouth - they were both doing that; they kept me so a few minutes, and pressed me very hard, which prevented me crying out - one man knelt over me with a large knife; the faces of the two who held me were towards me only part of the time; I could not clearly distinguish their features - I saw their dresses, and believe the two male prisoners to be the two who held my mouth and throat; I did not know any of them before - I believe them to be the two, and I think by their dress they were in the dancing-room; their dress corresponded with the dress of two men in the dancing-room; I speak to them from their face and their dress both - they left the room before I did: while they held me, one man held a long knife over my breast, while the others robbed me - the knife somewhat resembled a carving knife; he held it over my breast, but said nothing; I once got their hands off my mouth, and told them not to hurt me, and I would give them all I had; one of them said, "Stop him, stop him! stifle him!" they took my hat, my pocket handkerchief, and gloves, which were in my pocket, and a sovereign and a half, which were loose in my trousers pocket; I do not know whether they were in the right or left pocket - I had a little silver, but do not know how much, and cannot say whether they took any; they took a metal watch from my waistcoat pocket, three knives, a pair of scissars, a gold watch ring, and a bunch of keys - they were on me a few minutes, when I heard a little noise, a sort of grating noise, like a window opening, and then the prisoners jumped up.</p>
               <p>Q. You have spoken of four or five men? A. Yes; two were rifling my pockets, while two held me, and the other stood over me with a knife; they all jumped up - the one who held the knife stopped longer than the rest, and kicked me on the head very violently, while I was on the ground; I had heard them say nothing but "Stifle him!" the kick made a large cut on the side of my head, it was with his shoe - it bled a great deal, and I believe, if they had not been disturbed. I should have been murdered.</p>
               <p>Q. When these persons came up to you where was the female prisoner? A. With me; she disappeared when they came up - I saw no more of her; I got up and walked round the corner which they turned before, with my head bleeding; when the witness, Mrs. Raim, looked out of a window above, and asked what was the matter; I told her - John Raim opened the door, and told me to wait till he came back; I had not told him which way they had run; I waited on the pavement - he returned in ten or fifteen minutes, and in consequence of what he said I went with him and saw the two male prisoners in custody, and believed them to be the men who had attacked me; I accompanied them to the watch-house, and saw them searched by one of the watchmen; nothing belonging to me was found on them; I have not seen any of my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.What was found on them? A. Two or three knives; I had never seen either of them before - I was much alarmed; I cough myself at times - I do not swear to the men; I do not know what street the dance was in, but the name of the house is the Grand Junction - there were seven or eight men in the room, but no women except Stephens; I do not think there was a dozen men there - certainly not more; I did not dance; I am a single man; I had been with a friend, and was quite sober; I had been to a house with my friends, but do not know what house or the street it was in; my friend's name is Woodhead - it was only one friend; I went into a public-house with him; I do not know the sign or the street; I afterwards went to a private house - I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110091"></xptr>only been nine or ten days in London, and am quite a stranger; I had drank some ale, but am not certain whether I took any spirits, it is so long since - I paid for part, but do not know how much; it was not more than 1s. or 1s. 6d. - that was for drink and biscuits; I might drink some gin, but am not certain; I do not know what street the private house was in - I drank porter and gin there with Woodhead; I believe the person who kept the house was a friend of his; I did not know them; I might be half an hour or three-quarters of an hour in the public-house, and a quarter of an hour in the private house - I cannot say what quantity I drank there; I will swear I did not drink more than three or four galsses, and not a pint of porter; I had been drinking before that at the inn, the Yorkshire Stingo. that is the public-house we were at.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you did not know the name of the house? A. I have found it out since; I was drinking at another house about four or five o'clock - I do not know the name of it; I had been into the City that morning, and cannot say where I dined; I think I did dine on that day, but do not know - I took a glass with Woodhead about four or five o'clock - I cannot say whether it was ale or spirits, or what quantity; I was in no other public-house to my recollection; I do no know what houses I might have been in in the City in the morning; I did not drink where the dance was, nor send for any thing - I swear I was perfectly sober; I never said I was tipsy - there are two or three lamps in sight of the spot, but I took no notice of the distance they were placed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You do not swear to the prisoners? A. To the woman I can - I am quite sure she is the woman; I am not so certain of the men, but believe them to be the men; to the best of my belief they are the men who held me down; I am quite sure I was sober.</p>

            . I live at No. 25, North-street, Lissongrove, and am a bricklayer. On the 6th of May I had been out with my wife, about half-past six o'clock, to her sister's, in High-street; we got back about eleven o'clock- the watchman was calling "Past eleven," as we came down North-street; when we got to the door, and while I unlocked it, I heard a whistle; we both went into the house - my wife opened the window, and looked out; I saw the prosecutor under the window, and a girl with him- there was no lamp very near the window, but it was a very light evening; we both looked out of the window - I am sure the man who I afterwards saw is the one who was with the woman; I heard him say, "Where are you going to take me down this way;" I cannot swear the female prisoner is the woman - they continued there about a minute, and then went to the corner, about two yards further; they did not quite turn the corner - they stopped quite at the corner, and immediately they got to the corner two men came directly under my window; it was the two male prisoners - I cannot say whether they came out of the carcases of the houses; the prosecutor had then got round the corner - I knew it was the prisoners, for they came and looked me full in the face under the window; I had no light in my room, and one of them said to the other,"There are some people at the window;" "Nonsence" said one of them, and both came back, and the one in the light jacket (Crowther) came and looked me full in the face, in the window - my window is between eight and nine feet from the ground; I am certain he is the man - I have seen him about, but did not know his name; Turner was the first one who looked up - I could distinguish his face; it was he who called there was somebody at the window -I am certain they are the two men who passed the window; I have seen Turner about before also - when Crowther looked me full in the face, I pulled the windown down - I pulled the blind on one side, and saw these two run towards the corner immediately, and I immediately saw a girl running from the corner. up North-street away from them; she ran quite away, as far as I could see her, she did not cry out at all - I lost sight of her; just as the prosecutor got to the corner, I heard a sort of cough, and these men immediatly came running under the window - I lifted my window up again, and saw four or five men run away with a hat - I was lifting up the window gradually, and my wife came and pushed it up hastily; it made a noise, which they, I believe, heard, for they came running away instantly; there was either four or five of them - I could distinguish the two men who had looked up at the window among them: they went right straight across the way, but near enough for me to be certain the prisoners were two of them, I have not a doubt about it.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you say that from their dress, or how; you could not see their faces at that time? A. I speak by their dress - Turner had a dark-coloured dress, and Crowther a light one; I immediately ran down stairs, and followed them - the prosecutor came up as I came to the door, with the blood streaming from his head; I told him to stop there till I came back - I followed some little distance behind them to Nightingale-street, and I lost them for some little time; I saw them in that street, and saw them go into a house; I saw two watchmen a little distance off - I went up, and told them what had happened; I could not tell exactly which door they went in at: I walked up and down the street about ten minutes, and saw Turner and Crowther come out - they were the only two that came out; I said,</p>
               <p>"Come, you are just the young men I have been looking for" - they answered, and said,"Looking for we! you can't want neither of we;" they still kept walking backwards further from me - I was standing still; I said, "If you don't came to-night by fair means you shall to-morrow by foul; I know you both well" - the watchman was a little distance from me, and I gave them in charge, and they were apprehended - I left, and told them to bring them up to the prosecutor, at my house, which they did; I found the prosecutor ther; he said they were the two men that tried to strangle him - their shoes were daubed all over with the soft clay they had run across; the streets are not completed, and it had been wet - Turner's knees were all daubed over with the same sort of clay, very wet indeed; it was dirty round the corner, but not so dirty as in the middle of the road - it was very muddy there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prosecutor speak positively to them? A. He said "Those are the two men, I give them in charge;" he said before the Magistrate he positively believed them to be the men; I cannot say whether the dark coat was blue or black; they had hats on - I will not swear that; I never had a prosecution here - I cannot write; I had once a person committed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110092"></xptr>for trial at Clerkenwell - I committed a person named

            , to be tried here, and no bill was found against her; I cannot say why that was.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper (producing one) and tell me whether you do not know why the bill was not found? A. I cannot read; I never saw this paper before to the best of my knowledge, but I cannot tell - at the time the prosecution was going on at Clerkenwell, a young man called me out one night; there were two or three of them - they said, "Will you come and have something to drink;" I said "I have no objection" - he said, "I understand you have taken up an old sweetheart of mine;" I said," I don't know about that - I have taken one up for robbing me of a sovereign and a shilling;" he said, "Well, I should be very sorry you should lose by her; here, I will give you a sovereign, he as favourable as you can" - I said it was not left with me to be favourable - he said, "Well, take the sovereign, you won't lose much by her;" I took 20s. worth of silver - he said, "Just make a cross here, and I can show her when she comes out of prison, that I gave you a sovereign;" they got me to put my mark to it - I went before the Grand Jury, I believe it was the same day, or it was after he gave me the money - I did not agree not to prosecute her in consideration of having the sovereign; there were a great many people in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not two persons sign the paper as witnesses that you should not appear or prosecute - mind, they are here? A. The words were not mentioned - I put my mark without having the paper read. I was on the first floor when I saw the prisoners - the nearest lamp may be twenty or thirty yards off - I do not know the distance - it was a very light night; I told the Magistrate I had seen the prisoners before; what I said was taken down and read over to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long ago is it since the transaction occurred about Smith? A. I should think eighteen months, but am unable to say - she had picked my pocket of a sovereign and a shilling; I went before the Grand Jury and the watchman was examined - I put my mark to a paper, but what it was I do not know: the young man who gave me the 1l. wrote it - I know him when I see him, he is a coachman - I do not know his name; I stated to the Grand Jury just the same about Smith, as I stated to the Magistrate; no paper was produced to them to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>AMELIA RAIM. I remember going home with my husband on the night of the 6th of May; the watchman was going past eleven o'clock: while my husband was opening the door I heard a whistle, and when I got in I lifted up the sash, looked out, and saw a man and woman- I did not know either of them; they were standing underneath the window - a man afterwards came to our house with his head cut - he was the same man as I had seen under the window; I did not see the woman's face, and do not know her; they went round the corner of the unfinished house. and I saw two men come under the window almost instantly - they passed the window, and went towards the corner, where the man and woman had gone- I and my husband were looking out at the window; one of them said there were persons looking out at that window, and he stopped and looked up at a window; the other man said,</p>
               <p>"No, no;" one of them came back quite to the window, looked us in the face, and the other stood two or three steps off - I looked at the one opposite the window in the face for a minute or two; the one in the light jacket(Crowther) is the one who came back close to the window, and looked us in the face - I am positive of him; I had never seen him before to my knowledge - the other is the man who stood two or three paces off the window; I am positive of him; I never saw him before to my knowledge - I have no doubt of them at all: the first lamp, I believe, is about fifty yards off, but I cannot say; it may be more or less.</p>
               <p>Q. How many lamps are there within sight of your house? A. I do not know; I never counted them - I believe they are gas lamps; the window was put down; my husband opened it again a little way, very gently, and in a minute or two I thought I heard a noise, and threw it up violently; I cannot exactly tell what the noise was, but something frightened me - my throwing the window up made a great noise, as it was a very loose sash; it went up freely, and made a great noise against the top - I looked out, and saw some men running along - I believe there were five, but did not count them; two of them I knew to be the two men I had seen under the window; they were not far from me, and as they were running they looked back again, and looked at the window - I saw them sufficient to know they were the same men; I have no doubt of it: I saw the prosecutor almost instantly; he was half bent, and his head streaming with blood - he came from round the corner: my husband went out; I saw the two prisoners again the same night, in custody of the watchman, and instantly recognised them as the two persons I had seen under the window - they are the two men: I was married in January.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you were rather frightened? A. Yes: not so much when I saw them run as when I saw the man bleeding: it is rather a lonely place - my husband had told me he had taken two of the men before I went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you saw the prosecutor till you saw him bleeding? A. It might be five minutes - I cannot exactly say; it appeared so to me waiting: I dare say the men staid a minute under the window - it was all done in a very short time; I told the Magistrate I could recognise them by their faces - I am almost positive I mentioned their faces; they had hats on - I do not believe that either of them had a cap on under the window; they wore hats, to the best of my recollection; I cannot be certain whether one might not have a cap, but the rest of their dress I particularly noticed; I believe they wore hats - I only guess the distance of the lamp.</p>

I was applied to by Raim, and took up the two male prisoners; they said nothing to me - Turner's trousers were both wet and dirty at the knees, as if he had been down in the dirt on his knees; I took them to the watch-house; I did not know either of them before - I had not seen either of them that night.</p>

            . I am a watchman, of Great North-street and Grove-road. On the evening of the 6th of May, a little before eleven o'clock. I was standing at the corner of Great North-street, Marylebone, about ten minutes to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110093"></xptr>eleven o'clock; I observed five men come in a direction from St. John's-wood; I have seen the whole five ofter before - I could tell the names of two of those who are absent, and am certain the prisoners are two of those five -I have frequently seen them passing up and down the grove of a night, but did not know their names; I am certain they are two of the five, for I followed them down North-street to observe what they were about: I know where Raim lived in Great North-street; they were going in a direction towards his house, but they turned off towards Little North-street; the extent of my beat is at the end of Great North-street - I did not follow them further; they were then seventy-two paces from where the robbery was done; I have measured it: though I stated it to the Magistrate to be about one hundred and fifty yards, I measured it, and it is seventy-two paces of my own steps.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you measure the distance of the nearest lamp to Raim's house? A. It is about fifty paces; I call one of my paces a yard - her window is a height that I think a person might be identified from.</p>

            . I am one of the serjeants of Mary-lebone watch. About twenty-five minutes past eleven o'clock, I was coming along Church-street, Lisson-grove, and saw some of the watchmen's lights in an open place; I ran across, and saw the two male prisoners in custody; Davis came up, and said, in their presence, "That is the man who held my mouth;" (pointing to Turner) Turner heard that - they made no reply in my hearing; Davis identified them both - he said he believed them both to be the men who held him down, and held his mouth; and he said if it was so, the knees of their trousers must be dirty- I turned a watchman's lantern towards Turner, and both the knees of his trousers were dirty and wet; I examined Crowther - there were no marks on his knees - I examined their shoes; they were dirty - I took them to the watch-house, and next morning I went to the spot where the robbery was committed, and saw a quantity of blood there, and footmarks, as if a struggle had taken place, and the impressions of shoes - it is a yellow brick clay soil; I went with Webster, the officer, to the watch-house, about half-past five o'clock that morning; Webster took off Turner's shoes, and Crowther pulled his off himself - I tried one pair at the place, and 
               <persName id="t18290611-205-person1558">Webster</persName>
             the other; we compared them with the marks, and they exactly fitted, even the nails, and every thing - I am perfectly certain that those shoes had made the marks on that ground - that is my judgment; there were more marks than had been made by these two pairs of shoes - the tip of the heel of one pair had been worn off; this is it, and there were marks fitting it, and other marks of the very same number of nails in - the tips of both pairs fitted some of the marks.</p>

               <p>Q.Was there any thing out of the common way in the shoe, did you find marks that exactly fitted it? A. I did; here are Crowther's shoes - they were also very plain to be seen; these nails in the too were very plain; I have no doubt these shoes must have been on the feet of the individuals who were on the spot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did they not appear to be the marks of persons who had been struggling about? A. No; there did not appear to have been struggling where the footmarks were - they are ordinary shoes; Davis did not express a doubt about the men in my hearing - he was quite certain of them; he believed them both to be the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say the two men had knelt over him? A. No, not exactly; he said Turner was the man who knelt over him, and he believed the other to be the man who held his mouth - he did not say I should find the knees of both of them dirty, but I examined both; I found no large carving-knife - I found three knives; Davis said some person in a blue coat held a carving-knive over his breast - it had not rained in the night.</p>

            . I belong to the Police-office, of Marylebone. I went with Birnie to the watch-house, and took the shoes off the prisoners - I accompanied him to the spot where the robbery was committed, and compared the shoes with the footmarks very carefully, and am convinced these shoes had been there before; I was perfectly satisfied as to Turner's shoes by the length, the width, and the tip to the heel, and the nails in the heel, all correspond with the marks - we measured them; I have no doubt whatever of Turner's shoes having been there before, also by the colour of the clay on them - I compared Crowther's shoes with some marks, and was not so satisfied in my own mind as to his as Turner's; I apprehended the female prisoner from the description that was given of her, and knowing she was acquainted with Turner - I went down to the New Prison thinking she would be bringing him refreshment; I saw her there, took her, and told her it was on suspicion of having been with

             that night - she denied it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She knew Turner was in prison? A. Yes, because she went there to him - Crowther took off his shoes, picked them up, looked at them, and said, "You cannot match mine," I have not satisfied myself about his.</p>

            . I have known Crowther about seven years, and Turner one - they bore good characters; they came to me when I was at work at Mr. Watkin's brickfield, Portland-town, to ask if I could tell them of a job of work - there is loose clay and earth in that field; they wheeled up some dirt - it was on Wednesday the 6th of May.</p>

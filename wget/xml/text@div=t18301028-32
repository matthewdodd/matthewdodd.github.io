               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to JOHN BLAKESLY. Q. Upon your oath. has it not been brightened up? A. Certainly it has - I do not know who brightened it; it was in the prosecutor's possession above an hour - it was brightened within the hour; it looks better for it - there was a violent altercation between him and the prisoner; the prosecutor asked me to come with him before the Grand Jury, and I said I thought there was enough already.</p>

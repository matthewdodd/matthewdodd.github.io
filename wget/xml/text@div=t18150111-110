               <p>THOMAS SMITH. I am chief mate of the brig Commence; John Mudie is the master; the ship was delivering her cargo at the London Dock. On the 14th of December last, Davis was a seaman delivering the cargo on board: about half past twelve at noon, I was upon deck, I was looking down the hatchway, I saw Davis between the decks<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110059"></xptr>where he chest of opium lay; I went down towards where he was; I saw him stoop of one side; he appeared to be secreting away something, and their I asked him what he was doing there; he told me he was looking for a ball of spun-yarm; he came out with a ball of spun-yarm in his hand, and went upon deck; I immediately went to the same place that he came from, and found a ball of opium; I looked at the case of opium; it appeared to have been fresh broken, about a yard off from the place where Davis stooped down, and there was one ball of opium taking out of that case; he was stooping at that very ball where I found the opium. I compared the ball of opium I found under the sail, to the balls in the chest; that ball appeared to fill up the vacancy in the chest, which I saw had been plundered.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of opium that you found - A. About a pound and a quarter; the ball of opium is not here; I put in the case again.</p>

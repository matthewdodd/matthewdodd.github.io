               <p>Had you left the gown there? - I had not; I left it in the kitchen; I asked her what brought her there? she said she came to see one Mrs. Williams, who had lent her five shillings; I missed the gown which was drying in the kitchen, and found it in the place where she had been.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. Let us understand a little the situation of this kitchen; you found the prisoner in the cellar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is that under the kitchen? - On the one side of the kitchen; as I was going up stairs, I heard a person making a noise below stairs.</p>
               <p>How was the street door situated? - You go down about a dozen steps, and all the way along the passage.</p>
               <p>Is not the street door of your house nearer to the kitchen door, than the way down to the cellar? - No, it is about nine or ten yards length between the street door, to go down to the cellar.</p>
               <p>Have you never said at any other time, and particularly before the magistrate, that the gown at the time it was found, was at the distance of three or four yards from the prisoner? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Recollect? - I did not; I defy the world.</p>

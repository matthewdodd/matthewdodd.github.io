            . I live in Mr. De Grey's house: I was the only person in it during his absence. On the 23d of November I went to bed between 11 end 12 at night; I made all the doors and windows fast over night; the next morning I came down a little before six with a candle (it was then dark;) when I came down I found the area door open and this piece of wood ( producing a piece of wood that had been taken out of the door) lying by the door; there were a great many shavens and two chissels; I went into the pantry and there was a chest broke open, and some chissels; (the chissels produced;) these are the chissels. When I came into Mr. De Grey's room there were two portmanteaus opened, and all Mr. De Grey's clothes taken out; I did not know what was taken away; I went into Mrs. De Grey's room and found her things thrown about; they were in good order the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of portmanteaus were they?</p>
               <p>Smart. One was leather the other cloth?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of any wax candle?</p>
               <p>Smart. There was a bit lest in the two pair of stairs room, and a great deal was dropped on the carpet.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the chissels?</p>

            . I am a constable: about the 15th of January Mr. Caleton came to me and desired me to aid him, to go where he was ordered by the magistrate to go; I took my bludgeon in my bosom, and he desired when he saw the person he wanted I would secure him; we went to the prisoner's house; the prisoner himself opened the door; as soon as he opened the door I seized him by the collar, stopt an empty coach that was going by, and put him directly into the coach, in such a manner that I believe the people in the house had not an opportunity of even suspecting where the master was gone; he was carried before the magistrate; the wife was in custody before. As soon as he was brought there a search warrant was made out, and I, and Mr. Bird the silversmith, and one Jones belonging to the office, went to the house; we found a gold enamelled watch at the tester of the bed; Mr. Bird took it down; I took it in my hand to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find besides the watch?</p>
               <p>Barnet. Some silk stockings; I searched further and found this pistol ( producing it) loaded with a ball, which was drawn in the office; and betweed a trunk and a box these tools (producing a parcel of carpenters tools) and a bunch of matches; there were some old clothes put over the tools that nobody could see them; there were several things I cannot enumerate; I carried<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170013"></xptr> these things to the office, the loaded pistol, the gold instruments, the silk stockings, and his pocket book with 20 pawnbroker's duplicates; there were other things lost; Mr. De Grey desired the prisoner to tell where they were; he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find without any assistance from him?</p>
               <p>Barnet produces a parcel sealed; he opens it. This watch was the first thing we got in the house; it was then opened and Mr. Bird said by the description of it in the advertisement it was the watch that was lost; the silk stockings were found next.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pair?</p>
               <p>Barnet. Four or five I believe: these things Mr. Bird stopt (producing a box of little gold things, the heart, &amp;c.) This watch-case, the buckles and this gold, was found in brown paper at the second search.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he promised he should receive any favour if he made any discovery?</p>
               <p>Barnet. Upon my oath he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the things are there any chisels?</p>
               <p>Barnet. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce them.</p>
               <p>Barnet produces four chisels, a center bit and a saw, the maker's name is erased out, and thirteen other center bits of different sizes. I found in the room three little angurs.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Smart. Did that match with the hole in the door?</p>
               <p>Smart. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of any wax on the chisel?</p>
               <p>Smart. I made a remark on the center bit.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the bolts of the door was that bit taken out?</p>
               <p>Smart. It was the bottom pannel.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they could reach the bolt of the door?</p>
               <p>Smart. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any larger holes made?</p>
               <p>Smart. No, there were no other holes made.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the bolts forced?</p>
               <p>Smart. No; there was one undone, they had fastened the other up again.</p>
               <p>Q. What doors were open?</p>
               <p>Smart. The street door.</p>
               <p>Q. to Barnet. Was the hole big enough for a boy to get in?</p>
               <p>Barnet. Yes; the board is about nine inches across, any man might get in.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any goods you have not spoke to?</p>
               <p>Barnet. There are some things in the office that Mr. De Grey did not swear to, that will I believe be advertised.</p>
               <p>Mrs. De Grey deposed to most of the things that were produced.</p>

            , an ironmonger in the Strand: I sold five chisels to a person about the be gining of November; I cannot swear to the person; three of them were marked; two were not marked.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any body coming to your house with these things?</p>

               <p>Q. Were they both together at the time when the things were produced.</p>
               <p>Calton. They were. He said he bought them of a Jew walking about, but did not know the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Bird there at the time?</p>
               <p>Calton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Bird. You brought these things before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Bird. Yes; the things I have now produced.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say respecting the tools?</p>
               <p>Bird. He said being of an ingenious disposition he used to amuse himself by making tea-chests, and other small things at his leisure hours. He was examined a second time, and then he said he had them of one De Croy, a hair-dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had the tools of De Croy?</p>
               <p>Bird. Yes, and the silk stockings and ruffles; upon which De Croy was apprehended. He had them six weeks before that time; this was the 21st of January; De Croy was brought about four or five days afterwards, and the prisoner was sent for from Newgate; when he came he could make out no charge against De Croy, so he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Gabriel De Chaund's Defence.</p>
               <p>I bought the things. I was not acquainted with the law of this country; I did not know that the things were stolen; I bought them of a man in Soho-square; if I had known they were stole I should not have bought them; what my wife went to sell she was ignorant of; she did not know when I bought them; she was quite innocent of every thing, and she is my wife; what she did was by my order. I lived eight years with Lady Pembroke; I was Butler there; I always bore a good character; nobody could alledge any thing against my character.</p>

            . On the 19th of last month, between the hours of 6 and 7 in the evening, we were washing our engine; a man came and told us, a man had stole a grate from the ruins of the fire at Cornhill. I and

             went after him, and took him on the other side St. Hellen's in Bishopsgate-street; it was the prisoner at the bar: we bid him take it back to the place where he had it, in order to find out the proper owner; he said he was very willing to do that; he threw it down with intention to throw it on my legs, but missed me: he ran away, and I took him again about the Four Swans, or Green Dragon. I brought him to the engine, he was taken before my Lord-Mayor; and the grate was believed to be the property of Mr. Margeram, a tin-man. My Lord-Mayor asked him what he had to say for himself, after he was charged with stealing the grate; he said he had nothing to say.</p>

             confirmed the account that Parker had given.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fountain. I am a constable, in my going backwards and forwards, I saw this, or such a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176512110009"></xptr> grate as this, (produced in court,) lying in Mr. Margeram's ruins; and I missed it the day this was taken away. I think this is the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I worked upon the ruins, I found the stove in the middle of the street, I picked it up, and as I went along, the people followed me. It was at a distance from the ruins. They stopt me, and bid me bring it back to the same place, which I was going to do; and 2 or 3 men came up and told me they would hang me, so I threw it down in order to make my escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Is any body here that saw the prisoner take it from the ruins?</p>
               <p>Parker. The man that informed me of the prisoner having it, went away, and I have not seen him since.</p>

I live at 5, Davis-court, Chequer-alley, Bunhill-row—between 9 and 10 o'clock at night, on 10th December, I was coming out of a house with a strange man, and the prisoner saw me—he did not approve of it, and he came up to me, and struck me on the forehead—I don't know what with—it was a violent blow, and I fell down—I then got up, and was trying to get into the house again, away from the prisoner, and he stabbed me twice in the back—the first blow, on the forehead, rendered me insen<lb></lb>sible—I afterwards found I had two stabs on the back—he had a knife in his hand, because I saw it afterwards—when I recovered I found myself at my aunt's—I was afterwards taken to Old-street station-house, and from there to the doctor's—I could not move my arm for nearly a week. The prisoner was very drunk at the time.</p>

I live with Mr. Griffiths in Golden-lane—on 10th De<lb></lb>cember, between 9 and 10 in the evening, I was at Mrs. Lloyd's house, where Susan Francis was—she was going out of the house with a man—I was in the passage, and as she went out, she was knocked down by the prisoner—after she was down, he struck her several times, and she fainted—the prisoner had nothing in his hand when he first hit her, but afterwards he had a knife—I cannot tell which hand it was in—he struck her on the forehead with it, and as she ran in the passage, she was stabbed in the back twice—the pri<lb></lb>soner dropped the knife at the bottom of the stairs, and I picked it up—he then went out into the road, and some men quarrelled with him, and he went away—he afterwards came back again to the corner of the street and was given into custody—Susan Francis bled very much; more from the shoulder—I took her to her aunt's, and she was afterwards taken to the doctor's—the prisoner was very much intoxicated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of the G Division of police—I saw the prosecutrix—my assistant dressed her wounds on the night of 10th—I examined her the next day; she had a punctured wound on the right side of the forehead, and a wound on the back of the neck, and another wound over the left blade-bone, which was an inch and a half deep—they were all punctured wounds, from which I had no doubt she must have lost a great deal of blood—the wound on the forehead was somewhat dangerous, inasmuch as I think the bone was penetrated by the instrument which had caused the wound—she was under my care for ten or twelve days, and she went on well after that—the wound Jon the forehead was the only one that would endanger life, and that could only have been dangerous if erysipelas had set in—it would have been dangerous if it had been a little deeper.</p>

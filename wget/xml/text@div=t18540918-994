On Saturday evening, 19th Aug., I saw King and Hudson on Ludgate-hill—I followed them to Bride-court; Pike there joined them, and they all three went together to Fleet-street—they conversed together a few minutes, and I observed their hands move—it appeared as if Pike passed something to the other two—they separated; and King went into Mr. M'Donnell's, a confectioner's shop, No. 117, Fleet-street, and Hudson went into Mr. Brandt's cigar shop—I watched King; he had either a bottle of ginger beer or soda water—he put down a half crown, and Mrs. M'Donnell gave him change—Mrs. M'Donnell bit the half crown—I went in and spoke to her, and she put it on a shelf by itself—I went after the prisoners, and saw them all three together on Ludgate-hill; they each lit a cigar—I followed them to Cheapside; they there separated again, and King went into a confectioner's shop, No. 51; he purchased either a cake or a bun, and put down a shilling—he left, and I spoke to the person who had served him—King went on, and joined the other two pri<lb></lb>soners in the Poultry—they went from there to Gracechurch street, and separated again—King went into Mr. Laurie's ginger beer shop; he had a</p>

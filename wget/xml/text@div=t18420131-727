                  </hi>. I am a harness-maker, and live in Castle-street, Long<lb></lb>acre. On Thursday night, the 13th of January, between eight and nine o'clock, I was in Great Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields, and saw the prisoners there in company with another young lad—I saw Harris follow two gentlemen and feel one of their pockets—they followed them a little further, and picked his pocket of a white silk handkerchief—Newman was about two feet behind him at that time—I had seen them follow two or three people before that, and they all three joined company after following people—Harris was walking across the road directly he got the handker<lb></lb>chief, and put it in his breast, or somewhere about him—I ran up to him before he got across—he <hi rend="italic">dodged</hi> me about, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the handkerchief up—I took it up, and he got off—I delivered the handkerchief to the gen<lb></lb>tleman who had lost it—I saw the same three again in company afterwards, and followed them till I came to a policeman—I told him that one had picked a gentleman's pocket—he told me to run and lay hold of him di<lb></lb>rectly—I ran—he ran away a great distance—at last I caught Harris.</p>

PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever taken any men before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not for picking pockets—I took hold of a boy for steal<lb></lb>ing soap seven or eight years ago—I caught him in the street and took him into the shop—he was sent to prison by the Magistrate at Queen-square—I have never been here before—I worked at No. 86, Long Acre, at the time this robbery was committed—I left there through being obliged to come here—I could not do my work—my master told the policeman he should discharge me—he did not like my losing my time—be told me I did not do a job quick enough for him, and said, "If you don't mind, you shall go about your business"—I do not know the gentleman that lost his handkerchief—I never saw him before, to my recollection—I had a white apron on, the same as Newman—I took the handkerchief up—I had the property on me—I thought perhaps the people, seeing me following close behind them, might think I was one—to make sure of it, I gave the handkerchief to the gentleman, he attempted to run after them—I said, it was no use to run, they were a long distance—I had a man taken in Hol<lb></lb>born once, but he did not appear here—he was only at the station—the policeman afterwards told me he got some imprisonment—he did not say how much—I have not been concerned in any other case—the gentleman was not aware of the robbery—I had to run to catch him up—I did not call "Stop thief" at the time—it did not come to my recollection—there was a great number of people—this happened between eight and nine o'clock—I saw them again within an hour—Harris is the same person—I saw his face—he was <hi rend="italic">dodging</hi> me about in the road when he had the hand<lb></lb>kerchief in his possession—the street was well lighted with gas—it was right opposite the Wesleyan Methodist chapel—I gave no alarm—I went up to the gentleman, touched him on his shoulder, and said, "You have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184201310115"></xptr>
               <p>lost something"—he felt, and said, "My handkerchief"—I said, "Is this it?"—he said, "Yes"—I did not ask his name—I had not the recollection.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 65.) On the 13th of January, about twenty minutes to nine o'clock, I was in Earl-street, Seven-dials—Samp<lb></lb>son came up to me, and pointed out the prisoner Harris, and said he had picked a gentleman's pocket—I said, "You had better go and lay hold of him, I shall not be able to catch him"—as soon as he started from me he ran away, and Newman and Newman's little brother, who he takes out with him—Sampson ran after them, and took Harris—he said he had done nothing—I searched him at the station, and found a white handkerchief on him with the name of "Lydia" on it.</p>

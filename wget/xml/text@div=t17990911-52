             sworn. - I am fellow-servant with the last witness, at Mr. Seton's, in Parliament-street; I never saw the prisoner before that day; I am certain he is the man. On Monday, the 22d of July last past, about a quarter after nine, I am certain within two minutes, I had been out; on coming to the area, I met a very decent country young man coming up the area steps from my mistress' house; he had a large check bundle under his arm; he came up to the area gate; he had closed it; I pushed the area gate to open it, and he pulled it towards him; it was a sort of bundle that had been very familiar to me, as it always hung up in the pantry that I used, over my box; he asked me if he should shut the area door; I told him, if he pleased; he had pulled the nail out of the wall, and I saw the aprons coming out; I went down the area steps immediately into the kitchen; I had seen it not ten minutes before; I called out to the last witness up stairs, and ran out immediately; I was in the house four or five minutes, I think not more than four; I came out, and ran towards the Horse-guards; I saw nobody; I returned through King-street, and up Little Charles-street into Parliament-street again; I looked up Bridge-street, but saw nobody there; I went on to Palace-yard, and there I saw a man in a grey coat, with just such a bundle; I then gave chace, and overtook him in Parliament-place, by the gate where his Majesty goes in at, which is no thoroughfare; it goes to the water, and then there is nothing but a railing; I stopped him before he got half way down the passage; he said, are these your's, young man? I said, I dare say I could find somebody to own them, and he seemed to be in great agitation, and took him into custody; he had the bundle in his arm at the time I overtook him; they brought him home into the kitchen, at Mrs. Seton's; she opened them before him, and counted them on the dresser; I then sent for a constable, and took him before a Magistrate; I have had them ever since. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, that the man you overtook, was the man you saw coming up the area steps? - A. I cannot say that it was the same person; he was in a different dress, and I certainly cannot say he was the same. (The property was deposed to by the prosecutrix).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was hired by a man to carry them.</p>

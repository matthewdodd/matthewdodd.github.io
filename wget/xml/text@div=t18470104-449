I went on share and left the pri<lb></lb>soners on board, and no one else—I was away about ten minutes, and when I came back I saw the prisoner running away from the ship with a bundle under his arm—I went after him, but could not catch him, —when I got on board the ship I missed the bundle—it was my property—I missed a jacket, a waistcoat, two pairs of trowsers, two shirts, an accordion, two razors, and two half-crown—they had been in the cabin—I never saw the prisoners again till seventeen days afterwards, when I caught him in Blackwall—I am quite sure he is the same man—he had been working on board—this pair if braces is mine—they were on the trowsers which were in the bundle—this shirt is one of mine, which I lost at that time—when I saw the prisoner in Blackwall he ran away, a friend of mine caught him, and gave him into custody.</p>

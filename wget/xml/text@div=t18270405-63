            . I am a lamp-lighter. I know the prisoners Williams and Featherstone - I first knew them about three months ago; I knew Williams by the name of Dick - I became acquainted with him at the George and Ball public-house, Westminster; Dick introduced Featherstone to me there. I had known Dick seven or eight days before that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he introduce you to Featherstone for? - A. I was in the habit of going to the George and Ball; Dick asked me if I would buy a set of carpenter's tools - Featherstone was not present - I said No, they did not suit me - he said, would I buy any thing that did suit me; I said I was out of work, and if I could earn 1s. I would; he did not know where I lived - I told him I occasionally came to my sister's, who lived in Church-lane, Strand, and I could be found there - her name is Lilley - her husband lives with her; I do not lodge there, but go backwards and forwards; Ursula Willis also lives there. When I called there once my sister delivered a message to me, and in consequence of that message I went to the George and Ball, Westminster - it was on a Friday morning, between ten and eleven o'clock - I found Featherstone standing at the door of the George and Ball - he asked if my name was Tom; I said "Yes, and where is Dick?" - Featherstone said inside; I said I had come in consequence of a message from my sister - I went in, and found Dick sitting on a bench in a little box on the right-hand side of the tap-room; I and Featherstone joined him: we all three sat in the box together, and had half-a-pint of gin and a pot of beer - we had it inside the house; I paid for it- while we were there Dick asked me if I would buy any brass - he did not say what quantity, or where it came from - I said I would try to sell it for him as well as I could; after drinking our beer I went away, and went to my sister's. The prisoner Isaacs came into my sister's shop, to buy a herring - I said to him, "Do you keep an old iron-shop?" he said Yes - I said, "Are you in the habit of buying brass, and how much will you give me a pound for it?" he said he would give 5d. if it was good, but if there was bell-metal mixed with it he could not give so much; this conversation was in the presence of my brother, sister, and mother; after he said he would give 5d. I looked at him; he said, "You need not be afraid, for if it was Jesus Christ I would by it, for it would go where hundreds have gone before" - he had not seen it then.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to draw from him that answer? A. I asked him the price, and was looking at him rather dubiously - he said, "Is it here?" I said No - "Well," said he, "when can I see it?" I said I would have it brought there. Six o'clock that evening was fixed upon for his seeing it, at that place. After this I went back to the George and Ball, and found a horse and cart standing exactly opposite the door of the house, on the other side of the street, where there is some palings; I found Dick, and Featherstone there; I said to them, "It is all right bring your horse and cart, and the brass to the Strand - they knew where I meant, as they had been there in the morning (but I had not seen them there myself;) Dick said, "We will be there" - I said, "Go on first, and I will follow;" I went the back way, round Scotland-yard and Northumberland-street, and came up with them and the cart at the corner of Church-lane - the cart arrived first; both the prisoners were there with it; nothing had been taken out of the cart. I told them to wait there till I went and asked my sister's leave for them to put two sacks in the cellar - I went, and my sister gave me leave; I went back, and told them to bring the sacks into the place - they contained brass - they each brought one sack; they were put into the cellar - I went forward with a light while they put them there. When I got down stairs they asked 2l. 10s. for it - I agreed at last to give them 1l. 15s. and 1s. I had spent - they were to be paid the same day. I told them to go on, and I would follow them - after they were gone I borrowed two sovereigns of Mrs. Lilley, my sister. I then went back to the George and Ball, and gave the money to Dick; I gave him both the sovereigns - Featherstone was present in the room; Dick gave me 5s. change - he gave Featherstone a sovereign of it, and Featherstone gave him some change - I do not know how much; I left them there, and went back to my sister's - it was then between two and three o'clock - Isaacs came at six o'clock; I went down stairs, and showed him the brass - he looked at it carefully, took a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050034"></xptr>piece out of the bag, like a coronet, and said, "This came from a church" - I said they told me it came from the country; I said I did not think it was all right; Isaacs said, "Never mind about its being all right - if it were Jesus Christ I would buy it," and, laying hold of the cellar door, he said, "If this was gold I would buy it;" he said, "You have no occasion to be afraid, I will take every thing upon myself;" he agreed to give me 5d. per lb. for it. I said, "Shall it be taken away to-night?" he said, "No, because it is dangerous" - because there were people going along the Strand, and he might be stopped, but it should be fetched the next morning, Saturday, at ten o'clock - he promised to come between ten and eleven- he came about that time - I met him there; I borrowed a basket of my brother, to carry the brass in it to Isaacs' place; I took one bag in the basket, to take it to Isaacs' - I went with him; it was carried to No. 22, Houghton-street; I helped him carry it - he led me there; we went backwards and forwards for it twice. Before I moved it he asked how much I thought there was - I said I did not know; he said I might depend upon him about the weight - he gave me 10s. after I delivered it - he said, that in the course of an hour and a half or two hours, he would come back and pay the rest; my brother-in-law and sister were there when the brass was moved; Isaacs came again in the afternoon, and said, "How much do you think the weight is?" I said, "About 130 lbs. I suppose;" he said, "Why it is 128lbs., but as there is iron and other things we will take off the 8lbs., and make it 120 lbs.;" I agreed, and he gave me two sovereigns that afternoon; my sister reckoned it up by a ready-reckoner which she had; she said it came to more - he said he should give no more. I received in all 2l. 10s.; he went away, after giving me the money. I saw a woman named Jane at the George and Ball - she served liquor there sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Tuesday following did you hear some people in Church-lane talking about old Isaacs and the church? A. Yes - that frightened me, and I went to Dick's lodgings at Westminster, near the George and Ball, and told him what I had heard - he said, "I hope you will not take any notice - you know I have got a family, but I don't mind myself - I hope you will be as a man, and not say any thing about it?" I said I would not. I stopped at his lodgings seven or eight days - I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Dick's wife come backwards and forwards? - A. I cannot say that she was his wife; Jane came there once or twice, and my own wife came there sometimes. - When I left Dick's lodgings I went to Liverpool, to get out of the way. While I was stopping at Dick's I told him Isaacs had opened every thing about the brass.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You did not know Featherstone before? A. No. I paid Dick the money, and he gave me 5s. out of two sovereigns - Featherstone gave Dick some change out of a sovereign. The cart was open, like a chaise cart, and a very pale lead colour - Featherstone drove it - they were both in it; Dick said nothing about paying Featherstone for the hire of the cart; I do not know how much per day a cart lets for. - Our second meeting at the George and Ball was between two and three o'clock - the property was in two bags; I cannot say whether Featherstone could see what was in them as they lay in the cart, as I did not get up into the cart. I was taken into custody at Liverpool - I cannot exactly say the date.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you think of becoming a witness here? A. I did not think about it; I was never examined before a Magistrate. I was questioned at Mr. Harmer's office five or six days ago - there were a good many people in the room; I do not know how many. I am giving evidence for the good of the parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not once stand where the prisoners do now, in this Court? A. I am not obliged to answer that; I came here to tell what I am about now; I do not say but what I have stood at that bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Perhaps you have been here oftener than once? A. You may say as many times as you like - I never was but once in my life. I knew Isaacs before by his coming to my sister's - he dealt there.</p>
               <p>Q. You first said to him, "Do you keep an old ironshop" - it was your object to make a sale to him? A. Yes. I did not know the value of old brass - it was broken brass in pieces; I thought he gave a fair price. I went to Liverpool because I heard the people talk about the church, and mention Isaacs' name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that it was in consequence of what Isaacs said, that you were taken at Liverpool? A. I do not know - my wife told me somebody had been, and in consequence of that I went off. The brass had not been weighed - I left that to Isaacs.</p>

One day somebody came and knocked at my room door, and asked for Tom - I cannot say what day it was; I only saw one man; I should know him - it was the prisoner Williams - he left a message for Tom; my brother came about ten o'clock that morning - I told him what message had been left; it was to tell him, when he came, to come down to them at Westminster- he went, and came back again. Isaacs came in after he returned, for a pickled herring. Tom asked him, in my presence, if he bought brass; Isaacs said Yes; he asked what he gave per lb. - he said 5d. Tom looked at him, and Isaacs said "You need not be afraid, it is all right - if it were Jesus Christ I would buy it, for that will go where hundreds have gone;" that is all that passed that I heard. Isaacs went away - my brother came in the same afternoon, and asked if I would let him put two bags into the cellar - my husband, who was present, gave him leave. Williams and Featherstone brought two bags; I could not see what was in them; they were put down in the cellar. Tom asked me for two sovereigns. I do not know what it was for - I let him have them, and he went away. Isaacs came again that evening about six o'clock - Tom was there; they went down in the cellar where the bags were, and when they came up, I heard them agree that Isaacs was to come next morning to take it away; he said he would come between ten and eleven o'clock; he came about that time. Tom moved the bags - Isaacs was present; the basket was borrowed of my husband.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Dick and Tom agreed that Isaacs should come next morning? A. No; Tom and Isaacs agreed; I said nothing about Dick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you know any thing of the bags? A. No. Nobody came to search for my brother at my place.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. The 2l. was paid at that time - you know nothing of a previous payment? A. No.</p>

Yes: these bags were brought into my cellar - I afterwards saw Tom take them away; I believe Isaacs helped him - the brass was in two bags; I lent Tom a basket; I saw the prisoners, Williams and Featherstone, bring the bags into the cellar - they are the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were you ever here as a witness before? A. No; I was at the shop when Isaacs came, but was not there all the time - I was backwards and forwards, and talking to my customers outside; I might be five or ten minutes in the shop, but I cannot say; I saw Isaacs go out and leave the place - no customers came in the shop while he was there, that I recollect - I remained there after Isaacs went away; the customers came to the front of the shop, and I was serving them outside while he was there; I heard nothing particular between him and my brother, except that he said he would buy Jesus Christ if he would bring him in, and it would go where hundreds had gone before.</p>

I saw Featherstone there on a Friday morning, as I came into the George and Ball; he and Dick were there, and called for a pot of porter, which I took them - Willis was also there; Dick just came in as I did. I took them two pots of porter, and half a pint of gin - I remember seeing a horse and cart there; I looked into it, and saw a bag - the cart stood five or six houses off, on the other side of the way; it was a middling sized horse, and had a sore on its back - I only saw one sack; I have seen a cart in possession of Pople, but do not think it is the same; I did not observe the colour, but it is broken; the cart I saw had no step to it. I did not hear Tom Willis say any thing about a Jew - I sometimes went to Dick's lodgings for some pots; I have seen Willis there.</p>

On a Thursday night, just before I shut up, somebody came in for some penny cords - I should know him again, it was Featherstone - he said he wanted them to lace a bed with; I said he had better have it all in one piece; he said that would answer his purpose very well, and he bought six penny cords, very similar to that produced. I heard of the robbery of the church the next morning.</p>

            . I am a dealer in marine-stores, and live in Eagle-court, Strand. The prisoner Isaacs applied to me on Friday, the 2d of February. I went into a public-house to have a pint of beer, and he wanted me to buy some metal - I told him I did not deal in it, but I had a son-in-law who was going into business, and he might sell it to him. I did not see the brass that night; he came to me on the Saturday, after eleven o'clock, and said "Gashion, have you a mind to buy this brass?" I said No - he said he had 17l. to make up before one o'clock, to send away in the country. I said No, it would not pay me; he said he would be obliged to me if I would - I at last went to look at it; he took me to No. 22, Houghton-street, Clare-market - it was in two bags; I agreed to give him 61/2d. per lb.; but when I looked at it, I said it would not suit me at that price, and agreed to give him 6d. He asked if I would take it home to be weighed; I said, No. We took it to a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050036"></xptr>potatoe-shop at the corner of Clare-market, it weighed 156lbs.; I paid him 3l. 18s. Heath, my man, was present all the time; I sent the brass from there to Mr. Bottons by Heath, and received 4l. 6s. 11d. for it. I was taken up on this charge, and gave this account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were you before the Magistrate? A. Yes; Isaacs was there, and admitted that he had sold it to me; I bought it for 6d. and sold it for 7d. I saw him about it twice; he was at the public-house on Friday - I suppose six or more persons were present; he made no secret about it; it was weighed in the bags at the potatoe-shop; several persons were about; he made no secret of the matter; the bag was untied, but the brass was not visible. I told the master of the shop I had bought two bags of brass, and would be obliged if he would allow me to have them weighed - Isaacs heard that. I have known him attend different sales, and have known him from a boy. I never heard any harm of him, and believe he bore a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you go to any place in consequence of what Isaacs said? A. No; I went with Isaacs' brother from the 6th to the 10th of February, in search of Willis, but could not find him; and after Isaacs was bailed, I saw no more of the brother. I offered to bail Isaacs on the 12th - I said if they wanted one bail I would - I know he was bailed.</p>

               <p>WILLIAMs' Defence. Willis says I brought the property to his brother's place - I never saw Willis till he was waiting at the George and Ball: and hearing people mention my name, he said to me, "Dick, have you got any place where I can slow myself out of the way?" I said, Yes, and took him to my room; he said the officer wanted him for a firkin of butter. I kept him in my room for a fortnight; his wife came backwards and forwards - she brought him a pair of pistols, and he said no officer should take him away alive. I then said he should not stop in my place any longer, and he went away in two days.</p>
               <p>FEATHERSTONE's Defence. On the Thursday evening I went to Mr. Morrison, and asked him for twopenny worth of bed-cord in one piece - he gave me twopenny worth; I said that was enough, and had twopenny worth, and then another twopenny worth - I untied them, and he tied all three pieces together for me. Willis says I carried one of the sacks into the cellar out of my cart - my cart was not out that morning at all.</p>
               <p>MR. MORRISON. I have no recollection of his tying them together; I know he undid them.</p>
               <p>ISAACS' Defence. I bought the brass of Tom Willis as honest goods, at 5d. per lb. - he did not agree to my price at first, but let me go; but on the following evening he agreed to let me have it. I said I would not take it away that night, as so many officers were about, and if it was wrong they would stop me, but I would come next morning, which I did - he brought it in two different loads to my house, No. 22, Houghton-street. I had no idea of its being come wrongfully by, or I should not have taken it to a public shop to have it weighed. I hope you will consider me as an innocent man, and the witness against me as guilty of the offence.</p>

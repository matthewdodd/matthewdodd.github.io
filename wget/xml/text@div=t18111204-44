On last Saturday, between the hours of two and three in the afternoon the prisoner came into my shop, she asked to look at some blue printed cotton, there was a piece of that description laying upon the counter, I asked her if that was the sort that she wanted, she said no, she wished for a larger pattern, there were a number of other customers in the shop at the time, I turned from her to speak to the other customers, and then turned to her again and found her coming from the other side of the shop, coming towards me again, I asked her if that pattern would do again, she said no, it would not; she then walked towards the door, I observed her hand up to her cloak as she was going out, as if to conceal something that she had got there, I followed her immediately into the Street, she then attempted to cross the way, I took hold of her by the arm, I said,</p>
               <p>"let me see what you have got there," I pulled her cloak a little of one side and saw a piece of muslin, which I took from her and requested her to go back with me, which she did. Before I had been in the shop a minute with the prisoner a man, a stranger to me, brought in three pieces of muslin, and said, the woman has dropped these three pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the hearing of the woman. - A. I cannot say, it was very close to her. These are the four pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Sir, tell me whether you know these pieces are yours. - A. Yes, they are my own marking.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen them in the shop. - A. I had seen them in the morning, they were laying on the opposite counter, the counter from which she came.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the one piece that you took from her. - A. About six shillings, the others are about two pound four shillings.</p>

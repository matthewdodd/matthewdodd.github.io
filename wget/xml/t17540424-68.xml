During the time he was my servant I was robbed of a shirt, two neckcloths, a great coat, and two silver table spoons. There was a shirt and neckcloth delivered to him, which he acknowledged he had received, but he never produced them. On his losing these things I had great complaints of him. I taxed him with taking the shirt and neckcloth, but he said he had put them in a drawer in the kitchen. I discharged him for his bad behaviour, and he has been lurking about my stable almost ever since. About a fortnight or three weeks ago my stables were broke open and stripped of bridles and saddles, with some more furniture; having intelligence of the prisoner being seen about my stables, I got a search warrant to search his lodgings, and in searching found one of the neckcloths I had lost. Upon that he was taken up the same evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that neckcloth?</p>
               <p>Cox. It seems to have been worn very much since he used to ride with me in the country, and this is the linen we carried into the country with us.</p>

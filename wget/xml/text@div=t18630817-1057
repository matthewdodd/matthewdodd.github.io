                  </hi>. I am engaged in the Admiralty, and reside at Brunswick-cottage, Deptford—the prisoner was my housemaid—on Sunday, 2d August, I placed twelve bottles of sherry wine in my pantry, and after the servants had gone to bed I found there were only three bottles full; all the rest were empty—I had recently parted with some servants, and I did not suspect the prisoner—next day, on coming home, I found that one of the remaining three bottles was gone—I went to the police-station and got an officer, and left him outside the house—I questioned the prisoner and her fellow-servant about it, and they both denied all knowledge of it, and the prisoner said if there were three bottles there the night before there must be still—I again went into the pantry, and, to my astonishment, one of the two bottles I had left not long before was gone—I then called in the police<lb></lb>man—he asked me to let him speak to the two servants in private, which he did—when he returned to me he said in their presence, "One of your servants will tell you where the wine is"—I immediately asked the prisoner where it was; she seemed surprised, and said, "Why do you ask met?"—she then said, "I have taken one bottle"—the policeman then searched her bedroom in my presence, and some articles were found belonging to me and my sister—the prisoner produced one bottle from her room, and the police<lb></lb>man produced two more empty ones—she then acknowledged, in my presence, having taken three, but no more.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside with my brother—on 21st July the prisoner came into our service as housemaid—on Sunday night, 2d August, I asked my brother to move some wine into the pantry—I found that corks had gone out of several bottles then—I went to see the prisoner's box ex<lb></lb>amined,</p>

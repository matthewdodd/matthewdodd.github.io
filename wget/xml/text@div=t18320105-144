            . I am clerk to Messrs. Freeman and Hall. I have the waste-book here - here is an entry made by me, as dictated by the prisoner, on the 12th of September, in which he accounts for 20l. 19s. 6 1/2d. received from Mr. Gobby; on the 18th of October here is an entry, which I took down from what he told me, in which he accounts for having received 10l. 16s. - and on the 1st of December I have written, from his dictation, 47l. 16s. 4d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were these entries made during the hurry of business? A. Yes, when customers might have been in the shop, not in the evening; we put the name of the person from whom we receive money, and I take it to Mr. Freeman or Mr. Hall, generally in the evening - I account by this book; I never had money over, which I could not account for - I have not made mistakes in entering cash; I have made mistakes in the quantity and quality of goods - that would make a difference in the amount.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. When you give the money to your masters, they put their initials to the entry? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had the prisoner an opportunity of seeing what you wrote in this book, when you received the money? A. Yes; I took down what he said, and when I cast it up at the end, he asked what the amount was, and I told him - he said it was right; I did so constantly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not made mistakes in entering money received? A. No; I have been called to account for mistakes in this book.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY to MRS. GOBBY. Q. Have you not sometimes objected to the price of the goods? A. I have made abatements - I have sometimes paid him less than he asked for the goods, but not unknown to his master: the bill was not brought with the price of the goods made out - that was left to him: invoices were brought sometimes with the goods - he has asked me a higher sum than I have paid him.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did he ever give a receipt for a larger sum than you paid him? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. FREEMAN. I received on the 12th of September 20l. 19s. 6d. - here is my mark to it; my partner received the second and third sums - these invoices and receipts are the prisoner's writing; here is a book of the money received from each customer, in the prisoner's hand-writing - here is "Mrs. Gobby, on the 12th of September, 20l. 19s. 6d.; on the 18th of October 10l. 16s., and on the 1st of December 47l. 16s. 4d., which exactly corresponds with the account taken from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had he lived with you? A. Rather better than a year and a half - I believe we took him at 60l. a year, and from June, 1831, he was to have 100l.; I or my partner receive the money every night - it is not allowed to go for two or three nights.</p>

               <p>MR. HALL. I stated at the office that he asked my permission the following day, to go into the City to purchase goods - he said he had some money to pay to Mrs. Gobby - I do not recollect that he told me the amount.</p>

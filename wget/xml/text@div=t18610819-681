I am the widow of the deceased Thomas Lexton—he was a labourer, and fifty-four years of age—on Monday, 20th May, I returned home from my work between 10 and 11 o'clock, and found him in bed bleeding right down the fingers, and down the bosom of his shirt—his health before that was very good indeed—he never complained.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon of Middlesex Hospital—the deceased was admitted there as an in-door patient on 4th June—I found the index finger of the left-hand very much enlarged, and a number of cuts on it—it smelt very horribly—the bones were dead—there were several sores which were discharging very unhealthy and fetid matter, and those commu<lb></lb>nicated with the bones that were dead below—he had a dyspeptic appearance—his tongue was bad, and his digestion was bad—we tried to bring his system into a better state if possible before amputating his finger, therefore the operation was not performed immediately—his general health did not improve after the removal—the symptoms which existed to some extent before, increased, which made me and the other surgeon consider that abscesses were being formed in different parts of the body, which I after-wards found to be the case—he died on 19th June, and I made a post<lb></lb>mortem examination—I found a large collection of matter and pus in the lungs and liver, with the structure of the lungs and liver by them in a state of mortification—there was also a collection of pus in the joint of the thumb of the left-hand—it was a very unhealthy sore, buried under the thumb and over the ball of it—the injury to the hand must have been inflicted some-time before I saw him, because the bones were dead—there must have been some violence—a simple cut would not be at all likely to be followed by such a severe injury—I believe he had this collection of matter in his lungs and liver consequent upon the injury to his hand—there were abscesses in the lungs and liver, that was the immediate cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I understand you to say that the collection of pus in the lungs was consequent upon the wound in the Land, or that it may have been? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I mean to say that, not having received the wound in the hand, he would not have had that collection of pus—I say that the collection of pus did not arise from any bodily disorder, it was not the result of mortified action, having nothing to do with the hand—collections of pus do exist in the lungs quite irrespective of any injury, but you can trace their origin—if there is ulceration of the lungs the pus is formed first—these abscesses were cists filled with pus and not discharged—it is the same in cases of consump<lb></lb>tion, but not in the same form—consumption does not take place in the liver—there was a large abscess in the liver—in cases of dysentery, abscesses form in the liver wholly irrespective of any external injury—any external injury would produce collections of pus in the liver, lungs, and brain—we can trace their causes—I do not seriously mean to tell you that I can always trace the origin of a secretion of pus in the human system—the bone of the finger was dead—exfoliation is when a part of a bone dies; this bone was entirely dead—I believe the injury to have been inflicted a fortnight before he came in—a disease of the bone is not necessarily consequent upon an external injury—I mean to say that the bone would be not merely in an exfoliated state, but in a perfectly dead state, in one fortnight after the injury to the flesh—in a large number of cases such a wound would be inflicted without any disease following upon it—I do not consider that the man must have been labouring under disease for some time, and have been in a very bad habit of body prior to the injury; but these collections of matter in the lungs and liver took place subsequently—I do not consider that the bone was in a diseased state previous to the infliction of the wound—I cannot answer such a ques<lb></lb>tion—I cannot say what condition it was in previously, but the injury would account for it—I never heard of a case where a finger became dead of itself without any injury—I see no reason for the bone having been in a diseased state for more than a fortnight previous to my seeing the man—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186108190060"></xptr>
               <p>I saw nothing in the symptoms to enable me to say that the bone had not been diseased for more than a fortnight, but the thing is perfectly unique—I never heard of a bone dying without a cause—a bone of the leg might die but bones of the finger do not—I do not know what is called "Pott's mot<lb></lb>tification"—I have frequently heard of the celebrated Dr. Potts, who lived in the last century—I know he described a kind of gangrene which begins in the toes, and gradually involves the bones, but it does not begin in the bones first—gangrene is not a secretion of pus—I know a disease where the falanges or bones of the toes fall off, but both the flesh and the bones die—I mean to pledge myself that the disease commences in the flesh first and not in the bone—I never saw it originate in the bone and become commu<lb></lb>nicated to the flesh—as a man of science I never heard of it and do not know it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MECDONNELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you able, from having seen the man, to say whether he was a healthy subject or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should not, call him a healthy subject, because there were indications of disease in the kidneys; but I saw nothing in the condition of the organs to prevent his living for years.</p>

The deceased was my brother—on Whit-Monday, 20th May, between 5 and 6, I entered his yard, my nephew was there—the prisoner, who is the landlord, afterwards came into the room and said he would have no music played there—my nephew had a fiddle and played once—my brother after that brought some porter, and the landlord again came into the room—my brother reached out his glass for a glass of porter, and Callahan took the poker and gave him a blow over the left arm and finger with it, and across the glass of beer—his fingers were round the glass—the glass was broken and the beer spilt—Lexton turned, seized Callahan with his right hand, and knocked him down—my brother's hand bled—the prisoner took the poker from this arm and gave a blow with it—they were none of them drunk.</p>

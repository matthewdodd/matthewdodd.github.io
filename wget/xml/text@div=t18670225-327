                  </hi>. I am a builder, of Ashley Place, Stepney—about twelve o'clock on 12th January I was passing the railway arches, Brom<lb></lb>ley—I saw some women there, one of them asked me for a few pence, as she was starving—I told her I had not got any money then, but I should be returning that way about three o'clock—I did return about three—I saw the two females and four men sitting round a small fire in the middle of the arch—I had then 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket—one of the women came to me and asked me for some money, so I gave her a shilling—I turned round and was walking away, when I received a blow on the left side of my head—there were several persons round me—the prisoner was one of them—I leant against the wall, and the prisoner put his hand in my pocket and tore it out—the money was in that pocket—they all ran away, and I pursued them—a constable apprehended the others, and they were tried and convicted last Session.

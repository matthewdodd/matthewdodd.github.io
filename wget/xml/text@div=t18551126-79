                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 80). On 9th Nov. I was on duty at the gate of the Arsenal, at Woolwich—about half past 1 o'clock the men were coming out to go to their dinner—the prisoner came as one of the men employed there to the gate at that time—the inspector desired the prisoner to go into the office to be searched—I took him in, searched him, and found on him this gun metal, about 71/2 lbs., one piece in each pocket—I asked him where he got it, he made no reply—I took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman in the Royal Arsenal. The prisoner has been employed there about nine months—these pieces are what we term gun metal—they are of the same description and quality as the gun metal used in the Arsenal—the prisoner in his employ would have access to places where this was kept—the value of this is about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There is no particular mark on this, except that it is the same sort of metal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is the same sort—there is no mark by which I can identify it—I cannot say but that metal of this description may be used in other departments.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read, as follows</hi>: "I did not steal it at all; at half past 8 o'clock, on going from breakfast to work, I saw the two pieces of metal lying in the gutter in Powis-street; I picked them up, and put them into my pocket; I went to work in the Royal Arsenal, and kept them in my pocket; they were there when the policeman touched me; he searched and found them.")</p>

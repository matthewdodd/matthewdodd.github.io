I gave him 1l. note, 19s. and 7d. in halfponee; I went to the bar and came back again, and saw the 1l. note on the table; I asked him why he did not take it up. He gave her 1s. to get some bread and cheese. Seeing him in liquor, I asked him if it was his wife, he said, it was his cousin. He gave me the note to take care of; the silver was not there. He did not complain to me then. She came back and said the shilling was bad, and I changed it.</p>
               <p>JOHN DOWLING. I live with the last witness, I was in the tap-room drinking my beer; the prisoner, and prosecutor, came in, and called for some beer: Mrs. Powell served them; she gave the 1l. note, 19s. and 7d. in copper, in the change. The prisoner took the money off the table, except the note, and left the room: just before she came back, he said he had lost his money. When she came back, she said she had not got it: she was absent about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>BARTHOLOMEW CRONEY. I was at the public-house; the prisoner and prosecutor, called for some beer, the landlady gave them 1l. 19s. 6d., the prisoner took the money and went out, and came back and went out again. The prosecutor said, he had lost his money: I went out after her and took her, in about a quarter of an hour; she had got it; she gave him 1s. out of her pocket. I am sure she is the woman.</p>

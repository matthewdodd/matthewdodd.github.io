                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, at No. 5, Hanover Square. On the afternoon of 2nd June, about 2 o'clock, the prisoner came in, accompanied by a female, and asked to look at some rings—I showed them some, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185706150081"></xptr>
               <p>they objected to them, as not being sufficiently expensive—I showed them some more, and after taking them out of the case and putting them on the counter, they tried them on—I told them they had no occasion to try them, as the size could be altered—they desired to see some large stones; I declined showing them, but showed them an ornament with large diamonds in it—the prisoner selected one, and desired that one like that, and a ruby on each side of it, should be made into a ring for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave me his name as Le Blane, No. 27, Upper Seymour Street—I had shown him three boxes of rings, two were full, and one was deficient by two of the full complement—I sent my clerk to make inquiries—I examined the trays of rings, called them over by my stock book, and found that a diamond half hoop ring with five stones was missing, worth 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I put the rings all out, and found there were sufficient rings to fill two of the boxes, and left the one that had had two with three out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you ever seen the prisoner before, or the woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I sent to Seymour Street—I replaced the rings about a quarter of an hour after the prisoner had left the shop—I began to call them over as soon as my clerk returned—I sent the clerk the instant the prisoner was gone—I called over the rings when my clerk came back, in about a quarter of an hour—No. 27, Seymour Street, is near Portman Square; my clerk could go there in a quarter of an hour—there was a gentleman in the shop, a customer, at the time the prisoner was there—in general we confine the rings to separate cases, one less expensive, one more so, and another the highest price—there was one other person in the shop, my father; the others had all gone to dinner, and in that time I replaced the rings—I should think the prisoner was in the shop six or seven minutes—I have never seen the woman again, nor the ring.</p>

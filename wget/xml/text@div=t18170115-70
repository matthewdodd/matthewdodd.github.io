               <p>JOSEPH DELANY. I am a pawnbroker, and live at Rotherhithe. On Saturday, the 4th of January, the prisoner came to my house to pledge a pistol. I delivered it to the officer. I saw the name of Rae, 91, Minories, on the barrel. I asked the prisoner if it was his property; he said he was an officer's servant; and produced a paper purporting to be a recommendation from his late master. He said his master bought it at Mr. Montague's. I stopped it.</p>

            . I am clerk to the Thames Police-Office; the prisoner was examined at our office; Delany was examined, and produced the pistol. The prisoner was asked how he came by it. I took down, from his mouth, what he said (reads.) "I was servant to Lieutenant Prior, he brought it from abroad about two years and a half ago; he went to Chichester, and I dare say he is there now. I was in London at the time of the riots; but do not recolleet where. I was not at the riots. I used to attend clubs before I went to sea, but that led me into bad company, and that was the reason of my going to sea. Lieutenant Prior gave me his pistols, and other things, to the value of 50l. I have sold all the other things, as I was short of money."</p>

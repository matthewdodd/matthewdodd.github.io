               <p>Q. Is your father alive?</p>
               <p>Worger. He is, but he was not at home at that time the money was taken. I had for some time missed several goods, and having four servants, could not tell which to lay it to. I endeavoured, if possible, to detect the guilty person. Upon which, on Friday night, the 2d of January, I laid 18 d. upon the counter, the last thing before I went to bed. I had marked both the shilling and sixpence. On the next morning I saw the money laying where I had left it before the shop was opened: the prisoner's business was to open the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lie in your house?</p>
               <p>Worger. No, there was but one of the four lay in my house. The money was soon taken away, before any of the others had been in the shop. I did not think proper to appear in it myself at that time, so desired my journeyman to borrow a shilling of the prisoner. He did, and brought it to me [producing one] this is it, here is the mark I made by filing it over the head; it is a king William's shilling, with the letter B at the bottom; I suppose made after the battle of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176101160003"></xptr> the Boyne. The person's name, who I got to borrow the money, is Clark. Then I went to justice Fielding, who granted me a warrant to take up the prisoner. I took him up: he at first denied it. He was committed to the Gatehouse, and on Monday he was re-examined, and then he denied it, but at last he owned it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the sixpence upon him?</p>
               <p>Worger. He changed such a sixpence at a publick-house, but I have not got it again.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did I ever wrong you of a farthing before?</p>
               <p>Worger. I have missed a great many things, but I cannot charge them upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Clemmell Clark. I am servant to Mr. Worger, he desired me to borrow a shilling of the prisoner that morning (this is the same here produced.) I at that time did not know any thing of the affair, till my master explained it afterwards.</p>

               <p>The money that I lent the last evidence, was not my master's property, I had it of a tallow-chandler, at the next door, the night before; and the sixpence, that my master mentioned, I had of a soldier. I came from Wiltshire, and have no witnesses in town.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any business on board that barge? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - Yes, I know his person very well, after they put them into the peter boat; I rowed to them, the time I was rowing to them this prisoner and his companion chucked a parcel of them over board, finding I was rowing to them, and they rowed away as fast as they could, then I went on shore, they filled the well full and a cheese laid on it to conceal it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see by the appearance of these coals whether they were the same coals that came from the barge? - I think they were; then I rowed on shore to the Orchard house and called the officer that is in court,

               <p>Q. Did you go up with him? - No, we pursued directly after the boat and found the prisoner in the peter boat with the property which I described before, we took possession of the coals, and brought him up before the magistrate, there might be six or seven bushels, some of them are brought here, they have been in the office ever since, and there was a seal put on each sack.</p>

               <p>I am a trinity officer. On Tuesday I ordered Hill the waterman, to go down to Blackwall, and to stay at the mouth of Bow-creek to see if any thing was going forward in the coal line, to see if any of the boats were there loading out of any of the craft, and if they were, to come on shore to the Orchard house immediately and inform me of the same; after I had been there some considerable time I went out to see for him, and met him coming to the house to inform me there was a barge being plundered; in the mean time the lighterman Wilkinson, came into the house before Hill, when he saw Hill and me together he immediately went away from the house and called a boat with a ferry at Bow-creek to row him to the craft; from what Hill told me I got into my boat and rowed after Wilkinson, he rowed up Bow-creek after the loaded craft, when he was on board the craft I went on board to take the name and number, observing to him that there had been a quantity of coals taken out of the same craft, by observing the hole from whence they were taken; we took her name and number and told him I should acquaint the proprietor as soon as I could find out who it was, and send for him when I wanted him; I immediately rowed down the creek again after the prisoner at the bar's boat; in consequence of which we fell in with him and took him with the coals now produced in court.</p>

               <p>I am a waterman and lighterman; I was along with Mr. Peat on the 30th of April at the Orchard house, Tuesday, and being in there they thought Mr. Hill was a good while before he came to us; Mr. Peat went to look for him and we met him, and they spoke together and they agreed to have a boat and row round Bow-creek. I took them into the boat and we went round and got to the craft, then Mr. Peat stepped into the craft and took the name and number of the barge, 1,018, Beccy; after we had seen the lighterman, Mr. Peat spake to the lighterman, we then after that pursued after the boat, and took it; the peter boat was up at Blackwall at a good distance from there, I dare say half a mile, the boy was rowing the boat in by the side of the Gun at the upper part of Blackwall.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in a direction from the barge? - Yes, it is where the boy and his master lives.</p>

A barge came down from Blackwall and the wind blowed very hard, they were on the lee shoar; I was standing at the Gun-yard at play, and the man could not hold his craft in, he immediately called out for help, my fellow servant called me out of the yard and I went and helped the man almost round from Bow-creek, and he had no money to pay me and he told me to take some coals, he insisted on our taking them for our good nature for helping him down off the lee shore, and my fellow servant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290149"></xptr>chucked them on board because he would not dirty his boat with them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Edward Ashby, who is an ironmonger, at Staines. The prisoner came to the shop on 26th July; he said he wanted a dozen reaping hooks of a middling size, for Mr. Williams, of Laleham—I asked him if he was in Mr. Williams's employ; he said, yes, he was, and he had been in his employ about five weeks—I served him with the reaping hooks, and asked him his name; he told me it was Davies—the officer has four of the hooks (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here are the marks on the handles, which we mark when they come in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> What he states is false, these hooks I bought; I was not at Staines on 26th July. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I am sure he is the man—I had not seen him before—I have a lad in the shop who knows him well—I have now heard the prisoner speak—I have not the slightest doubt that he is the man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, T</hi> 27). I was on duty at Staines, and in consequence of information, I went to get some reaping hooks—I found these four of them in possession of different persons in the neighbourhood of Shepperton—two of the persons I got them from were William James, and Thomas Williams; I do not know the names of the other two persons—I found the prisoner afterwards in Abingdon gaol—I found nothing on him.</p>

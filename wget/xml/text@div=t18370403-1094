                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Thomas Emmett, jeweller, Holborn-hill. The prisoners came in together—Wilson asked to look at some seals—I showed him some—he looked at them, and asked for one with a large white cornelian stone—Harrol was by his side, and talking with him respecting them—he selected one which was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he inquired the price of engraving two letters—I said about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they said that would be too much—I said I had some cheaper—he said they were too common—I thought some of the seals were missing, and said, "I have lost some of these seals, and before you go, I will find them"—Harrol hastily got out of the door, but I got round the counter in time to stop Wilson—I sent the boy to call Mr. Emmett—I told him to mind Wilson, and I went out, and saw Harrol waiting in Bartlett's-buildings—I waited in a public-house at the corner—I saw the officer, and told him to take her to the shop—I watched her that she did not throw any thing away, and she was taken into a little back room.</p>

                  </hi>. This seal is mine—I was present when the prisoners were searched—as far as the officer has stated, it is correct—my young man sent for me up stairs—he stood between the man and the door to prevent his escape—I took his place—he said, "The woman, I am quite sure, has got some of the property"—I said, "You go alter her"—he went, and brought her back—she was searched, and I heard the seal fail from her. (Wilson received a good character.)</p>

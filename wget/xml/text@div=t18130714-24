He was walking with the property in question under his coat. He had it at the back of his coat; it was between his coat and his back, in this box. I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>

The box was locked; the key had been lost for six months. I know both the watches; they are my husband's. The spoons are marked with the initials of my husband's name, and his first wife's name. The tea-spoons and the two salt-sillers are silver; they are marked in the same way. The cream jug, that is silver, with the same mark.</p>

            . I live at Mrs. Baker's. On the morning of the 6th of July I saw a man go out of the house; he wore a shabby coat; by the prisoner's appearance he is the same man; he has the same coat on. It was between eleven and twelve o'clock. I did not see his face. He was the same size as the prisoner. He turned his back towards me, and turned up Coleman-street; it was impossible for me to see whether he had any thing about him.</p>
               <p>Q. As near as you can tell what o'clock was it - A. About a quarter to twelve.</p>

               <p>Q. to Percy When you found the prisoner was the box locked or open - A. It was locked. I searched him for the key; he said he had no key. I stopped him in Star-street; that is about two hundred yards from Gravel-lane. I saw him come down Coleman-street, and go into Star-street. I followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he coming from Coleman-street in the direction as he would be coming from Gravel-lane - A. Yes. When I asked him what he had he said he had a box which he took from a sailor at New Crane-stairs out of a waterman's boat: he had it at the back of his coat, and he was smoking a pipe also. He told me he was going to take it to a lodging-house; he could not tell me the sailor's name, nor the person's name, nor who occupied the house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140024"></xptr>New Crane-stairs is about as far from where I first saw him as New Gravel-lane.</p>

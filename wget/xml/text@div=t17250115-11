He returned about 6 in the Evening, and soon understood that she was eloped with the Prisoner. The Chest of Drawers were fast lock'd, and the Key left in the Window; but when he came to open 'em, all was gone. When his Wife Jane came home again, she confessed that she had taken the Money away. The Prisoner desired that the Prosecutor or his Wife might be asked, if they did not know that Plate was his, (the Prisoner's,) and that he lent it to Jane the Prosecutor's Wife before her last Marriage. Mr. Barns did not care that his Wife Jane should be examined in Court. The Jury <rs id="t17250115-11-verdict59" type="verdictDescription">

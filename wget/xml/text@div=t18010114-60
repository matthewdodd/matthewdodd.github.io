             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am clerk to Messrs. Price and Aubrey, of Salisbury-square, Fleet-street, attornies: On the 6th of December I went by the Banbury coach from the Green Man and Still, to Uxbridge; I never saw Mr. Fagg till the 6th of December, nor Mr. Pratt till a day or two ago; when I saw Mr. Fagg, it was after I had been to Uxbridge and back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made Mr. Fagg acquainted with your intention of going to Uxbridge, before you set out for Uxbridge? - A. Certainly not; I had never seen them before; the prisoner at the bar drove the coach; I got down at the White Horse, at Uxbridge, from inside the coach; the prisoner charged me five shillings, which I paid him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you acquaint Mr. Fagg, upon your return on the 6th, that you had been a passenger, and what you had paid? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are a limb of the law - you are to be an attorney? - A. I believe I shall very shortly.</p>
               <p>Q. You are what is called a fagging clerk? - A. No, I do not fag much.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in their employ? - A. Six weeks; before that I was with Mr. Edmonds, of the Exchequer office of Pleas, for more than twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sent you to Uxbridge? - A. Mr. Dixon, of the One Bell, in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. A friend of Mr. fagg's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did not he give you money too? - A. Yes, he gave me a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. You expended five shillings going out, and five shillings coming home, and the rest was for your dinner? - A. Yes, and my breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. This was from a pure love of the public; you did not wish to have any reward for it? - A. No, I did not know what I was to go for; I was to take notice of what passed on the road.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who gave you the guinea? - A. Mr. Dixon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Who was there going down? - A. A lady and her son, going to Buckingham, and a gentleman, I do not know where he was going.</p>

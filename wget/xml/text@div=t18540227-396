                  </hi>. I am a hosier, of Beech-street, Barbican. The prisoner came to my shop on Monday, 16th Feb., for a pair of braces, about a shilling a pair—I showed him some; he selected a pair, and offered me a crown piece; I gave him change—I asked him if there was anything else that he required: he said he should want a cravat at some future time, bat there was no harm in looking at some—I showed him some, and he ended by taking a cravat, and not the braces; it came to 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., more, and went out—I immediately took the crown from where I had put it, and followed him to the door with it, as the shop was rather dark—I found that it was bad, followed him, and challenged him with it—he said, "Are you sure it is the same one?"—I said, "Yes"—it had not been out of my sight at all—he went back with me, laid the cravat and change on the counter, and wished to leave the place, which I would not allow—I gave him in charge; he was remanded on 6th Feb., and discharged on the 11th.</p>

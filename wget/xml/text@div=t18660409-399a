I am a licensed victualler, and keep the Grapes, Holborn-hill—the prisoner applied for a situation as barman, and came into my service on 15th March—for some reasons, I placed some marked money in my till on four consecutive days—on Tuesday, 3d April, I placed some marked money in my till, and among it, caused this florin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be placed there—I marked it with a penknife on the upper part of the head—it is visible now if you turn the head to you—I also marked this shilling (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) under the head—it is a sort of curve on the right-hand side of the crown—I gave the prisoner in custody on 6th April—I was present when his box. was searched, and the florin was found—the shilling was found in his pocket—during the time he was in my service he received no money, as he was only there three weeks, and I pay once a month.</p>

               <p>him he must consider himself in custody for stealing money from his master's till—he said that he had not stolen any money whatever—there were twelve shillings, a sixpence, and a penny on the table—I picked up the shillings, put the rest in the purse, and then went up stairs—I saw the prosecutor mark on a shilling—the mark is at the bottom of the head—it is a line drawn very short—I can swear to this shilling from that mark—I saw they were all marked each day before they were put in the till—I asked him where his box was—he took the keys out of his pocket, and was going to unlock the box, and I said, "I will unlock it; what money shall I find in it?"—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "What gold shall I find?"—he said, "I don't know"—I believe he said afterwards, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, but he did not know how much silver—I said, "You can tell to a pound or two?"—he said, "I shall not answer any more questions"—I said, "Very well"—I was not in uniform—I told him I was a detective-officer—I opened the box, and found two sovereigns, a half-sovereign, half-crown aflorin, two gold rings, eight pawn<lb></lb>tickets, a silver watch, a gold chain, a gold key and locket, a gold pin, and in the breast-pocket of the coat he was wearing I found a ticket of a watch pawned on 15 th March, the day he entered the prosecutor's service—I took the florin and separated it from the other money—I did not mark it—several persons were sent in, and I went in—I can point this florin out of a thousand—the mark is just on the verge of the near part of the crown—I did not see it marked—I saw it after it had been marked—I am able to swear to it because of the mark I can see.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, on Monday the 17th of September this spoon (producing one) was brought to me to pawn by the prisoner at the bar, I ask'd her whose it was; she said, what was that to me whose it was; she asked 8 shillings upon it. I told her I would know whose it was before I lent any money upon it; I kept the spoon in my hand, and when she found I would not give it to her again, she said it was a young woman's that was at her house: I said I would go with her, and carry the young woman the money. I went along with her, but as I went along she said I must not see the young woman, and that I should not go to her house; so I then carried it home, and next day a young woman came for the spoon, but as she could give no particular description of it, I would not let her have it.</p>

               <p>Ann Green. I am servant to Mr. Strahan; I left a pan at the prisoner's house, and told her she might bring it home; she came and brought the pan home, and put it into the kitchen, and when she found nobody was there she took the spoon and put it into the pan, and carried it back again to her own house; some time after she sent to me and confessed that she took it after the manner that I have describ'd; we missed it about a quarter of an hour before she sent.</p>

               <p>The pan was brought to my house by the last witness, it was a kitchen-stuff pan, and, indeed my lord, the spoon was in the pan among the stuff. I sent and told her it was in the pan ; she desired I would not say any thing about it, for she would not have her master know it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Green. Was their kitchen stuff in the pan?</p>
               <p>Green. No, it was empty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the guard of the Rein Deer coach. I received some parcels from Parrott on the morning of the 23rd of November—I remember receiving one directed to Messrs. Alexander and Clare—it ap<lb></lb>peared to contain something—it was bulky, and not like a single letter—I gave it to the prisoner about twelve o'clock on the 23rd, in the up-office, at the Belle Sanvage—when I gave it to him the seal was perfect—it was never out of my possession till I gave it to the prisoner—there was no tear in it, that I perceived—it was bulky when I parted with it, the same as when I received it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many parcels had you that day to deliver to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Five—I know the direction of each parcel—my atten<lb></lb>tion has been called to it since; if it had not, I could have told to whom they were addressed by the bill—I could not well make a mistake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you deliver the prisoner a parcel short that day, and find out that you had left it in your pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not deliver him the mileage parcel at the time I delivered him the others—I delivered him two, one for Mr. Alexander, and one for Mr. Nelson, and about two mi<lb></lb>nutes after I delivered him one more—the third one was very small—I had not forgotten it, but I went into the tap-room, and when I pulled my coat off this small parcel was in my pocket—I knew it was there—it escaped my observation just at the moment, being so small—that was the first journey I made with the coach—I left the other two parcels on the road according to their directions—I brought but three to town—I observed the other</p>

               <p>parcels that I delivered to the prisoner that morning—I did not tell him there were some accounts in them—I said, "You will deliver these and take care of them, I think they contain money"—I did not say that before the Magistrate, because I was not asked—I told the prisoner they were accounts which I thought contained money—I did not deliver four parcels to him that morning, to my knowledge—the two I delivered on the road were for Mr. Everett and Mr. Woodward, and the three I brought to London were for Mr. Alexander, Mr. Nelson, and Messrs. Wright and Horne.</p>
               <p>

            . I am a watchman; my beat is in Drury-lane; it was so on the 19th of September. When I came back to my box, after calling three o'clock to the extent of my beat, I went into it. Presently I heard a great knocking, I then went out of my box, and walked up and down, and I came up to the Mogul, which is M'Neal's, and found the knocking was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the Mogul from your box - A. The second house. I came to the door, and put my hand to the door, and it was fast. I drew back then, and stood up against the side of the house, and left my lanthorn in my-box. and harkened to the knocking all the time. In the course of a quarter of an hour. I heard a person coming to the door, and undoing the bolts, taking the bar off. I then drew back from the door about three or four yards, and the person opened the door, and out the prisoner came with a bundle under one arm, and a quartern loaf under the other. and a bottle in his hand, with as good as half a pint of liquor in it, with his thumb in it for a cork. As soon as he had got as far as the curb stone, I collared him; I walked with him across the street, and asked him what he had in the bundle, and he said, his clothes. I asked him what he had in the bottle, and he said, sugar and water. I called the private watch to my assistance. I put my hand to the door where the prisoner came out of, and it was open We then knocked at M'Neal's to awaken them, and down stairs they ran. I gave the prisoner in custody to the private watchman, while I went into the house. While I was undoing the bolts to let M'Neal's people down into the tap-room, I heard the bottle go smack upon the stones, and away he ran; the private watchman ran after him. I saw them both running along the street; I caught him myself, in Coach and Horses yard, Drury lane, and then I took him to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a watchman; my box is opposite Brownlow street, Drury lane. I saw them both crossing Drury lane, and brought them back to the Mogul door; it was about five minutes before M'Neal was called. While the last witness was calling M'Neal, the prisoner made a blow at me, and at the same time, made a spring, and ran off; we pursued him, and took him in Coach and Horses yard, and then took him to the watchhouse.</p>

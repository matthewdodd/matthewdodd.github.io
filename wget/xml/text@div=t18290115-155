            . I am a patrol. I was in West-street, near one o'clock on the morning of the 27th of December; the prosecutor called Watch! and said he had been knocked down and robbed - there was a mob round him; I had not seen him knocked down - he stated what he had lost; I asked him if he could identify any of the men - he said he could not; there was a mob gathered - I told them to disperse, and called another watchman to clear them away; we were obliged to take three to the watch-house - the prosecutor went with us, and not finding the property on them, he stated what sort of persons he suspected, and I went to look for the fourth, from his description; and about an hour after I saw the prisoner coming down Great Saffron-hill, which leads into West-street, with a flannel jacket on; he had a hat on - I took him, and asked what hat he had on, knowing it to be a different one to what he generally wears; I knew him before - he said it was his own hat; I told him I did not believe it, and he must go with me to the watch-house - I took him there; I took the hat off his head going along, and found a collar in it - I saw the prosecutor at the watch-house, and asked him to describe his hat; he said, if he saw it, he should know it, and that there was a collar in it; he did not say that before I told him I had found it - he had not mentioned it in my hearing; he did not mention the collar, until I showed it him- I did not ask if he had lost any thing else; the prosecutor said the collar belonged to his wife - the prisoner said nothing to that, but as we came along, be told me if I would let him go he would make it all right, and he attempted to tear the lining out of the hat, but I would not let him.</p>

            . I have no doubt this is my wife's collar - we had been out to a party the night before, and as she was coming home the wind blew it off her neck; I took it up, and put it into my hat, and forgot to take it out the next day - I believe the hat to be mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down the street - the prosecutor was quarrelling with a female; I went up and interfered - he pushed me down; we both fell in the crowd - he picked up my hat by mistake, and I picked.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150068"></xptr>up his; he was in liquor - they could get no sense into him at the watch-house; he had sworn to another hat before I was taken.</p>

               <p>with it—he-said "I will let you know in a minute"—he was standing up in the gangway—I said "You don't go forward with that knife"—he replied "Insult me and I will let you know what I will do with it in a minute"—I got hold of him and pushed him—we were wrestling awhile, and he stabbed me three times—he did it on purpose—he put his knife open in his pocket afterwards—I was in the hospital two or three days.</p>

I was on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Hudson</hi> on the night of 8th August, and saw the prisoner and the boatswain fighting—T did not see that he had a knife in his hand—they got on pretty well during the voyage; sometimes they had cross words—they had commenced a quarrel while washing the deck the same morning—when Watson had finished fighting with the prisoner, he went and fought with a man who is dead—I heard the prisoner say "I see the son of a b----coming, now I'll do fur him"—before I could get to the forecastle, Watson and the prisoner were fighting—Watson struck three or four blows, and the prisoner ran and got a handspike—afterwards he put the handspike down, and they went to fight<lb></lb>ing with their fists—I did not see that Watson had been stabbed—after this fight, Watson wanted to fight another man.</p>

He after<lb></lb>wards laid wait for me with a belaying pin behind him. He said he had a great mind to kill me; I told the second mate, who came on deck at the time, about it. I had been eating some ham and bread, and was picking my teeth with a knife when I went on board.</p>

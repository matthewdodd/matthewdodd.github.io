I am a dairyman at 13, Barry Street, Great Russell Street—on Saturday, August 2nd, at 9.30 p.m., the prisoners came in and O'Connor asked for a glass of milk and tendered me a bad florin—Norris asked the price of a glass of cream—I broke the florin in my tester, went round to O'Connor and asked him if he had any more money about him—he said "What is that to do with you?"—Policeman 471 E came in and gave me instructions and I gave him the bad florin and fetched Policeman 155 A—Norris struggled with him and they both fell down in the shop and when they got up Policeman 155 A showed me a florin which I found was bad—I heard something drop, but could not swear whether it was the coin or the policeman's hat.</p>

            . I am wife of John Surman - the prisoner was in my service in 1824, and was frequently at my house, once or twice a week in 1826; these articles are mine - I missed them in 1826, with a great many other things - I swear to them; there is my own writing on the table-cloth; and I know the knives and forks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has she been employed by you since 1826? A. No: she was at my house on the 24th of March, but not with my knowledge; I was present when part of the property was found in her room; some of the knives and forks were on the table - I know one knife by having broken it; I lost some of the knives in 1825.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker; I have a tablecloth and two towels pawned on the 17th of July last; they are marked in the prisoner's own name and her husband's, I am sure she is the person who pawned them; the prosecutrix said her name has been picked out, but there is no appearance of that; she then said she could swear to the hemming, but many females work in the same way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she not claim a great many more things? A. Yes; I thought she would swear to all I had got.</p>
               <p>MRS. SURMAN. Here is the place on the table-cloth where my husband's name was; it has been picked out; the name of Surman was marked in full - there were several other things at the pawnbroker's which I could have sworn to.</p>

            . I bought this table-cloth of the prisoner; it was marked B. H. L. - I never altered it.</p>
               <p>MRS. SURMAN. I know this table-cloth; I sewed it instead of hemming it - I have another of the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you have all these things in 1825? A. Not the small green-handled knives and forks: the prisoner came to me on the 24th of February. and left on the 1st of May, 1824; her sister then came to me and left in August, 1826, and the prisoner came to char for me that year; I never gave the sister anything; but I have given the prisoner some old bed-furniture, baby-linen, and other things; the mark has been picked out of this table-cloth; there was some of the marking cotton on it when I found it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When were the table-cloths marked? A. That I cannot say; the whole of the three were bought in 1825; the mark of the thread cannot be washed out: I missed them in 1825 - the prisoner's sister left me in disgrace in 1826: I should rather suspect her than the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that some of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100098"></xptr>the things were given her by her sister, and others by the prosecutrix. <rs id="t18280410-201-verdict1075" type="verdictDescription">

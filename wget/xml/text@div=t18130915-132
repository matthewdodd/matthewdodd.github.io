I lost my eighteen-penny piece in the night on the 20th of July; the prisoner slept with me, I lost money at different times; I marked my money before I went to bed; I went into the room about five o'clock; I looked at my clothes; I saw they had been moved; I said to the prisoner that I had lost money out of my pocket; I must see whether he had it; he said, he had not; he took some halfpence out of his pocket; my eighteen penny-piece was among them; he went to work that day; at night I gave him into the charge of an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he been in custody ever since the 20th of July - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that eighteen-penny piece was in your pocket - A. Yes; I did not mark it; I took particular notice of it, and the mark upon it.</p>

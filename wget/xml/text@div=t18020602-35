             sworn. - I am shopman to Thomas Moore: On the 18th of May, about a quarter after eight, the prisoner came into the shop with a man, to buy a pair of shoes; William Rumbold, the apprentice, served her with the shoes, for which she was to give three shillings; the prisoner pretended she had lost one shilling; she left one shilling, and said she would come again for the shoes; she then produced sixpence more in halfpence, which I gave to the apprentice; while he was looking at it, she went out of the shop, and left the man in it; there were a great number of shoes near the door; and, in consequence of a fire in the neighbourhood, I ordered the lad to take the shoes in; I then observed the prisoner outside the shop, leaning upon the window; I desired the boy to keep an eye upon her; a neighbour then came into the shop, and said, Saunders, come here, and look at this woman's petticoats; upon which I looked at her, and observed a great coat, which I took from under her petticoats; she said it was none of our coat; she clapped her hand upon her knees, and said, I should not take it from her, for it was none of our coat; the man absconded; I sent for an officer, and delivered up the coat and the prisoner; the great coat had been hanging outside the door before the alarm of fire.(Thomas Hubbard, a headoorough, produced the great coat, which was identified by Saunders.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I picked it up at some distance from this man's house; it was lying upon the ground. GUILTY, aged 38.</p>

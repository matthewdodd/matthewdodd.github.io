MORRIS, his assistant, on being called, were informed by the Court, that if they had attended on the field, knowing a duel was going to take place, for the purpose of giving surgical assistance, should it be necessary, they were liable to a criminal prosecution themselves and that they were therefore at liberty to refuse being examined in this case.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you give any account of the conversation, that may have passed between you, inform us if he believed himself in danger - A. He believed himself in danger, but not dying. He was told his wound was not necessarily mortal - he entertained hopes of recovery, Mr. Guthrie told him he might recover - he was not under immediate apprehension of death. He died from the wound of a bullet in the right side; the ball passed through the body, and lodged under the skin on the other side.</p>

On the evening of the 16th of February, two gentlemen, whom I did not know, came to my house; they staid there twenty minutes, or more, they went out towards Hampstead-road, in about half an hour an alarm was given. I sent some men to the field to give assistance - Mr. Scott was brought to my house on a door. I knew Mr. Patmore perfectly well; he came with the wounded gentleman, and continued three or four hours, I believe, and attended Mr. Scott very frequently from that time till his death, and appeared very much affected.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Did you know Mr. Patmore before - A. I have known him twelve years. I do not know what passed in the field, nor when Mr. Patmore joined Mr. Scott; the first time I saw him was when he came to my house - Dr. Darling attended Mr. Scott.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On the evening of the 16th of February, I was at Mr. Watson's; an alarm was given of a gentleman being wounded - I and Ryan went to assist in bringing him in. On entering the field, I saw four or five gentlemen - I saw Mr. Patmore there; they were standing ten or twelve yards from Mr. Scott, who lay on the ground alone - he was brought to Mr. Watson's on a door. When I got to the field, I was desired to fetch a door, which I did, and the gentlemen assisted him on it, and took him to the house - nothing was said in Mr. Patmore's presence.</p>

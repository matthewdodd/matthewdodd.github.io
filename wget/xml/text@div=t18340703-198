            . I am the wife of Abraham Stillwell - we live in Little Ormond-yard - I sent my daughter to sell some rags once, but never to sell any socks, or stockings, or petticoats - I missed a great many articles at different times - these are some of them.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH STILLWELL, Jun. I am the prosecutrix's daughter - I took the all these articles to the prisoner's, at different times - I took them from my mother - I asked the prisoner if she would buy them; she said yes, and as many more as I pleased - she keeps a shop in Liquor Pond-street, and buys all sorts of things - I went there twelve or thirteen times - she gave me one penny a pair for these socks, and two-pence or three-pence a piece for these flannel petticoats.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How came you first to go to the woman's? A. My mother first sent me to sell some rags - I did not tell her that my mother had sent these socks, as they were very moth-eaten - the prisoner said they were moth-eaten - I said I knew it - I do not know why - the prisoner did not give me 2d. a pair for these socks, only 1d. - I am fourteen years old - my eldest brother is ten or eleven - he went to the prisoner's shop also - I do not know how he came to go there - I did not think whether I was doing any harm - I bought cakes with the money - I have not been to any other shop but the prisoner's to sell things - she lives nearly half-a-mile from my mother's - I do not know that there is such a shop as the prisoner's nearer to my mother's - my mother did not tell me what shop to go to, when I took the rags to sell.</p>

             (police-serjeant G 11). I went to the prisoner, and asked if she had ever bought any thing of this girl - she said, "No" - I found these things there, and took her to Hatton-garden - she then said she had bought some socks of this girl.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH STILLWELL. I had been to the prisoner's shop the day before, and saw a flannel-petticoat and a pincloth outside the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they not publicity exposed? A. Yes - the pin-cloth has been sold - I send my little boy out on errands - I do not know how he found his way to the prisoner's - I never sent him there, nor this girl either - these petticoats are worth 6d. or 1s. a-piece - I sent this girl to sell the rags about Christmas - I never sent the boy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The girl said her mother had got several moths in the house, as her father was a smith, and her mother thought she had better dispose of them - I put them up for sale every day - I gave the girl 6d. or 8d. a-piece for the petticoats, and 2d. a pair for the socks.</p>

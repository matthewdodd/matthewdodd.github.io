            . I am a watchman. On my last calling the hour at Upper Gower mews; I saw Mr. Clark; I saw the prisoner go into Mr. Kemshin's yard and shut the gate after him; I looked through the cracks of the fence, I saw him measuring other pieces of timber with a hook in his hand; he came out of the yard, saw me standing, he went down Francis-street, looked up at a public house; I was desired to pull my coat off. I watched him into Mr. Kemshin's yard again. I went to Bedford nursery-place, there I saw three pieces of timber lay; I saw the prisoner coming; I secreted myself; I saw him carry the three pieces of timber by turns to another house, he left the timber there and went to Mr. Kemshin's yard; I watched him in and out of the yard; he brought another piece of timber to the three-pieces. I then met with Mr. Clark; he took the prisoner that morning. The timber is in the Yard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man of the name of Garrod was building a house in Southampton-place, he asked me to lend him some boards for scaffolding; I said I would see what I could do. This was on the Thursday. On the Friday I took the four-pieces and laid them near the house he was building; I took a memorandum in my book that the same pieces should be returned. I was no ways interested; I did it to serve the man as a friend.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

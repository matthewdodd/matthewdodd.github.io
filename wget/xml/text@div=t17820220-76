               <p>Court. Had you any suspicion of her when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200092"></xptr> she came into your shop? - No; I saw it fall, the check fell of the side shew, it was thirty-one yards, I thought it was an accident; (the check produced and deposed to by the Prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Jury. How many pieces of check did you shew? - Two.</p>
               <p>How happened it you did not go round and take up the check? - I never saw the prisoner stoop, I had no suspicion, she looked a hard working young woman.</p>
               <p>Court. How could she take this check without stooping? - I did not perceive her stoop, which way she took it or which way she dropped it I do not know, she touched none of her cloaths.</p>
               <p>It might be kicked by her into the street? - No, my lord, she had got near a hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Jury. How far was the prisoner when she was looking at the checks, from the door? - Half the distance between you and me.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was not the check loose at one end? - No, it was tied at both ends; my master told me the woman had stolen some check who had been in the shop, I stopped the first woman I met, it was about a hundred yards, my master came and took the prisoner, I saw the check fall from her, I believe it fell from under her apron.</p>
               <p>No defence called.</p>
               <p>No witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court. This is a very severe law, the check may be all holes, you may value it under five shillings.</p>

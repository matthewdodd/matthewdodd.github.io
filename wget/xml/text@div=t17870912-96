               <p>What had he done to displease him? - Nothing that I know of.</p>
               <p>As you are so nearly related to the deceased, be careful what you say; it is your duty to tell the truth, but nothing more: If this man deserves punishment he ought to suffer it, but recollect there are a great many witnesses who were present besides you. - I will tell the truth as near as I can.</p>
               <p>What was the first thing you saw of any dispute between Weston and the deceased? - No other than Mr. Weston began to pull him about; and pull him into the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Was that without any provocation from your husband? - Yes, I saw nothing else; after he had dragged him into the tap-room, one Bolton held me across the stomach and breast, and said damme, if you stir, I will knock you down.</p>
               <p>Then you did not see what passed in the tap-room? - No Sir, I saw nothing after that.</p>

               <p>Be careful what you say, because Parker is here and several other witnesses: Was not there a dispute between Parker and the deceased before? - I will not swear there was or was not.</p>
               <p>Don't you know? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you swear that any thing hindered you from hearing or seeing? - I do not know what passed before I went in.</p>
               <p>After you went in was there any dispute between Parker and your husband? - I heard no dispute.</p>
               <p>Then Weston did not interpose to prevent Parker and the deceased from quarrelling? - I don't know, I am sure.</p>
               <p>I ask you as to the whole of what passed in your presence? - No Sir, I did not see Weston till he came in, and pulled my husband into the tap-room.</p>
               <p>He did not tell them he would have no disturbance in his house? - Not to my knowledge, he did not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not the deceased strike the landlord in the face and knock him backwards? - I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Before the landlord touched him? - No Sir, that I did not.</p>

               <p>Was there any thing to prevent your seeing all that passed after you came, and before he got hold of your husband? - I went in just as he had got hold of my husband.</p>
               <p>Had he hold of your husband when you first went in? - No.</p>
               <p>How long after that was it he had hold of your husband? - Not long after it.</p>

               <p>Did he strike Weston at all before he went into the tap-room? - I did not see that he did.</p>

             the landlord was coming from the back room adjoining to the tap-room, some words passed between the deceased and Mr. Weston, the words were, that they were not afraid of each other, after that they came together in the tap-room, and they kept striving to come at each other at the time, but there was a person or two between them.</p>
               <p>Who were they? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Were they striving to fight? - That I cannot tell; they were striving to get together.</p>
               <p>Had you any thought they were striving to get together to fight? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Did they get together in your sight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In what manner? - Mr. Weston came from the other room, the deceased was in the tap-room, and Mr. Weston was coming from the back parlour at the time, but he was not got into the tap-room at the time, then Mr. Weston came into the tap-room, and they came together in a scuffle.</p>
               <p>Who struck first? - I saw no blow, it was a fall; I saw no blow struck by either of them.</p>
               <p>Did both fall? - Both fell at that time; in recovering again, the landlord seized the deceased again.</p>
               <p>Did they both get up? - Yes; and then Weston threw the deceased again close by the fire-side in the tap-room; the deceased<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120144"></xptr>cried out that his leg was broke; after that, Mr. Weston struck him several blows on the head and the upper part of the body; after that, I went on purpose to fetch a surgeon, after I had fetched him, I went home.</p>

             the second time, and cried that his leg was broke, did you immediately perceive whether it was or not? - Not directly at the time, afterwards I perceived it was; his leg struck across a large sender in the tap-room.</p>

               <p>Were you at this house when this unfortunate affair happened? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening did Cuit the deceased come in? - Between ten and eleven at night; it might be about twenty minutes after ten; he used me very ill, and shoved me about from one part of the kitchen to the other; he asked me if I would be a pint along with him, I said I would have no more beer; one word brought up another, and he said he had a light guinea of mine, I said, whatever you lose by it I will return you the money when you come to my house; he began to fly in a passion, and wanted to fight with me, and more than that, he said, I should not walk along Old-street; he shoved me about from one part of the room to another, and he tried to wring my nose two or three times.</p>
               <p>Where was the landlord at the time? - He came into the kitchen and desired peace; he said he would not have his customers ill used; and said to the deceased, the last time you was in my house, you cheated me of a pint of beer; at that minute in came Mrs. Cuitt; while they were talking about that, one word brought up another, and they began talking about scholarship.</p>
               <p>Had any blows passed before that? - No, Sir, none at all.</p>
               <p>What happened after she came in? - She came in one of her flying airs as she often did in public-houses, and began black-guarding me, and he immediately began upon the landlord and knocked him down with his head upon the fender; he hit him just in the jaws and cut his lip.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was that the first blow struck? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that is the truth upon the oath you have taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who was present beside Cuit's wife? - There was a man and his wife in the room, but I never saw them before or since.</p>
               <p>Was it the man and his wife that were examined before the coroner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any body present besides them? - Not in that room, the other room door stood open; I had got my bricklayers and labourers in the tap room at the time.</p>
               <p>Then there was nobody in the room at the time but you, Holt and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Cuit, and the landlord? - No, that was all.</p>
               <p>After he had knocked the landlord down, what passed? - He got up and went to put Cuit out of the door, and both Cuit and his wife laid hold of him, she laid hold of him by the hair of his head and held him down, while he beat him, and Cuitt struck him while she was holding him by the hair.</p>
               <p>What happened afterwards? - Then they got entangled together, till they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120145"></xptr>came into the tap-room, and there they engaged themselves together, and entangled themselves together; I cannot say who was liablest to fall, but Cuit happened to fall undermost, after they both met together, they entangled one with the other, and Cuit happened to fall, and he said, his leg was broke; I believe it was an old wound; Weston ordered a chair to be fetched for him.</p>
               <p>It turned out in fact, that his leg was broke? - Yes, Sir, he was sent to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Did the landlord strike him after he was down? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that; can you say that with certainty? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Then he was sent to the hospital? - Yes, there was a coach fetched, but he was carried on a shutter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. If I understand you right, Weston received the first blow? - He did.</p>
               <p>Where was he standing at the time? - About four foot from the fire-place, with his hands in his breeches pockets.</p>
               <p>Then the deceased struck him upon the lip, and knocked him down with his head upon the sender? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After that there was a struggle, and a fall? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Before the struggle and fall, Mrs. Cuit laid hold of his hair? - Yes, I knew them both well; his wife has slept at my house for fear of his killing her.</p>
               <p>What sort of a man was the deceased? - He was a very quarrelsome man when in liquor; a very quiet man when sober.</p>
               <p>Is Weston quiet or quarrelsome? - I never saw any thing of him, than that of being a quiet man; I would not use his house, if he did not use me civilly; I always pay my men there.</p>

               <p>I am one of the surgeons of St. Bartholomew's hospital; I remember the deceased being brought to the hospital on the 2d of July, about twenty minutes before one on the Sunday morning; he was brought on a board, and I was desired to look at his leg; I examined him and found a dislocation of the ancle, with a fracture of the small bone; I examined it very minutely, and I told his friends it would be mortal.</p>

               <p>On what did you ground that opinion? - From the nature of the fracture of the small bone; though a dislocation of the ancle is certainly not in itself a mortal accident; a compound dislocation of the ancle is generally a mortal accident.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by that? - Where there is a large fracture beside; the bones we call the tibia &amp; timpana, were broken.</p>
               <p>In what manner was the wound; describe that? - The wound was circular.</p>
               <p>By which bone? - By the tibia.</p>
               <p>That was in consequence of the dislocation? - Yes, it had been so violent as to break the small bone; had it been so as to force the large bone out of its place, it would have been what we call an Astragulus.</p>
               <p>How do you mean, an external wound? - Yes, and being so violent as to force the bone through the flesh and the skin, the bone was quite out.</p>
               <p>Then it forced the large bone out through the flesh and the skin? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You apprehended danger immediately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>From the violence of the accident? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The danger you apprehended was a mortification? - I apprehended that would come on in three or four days.</p>
               <p>Would not amputation prevent that? - I have seen them amputated, but I spoke to Mr. Lock concerning it, and he said he would not do any thing, for he could not save his life.</p>
               <p>When was that? - On the Monday I went for him; he said he would not take off his leg for that it would certainly mortify; as he never saw one but what did.</p>
               <p>Then there are not many instances where the bone and the flesh is shattered and mangled to pieces, which immediate amputation would cure? - Some, my Lord; but in compound dislocation, I never saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120146"></xptr>it; I have seen a good many, but I never saw it in compound dislocation.</p>
               <p>Can you explain at all, why if the part injured is immediately amputated, whether the dislocation in that case makes any difference? - No further than this, an inflammation generally takes hold of the whole system; if amputation is deferred, the stump will probably mortify.</p>
               <p>Did this mortify? - An inflammation came on, and that was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Then the injury done to his leg, was, in fact, the actual occasion of his death? - That I believe, my lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Must not the foot have catched somewhere to have caught this wrench? - I should think most likely it did.</p>
               <p>A dislocation of the ancle, generally produces a fracture of the small bone? - I never saw one without.</p>
               <p>Of course when the bone is out of the socket, the large bone, which you call the tibia, that of course almost always breaks the small bones? - Yes.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. Were there any appearances of an old wound on his leg? - No.</p>
               <p>A dislocation when once set, leaves no mark? - No.</p>

               <p>As I was coming from White-cross-street, going home up Old-street, by the Falstast, I heard the cry of murder; I went in, and saw Weston and the deceased having some words, coming out of the back room, they had hold of one another, and the deceased came out first; they was having words; Weston said he was as good a man as the deceased; and the deceased said he was as good a man as Weston; when they came into the tap-room, they had not been there long, before Weston laid hold of the deceased, threw him down and fell at top of him; then they got up again, and as soon as they were both got up, Weston seized him again, and threw him down again; and when he threw him down the second time, he cried out my leg is broke; Weston then ran at him, catched him by the hair of his head, and struck him several blows with his right hand, till such time as I laid hold of him, and pulled him back, and called him a villain for so doing, and he asked me what I had to do with it.</p>
               <p>Did they put you out of the door? - Yes, after that.</p>
               <p>Had you any acquaintance with either of them before; I never saw any of them to my knowledge; I was quite a stranger; I staid out some few minutes, and some people knocked at the door, and then I went in again.</p>
               <p>Then the accident was over? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. There was no blow struck at all by any body before the falls? - Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>The deceased was undermost both times? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Do you know this public-house, the Falstaff? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who keeps it? - Weston.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Cuit's coming in there? - I was present at the time he came in.</p>
               <p>Tell us what happened? - When he first came in, he asked Mr. Parker to drink a pint of beer; Mr. Parker said no; then he had some words with Mr. Parker, and shoved him, and threated to wring his nose; then Mr. Weston came into the room, and he and Mr. Weston had some few words together; then he took and knocked Mr. Weston down.</p>
               <p>Had Weston struck him at all? - No, not at this time; then the woman came in at the time Weston was down, and caught hold of his hair, and the deceased struck him; then they both fell down together; then they were parted, and the woman was taken away; then he was very much in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120147"></xptr>liquor, and went into the front room, and they both fell down together, and he cried out his leg was broke, and there was assistance got immediately.</p>
               <p>Now, did the landlord strike him when he was down? - I never saw him strike him when he was down; I must have seen it if he had.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you say that after the first quarrel, Cuit struck Weston, and the woman laid hold of him by the hair? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then they were parted and went into the tap-room? - They were parted, and then this man was very much in liquor, and he got hold of Mr. Weston.</p>
               <p>Who laid hold first in the tap-room? - Mr. Cuit.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am sure he took hold of him first in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>The prisoner's counsel called four other witnesses, who gave the prisoner the character of an industrious, humane, good-natured, tender-hearted man.</p>

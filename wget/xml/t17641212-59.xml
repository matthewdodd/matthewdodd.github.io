I said, yes: the boy boldly said, you lost five quarter guineas, half a guinea, and a shilling: he said he stole it: I asked him how he durst come in to steal it? he fell a laughing: the man said, there were three more of them at Justice Fielding's, and this little boy was admitted evidence, and desired me to go to Sir John: I went there, and saw the prisoner and two others tied together; there the boy said to the prisoner, Give the woman the purse: then the prisoner pulled this purse out of his waistcoat pocket, and gave it to me: (produced in court).

            . I am going in the 16th year of my age: the prisoner came out of Tothill-fields Bridewell, on a Thursday, and he went along with me on the Friday, to this shop, in St. Clement's parish; he opened the door, and I kneeled down and went in on my hands and knees to the till, and took the gold out, as she has mentioned, and a shilling: I left the till on the ground; we divided the money going along: we went to the Black horse in St. Giles's Ruins.</p>
               <p>Q. What share of the money had you?</p>
               <p>Mackrill. I had half a guinea, a quarter guinea, and a share of another quarter guinea, half a crown, and three half-pence; he had the purse. We kept company till we were taken, which was the Monday following: we had a gold lac'd hat upon us, and were both taken up in Mynard-street, by St. Giles's: when we went to Mr. Fielding, I told him of this affair:

            . I took up the prisoner, evidence, and another, all together, in a house in St. Giles's; there is a bill found against the third person at Hicks's Hall, for stealing the hat. The evidence told the whole affair before the Justice.</p>

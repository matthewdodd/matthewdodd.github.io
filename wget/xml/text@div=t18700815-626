I am 15 years of age, and live at 212, Green Street, Bethnal Green—I was passing by this confectioner's in Lombard Street, between 11 and 12 o'clock, and saw the prisoner with a basket of sponges—I saw him run out of a shop, and saw a steel chain between his fingers—he ran up the street—I went into the shop and saw a lady, and afterwards I went out in search of the prisoner—I have seen him about before, and am quite sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in St. Paul's Church-yard, and and a comb and brush maker. On the 21st of December, at half-past four o'clock the prisoner came, and said he had called for some brushes which were to be there ready for Mr. Wilson, of Tottenham—I inquired, and none.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the shop boy. The prisoner had six brushes for Mr. Willson—I went with them to Clement's-inn, at the corner of the Old Bailey—there was a cart standing with "T. Young, Enfield-carrier" on it—the prisoner took them from my hand, threw them into the cart said it was all right, and I came way.</p>

On the evening of the 21st of December, I was serving in the shop, and the prisoner brought these brushes in to pledge—I asked what he was—he said, "A hawker"—and seeing them very good brushes, I suspected they were stolen—I said if he was a hawker, why should the brushes have Mr. Hassell's name on them—he then said he was a brush-maker, and had a large connection, and if he could not make enough, he had them of Mr. Hassell—he said his brother was outside with the Walthamstow cart.</p>

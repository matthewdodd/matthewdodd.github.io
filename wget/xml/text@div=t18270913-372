               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had I any salary? A. No - you had your board and lodging, and sometimes a little money; you may have had money of mine two or three days in your possession, but not to my knowledge - he never told me of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not come by on one Saturday night, and say, I had some money, and you told me to keep it a few days longer? A. I believe it was so.</p>

               <p>MR. WHITBOURN. He never accounted to me for this money - he did not come back on the Saturday. I found him in the watch-house at Richmond on the Sunday - he had been taken up with a female by a friend of mine.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I came to London, not having any thing to do, I became a sort of clerk to the prosecutor, for which I was to have board and lodging - I. of course, looked out for something better. I frequently went and collected money, and retained it in my possession a few days. After receiving this money, I heard of some private business, and went to Richmond, intending to return and account for his money, and on the way there, wanting money, I used part of it. I was captured there the same night, and on my return, the prosecutor refused to wait at my house while I could have the money made up.</p>
               <p>MR. WHITBOURN. He did not ask me to wait at his house for the money to be made up.</p>

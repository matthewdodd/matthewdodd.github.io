                  </hi> I am a clerk, and live at 184, King's Road, Chelsea—I was in College Street, Chelsea, about eleven o'clock on 25th June—a woman came up and spoke to me, and I told her to go away—I crossed the road into King's Road and was grasped round the throat—I heard some man call out, "Be quiet, or you will be heard"—it was one of the men that had got hold of me—I was struck on the nose, which made it bleed—I was a good deal hurt about the throat—I had some loose silver in the tail pocket of my coat, and my keys—after they had robbed me they threw me back and ran away—one afterwards passed me again, running, and made a blow at me, which did not strike me—I jumped</p>

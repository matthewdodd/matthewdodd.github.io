I was applied to by a witness, and accompanied him to the City-road about nine or ten o'clock—I saw a cart, and the prisoner in it, opposite the Green Gate—I ordered an officer to lead the cart to the station—I watched on one side of the cart, and I directed an officer to watch on the other—they took the cart along Bath-street, and I saw the prisoner lean over the cart, and beat the horse with her clenched fist several times—I then saw her put her hand under the horse's tail, and from it I saw a small black parcel drop—I called sergeant Harvey's attention to it—I saw it opened at the station, and twenty-six counterfeit shillings were in it.</p>

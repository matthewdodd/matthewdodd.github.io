The Prisoner was a walking in the Yard, I pull'd out my Purse with 10 l. in it, to pay 3 s. 6 d. I was very much fuddled, and Mrs. Loveday advis'd me to go into a back Room and take a Nap. I went in and sat down in a Chair close by the Bed side, and fell a sleep. The Prisoner came in and took the Purse out of my Pocket as I suppose, for I waked and saw her just as she was going out of the Room. I got up, and walked about the Room for a quarter of an Hour, till I was throughly waked, and then taking out my Purse, I mist about 10 l though I have laid the Indictment but for 5 Guineas, being willing rather to charge less than more. I enquired for Lucy, but she was gone home, for she Lodged over the way, and only came a <rs id="t17260711-71-deflabel311" type="occupation">Charing</rs>

Well I came again on Monday and then too I can't say but I was a little in for it. But howsoever I saw Lucy a standing at her Mothers Door in a new Suit of Cloths as fine as any thing for she got her a Husband in about 10 hours after my Pocket was Pick'd. Ah Lucy! Lucy! thinks I. that Husband that wedding Ring, and them new Cloths were all bought with my Mercy ye wicked Jade you' Not that I ever had any thing to do with her neither - But in I goes to Mrs. Loveday, and sits, me down and by and by in comes a Neighbour, and says, There's Lucy yonder has gotten a great deal of Money, and had hardly a Penny to help her the other Day, 'tis well if she come honestly by it. Iy says I, so it is, for I am afraid it came out of my Pocket, And so I e'en up and told them the whole Story.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Loveday thus depos'd The Prosecutor came fuddled to my House on Thursday, and Lucy was then a washing. This is a pretty Girl says he. I'd fain have to hire her for a Servant. Aye says I, if you'll pay her Wages. Well, says he, I'll give her a Shilling Earnest, whether you agree to it or no. Take the Money Lucy, says I, and to she did, and then he kiss'd her. He came again the next Day, and then he was fuddled too. He having occasion to take out his Purse, I saw that he had Gold and Silver in it. I advis'd him to go in and Sleep, he took Lucy by the Hand, and would have her go in with him; Well go Girl, says I, and sit down with him, be'll be a sleep presently, and then you may come away. She went, and they drank a Bottle of Sider together, and then came out again; But she went in 2 or 3 times after he was a sleep, though I call'd her away several times, and ask'd her what she did there. On the Monday following, when he first complain'd that he had lost his Money, I went over the way and told her, that I heard she had taken the Money from him. No says she, I had is of my Husband, be borrow'd it, and gave Security for it.</p>

             thus depos'd. On Friday Night, the Prisoner, and her Mother, and Brother, were at my House drinking plentifully, a Baker was in the same Room too, who had formerly been her fellow Servant: Her Mother said, that her Daughter Lucy had got a small Legacy left her.</p>
               <p>- Brook the Watchman thus depos'd. I saw the Prisoner at Mr. Mackgwyers House. She went to the Door where the Baker stood, and ask'd him if he'd go and be Married, and he answer'd Yes. with all my heart, and so between 4 and 5 in the Morning, away they went to the Fleet, and I with them, and there I saw them Married together. I saw 2 or 3 Guineas, and some Silver in her Hand, but she desired me not to speak of it.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made her Defence. Mrs. Loveday desired me to go into the back Room, and drink with the Prosecutor. I did, and came away in half an hour, but she push'd me in again, and shut the Door, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172607110008"></xptr> was very rude with me, she carried me to meet him in a Coach about 11 at Night, and he gave me that Shilling to meet him at another place, but because I would not do as he would have had me, therefore he charg'd me with picking his Pocket.

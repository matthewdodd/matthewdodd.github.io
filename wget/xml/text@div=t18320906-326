I went to Fairlop-fair on a Sunday in July, and on my way there I found a cloak and two handkerchiefs - I went round the fair, and asked several persons if they owned them, but nobody did - next day the prisoner came up to me at the corner of <placeName id="t18320906-326-crimeloc1848">Winfield-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18320906-326-crimeloc1848" type="placeName" value="Winfield-street"></interp>

I said, "A cloak;" he said, "Come with me, and let me look at it;" he took me into a public-house, and said,"What will you take for this cloak?" I said 30s. - he did not say what he would give; I went out - he called me in again, and said, "Let me have a look at it;" another man came in - they look it from under my arm; the other held it up, and ran out at the door, saying, "I will take it up and show it to him," and when I wanted to go out after him, the prisoner went from one side of the door to the other, and prevented me going out - at last he let me go; I said, "Where is he gone?" he said, "Where the hell do I know;" he then went, and pretended to make water; he kept hitting me on the head with a stick and said, "If you say I took it I will break your b-y head;" I gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. What day did you go to the fair? A. On Sunday; I went for the purpose of going to the fair - I was in the employ of Mr. Williams, of Finch-lane, and am so still; I worked for him at Whittington's alms-houses - I live with my father in Horse Shoe-alley, Bishopsgate-street - I am going on for fifteen years old; I was never in custody - I was once accused of stealing bacon, and was discharged - I was once taken to Worship-street about some wood; I never told Chiddy and Smith that I myself had stolen the cloak and handkerchiefs from a gentleman's chaise at Fairlop-fair.</p>

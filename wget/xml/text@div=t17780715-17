I met him and told him I was sorry to find him such a man as he was; that I had found a great many things of mine in his house. He said he took the locks to repair; and when he had repaired them he meant to return them. I asked him if I had ever given him them to repair; he then said no; that he was very sorry for it, and hoped I would forgive him.</p>

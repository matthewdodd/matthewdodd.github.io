            . I live in Union-row, Hackney. On the 2d of September, about twenty minutes before two o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another man coming from Mr. Routh's - about forty yards from the house; I stopped them coming up an avenue; the other man had nine ducks- he ran, and dropped them; I took up the ducks, but he escaped - the prisoner stopped, put his hand into his bosom and drew out something; I had desired them to stop - the prisoner said "What is the matter," and then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110110"></xptr>drew this from his bosom; I followed the other man some distance, and the prisoner went towards Hackney - I lost the other man in a nursery-ground; he dropped the ducks in a field, and I took them up - that was about one hundred yards from where the prisoner and him had, been together: I took the ducks to Mr. Routh, and then went to the watch-house, where I saw the prisoner in custody, and am certain of his person - the moon shone full in his face; he was so near to me that I could have touched him- I can speak confidently to him from his features, and the manner in which his handkerchief was tied: when I went to the house, Mr. Routh came to the window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If I were as near to him as he says I was, why did not he take me? Witness. I wanted the man with the ducks; I knew my brother watchman would take him from the sound of my rattle - what he drew out appeared to be a pistol.</p>

            . I live in Homerton-row, and am a watchman. On Tuesday morning, I was on my beat, near the Paragon; I heard the rattle, and went on towards Homerton-terrace - I met the prisoner there, about one hundred yards from Mr. Routh's; I asked if he heard a rattle - he did not answer at first, but then said No; I asked where his ears could be - he seemed much agitated and wanting breath; I took hold of him and took him to the watch-house - Rowles came in and pointed out the prisoner as soon as he saw him.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Routh. I had seen the ducks safe in the hen-house between six and seven o'clock; I went again at ten and heard the noise of the ducks - between one and two the next morning I heard they were gone; I went to the hen-house, and the whole nine were gone - I saw them again, and knew they were the same as had been in the hen-house.</p>

               <p>COURT to JOHN ROWLES. Q. Did the prisoner and the other man appear to be in company. A. Yes - they were as close as they could be.</p>

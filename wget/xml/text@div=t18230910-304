After soap is manufactured, it is put into the store-room; in consequence of suspicion, I employed two officers to watch: he occupied two rooms in my house. On the 30th of July, I ascertained the quantity of soap in the store-room. I reckoned 38 cakes to a cwt., and by that calculation, there were 2 l cwt.; I ordered him to deliver 6 1/4 cwt. to a customer; only a labourer, myself, and him had access to the soap. The labourers were under his controul. The soap was moist on the evening of the 29th - it was then all correct; he was to deliver out the 6 1/4 cwt. On the 30th, the officers took him into custody; on that day I went with them into his room; I found eight cakes of soap on the floor, between the bed and wall; it was moist, similar to the pile; I went to the store-room, and found eight cakes deficient.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When had the pile been manufactured - A. I cannot exactly say; I think not a fortnight or three weeks - there might be two or three tons weight made. I sold Mr. Freeman 56 lbs. of each; the prisoner said it was the residue of a 1/4 of cwt. he had bought of Freeman; he bought soap of me occasionally; there was a closet in his room, where he might have hid it. I had Freeman apprehended.</p>

            . I was directed to watch the prisoner and took him in charge on Wednesday, the 30th of July; and told him under what circumstances I came, and asked him if I should find any soap there? He said I should; he has two rooms over the warehouse. He said, he bought the soap of Freeman; I found eleven cakes piled together, between the bed and wall - the bed was two feet from the wall - it resembled the pile in size, appearance, and moisture.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They went to inquire if I had it of Freeman; I said, I had the soap, it was part of a 1/4 of cwt. which I bought the week preceding of Freeman; I was detained while the prosecutor went to inquire at Freeman's.</p>

               <p>FREEMAN. I am a tallow-chandler, and live in Wilson-street, Finsbury. On the 23d of July, I bought 1/4 a cwt. of soap of Mote; and on the 25th, sold the prisoner a 1/4 of cwt. of it. I believe the soap to be part of the same.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. He was servant to a soap-maker - A. Yes, I have sold him several 1/4 cwts.; I charged him 2 s. more on a cwt. than I gave; I do not sell soap for less than I give. I remember offering a cwt. at 1 s. less, when I wanted money to make up a bill. I will not swear that I have not sold some to Cook, of Union-street. I never sold soap to a man named Cook.</p>

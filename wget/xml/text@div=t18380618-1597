                  </hi>. I am an accountant in the licensing de<lb></lb>partment of the Excise-office. I have examined the licences granted for the last three years—there is no person of the name of Potts licensed for any premises—we have the name of Mitchell, but not for that house—I believe licences are never granted but to housekeepers, and persons paying poor-rates.</p>

Q.</hi> Is it the practice for a person applying for a licence to have a printed form, signed by the surveyor, who inquires into the cir. cumstances of the party? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Mr. Cramer is one of our out-door officers—he would be authorised to inquire into references and sign the papers—I should presume that he is surveyor of Hackney—if he has signed any paper I am not aware of it—I should think this is his signature to this paper—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City policeman. On 1st Feb. I was on duty in plain clothes, and about half past 8 o'clock in the evening I saw the prisoner in company with Mr. Brown, in King William-street—I passed by them sufficiently close to see that the prisoner was the person—I saw them pass the corner of Arthur-street west, and I saw a man watching them very attentively—they went down into Thames-street, and went into Old Swanlane—they went down about ten paces, and when I was within five yards of them I saw the prisoner leave the gentleman, and she said, "You brute, you want to ill use me you do?"—I stopped her, and took her into custody—I had not seen any appearance of ill usage at all—I called after Mr. Brown—he did not stop at the time, but ultimately he came hack—I saw the prisoner put her left arm quite through her muff, and I distinctly saw her drop this canvass bag—she was in a stooping position—four shillings fell out of the bag, I picked them up, and placed them in the hag—the bag contained 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I showed the bag and money, and some papers that were in it to Mr. Brown, and he identified them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Peckham Rye, and am a ware-houseman in Cheapside. On the evening of 1st Feb. I saw the prisoner in King William-street, I walked some distance with her, and got into Thames-street, I turned down a lane, which I afterwards understood was Old Swan-lane—she asked me in King William-street to go home with her—I declined</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280051"></xptr>
               <p>to do so—I was going to my omnibus to get to Peckham Rye, but she continued pressing me, and I believe I said, "Well, I don't mind giving you something to drink to get rid of you"—I offered to take her into Ganney's, which is nearly opposite Arthur-street; but she declined it, saying it was such a public place to go in, and site asked me if I was going to give her anything to drink, would I mind going down that street to a more quiet house—of course by that, J understood a public house—that was the reason I went with her—when we got in the lane, I said, "Where are you taking me?"—she said, "That is the place"—pointing to a house at the end, having a lamp over the door—she began to stop me, and I asked her what the meant by stopping me—I said, "Now make haste if you are going to have anything, have it and have done with it"—she did not seem inclined to move any further—she began fumbling about me, I said, "None of that," and I left her—she said some words that I wanted to ill use her, and I thought she had somebody near her, more especially as I had seen the shade of some one near me—a person then put his hand on my arm, and I walked very quickly away—he said, "You have been robbed, I am an officer"—he showed me my purse—I had last seen it in Sweeting's shop in Cheapside.</p>

Q.</hi> Might you have dropped your purse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it at all possible; I never put my hand in my pocket from the time I put the purse in—my trowsers were not down, nor had I the least intention of having them so—by fumbling about me, I mean she put her hand outside my trowsers—I thought she meant to touch my person—I was surprised at going down that lane, that she took me so far out of the way—I thought her a prostitute—I am twenty-two years of age—I have no doubt what she meant, and wanted—I went down the dark lane, on her pointing to the lamp there, and saying, "You see where it is"—I knew what she was, but I did not expect she would induce me to go home—I did not go down for indecency, merely for the purpose of drinking, it being a miserable night—I did not give her a sixpence—it was for want of thought, certainly—I believe it was about a quarter past 8 o'clock—I will not swear whether I walked or ran away when she made use of those expressions; this bag was in my trowsers pocket—I cannot tell how she got her hand in that pocket—I am not aware of her having her band in my pocket at all—it was not the way to the omnibus down that lane.</p>

He then said the prisoners had been passing bad notes - they could hear him, I thought. Cock rather smiled. I gave Mr. Chapman the note, then desired that I might mark it; he gave it to me back, and I marked it with my initials (looks at one), this is it. Mr. Chapman and Mr. Gray, who was with him, took the prisoners away in custody.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Margaret-place. On Saturday night, the 18th of March, between eight and nine o'clock, Walters came to my shop, and bought a leg of pork, which came to 4 s. 8 1/2 d., and gave me a 1 l. Bank note. I asked him his name and address? he gave me</p>
               <p>"Walters, Wick-street, or Wick Hackney." I said,</p>
               <p>"You appear like an honest man, I suppose you took this of your master?" he said Yes, and that he had been a cook in London-wall. I did not mark the note, as I considered it useless. I do not remember his saying when he received it. Directly after he was gone, a neighbour came in, and gave me reason to suspect it was forged; it laid on the block. I then took out two or three notes from my pocket to compare with it, I could discover no difference. I always kept it separate from the others. Sometime after, Chapman brought Walters in, and I gave him the same note Walters paid me I am certain.</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger, and live in Margaret-place, Hackney. On the 18th of March, a little before nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner, Walters, came to the shop, and bought 3 lbs. of butter. He asked if I could give him change for a 1 l. Bank note? I said I believed I could (in order to get the note into my hands.) - He gave me the note; I looked particularly at the signature and date, as I had previously taken some bad ones; they did not correspond - it was signed E. Staple. I could not tell whether it was good or not. I told him I could not give him change, and returned it to him. He told me to weigh him a pound of cheese, and then perhaps I could. I said No. I noticed the date of it. He went out, leaving the goods, and said he must see if he could get change somewhere else. I followed, suspecting him; he carried the note in his hand, and went into Mr. Hayward's shop, a few doors further on. I saw him give Hayward the note, and get the change. He then came out, went down Margaret-street, and about twenty yards from the shop the prisoner, Cock, joined him. They conversed together, then went into a chandler's-shop at the bottom of the street, and had some grocery weighed, but did not purchase it. They came out, I followed them up Margaret-street again about twenty or thirty yards; they then went into Mr. Haddock's. They stopped, and had some conversation together in the middle of the street before they went in, they then both went into the shop together, I went over to a butcher's shop, where I saw Gray, and called him to assist me. I stood looking through Haddock's window, saw him looking at the note by his lamp, and observed one of them hand some paper behind him to the other; we then went in. I asked Haddock to give me the note, and said, quite loud enough for the prisoners to hear me, that I knew they had been passing bad notes. Haddock gave me the note, and then said</p>
               <p>"Give it me again" - he marked it and returned it to me, it was not out of my sight - it was not the note he offered to me, for it was a different signature. I secured them both, took them into Hayward's shop, and asked him, in their presence, to give me the note he had taken from Walters; he did so, and Walters gave him back the change - it was the same number and signature as the note he offered to me. I and Gray then took the two notes to the house of Mr. Glover, the inspector, and gave them to his housekeeper. I put my name on both the notes at his house - (looks at two) - these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. You had both the prisoners in custody at Hayward's - A. Yes; and while Walters was giving back the change Cock escaped. When I secured them at Haddock's, and said they had been passing bad notes, they both said,</p>
               <p>"If they are bad we have just taken them of our master." I am sure they said we, and I understood them that they had just taken them. It was on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the prisoners come to your shop on the 25th of February - A. Yes, Cock came about eight o'clock in the evening, and asked if I had got a hock of bacon? I said No. He had a piece of bacon and some butter weighed, and gave me a note. I asked him his name? he said it was Cook, and that he lived in Mutton-lane. I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120044"></xptr>certain he did not say Cock. This is the note - (looking at it). I gave him the change, and he left.</p>

Haddock put his name on the note in my presence, and delivered it to Chapman. We took the prisoners to Hayward's, and he gave Chapman a note; the change and meat were returned to him. We took the notes to Mr. Glover's housekeeper, having left the prisoners at Hayward's; we returned, and found Cock had escaped; I took Walters to the watch-house.

I fixed Gray at the front door and Gleed in the garden - it was about seven o'clock in the morning. I looked over into the back-yard, and saw the door ajar; I got into the garden and saw Cock; he turned round, saw me, and went into the front room directly. I went into the house, and saw his wife and sister there. I went into the front room; it was all darkness - I called for a candle, they had none. The shutters were opened, I looked round, but could not see him. I at last found him in a cupboard, doubled up, and a knife in his hand, which was shut.

               <p>WALTERS'S Defence. I went to the London-wall Asylum, and was a cook there for six weeks and five days; they gave me 1 s. a day. When I left there I went to lodge with Cock. The next morning he went into his garden, and said he had lost three 1 l. notes. I had two 1 l, notes, and gave them to him to take care of - I had 5 s., which lasted me till Saturday night, I then asked him for one of my notes to get victuals. He said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, you can have victuals with me, and pay me next week," and on the next Saturday night he gave me these two notes and said,</p>
               <p>"These are the two notes you had from London-wall." He sent me into the shops for the articles.</p>

            . I was Chairman of the House Committee of the Society at London-wall, and had the management of the establishment. Walters was received there as an assistant-cook for about six weeks, and as he was considered a laborious and deserving man, a gratuity of 1 s. a day was given him when he was discharged, which was on the 1st of March. I myself paid him two 1 l. notes and 6 s. I was in the habit of paying new notes; I almost always paid everything in new notes. I have a strong impression in my mind that I paid him two new notes - I should certainly think I did not pay him these two - (looking at them.) The notes I paid almost invariably came from my bankers, Messrs. Smith, Payne and Co., or from Messrs. Lubbocks', the bankers of the establishment. I certainly do not think these notes ever passed through my hands. He behaved extremely well with us.</p>

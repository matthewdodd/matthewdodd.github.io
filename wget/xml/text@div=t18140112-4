               <p>Q. Had you any property in your house in December last - A. Yes, I had five one-pound notes in my chest; I had put them by to pay my rent. I saw them in my chest about a fortnight before I missed them. I locked them up in my chest, and kept the key in my pocket. I missed them on the 8th of December. I saw my chest was broken open. I asked my wife if she had broken it open; she denied it. The prisoner came in and said, your wife did not break it open. I asked the prisoner if she broke it open for her. My wife said, I left nobody else but you here on Friday when I went out. I then said to the prisoner, I will make you suffer for it. The prisoner called me up into her room, and acknowledged that she had changed one of the pound notes; in about an hour after she acknowledged that she had changed two of them. On the next morning I had her taken up to the magistrate. She acknowledged that she exchanged two one-pound notes. This is a chisel that I lent to the prisoner's husband; I never saw it after until I saw it in my chest. The prisoner borrowed it of my wife for her husband's use.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I changed a one-pound note for his wife to get some things out of pawn for her.</p>

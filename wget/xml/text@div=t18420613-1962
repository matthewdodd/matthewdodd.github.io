                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at Plaistow. On the 30th of May, I was outside the Coach and Horses there, and saw the de<lb></lb>ceased John Mullins, who I knew by sight, standing sparring through the window at the prisoner—he was not within reach—they were both in liquor—the deceased called the prisoner a b—<hi rend="italic">thing,</hi> and said he was no use either for fighting or for work—the landlord came out, and ordered Mullins away—he refused to go until he had seen the prisoner—the land<lb></lb>lord sent the prisoner out—the prisoner came out and said something to Mullins, who immediately stripped to his skin—the prisoner pulled off his jacket, and they sparred at each other—a man named Smith tried to make it up between them—at last they got to fighting in the road—they each had a second—the deceased struck the first blow—the prisoner struck him again underneath the left ear, and he fell—that was the only blow—in falling he struck himself at the back of the head, and was taken into the public-house yard insensible—he was carried to his brother's house on a man's back—I afterwards saw him dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the quarrel in the public-house—the deceased began it—he provoked the prisoner very much indeed to fight, and used very bad language—he said he was no man at all—he was nothing but a <hi rend="italic">thing,</hi> he could neither fight nor work, and he aggravated him very much—the deceased went out and stripped, and told the prisoner to come out—he said, "I do not want any thing to say to you"—he threw the window up, and said if he did not come out, he would pull him out by his <hi rend="italic">snout</hi>—he asked him again, "Are you coming out?"—he said, "I do not want any thing to do with you"—he said, "If you do not come out I will fetch you out"—he looked over my left shoulder, and tried to reach hold of him—he threw both the windows open, and sparred at him—a boy pulled</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Plaistow. I saw the deceased first on Monday, the 6th of June—he had then been ill a week—he had symptoms of effusion of blood, or fluid on the brain, pro<lb></lb>ducing convulsive spasms and fits—he was sensible, but only at times—when I first saw him, I told him to put out his tongue, which he did—he appeared sensible then, but that morning he had two or three fits—he died on the 8th—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exam<lb></lb>ination—on removing the skull cap, I found lying on the left hemi<lb></lb>sphere of the brain, from one to two ounces of coagulated blood, between the <hi rend="italic">pia mater,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dura mater,</hi> which accounted for his death—he had a small wound at the back of his head, it was nearly well—there was a bit of plaster on it, which I took off—I did not apply anything fur<lb></lb>ther—there was not much concussion, and no external swelling—there were evidently several other blows on the back of his head—I apprehend that concussion was the cause of the extravasation of blood—I consider a blow or fall was the cause of it—I do not know that a blow under the left ear would produce it without a fall, but accompanied with a fall it would—such a blow and fall as has been described would be sufficient to account for what I saw, and the man being partially intoxicated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You could not trace the extravasation to the wound at the back of the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It led me to know that he had had a severe blow on his head—there was no fracture—the blow was between the hemispheres of the brain—the blood was all in one hemisphere—ex<lb></lb>travasation may occur without violence—it is more likely to occur during intoxication—I do not think he could have recovered under any circum<lb></lb>stances—the extravasation had most likely existed for some days, but I cannot state positively how long.</p>

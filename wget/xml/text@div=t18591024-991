                  </hi>. I keep the Tailor's Arms public-house, Gravel-lane. On Thursday, 22d September, the prisoner came to my bar and asked for three-halfpenny-worth of gin—he had been there the week before—when he came in I recognised him—he had had a glass of half-and-half the week before, and he gave mo in payment what I supposed to be a shilling—I put it in the till—there were two half-crowns, and several sixpences in the till at the time; there were no other shillings—a man came in soon afterwards, and I gave him the shilling and a half-crown in change for something—about two minutes after he gave it to me back, and I found it was bad—I put it by itself—on the 22d September, when he came for the gin, he offered me a shilling in payment; ho then moved a step back—I took the shilling and laid it down under the counter, put my hand in the till to rattle the money—he came forward to take the change, and I <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> hold of him till the police<lb></lb>man came—he took him into custody—took him to the station-house, and from thence before the Magistrate—when I took him, I said, "I have got you now, and you are the one who passed one on me the week before"—he begged me to let him go—I gave the constable the shilling that the prisoner had just given me, and the one I had taken the week before.</p>

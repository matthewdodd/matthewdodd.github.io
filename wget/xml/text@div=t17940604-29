               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It was in the evening that you charged Mr. King with this? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you afterwards take him to a public-house? - The clerk of the office told us when we applied for a warrant, that we did not want any warrant at all,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040049"></xptr>we might go and take Mr. King; and bring him down to the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go afterwards, and tell him that you found there was a mistake, and that you found the deals in Fitzroy-square, and that those were the deals that you lost? - No, no such thing, I deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Bow-street with him that evening? - I did not, I went, but they were gone when I went.</p>
               <p>Q. He appeared the next morning to answer this charge? - He did, Mr. Malpas passed his word for him.</p>

               <p>Q. He gave bail for his appearance here to answer the charge, and here he has come and surendered himself? - Yes, he has.</p>

               <p>I work for Mr. Tomlin, I was at work for him the 13th and 14th of May; on the 14th of May I missed a great quantity of deals, I cannot tell you directly how many, I suppose as much as a one horse cart would hold, or more, we found many of them again, we found some in Fitzroy-square, I believe there to be about a one horse load, but there was more lost than that; we got information, and we made search after them, we went away down to Goswell-street, where were some, but I could not swear to what I saw there, we came back again to Mr. Tomlin's, a neighbour said, you have gone too far, and he pointed over to Mr. King's yard, we went there and Mr. Mitchell said, here is, I believe, the plank, and Mitchell turned the plank over and there was my own name on the plank, that I did myself for the doing up of Dadoes, I marked them while I was in Mr. Tomlin's service, I marked them with my own mark; the prisoner would not tell me where he bought them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What time did you go Mr. King's premises in the evening? this was after the hours of work that you went there? - It might be between seven and eight for what I know, we had not been at work, we had been doing all in our power to try to trace this out on purpose to save our own credit.</p>
               <p>Q. What you was under suspicion, was you? - and therefore, you to prevent the suspicion falling on you, went about to several public houses to look after them? - Perhaps we did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober? - I was as sober as you are now.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you quite in your sober senses? - I told you so, so don't ask me no more about it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told Mr. King that you had this suspicion of him, he told you that he bought all this timber of Mr. Nicholson, his timber Merchant? - I don't know who he bought it of; and if you talk to me till to-morrow morning, you will get no more than what I have told you.</p>
               <p>Q. Satisfy my question? - I never heard Mr. King mention the word.</p>
               <p>Q. He went with you to Bow-street? - He did not go with me, he went with Claxton.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back you gave him leave to go home? - I did not, he was gone when I came.</p>
               <p>Q. He came the next morning voluntarily to answer this charge, and there he was admitted to bail; and now he has surrendered himself to take his trial? - He has so, and if he has got any thing to say, let him say it.</p>

               <p>Q.

They would not let him go into his house, so much as to put on his coat, they lugged him into the coach like another thief, this other man was along with us, well says I, if you will resign him up to me, I will be answerable for his appearance to-morrow morning at Bow-street, and he took me to his warehouse, there were five large deals.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any mark on them? - Mr. King asked me to look, and I saw none.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see these three men? were they drunk or sober? - The second man, Mitchell, took me out of the parlour into the public house, and said for God's sake let it all drop, for I believe Mr. King is an innocent man, for the deals are found in Fitzroy Square; then says I, Mr. King has a right to take you up, to accuse such a man as that.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been the character that Mr. King has borne in the neighbourhood? - Not a better character in England.</p>

Mitchell said, that he was sorry, and hoped it would all be dropped, however, this fellow Penn, seemed more obstreperous than the other; and he said, if Mr. King would give them all a pot of beer a piece it should all drop.

            Was there any mark as this man has described? - No mark at all.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know that these were the boards that were challenged, either by Mitchell or Penn? - My master shewed them me when I went in the morning.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three more of his journeymen who corroborated Goodlass and eight other witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Mitchell. You hear what the witnesses have said the other side that you admitted that you had no charge against King, is that so? - I could not swear to the deals, but there is a man that has been examined that told me that the deals were not there the night before, it was Brown.</p>
               <p>Brown. They were deals that stood outside of the door, that I spoke of.</p>
               <p>Penn. When we found the deals, this man and his master was at work in the yard, Mitchell was the first man that brought the men out of the yard, we took them to a public house adjoining to Mr. King's yard, and Mr. Mitchell gave them a pot of porter, I asked this man, Brown, whether these deals were in Mr. King's yard last night? he said no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see the deals that you pointed out and fixed upon to be Tomlins? - Yes, he said they were not there when he left off work, and in the morning he found them.</p>
               <p>Q. To Brown. Was you in the yard when Penn came there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him look at any deals particular? - No, I did nor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say that any deals were his master's? - I never heard him say any thing till we were in the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. What deals was it you told him were not in the yard? - They were deals pitched outside of Mr. King's premises, in the Mews, the property of Mr. Hoare, who is a bankrupt, a waste place, adjoining my master's yard.</p>
               <p>Penn. When I asked him about this, I asked him about planks, I did not say deals; I asked him whether the planks which laid by the pit side, were there when he left work? he said no; says I, were they there when you came in the morning? he said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me at first they were marked with your name? - They were, I had two inches breadth taken off from one side, there were two marks for the two cuts, there was a cross and a P. for my own name on it, it was all in chalk, we never scarcely work with any thing else, without it is red chalk or white.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long ago you made these marks? - It might be four or five days, I cannot rightly say for a day.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mitchell. Was you present when Brown was asked any questions about the planks or deals? - asked him whether the planks was in the yard the night before, and I rather suppose that his master had been guilty of the crime, and I told him if those deals could be got back again, there would be nothing said about it.</p>
               <p>Penn. The two deals that I swear to was taken away in the night.</p>

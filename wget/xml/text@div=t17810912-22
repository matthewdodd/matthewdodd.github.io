             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was robbed on Saturday, the 25th of August last: it was, to the best of my recollection, at about a quarter after nine o'clock. I was on <placeName id="t17810912-22-crimeloc111">Kingsland-road</placeName>

I took a coach from the stand in Whitechapel, to evade being robbed: I got upon the coach-box myself, and drove the horses. When I got about 150 yards beyond a house, the sign of which is the Black Horse, on Kingsland-road, a little man ran across the road, and laid hold of the horse by the bridle: I stood up on the foot-board of the box, and said, I will not be robbed: upon which I received several blows upon my right arm, and while they were hitting me -</p>
               <p>Was there more than one? - There were four in all. One swore, called me by an opprobrious name, and said, We will make you stop when you are bid. I still made some resistance, till one, who was taller than the prisoner, came with a kind of a weapon, and levelled at my head. I held up my arm, and received the blow upon it; upon which my arm dropped, and the man who cut me came upon the splinter-bar, and laid himself across me to rifle my pockets. I begged him not to kill me; that he should have all I had. Then I put my hand in my right pocket, and took out very near twenty shillings in silver. Then he took my gold watch. He felt outside my left-hand breeches pocket, and felt something: he swore, and said, Come, Sir, make baste. He took a pocketbook out of that pocket, and a purse containing eleven guineas, a shirt buckle, and two medals of the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester; they were all in that purse. I said, I hoped he would be satisfied; for now he had got all: he replied, Very well, go on.</p>
               <p>What have you to say against the prisoner? - He is the man that ran across the road, and laid hold of one of the horses.</p>
               <p>Are you certain of that? - I am certain.</p>
               <p>What sort of light was it? - It was not quite dark, it was dusk; but one might perceive<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120023"></xptr> and know any face: he stood quite fronting me, at the horses' heads, and looked up; his face was directed towards me: I am perfectly sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Did you observe his dress? - Yes, a brown coat; I described him exactly before I saw him. I whipped one of the horses, and dragged him I suppose fifteen or twenty yards. When I said I would not be robbed, I kept whipping the horses; but he would not quit his hold. The prisoner was taken the next day. I refused seeing him that evening; it was then pretty near dusk, and the man who took him brought him to me at Kingsland, and wanted me to look at him then; he was brought to a house, the sign of the Fox, near where I lodge: I told the man that had taken him to keep him; for the next day I would attend Mr. Wilmot's office; I chose to see him at the justice's: I saw him there the next day; there were several people in the room with him; I pointed him out the moment I saw him. I said, That is the little man that laid hold of the horses' heads.</p>
               <p>Have you found your money or watch since? - No; and what they ha d got they should have been welcome to: I should not have prosecuted them, but only for their cruelty to me: I had a cut an inch deep in my arm; but this is not the man that cut me.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. What marks he swears to me by? - By his face.</p>
               <p>Which horse did I lay hold of first? - You came on the right-hand side, and laid hold of the off horse first, and then to the other, and then never quitted your station till I was robbed, and the man left the coach-box.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a hackney-coachman. My coach was taken by Mr. Leoni in Whitechapel; he got upon the box before I came to the coach, and asked for the coachman: Mr. Leoni drove himself; I sat upon the box with him. Mr. Leoni set off along Houndsditch, Shoreditch, and Kingsland-road. Just as we came on this side the Fox, a little man catched hold of the horse's head, on the near side, and swore, D - n your eyes, stop! or I will blow your brains out. I did not see him lay hold of the horse on the off-side. He had a bludgeon, or pistol, or something in his hand; but I can't tell what. Mr. Leoni said, D - n your eyes! I will not be stopped by any body. He kept whipping the horses, and dragged the man twenty yards, I dare say: then a tall man got upon the splinter-bar on the off-side, and said, D - n your eyes! I will learn you to drive on when you are ordered to stop! The coach was stopped; then he began beating Mr. Leoni a-cross his thighs with a hanger, I believe it was, it looked like one; he hit him across his arm, and cut his arm very bad: then he laid across him, and began rifling his pockets; he pulled his watch out, as if he would pull his breeches all to pieces; I saw the watch, just as they drew it out: they made me look the other way, only I just cast my eyes a little that way.</p>
               <p>How long did this continue? - About ten minutes: they went towards London from the coach; we set off the other way to Mr. Leoni's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Can you speak to the prisoner? - I can't swear to never a one of them; it was pretty dark.</p>
               <p>What was it o'clock? - About ten.</p>
               <p>Why do you think so? - What makes me so positive in the time was, I was going to draw the horses into the yard.</p>
               <p>You could not see the prisoner's face then? - I could discern what size he was, but not to swear to him: he seemed to be a shortish thick-set man. I was at Justice Wilmot's next day, and saw the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Was you there when Mr. Leoni came in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did or did not Mr. Leoni fix upon the prisoner as soon as he came in? - I don't know; he was there before I was.</p>
               <p>What did you say before the justice about the prisoner? - I said, I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>What time do you usually put up your horses? - Just as it happens.</p>
               <p>Do you ever put up before ten o'clock? - Yes; I have put up at seven and eight several times.</p>

               <p>This witness swore before the justice that Mr. Leoni was very drunk. I am innocent of the affair. At the time the robbery was done, I was at Clapton with this gentleman that is here; I slept there till five next morning; then he gave me a shilling, and I came away.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the prisoner; he lived fellow-servant with me about nineteen months, at Mrs. Horton's, at Brook-house, Clapton; he was a very honest lad, and very willing to do his work: he left his place about two years ago. On the 25th of August, he came to me at Brooke-house, where I live, about ten minutes before ten, and slept with me till five next morning, when he departed: he had laid with me several times since he left his mistress's service; I cannot say how many times.</p>
               <p>How came you to be so certain to Saturday the 25th of August? - Because he was taken up the next day, and I was told of it on Monday.</p>
               <p>How came you to know the time to be ten minutes before ten so exactly? - Because he and I were talking at the gate some time, and then the clock struck ten. The place where this robbery is said to have been committed, is about two miles from Brooke-house.</p>

               <p>Jury. Is there not a nearer way across the fields to come to it? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you drink? - Small beer. He appeared tight and clean; he had the same coat on he has now, and he had no money in his pocket that I know of. I should have thought, if he had been guilty, he would have been in a terror; but he seemed the same as usual. He has drove for a livery-stable at London-Wall.</p>
               <p>Jury to Ray. Whether Mr. Leoni was sober at the time he was robbed? - He seemed to be about half-and-half.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Leoni. Was you affected with liquor? - I was not affected; I was sufficiently capable of knowing his face. The moment I was attacked, I had a diamond-ring upon my finger; I turned it back, and brought it home with me. I had been dining with some friends; and, to the best of my recollection, had not drank a bottle of Port wine; something better than a pint.</p>
               <p>Court. Some people's heads can't carry much. - My Lord, I am sorry to say that I can bear a bottle of wine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the county of Surrey. On Wednesday, 20th Sept., the deceased, Eliza Wilson, made a statement in my presence and hearing, and signed it—I took it down, but in consequence of her weak, dying state, I had to bend over her in bed, and then I got the police-inspector to write part, in my presence—I had seen her on the previous Sunday—I was requested by the inspector to go there on that day to take the declaration of a dying female—she was then very ill, but she expected to recover, and I therefore went away—on the Wednesday the inspector came again to me, and I went again—I saw her father, and sent for a Clergyman—I asked her how she found herself—she said, "Very ill"—I said, "Do you now think you will recover?"—she said, "No"—I said, "Do you think you will die?"—she said, "Yes"—I then proceeded to take the statement.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-inspector</hi>). I went with Mr. Elyard to Mr. Wilson's house at Norwood, on 20th Sept., and saw the deceased Eliza Wil<lb></lb>son—I heard her make a statement—I wrote part of it down—this is it—she signed it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—" The declaration of Eliza Wilson, taken before me, Samuel Elyard, Esq., at Norwood, 20th Sept., 1848. The said Eliza Wilson having been examined by me as to whether she at present considers herself in a dying state, and she having assured me that she does, is in the thirty-second year of her age, and saith, and suspecting herself to be in the family-way, she made known her suspicion to Richard Orpin, with whom I had had criminal connection, and who would have been the father of the child—I never had connection with any other man—and on my informing him as above, he said, 'Stop till Monday, and we will go together to East-lane, Walworth, to a</p>

               <p>woman, but she need not trouble herself for three or four months;' and he went with me on Monday, 4th Sept., to East-lane, but could not find the woman, and on the following day, Tuesday, I went by myself and did not find her, but saw a Mrs. Dryden, who resides in York-street, Walworth, to whom I acquainted that I was in the family-way, and informed her that I wished to get rid of it, and she said it should be all right, if I would pay her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and which I gave her; she gave me a box of pills and a bottle of stuff, which did not have the expected effect. Mrs. Dryden then went with me on the Wednesday to Mrs. Lindfield, to Prior-place, East-street, Walworth, a herb shop. Mrs. Dryden said, 'I have got a friend of mine come to see you.' Mrs. Lindfield, without asking any questions, said, 'I will take her up-stairs directly,' and shortly after did so, and told me to lay on the bed on my left side; she then performed an operation by some instrument, which had some holes at the end. I went again on the 9th, she used the instru<lb></lb>ment again, saying, 'It does not come so freely from you.' I slept at Mrs. Dryden's that night. I paid her, Mrs. Lindfield, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the first day I went, and gave Mrs. Dryden a few shillings for her trouble in taking me to Mrs. Lindfield. I went to Mrs. Lindfield again on the following Monday, the 11th, when she again used the instrument, when I came home and became ill. I told Mrs. Lindfield my father thought I was ill, and she said, 'Nonsense, you are all right.' Richard Orpin promised to pay the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but has not done so. The young man, called Mrs. Lindfield's son, was pre<lb></lb>sent on each occasion I went, and was perfectly aware of the business which I was on")—the prisoners were in custody before I saw Wilson—Lindfield's house and premises were searched in my presence—I was present when the catheter, a box containing other instruments, a quantity of herbs and pills, and drugs of almost all sorts, were found—Merritt, the policeman who was present, has them.</p>

I wish that some medical man should examine my hand, to see whether it is in a state to reach the uterus of a person in a rigid state, like this young woman's. I did what I could, but I told her I could prove nothing. I told her to keep her mind easy, and gave her some laxitive medicine. When I tr ied to examine her next time, I had not got my finger more than an inch when I found menstruation coming on again, and I told her to go to bed, and keep her feet warm. I drew her water off for her, as she complained of pain. I gave her an ounce of salts to take home, and I gave her at the same time four pills. I told her to take half an ounce of salts that night, and next day to take two pills, but no salts. I said, 'Take them alternately, till your bowels are relieved.' She complained of costive-ness very much. I did not see her again till that day week, and then she showed me appearances to satisfy me ail was right. She said she was going to see her aunt; she complained that her bowels were still in a constipated</p>

               <p>state. I attributed it to the properties of the savin. I heard no more of her till Thursday evening again, when I received this note; then she complained only of the constipation of the bowels, and I sent her two ounces of salts by a young man who brought this note. Dryden did not say she had given her savin; it was the young woman said that, when I took her up stairs privately to examine her. It was the third time the deceased came to me I drew off her water." Dryden says, "She (deceased) had no savin water from me. I gave her rive-leaf grass, ground-ivy, agrimony, and pil. cochioe, which are fine things for the stomach. She asked me if I knew a midwife, and I referred her to Mrs. Lindfield." Orpin says, "I have been out with the young woman several times, but as to giving her poison it is wrong; whatever she took she got it, and took it of her own accord; I neither supplied her with money nor bought it myself; she said something must be done; she came to me, and asked me to give her 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get her some stuff, but 1 told her I would not have anything to do with it, and 1 have not seen her since.")</p>

                  </hi>. I am housemaid to the Rev. Edward John Smith, a clergyman, at Norwood, in Middlesex. The prisoner used to come to his brother, who was in Mr. Smith's service as footman—he used to come to fetch his brother's linen—the forks were kept in the parlour, but they were brought down into the pantry, where the prisoner's brother used to clean them in general—I re<lb></lb>member missing a fork on a Saturday—the prisoner had been there on the Thursday before, assisting his brother—he might have been there an hour, or an hour and a half—this is my master's fork—it has his crest on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Hampton. The prisoner gave me this prong part of this fork, and said, "Will you go to Mr. Ward's, and ask him if this is silver; and if he asks you where you got it, say you picked it up in the road?"—I did not say any thing to that, but I went to Mr. Ward's, and he would not have any thing to do with it—I went back to the prisoner, who was waiting at the top of King's Arms-lane, and told him he must send his mo<lb></lb>ther, for Mr. Ward would have nothing to do with it, and he had kept the fork—the prisoner said he would be blessed if he would not send somebody else that would have it—I saw him go to Mr. Ward's.</p>

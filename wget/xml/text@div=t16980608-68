            </rs>. The Evidence deposed, that the Prisoner did swear to the Affidavit, and that the occasion of it was, that Capt. Johnson being tried and acquitted at the last Admiralty-Sessions, said, he would stick close by him, and for that end resolved to have him tried for being in the French Service, and staying in England after the first of February last, against the late Statute, without a Licence for so doing: That the Prisoner had carried one of the Evidence to a meeting with one Lewis, where the Prisoner said he had served Capt. Johnson on board, and wanted Lewis to let him see the Captain; which occasioned a Jealousy in the Evidence that he did not know him, and the more because they were heard to say, they were to have 100 l. to do the Captains Business. It also appeared, that the Prisoner took other Persons for the Captain, and named them as such. There were several Witnesses that deposed, that Capt. Johnson was taken in 1689, by the French, and carried into Dunkirk, where he lay long a Prisoner, and afterwards made his escape: and the Captain himself deposed, that he never served under Dubart, that the Prisoner never served him, that he had a Servant of the Name of William Argent but the Prisoners Name was Warner, as several Witnesses deposed he had owned on board other Ships.

            . I am warehouseman to the prosecutors, who carry on their business in Fore-street. Potts brought me twelve shawls, on the 12th of February; having some suspicion, I shewed them to Mr. Morrison, in consequence of which, application was made to Potts, to know where he got them.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COPE. I am also warehouseman to Messrs. Todd, and Co. I purchase for them. When I buy the articles, I mark the price on them that they are to be sold at; it was the duty of the last witness to sell them for that price. The prisoner, Edwards, was a <rs id="t18170219-68-deflabel375" type="occupation">seller</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18170219-68-defend593 t18170219-68-deflabel375"></join>; he was to sell the goods at the price which they were marked. I put the mark on the goods, and the party who sell them, are to sell them at that price only; they are not at liberty to take a less price. The twelve shawls, the last witness spoke of, were shewn to me. In consequence of what had passed. I accompanied Brand to Mr. Knott's, in Holborn; I saw Littlewood there, and a large quantity of silk goods, that were our property.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. What is the duty of the person when he sells goods - A. He is to see them entered in the day-book immediately. The daybook is kept in the warehouse on the first floor. There are four day-books, they are placed in different parts of the warehouse. If he sells in the lower part of the warehouse, he must go to the back of the warehouse and put them down. They are all took to that part of the warehouse to be entered; the clerk enters them for him. If a person wants their goods immediately, his duty is to see them entered. If he sells for ready money, they are to be entered, but they are sometimes entered after they are delivered, in the warehouse-book. Edwards has lived nine months with Todd, and Co. He was authorized to sell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. We mark the lowest price on the goods, it is a private mark.</p>
               <p>Q. When a person comes into the shop, he has no means of knowing whether the price asked, is right or not - A.He has not. Goods have been bought at our shop at a very low price - We have bought them at a very low price. The seller has no right to lower the price. I have seen Levick at the shop once, perhaps oftener. When goods are sold, they are put into a drawer kept for the purpose. There are ten drawers, each seller has a drawer.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Knott, who is a linen-draper, and lives in Holborn. I manage his business. I spoke to the prisoner, Levick, to send me twelve shawls, on Tuesday the 11th of January; it was the evening before the shawls were stopped at Messrs. Todd and Co.'s house; a little boy brought them to me - I believe he was in Levick's employ. I saw Levick after they were delivered to me; I told him, that I was not certain whether I should take the twelve shawls or not, meaning those which his boy had brought to me. I gave Potts the same shawls that I spoke to Levick about. Levick was a dealer in those articles, he was in the jobbing line. I only knew him, by his bringing goods for sale. I never enquired how he got them.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body brought them, would you buy without asking how they got them - A. We buy many in that way. Levick named eleven shillings, or eleven shillings and two pence, for each shawl, and I told him, he might send me twelve. I gave them to Potts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I bought the goods for myself, not for Mr. Knott. Levick has sold Knott those kind of goods. I did not know where he got them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a common thing for men to job about, and bring goods to the shop with them - A. It is. I do not exactly know the value of the goods; we sometimes buy of the jobbers as agents, and sometimes as principals.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. What quantity of goods of this description, has he sold your master - A. Three or four dozen; we sold them for eighteen or twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q.On your oath what did you sell them for - A.Some for eighteen shillings, others for sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say, you did not know the value - A. That is not the value; I bought them for myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it the custom of your trade, for a shopman to buy and sell the same articles as his master - A. I believe it is not customary.</p>
               <p>Q. To under-sell your master in his house, while you are receiving his wages to sell his goods - A. There are shopmen who buy goods without their master's knowledge-we sell them to our private friends. We buy things without enquiring how the parties come by them.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BRAND. I am a City marshalman. The shawls were delivered to me by Mr. Cope, at Mr. Knott's.</p>
               <p>Q. When Levick came to Mr. Knott's, did any conversation take place about them - A. Levick came in, I asked him what he had got; he said, he had got shawls; I asked him, where he purchased them; he said, at Mr. Todd's, and produced a bill of parcels; I told him a suspicion had fallen on Edwards, who was Mr. Todd's servant, and that I found he (Levick), had sold Mr. Knott a quantity of shawls, and asked him how he came by them; he said, he had regularly bought them at Mr. Todd's, at different times, of Edwards; I asked him, if he had bills of what he had bought; he said, he had bought both gloves and shawls at Mr. Todd's, but he believed he had not got bills of all the shawls; I asked him, if he had any more than those he had sold Knott; he said, he had sold different parcels to different persons, and mentioned their names; he said, if he had not got bills of parcels, he had entries in his own book at home, of all the goods which he had bought, and if we would go with him, he would produce his books and show us what documents he had; I asked him, if he had any goods at home, previous to that, we had found a bag of shawls; he said, he had no more to his knowledge - We went home with him, and found thirty-five shawls in a parcel, and two scarfs in a clothes box, one of which he said he had selected for his wife, from a former parcel, and the other for a friend. He produced his book - We found a number of entries of goods bought and sold, of gloves and shawls, but no bills of parcels of shawls, except one; I told him it was a singular way of doing business, by buying goods in large quantities, and having no documents to shew; he said, he had generally bought for ready money, and frequently brought the goods away himself, and sometimes he sent a lad, who was a relation of his, for them. We went down to Mr. Todd's, leaving Levick in a coach in the street, till we had examined Edwards. Edwards was fetched into the parlour, and Mr. Todd asked him, if he knew a man named Levick, and if he had not had some dealings with him; he said, he had known him about two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190037"></xptr>years, and he had at times bought goods; I asked him if he had sold him any shawls, and how many; he said, he had sold him two or three at a time; I asked him, if he could recollect how many he had sold him in all, after a short pause, he said. he believed three dozen to be all he had sold him; I asked him how many he had sold at one time; he said, two or three or so, but being pressed, he said, he believed he had sold him as many as sixteen, and at another time eight, which was the eight that Levick had bought that morning. I repeated the questions as to the number of the whole, and he gave the same answers. I asked him what he had done with the money, and if they were paid for; he said he had always placed it to his master's account. (I should have mentioned that in the course of the conversation with Levick; he said he had paid Edwards a 50l. note, for goods; I understood him it was the day before; he said that he had the number of the note). I questioned Edwards as to the receipt of the note, and he acknowledged receiving it. I asked him what he had done with it, he said he had left it on the warehouse mantle-piece when he had sold the goods, and went down stairs, leaving Levick in the warehouse, and when he returned the 50l. note was gone, and he knew nothing further of it. I asked him why he did not pay it to the account of his master; he said he intended to have the goods back that Levick had had, and to return him his money; we then questioned him whether he had made entries in the books of the money he had received; he acknowledged that he had not. I told him that I had Levick outside, and brought him up. Edwards said, he had sold the things to Levick. I afterwards found the 50l. note in the ceiling of the cellar of Mr. Todd's house, there was 138l. in all, there, including the 50l. note, and a letter with it (I produce it).</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN JOHNSTON. The prisoner, Levick, lived servant with me, he left my service about a month ago. I had an opportunity of seeing his hand-writing, it looks like his hand-writing; it is in pencil, I believe it to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>WM. BRAND. The note is directed to Mr. Edwards-(reads)-"Mr. Levick will be obliged to Edwards to send by bearer, twelve shawls; and to say how many more he has on hand, and the price of the damask scarfs Mr. L. looked at, with 35s. per cent. off." I told Levick that I had discovered the 50l. note that he had paid Edwards, and that the number he had given answered; he appeared glad of it. I asked Levick about the different payments he had made, and if he had paid for all his goods; he said he had not, for there was a balance due to the firm; he said, that he had been dealing with Todds, through Edwards (I produce the shawls).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Edwards told me that he had not paid the money, because he hoped to get the goods back, as he had done wrong.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I only knew where Levick lived, by his telling me it was 75, Portland-street. We found the shawls laying open on the table, in the first room we entered; he told me the number of the 50l. note. He said he considered himself as dealing with Todd, through Edwards, as his servant.</p>

            , and John Edward Todd; after the discovery was made, the prisoners were together, in my presence, Edwards charged Levick with having biassed his mind; that observation was in answer to my question, whether he had taken off a discount; he replied, that he did not himself understand discount, but that Levick had biassed his mind. I asked him how the balance of money was to have been paid, seeing that he had made no entry of the goods in our books; Edwards said, that they were to have had a meeting that afternoon or evening, when it was to have been fully arranged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Edwards had been nine months in our service; we have considerable property exposed to the mercy of our servants. I never suspected him before, but always had a very high opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I may have seen Levick at our house; but do not remember seeing him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of his dealing with you for a considerable number of bandanas - A.Only from an invoice which he gave up, it was regularly made by people in our employ. I do not remember seeing him before he was taken; he had a regular invoice of some of the things, but not for these articles; he produced two more invoices of other shawls.</p>
               <p>Q. When Edwards said Levick had biassed his mind, did it arise from an observation about discount - A. I had asked Edwards, generally, about the robbery, his answer was, that he was biassed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are we to understand you, that he meant to say, that his mind was biassed by Levick, as well as to the robbery, as the discount - A.Certainly so.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he not say, that Levick was not to blame - A. Not a word like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say so - A. I might have made an observation of that kind, when we were going to his house, before we were aware of things.</p>
               <p>Court. Are we to understand you, that Edwards said to Levick, that he had been biassed both with respect to the robbery, as well as discounts - A. I understood him to say so, he spoke generally, I had spoken to him about discounts.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM THOMAS. I was also employed in Messrs. Todd and Co.'s warehouse. I remember Levick dealing with Edwards for some shawls, on the 8th of March, they are the same kind of shawls; he said he had given a guinea for worse some time back, he bought eight; I do not know what he paid for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. He did not say how long ago. I have not known such a falling in price, as from 21s. to 12s. I never knew such a difference.</p>

I have an invoice of some shawls, which I purchased on the 12th, the price paid for them was 15s. 9d. they are the same sort, not quite so good in quality as were offered at our shop for 11s. 3d.; the shawls for which 11s. 3d., was offered, were better shawls than those that I paid 15s. 9d. for, the same day, they are worth 18s. The shawls produced are my master's property, they were brought to me by Crow, they have our private mark on them, made by myself. We do not always take the private mark off the goods when they are sold; we generally take it off, if the purchase<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190038"></xptr>takes them with him we should not take it off. We may have sold several hundred of them.</p>

            , chief clerk to the magistrates at Guildhall, was then called, who read the examination of Edwards, wherein he stated, that he had been in the habit of selling goods to Levick, and that the money was not entered in his master's books, and that he intended to get the goods back.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Levick, put in an exceeding long defence, stating, that the whole of his dealings with the prisoner, Edwards, were publicly before the rest of the persons in the warehouse; and that he was in the habit of buying goods cheap, and selling them again. That Edwards told him Messrs. Todd and Co. were in the habit of purchasing goods very low, and he always considered himself as dealing with Edwards as their servant, in the presence of the rest of the servants; and that Mr. Morrison had often seen him dealing with Edwards.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to Messrs. Todd and Co. - I have often seen the prisoner, Levick, at Messrs. Todds', and have asked him if I should serve him, but he would not let me-he said he would wait for Mr. Edwards. I sold in the same department as Mr. Edwards. When Edwards has been engaged, Levick has waited, from five to ten minutes, for him, after I had offered to serve him-he was always served by Edwards.</p>
               <p>MR. NOTT. I am a linen-draper. Levick has sold me shawls two or three times - He did not keep a shop. I bought goods of him when he lived with Johnston in the jobbing line. We buy shawls, from 8s. to 18s.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. When he brought goods to your shop, did he not tell you he bought them of distressed tradesman? - A. Yes, he did. I never inquired how he came by the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the way you trade. - A. I understood him to be a partner with Johnston.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN JOHNSTON. The prisoner, Levick, has been in my service-he has left me about a month. I did not know of his doing business on his own account while he lived with me. He had a commission from me for selling hosiery and lace, but not for silks-silk is out of my line. I should not allow him to deal in any goods but mine.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAM EVERINGTON. I am a linen-draper, I live on Ludgate-hill; Levick has sold me shawls - He described himself as a partner with Mr. Johnston.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Did he not tell you he had them from the country. - A. He did - He said he had them from Macclesfield.</p>

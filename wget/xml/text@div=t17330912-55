I told her, and shew'd her the Linen. She said, that could be no natural Thing, and bad me examine the Child, and so I did. I ask'd her what was the Matter? and promis'd not to beat her, if she would tell me the Truth. Upon that, says she, As I was suting a Quilting upon the Bed,

               <p>Mason. Yes, she was torn as much as a Child could be. Court. How far do you think she had been penetrated? Mason. I can't say exactly, but as far as could be in Reason.</p>
               <p>Court. In what Condition was her Linen? Was it bloody? Mason. Yes, and I ask'd her how long it was since it was done? and she said, the last time was about a Week before, and that he had done it 3 times. The outer Parts were ulcerous. I said, I believ'd the Child had got an ill Distemper, and advis'd them to go to a Surgeon, because I had no Judgement in those Things. They went, but when the Surgeons heard how it happen'd, they would not be concern'd in it for fear they should have the Trouble of attending at the Trial, and so the Child was forc'd to be sent to an Hospital, from whence we brought her now. The Doctors there, said she must be laid down, but they would not do it till the Trial was over, because if they took her in Hand first, she could not be brought hi her.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you make any Judgment by what you saw on the Linen, whether there was an Emission of Seed? Though it might not be decent on any other Occasion, yet as a Man's Life is at Stake, there's a Necessity for the Question. Mason. All I can say to it is, that her Shift was in a sad stiff Condition.</p>

But this was 2 Months before what happen'd to my Child, and I have seen no Spots on his Linen since; but I observ'd one Thing, that ever after, when his Linen came to be wash'd, the Fore-part of it always look'd as if it had been dipp'd in Water and wash'd out before it came to me.

               <p>Prosecutor. I thought it was great Confusion, and I was asham'd - But I can send for it.</p>
               <p>Court. Do so. It is not, indeed, a very decent Sight, but in this Case its necessary. - Let the Prisoner stand aside a while.</p>
               <p>The Messenger who was sent for the Linen, being return'd, the Prisoner was again set to the Bar. Prosecutor. This is my Child's Shift. Court. I thought it was the Prisoner's Shirt that was sent for! Prosecutor. Then I mistook; for I have not got his Shirt.</p>
               <p>Court. However, since the Shift is come, let the Jury look on it. - Is this the Shift the Child had on when she was abused?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can't say whether it's that, or one she wore since, but it is very soul.</p>

I live at 3, Rumsey-villas, Brixton, and am a leather merchant—this brooch and the other articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are all mine—they were part of the contents of a work-box and dressing case which were taken from my house at a quarter to eight on 3d January—my wife came into the house first; after that my attention was drawn to the first floor front window, the fastening of which was wrenched off—a dressing case and work-box were gone, and the drawers were open—I was sent for to the Brentford Petty Sessions—there I identified a single handkerchief as my property.</p>

About half-past ten at night on 12th January I was in New Nichol-street, Bethnal-green—I was near a door and saw the female prisoner and another woman inside the door—I heard the female prisoner ask the other woman to take care of a box—she called the other woman Jane—Jane said to Rose Skinner, "What is in the box?"—the prisoner said, "Nothing, much "—Jane said, "You had better take care of it yourself"—the female prisoner then said, "I think Jack is <hi rend="italic">nicked</hi>, I expect the police will turn over my crib"—Jane said, "I shall not take care of it, you had better keep it in your own room"—a short time after<lb></lb>wards Jane went away—I watched the house till between three and four—I saw a light in the female prisoner's room, extinguished—I went up to the door and knocked three times—she said, "Who is that?"—I said, "Police"—she said, "What do you want?"—I said, "Come and see"—she opened the door—she was alone in the room—I said, "I have come to search your</p>

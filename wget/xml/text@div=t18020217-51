               <p>THOMAS PRUDENCE sworn. - I live at Palmer's Green, near the hand posts: On the 10th of January, a niece came to see me, with Joseph Johnson, who is my nephew; about half past eleven o'clock at night, as nigh as I could guess, I had been to take Johnson's two sisters home to London, and when we got into the <placeName id="t18020217-51-crimeloc269">Green-lane, as you go from Ball's-Pond turnpike, on the other side of the Jolly Butchers, near the Five Elms</placeName>

               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it? - A. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170049"></xptr>moon had been down about twenty minutes or more; a man came up to me with a pistol in his hand, and said, stop and deliver your money, or I will blow your brains out; I then saw three other men; I made answer to him, are you going to spill the blood of a man that never hurt you in his life? I told him I earned but nine shillings a week, and hardly that, how could he think of robbing such poor people as us; he then told us to go along; then I saw one of the men in the cart; there was nothing in the cart but two old chairs, an old sack, and a nose-bag, that I had to give my horse some corn; then I saw my kinsman knocked down, and a short man in a smock-frock came from the off side with a pistol in his hand, and ran it into my eye; I could not see for some time; I rubbed my eye, and he then shoved the pistol into my throat; I still kept following him up, and then there came another behind me with a pistol and a stick, and he kept paying me as hard as he could upon my head with the stick and pistol; he cut my head on both sides; I tacked about to the man behind me, and the other man with the pistol came up and payed me over the head and back with his pistol again; that was the short man; I begged for mercy, but I had none, and so it was of no use to ask for it; they gave me a number of blows after I begged for mercy, and then they took my great coat from me; the blood was pouring down from my head in streams.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the great coat you wore? - A. Yes; the collar was all over blood, and my shirt was as if it was dipped in a blood-tub, all about the neck and shoulders; I lost six shillings, but I don't think they took it out of my pocket; I might have lost it in the skirmish; I cannot swear to either of the men; I think I could have sworn to the short man in the smock-frock.</p>

             sworn. - I am the nephew of the last witness; on the 10th of January, I had two sisters come from town, and a brother-in-law, and another acquaintance, to see me; my uncle said, if you will stop a little later at night, I will borrow a horse and cart; we came to town, and going back as far as Kingstand, we stopped and had something to drink; then we came on to the Jolly Butcher's-hill, I walked, and my uncle said he was very cold, and would walk up the hill too; I was whipping the horse along, and my uncle was behind, with his hand upon the tail-board, and going by Ball's-pond, a man came up in a smock-frock, and said, d - n your eyes, stop, I said, stop, for what, and before I could well say a word, I had a blow on the side of my head; they very much beat my uncle, and took his great-coat from him; it was a great-coat with brass metal buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish the persons of any of them? - A. There were five of them altogether, two in smock-frocks, and three in long coats; when they bid us go away, there were only four, but neither of those four had our clothes, but from what I saw of them, by the light, I have no doubt the prisoner was one of the party.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a dark night? - A. The moon had been gone down about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, and the stars were all gone in; it was quite cloudy, but the snow on the ground gave rather a light.</p>

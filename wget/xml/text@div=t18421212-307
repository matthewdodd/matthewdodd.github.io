                  </hi>. I am in the service of Richard Marshall Phillips and Mr. Grover, lightermen and commercial agents, and live in Rood-lane. In the beginning of Nov. they bad a barge, called the <hi rend="italic">Newberry,</hi> moored off Nichol<lb></lb>son's-wharf—in consequence of instructions I went to the barge about half-past eight o'clock on the evening of the 7th of Nov.—I unbarred the hatchway, went to the cabin, came out of the door, and came to the hatchway again—there is a bar goes across, I locked it, and put the key into my pocket—I re<lb></lb>turned through the door, and went to the cabin again—there were nine chests of tea below, belonging to my master—when I had been there five or ten minutes I heard footsteps on the gunwale of the barge—I threw the cabin open, and went out by means of the door, and went round to the hatchway, where I found Riley unlocking the hatchway, and Williamson was on the cabin head—when they saw me they both went away, and jumped on to the cabin head of a barge which was alongside ours—Williamson returned, and said, "If you will let us have some tea, I will give you <hi rend="italic">trebles"</hi> which means one-third—I said I had got no tea in the barge—Williamson said, "Yes, you have got nine chests"—I told him I should do no such thing—they went away—I afterwards told the foreman—one of them was taken the next night—neither of them had any right to be on board that barge.</p>

               <p>Q. Does Mrs. Harrison, the prisoner, live there - A. Yes, she had the first floor and the use of the kitchen, and the whole range of the house except the shop and the parlour. She was a weekly lodger, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mrs. Bloomfield another house - A. Yes, 151, Ratcliffe Highway, where she resided. I took care of this house in High-street, the shop and parlour, for Mrs. Bloomfield.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house did Mrs. Bloomfield carry on the business of a hatter - A. In the shop and the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way do you go to the shop and parlour - A. I went in at the shopdoor that led to the parlour. I had not any way of getting to the stair-case: there is a door but it is locked; Mrs. Bloomfield had the key of that. Mrs. Harrison's way into the house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270022"></xptr>was the street door and passage that gave her access to the whole house except the shop and parlour, which was in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any contrivance been done for a tea-pot to pass from Mrs. Harrison to you; had any thing been arranged for a tea pot to be let down - A. Oh, no. There was a hole through which a small tea-pot might be put down. A man had danced on the floor, and made a hole. We passed a small tea-pot through that hole once. A large one would not pass through the hole. It held a pint. After the fire the hole was the size of a small man's foot. On the night of the 20th of September I went away from this house about five minutes before eight. I left Mrs. Harrison at home, her servant, and a man, a friend of hers, up stairs. I know there was a man there. She sent down for me to put a band and buckle upon this man's hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went away did you clean up your apartment - A. I swept it up twice in the course of the afternoon. When I went away it was clear of any litter. There was not any straw or chips any where about it.</p>
               <p>COURT. In what apartment was the hole that the tea-pot was let through - A. The parlour, and before I went away in the evening part, Mrs. Harrison could see down into the parlour. I had a person with me. I could see light through it. I saw Mrs. Harrison was at home. I put an old petticoat in the hole that I had brought there that day, and left it in the hole when I went away at night. The hole was close stopped; it could not fall out. I put out the candle, and left it there. I had no fire all the day. I locked the door and took the key with me, and went to my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your attention called to the hole the next day, or how soon afterwards - A. At three o'clock in the morning, upon an alarm, I went to the house. I saw the straw all about; the hole was made much larger. I was once in Mrs. Harrison's room, I put my foot in it; I hurt my foot; I drawed it out; my foot stuck in it. When I saw the hole the second time; my body would have gone throught it. In the morning my petticoat was down on the floor. My mistress is not insured at all.</p>

            . I am a watchman at Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know 188, where the fire took place - A. My beat goes by the door. I know the house perfectly well. I cannot say the number. I was facing the door at ten minutes before two, and five minutes before two. I was there about minutes before five; I heard a noise at the side door; I heard a child crying. I went into the passage; I saw Mrs. Harrison come out of the door, and go down the passage to Mrs. Neave. She was undressed. When I saw her in that state I thought it was prudent to walk away. She had nothing on more than her shift. I went away to cry my hour. At that time I did not perceive any appearance of fire in the house. I heard the cry of fire in about seven or eight minutes; I returned to the house. I believe Mrs. Harrison cried fire first. When I came back I saw her upon the leads over the street door, at her own window. She gave her child down to the fireman. I desired her not to jump down. I was afraid she would. I got a ladder in about ten minutes; she waited on the leads until the ladder came. I helped Mrs. Harrison down the ladder; the fire was not then extinguished. I then went down to the yard door, which leads from the passage to the kitchen. There was a fire at the foot of the stairs, somebody got a bucket of water and put it out.</p>

            . I live down the same passage where the fire happened. My husband is a sawyer. On the night of the fire, Mrs. Harrison knocked at my door just before the watch went two; she asked for a lighted candle; I gave her one She brought no candle. She said her child was very ill. Soon after this I got out of bed to give my child some drink; I saw the fire in Mrs. Harrison's house; I saw fire in Mrs. Bloomfield's kitchen; I could see it was straw in a blaze. I told my husband; he went out and gave all the assistance he could.</p>

            . I am a fireman of the Atlas Insurance office. At a few minutes past one in the morning in question I came by this house; I perceived a smell of fire at that time; I walked about five or six doors; I then thought I went away from the smell. I returned. Mrs. Harrison throwed up the one pair of stairs window. She came out on the leads on the shop window, with the infant in her arms, and a servant girl with her. She begged me to save the child, for the house was all on fire. I desired her to drop the child; she did; I catched it in my arms. A ladder was sent for, and she came down. She seemed as if she was going to jump down; I begged her not, as there was no immediate dranger, as I saw. I took her to a house nearly opposite. I then went into Mrs. Bloomfield's shop, through the door, into the back parlour. I saw a fire in the parlour nearly about the middle of the floor. The floor was burnt about eight inches by five. The boards were burnt through. The floor was burning at the time I went in, but not fiercely. There was some straw in a flame: the straw was over the part on fire. I should suppose the straw occasioned that fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing besides the straw - A. I did not. There was about a small handkerchief full of straw. It did not last long in flame.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the hole in the floor above - A. I did. The hole in the floor above was nearly right over the fire below. I assisted in breaking open the door that led to the stairs. I could not get to the stairs that way, the smoke was so strong. Finding the smoke so strong I shut the door again to prevent all drafts. I then went to the back door leading out of the yard into the back kitchen; I could not discern the fire for the great body of smoke. Some water was handed to me; I throwed the water on different parts of the stairs that were on fire. I extinguished the fire with about ten or twelve pails of water. That fire on the stairs was the principal fire in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did it appear to you that fire had been kindled - A. On the ground, directly under the stairs. Two or three stairs had been burnt through.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing combustible there - A. No, none at all.</p>

            . Q. Did you to Mrs. Harrison give a light on the night the fire happened - A. Yes; I gave her a candle and light, and in about ten minutes after, we saw a fire through our window, in her kitchen; I put on my drawers directly, and snug out fire. I went through the yard door into the kitchen; the inside door was open; the outside door was fast. I was in the house first; I saw the fire on the back part of the stairs; I believe that was made with straw and shavings, I cannot say which; the smoke was so strong I could not go in.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the size of the candle you gave Mrs. Harrison - A. About two or three inches long.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went back did you ask for the candle - A. No; I saw Mrs. Harrison just in the same state as when she came for the candle; she was on the leads.</p>
               <p>- PROCTOR. I am a watchman. I was calling the hour of two; I heard the alarm of fire, and I saw it was a fire; I got an axe, and broke Mrs. Bloomfield's shop door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the back parlour - A. I did; I did not find the floor on fire; then another person got in first; I was the second that entered the parlour. There was no fire in the back parlour at that time.</p>
               <p>Q Did you stop to examine in what state the floor was - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you one of those that forced open the door of the back parlour, that led to the stair case - A. Yes, and upon opening that door, I said, shut it again; there was a great smother coming up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shortly afterwards find any thing in the back parlour - A. I did; a little loose straw tied up in a handkerchief; it laid near the fireplace; after that, I went for the fire engine, and to get water. It was extinguished without the engine working.</p>

               <p>Q. How early on the morning of the 21st, was your attention directed towards this house - A. Between three and four; I went to the house; the fire was out; the alarm had quite subsided. I examined the cellar; there had been water thrown down under the stairs. There had been certainly a fire, and outside of the stairs there had been another fire; I examined it minutely; the stairs were burned more on the upper side than the inner side. I then came up into the parlour, and discovered that a hole had been burnt in the middle of the floor, that hole in the floor was directly under the hole above, in the ceiling; there were two parcels of fire brands, that must have come through the ceiling in my opinion; one was upon the hearth-stone.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the fire brand - A. Wood and straw; only this parcel was on the hearth-stone.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say the fire brand, you mean this - A. Yes; it is straw and turpentine wood, and the straw that I found on the parlour, was oat straw, and on removing the boards where the hole was in the room above, there was some oat chaff, which corresponded with the straw I found below.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it then appear to you, that the straw had been put through that hole, and left the chaff - A. Yes; it left no doubt in my mind.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you examine the ceiling of the back kitchen - A. I did; there was no communication to the fire on the stairs, with the fire in the parlour; the fire in the parlour must have came from above.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you examine the house with Mr. Drummond - A. No; I did not go until ten in the day. I observed the floor in the parlour was burnt; it was nearly under the hole above; the ceiling was about a seven foot cieling. I have had the care of these combustibles, and I have brought them here to day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the place above, to see whether there was any remains above - A. I saw there was some chaff littered about in the up stairs room; I examined the hole in the ceiling; I saw some chaff then, and some straw hanging at the end of the hole in the ceiling; it had the appearance of straw being thrust down there; upon that appearance I apprehended the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the size of the hole in the floor in the prisoner's room - A. It might be a foot by fourteen inches. When I apprehended the prisoner, I enquired of her whether she was insured; she told me that she was insured for one hundred and fifty pound; she was not at home at that time, and when she came home she said, William had got the policy; it was afterwards produced. This is it. When I examined the policy, I found it was for more than one hundred and fifty pounds. I saw her goods, thirty pound would be the utmost value of them; her stock in trade was not worth more than a pound; her stock and furniture was not worth more than twenty pound. I saw two or three candlesticks about the prisoner's apartment, but no candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine whether there were any combustible matter of turpentine - A. There were some droppings of pitch, but that might be from the links of the men that had been there in the morning.</p>

            . I am a sail-maker; I live at Shadwell. I went into the house; the fire happened about half after two in the morning. I observed a hole in the middle of the floor, in the prisoner's apartment; that hole was as long as my foot, but not so wide; I observed a knife laying near it; it appeared to me to have been presently cut as I understood, to let a tea-pot down. I looked at the furniture about these rooms; I thought the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270024"></xptr>value of the things at that time was not more than twenty pound. I am not a competent judge of these things. It might cost a woman a great deal more; it is the furniture that I am speaking of. At another time, prior to this, I have observed a great many straw hats in the window; that was when she had the lower part of the house.</p>

            . I am thirteen years old. I am a servant to the prisoner, Mrs. Harrison. On the night of the fire, I went to bed about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you leave up when you went to bed - A. My mistress said, she was going out for two or three minutes; I might go to bed, she had made all safe below. At that time there was nobody with her.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a hole in your floor we understand - A. Yes; I saw it when I first went on the next morning; the hole was much larger than it was at night.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jameson. When was the second time that you saw the hole, was it larger - A. Yes, that was about nine or ten o'clock; the boards had been lifted up, and examined.</p>

            . Did you go in the room at eight o'clock in the morning - A. No; at nine o'clock. Mrs. Bloomfield put a broom up to shew how loose the boards were.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to bed on the Monday night, did you see any straw in the room - A. No; my mistress had not been gone out long before a young man knocked; I took a candle and let him in.</p>
               <p>Q. What candles were there in the house - A. Only a three-halfpenny one, which I had fetched that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it burnt out - A. No. there was half of it remaining; the young man cut it in half, he took one half, and gave me the other. I went into the front room where I sleep and shut the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your piece of candle when you got up in the morning - A. No; when I was alarmed I saw a candle burning in my chimney-piece where I had left it.</p>
               <p>Q. At ten o'clock the young man knocked; you let him in a little after ten; where was the child - A. In bed with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did your mistress come home - A. I do not know; I was asleep. The crying of the child did not awake me at all. I awoke first with the smoke. My mistress called out Mary; she thought there was a fire; she and the child. and I got upon the leads. I did not hear the child cry all night. My mistress gave me the child whilst she opened the window; my mistress slept in the same bed with me; I was don't know whether she was a bed or no, I was so sound asleep nor do I know where her clothes were; when my mistress awaked me, the candle was burning in the fire-place; I don't know whether that it was the same candle; most likely that candle would not last so long.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that cloth that the straw is in, and turpentine wood - A. My mistress had a cloth like this; I saw it daily. I think it is the same; I did not see it on Sunday, or Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sarah Taylor. You say you had been frequently in the prisoner's room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Take that into your hand; had you at any time when you have been in the prisoner's room seen any thing of that - A. Yes up at the fire-place; I believe it to be the same because of the work. I saw Mrs. Harrison hemming this in my parlour; it was for a little fire-place; it was hung up to hide the deficiency of a stone; she was sitting by my side when she was working it; I believe it to be that piece of cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen her have any pieces of cloth like these - A. I had seen them fragments in the day, the fire happened on the night. I had seen in her room such fragments as these, and of this colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever borrowed this cloth of the prisoner - A. No; I never borrowed any thing of the kind of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the smallest quarrel with her - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any quarrel with your mistress - A. No; she had managed my mistress's business, and after that became a lodger; my mistress called that day, and sent me up to Mrs. Harrison, with her compliments, and to know when she would settle. Mrs. Harrison said, she would come down that day or next; she was quite civil.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where your mistress is - A. No. she came out before me; she said, she would be here as soon as me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You have told me that Mrs. Bloomfield, and she had no quarrel - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mrs. Bloomfield does not live with her husband - A. No, sir.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not you know that the prisoner received notice to pay her rent to her husband, and not to your mistress, and they quarrelled because she would not pay the rent to your mistress - A. I don't know it; I never heard of any dispute.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect borrowing a tin pot in which dusters were kept by the prisoner - A. No, I never borrowed any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mrs. Arnott - A. I might have seen her.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said to Mrs. Arnott in her presence, that your mistress did not care how soon the place was burnt, because she was insured - A. No, I never said such a word to any body.</p>

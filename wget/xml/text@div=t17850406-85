               <p>Some person overtook you in Fleet Market? - No, it was just by Fleet Market.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see that person before? - No, I saw him standing there, I took no notice, I went on, he followed me.</p>
               <p>Did he offer you any money for your bundle? - No.</p>
               <p>Had not you a long conversation with him? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he ever offer you any money? - No, no conversation of that sort.</p>
               <p>A. Temple-bar you say you was stopped? - Sir, he met me by the pastry-cook's at Temple-bar, it was between seven and eight, at the pastry-cook's I viewed his face.</p>
               <p>Are you short-sighted? - I can see very clear, Sir, thank God.</p>
               <p>What conversation have you had with Sir Sampson's men? - None.</p>
               <p>Why did not you call out? - I did, as soon as I could; and the people went over, I did not call out at first, because I could not, and after they left me, I could not catch them.</p>
               <p>Were not their hands hollow over your mouth? - No, their hands were close to my mouth: I am sure it is the man, because he stopped me at the pastry-cook's so long a time, I viewed him there.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner desire the magistrate might have him examined in a different coat? - No, I did not hear him say such a thing.</p>
               <p>Was you asked before the Magistrate what coat he had on? - No.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner desire the Magistrate to ask you that? - Yes, but I said I would not swear to his clothes, only to his face; no money was offered of held out to me.</p>

               <p>I sent a parcel by the lad of thread and tapes. This is a memorandum of the several things, I set them down last Saturday, I took this memorandum from the invoice, I am very sure that all the things I put in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060124"></xptr> there were in that parcel, they are the things mentioned in the indictment; I sent him about seven, it was near nine when he came home, he brought a man with him, I do not know the man, but he seeing the boy in great confusion, came to tell that he was robbed; the boy was very much frightened for fear his master should be angry.</p>
               <p>Had the boy ever lost any thing before? - No.</p>
               <p>How came he to be so much frightened? - I should think it was natural, he said he was followed by a man from Fleet Market, and robbed under Temple-bar; the prisoner was taken up about five weeks after, at the White Horse alehouse, the things were never got again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. How long have you known that boy? - Not quite three months.</p>
               <p>Was it his custom to loiter on the way, when he was sent of an errand? - Not to my knowledge, I never went with him.</p>
               <p>Would you trust him with a sum of money? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What did you apprehend the prisoner for? - On suspicion of this robbery, from the description of the boy; there were two seals, a chain and key, without a watch, found upon the prisoner; and this stick, and other things and duplicates which were returned to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Who was with you? - Shallard, King, and Carpmeal; Jealous was in the coach, we had it to the door, we came out and left Hughes behind.</p>

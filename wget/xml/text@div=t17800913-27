On the 17th of July, about one o'clock at noon I lost the things mentioned in the indictment ( repeating them); I had seen them all in the bar, except the tankard, about ten minutes before I missed them. This gentleman (the prisoner) came and had a dinner at my house.</p>
               <p>In company or alone? - By himself; the waiter came out of the room, and when he returned the gentleman was gone. The waiter came and asked me if I had seen him, or he had paid his reckoning? I told him I had not seen him. He said the tops of the castors were gone; he went back and then missed the spoons. I have a letter (producing it) which came from the prisoner on Sunday last.</p>
               <p>How do you know it came from him? - I suppose so, it has his name to it.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Cox. The prisoner came to dine at my master's house; I attended upon him; my master carried in part of the dinner, and I followed him; there was on the table a silver table spoon, a silver salt and salt spoon, and two crewets with silver tops. I brought him a pint of beer in a china pint mug; I set it down on the table by him, and went out of the room; I staid out some time, and then went back to see if he had done dinner; when I went into the room he was gone, and I missed the things off the table; I am sure they were there when I went out. I went into the next room and missed a silver tankard off the side-board. I saw it in that room when I shewed the prisoner into the room where he dined. He went through the room where the tankard was. I went and told my master, and five or six of us went in pursuit of him; my fellow servant overtook him, and I saw him brought back.</p>

He asked me what business it was of mine? and said what he had got was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130031"></xptr> his own. I told him I did not know whether it was or not, and insisted upon seeing. He said I should not, I might take it out of his pocket if I dared. I brought him back and we sent for a constable. The prisoner was searched in my presence; I saw the silver tankard taken out of his side pocket, and a silver spoon. I did not stand to see all the things particularly taken out. He said they were his own.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was he perfectly sober then? - He was very sober as far as I saw.</p>
               <p>It was not the conduct of a sober man before you and your master to say the tankard was his own? - He insisted upon it that it was his own.</p>

               <p>These spoons (producing them) were pawned with me between nine and ten o'clock on Saturday night by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you know his person before? - Yes, perfectly well. He said they were left him by some relation; I think he said his father. He asked me two guineas on them; I lent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130032"></xptr> him twenty-six shillings; they have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>What is the value of them? - About forty-five or forty-six shillings.</p>
               <p>What are they worth as old silver? - About five or six and forty shillings; they weigh nine ounces at least.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my property; my name is upon them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord I have the same objection to this indictment that I am not rightly described. I have no witnesses.</p>

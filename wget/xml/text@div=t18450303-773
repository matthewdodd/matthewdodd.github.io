                  </hi>. I am a china and glass man, and live in the London-road. On the 6th of Feb. I was called by the policeman, I went to the station-house, and saw thirty-five plates and three jugs of mine—I particularly know the jugs—I had missed such articles—the jugs, and about eighty dozen of one sort of plates, and about forty dozen of another sort,—they exactly corresponded with those which were found—I have employe the male prisoner as a carman, and to look after horses—these plates and</p>

               <p>jugs were kept in a warehouse over my stable—I saw Chaff the evening before this—she came, and gave a pot with some beer for the lads to drink out of—I remarked about it—I saw her at the station between eight and nine o'clock next morning.</p>

Wheeler" to it—I do not know whe<lb></lb>ther she is a maiden lady—I believe she is Miss H. Wheeler—I have known her for ten years—she has carried on business in the place where I lodge for'three months, I dare say, since my house fell down, which was on the 13th of Nov.—I sometimes see to managing her business for her—I superintend the business for her at times, and superintend the articles from my warehouse for her.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in West-square, Lambeth. At half-past six o'clock in the morning of the 6th of Feb. I saw the two pri<lb></lb>soners standing in a gateway—the man was stooping down, apparently taking something from under the gate—he saw me, and ran into the Lon<lb></lb>don-road—I went into the London-road, and told a policeman I suspected something was incorrect—he returned with me, and saw the female sitting down, half tipsy, leaning over a bundle containing this property—I do not know Mr. Searle's warehouse.</p>

               <p>[At the Desire of the Prisoners, the Witnesses against them were examined apart.]</p>
               <p>Job Nutton. About 7 a Clock, last Wednesday Night, I was going along Fleet-street, to my Master (who was at the Bull-head Tavern at Temple-bar) and, on this Side Shoe Lane, there were two Girls, who were singing Ballads; and a Gentleman threatned to beat the Girls, because some-body had pick'd his Pocket. I stood a little to see what was the Matter, when Quan (the tallest of the Prisoners) stoop'd down before me, and took up Half a Crown. Sir, says he to me, I believe 'tis a good one; let's go to the Light at that Shop-window, and see, and, if it is, I'll give you Half a Pint. We went; he rubb'd some of the wet Dirt off: It was a very remarkable Piece; it was bent, and look'd as if a Coach-wheel had ran over it. Sir, says he, pray lend me another Half-Crown to compare with it. I did so. He rubb'd 'em one upon the other, and said, I find 'tis good, and for Luck's sake, I'll treat you. I have a Friend lives at the upper-end of this Court (we were then at the lower-end of Bolt-Court) where we can have a Glass of good Wine. - Come, Sir, I'll shew you the Way. I was got but a little up the Court, when Conway (the short, lame Prisoner) clapp'd a Pistol to my Breast, and said, Damn you, Sir, deposit. Quan presented another Pistol, at the same Time; and Conway put his Right-hand into my Left Pocket, and took out 3 Guineas, and 20s. A Woman came up the Court. Quan swore, if I made the least Noise, he would shoot me thro' the Head. When she was pass'd, Conway said, Damn you Sir, you have got a Watch, we must have that; and began to search for it. The String of my Watch was thrust into my Fob, so that they could not get at it readily; and more Company coming up the Court, Conway walk'd off, and Quan took me by the Shoulder, led me into the Street, bade me go forward quietly, and swore, if I offer'd to speak, or turn back, he would be my Death. I went to my Master at Temple-bar, and from thence to the Queen's-head in Red-Lion-Court, in Long-Acre, where I related what had happen'd, and described the Prisoners so perfectly, that some in the Company said, they knew 'em by the Description, and would send for Mr. Haton, the Constable, who knew their Haunts, and would take 'em. Mr. Haton came; I gave him the same Description, and he apprehended 'em at a Baudy-house the same Night, and they were carried before a Justice. I swore to Quan, and to the bent Half-crown, which was taken upon him. I was a little scrupulous of swearing too positively against Conway, that Night, on account of his Crutch, For, when Conway robb'd me, he stooped to take the Money out of my Pocket, and I took Notice that his Crutch reached above the Bend of his Arm, and when he was brought before the Justice, I thought that his Crutch, (which was a short Hand-crutch) appear'd to be shorter than it was over Night; but, next Morning, I consider'd, that the Difference consisted only in the Position of his Body; for, when he stooped, his Crutch might reach above the Bend of his Arm, tho', when he stood upright, it would reach no higher than his Hand. My Scruple about his Crutch being thus removed (for I had no doubt as to his Person) I was fully satisfied, and swore to him as positively as to the other, and I am now certain, that the Prisoners are the two Men that robbed me in Bolt-Court last Wednesday Night. I saw Quan plainly at the Shop-window when we look'd at the Half-crown; and I saw them both, when they took my Money, by a Light that came from Bolt-Court Coffee-house. They had light natural Wigs on then, tho' now they have got dark Wigs to disguise themselves.</p>
               <p>Conway. Was not you drinking, and playing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140031"></xptr> at Cards with me, at the Mourning-Bush Tavern, at Aldersgate, the Day before you say we robbed you?</p>
               <p>Nutton. No: I never was in your Company before you robbed me.</p>
               <p>Quan. When you was before the Justice, you, at first, said, that you could not swear positively to either of us.</p>
               <p>Nutton. When I first came into the Room, at the Justice's, there was but one Candle, and you stood on one Side of me, so that I had not then a full View of your Face. Three more Candles were brought in; the Half-crown was shewn me, which I knew at first Sight, and swore to be the same that we look'd on at the Shop-window. Then I turned about, and saw you; and, as soon as I had looked you full in the Face, I was certain, and swore positively that you was the Man.</p>
               <p>Quan. What Hour was it when (as you say) you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Nutton. About 7, or between 7 and 8 at Night.</p>

            , Constable. About 9 a Clock, on Wednesday last, a Gentleman came to me, and told me, that a young Man, who was at the Queen's-Head in Red-Lion-Court, had been robb'd. I went thither, and found the Prosecutor, who gave me so exact a Description of the Persons who had robb'd him, that I presently believ'd the Prisoners to be the Men. He said, That near Bolt-Court in Fleet-street, the tallest of the two Rogues stooped down before him, and took up a Half-crown; That they went to a Shop-window, to see if it was good: It was dirty, bent in the Middle, and bruised in the Head; That this Rogue offer'd to treat him with Half a Pint for Luck's sake, and carried him up Bolt-Court, where a short, thick, lame Rogue clapp'd a Pistol to his Breast, and bade him deposit: The tall Rogue presented another Pistol; the lame Rogue rifled him; a Woman came up the Court; the tall Rogue threatned to shoot him, if he spoke; the lame Rogue felt for his Watch, but the String being in his Fob, and other People coming by, he went off; and then the tall Rogue, taking him (the Prosecutor) by the Shoulder, led him down the Court, and bade him go off quietly, or he was a dead Man. - I knew the Prisoners Haunts, and taking two Men to assist me, I went in search of 'em to

            's (a notorious Baudy-house) in Holsford's Alley in Drury-lane. This was abouthalf an Hour after Ten. I found no Body at Home but a Woman. I took a Turn in the Neighbourhood , and, posting my two Assistants in a proper Place (to avoid Suspicion) I came to the same House again. It was then about 10 or 15 Minutes past 11, and found 'em both sitting by the Fire. T hey asked me how I did, and if I had any thing to say to them? I pretended that I had got a Warrant to search for a Woman. They said, they believed them were more Whores and Thieves in Fleet-street, than in Drury-lane. I went out again to see for my Assistants, and ordered one of them to go into the Court, at one End, and one at the other, and so meet at Thomson's Door. At my return, Quan was standing at the End of the Alley: I seized him, and searching his Pockets, found some Gold and Silver, and this very batter'd, bent Half-crown. One of his Madams, who was standing by him, lent me this Paper to wrap it in. Then we went into the House, and took Conway. They have followed the Trade of dropping Half-crowns a pretty while. We carried them before Justice Mitford, and sent for the Prosecutor. When the Prosecutor came in, there was but one Candle, but three more were brought, and Quan was standing on one Side of the Prosecutor. I shew'd the batter'd Half-crown to the Prosecutor, and as soon as he saw it, he said, I'll swear to this. The Justice bade him see if he knew any Body there. He turned about, and taking a full View of Quan's Face, he swore positively, that Quan was one of 'em. You Rascal, says Quan, do you say that I held a Pistol to you? I never saw you in my Life. The Prosecutor, turning to Conway, said, And I believe this to be the other; but when he stooped to take the Money out of my Pocket, I thought his Crutch was longer then, than it appears to be now. To which Conway answer'd much as Quan had done; You Rascal, did I hold a Pistol to you? I never saw your Face before. And yet, next Day, one of 'em said to the Prosecutor, How could you be such a Rascal, to swear we robb'd you, when we won the Money of you at Cards, at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140032"></xptr> Mourning-Bush at Aldgate - Aldgate! said the other, No; it was Aldersgate, and the Drawer will swear it.

            . I went with the Constable to take the Prisoners. When they were examined before the Justice, they both said to the Prosecutor, Ye Rascal, did we hold Pistols to you? We never saw you in our Lives. But next day they both said they had won it of him at Cards, at the Mourning-Bush , the Day before the Robbery was committed.</p>

               <p>Quan. Last Tuesday Night, as I was going along Fleetstreet , I found Half-a-Crown, and taking it up, the Prosecutor cry'd Halves! I told him that as he was by when I took it up, I would give him half a Pint, with all my Heart; and in going along we met Conway , and so we all three went to the Mourning-Bush at Aldersgate, where we play'd at Cards, and staid till between 1 and 2 in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Nutton. It was not Tuesday Night, but Wednesday Night, that he shew'd me the Half Crown that he pick'd up.</p>
               <p>Quan. It was Wednesday Morning when we parted; and in the Afternoon Conway and I went to a House in Water-Lane, and there we staid till Eleven at Night.</p>

            . I was Nurse to a Gentlewoman (Mrs. Hill) who lies-in in Britain's Court in Water-Lane; and last Wednesday between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon, the Prisoners both came in and asked how my Mistress did? They were both to be Godfathers, but I suppose they came by Accident now, for I know of no Invitation. I never saw them before that Night. They went up one Pair of Stairs into the Room where she lay-in. She was a-bed and asleep. I desired them not to disturb her, and told them that

The 2 Prisoners, and the new-married Couple, and 2 or 3 more came over and supp'd at my Mistress's. They staid till within a Quarter of 11. I was there, and they were in the Room all the time.

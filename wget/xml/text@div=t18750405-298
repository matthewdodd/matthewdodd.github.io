I am twenty-five years old, and am married—the pri<lb></lb>soner is my father, and the prosecutrix my mother—I live in the next house to them, and my room adjoins theirs—on 15th February, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I thought I heard them quarrelling—I went into their room and saw my mother lying on the floor by the table, which was in the middle of the room—she was not sensible; she was bleeding from the head and face; her face was covered with blood—my father was sitting up on the floor, with one <hi rend="italic">leg</hi> under him, a little way from my mother, between her and the door—I said "Oh, father, have you done this?"—he did not answer me; he seemed to be asleep; he was not leaning against anything—I said again "What have you done, have you done this?"—he did not wake up of answer me—I then hallooed out for the police, or some one to come—be<lb></lb>fore that I asked him if he would go to bed, so that I could get some one; to see to my mother—he woke up then; he tried to get himself up, and he fell down again, and as he tried to get up he pulled his leg out and tried kick mother—I don't think he did it on purpose; she was close to him—laid hold of him and said "Father, what do you mean to do, do you mean to murder mother?"—he raised himself up and said "Yes; I will"—I laid hold of him and pulled him round by the bedstead, to get him away from the side of mother, and ran down stairs and had a fit.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 66, Camberwell Road—I was called in to examine Myra Reynolds, at the house, on the evening in question, about 8 o'clock—the police were there—she was lying on the floor drunk, wretchedly dirty and badly clad, with a cut mouth, blackened nose and eyes, that appeared to have been done with something blunt, as a fist, she had a cut on her left cheek, four cuts on the right side of her head, one on the cheek-was a deep cut about half an inch long, it went right through the flesh, it was such a cut as might have been inflicted by the; edge of this shovel, as were also those on the side of the head—the longest did not exceed an inch, the others varied from half an inch; one seemed to have exposed the bone, it had cut through the skin covering the bone, it did not go to the bone—there was no evidence of contusion about the head—I don't think that could have been done with the shovel; I saw the shovel, it had hair and blood on it—you can see the blood now—the woman was insensible, partly from drink—the blows must have been very violent, the weapon is light—there was danger from erysipelas or future injury to the bone, she is not well yet, but I think she will recover all right—she appeared to have been drinking very considerably.</p>

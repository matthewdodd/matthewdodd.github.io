               <p>Mrs. Smith. The prisoner being a customer, and I was without a servant, I sent for her to chair for me. She pretended to go home to suckle a child, and I gave her liberty so to do, on days; but I found she had no child to suckle: I missed a great number of things. I was in her room, when it was searched, and found a Ghentin handkerchief, and a tin dredging-box; she had one of my handkerchiefs about her neck; (produced and deposed to).</p>

               <p>I was a customer to Mrs. Smith: being a poor woman, and out of work, I asked her if she wanted a chair-woman? she said, she did; I said, I should be very glad to serve her. She sent for me on the Friday, about 11 o'clock, and I was there nine or ten days,: after that, they hired a maid; she came, and staid a day and a night, and went away. There were some odd things, which Mrs. Smith gave me; I went constantly with these handkerchiefs about my head and neck; I should have thought, if they had been hers, she would have owned them. She owned before my Lord Mayor, she lent me the pan; and the dredging-box I bought when I was first married: the handkerchiefs my mother gave me when they were very near new.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Did you lend her the pan?</p>

I am married and live at Sherborne, in Dorsetshire. I had been in London nearly a fortnight, and met the prisoner on the 1st of June, about two o'clock in the morning, in Smithfield: I asked if she could tell me where to get any thing to drink; she said at the Bull's Head public-house; I went there with her, and we had something to drink; she then asked me if I wanted a bed; I said I did, as I had not been in bed the night before; she got a bed in West-street, and she and I went there to sleep together, about half-past two o'clock. I had walked to town from Hampton that afternoon, but I could not find the place where I had lodged. I had some silver in my pocket, and a sovereign in a small box: I put the box under my pillow; I looked into it after I was in bed, and it had the money in it; when I awoke in the morning the box was gone; I said</p>
               <p>"I cannot find my box;" she said if I looked I should find it: I did find it but the sovereign was gone; I charged her with having it; she said she had got no sovereign at all, nor had she seen any; I took her to a public-house, and sent for an officer - she was searched and the sovereign found on her.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for, and found the prisoner in the public-house; she said she knew nothing about the sovereign - she had not got one; I said she had got it, and had better deliver it up: I took her to the watch-house; she took off her pocket, and laid it on the form, and in it there was seven pence halfpenny, two shillings, and a sovereign, loose, which she said a gentleman had given her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Salisbury-square, and a gentleman spoke to me - he took me to Turnagain-lane, and gave me a sovereign and 2 s.; I was then going home, and saw the prosecutor; I took him to a house, and we had a glass of spirits; he then asked if I could get him a bed: I took him to West-street: I saw some silver, but no gold about him.</p>

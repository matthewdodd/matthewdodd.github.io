                  </hi>. I live in James-street, Kensington, and am a saddler, on the night of the 7th of March I went to the Sell public-house, near Tothill-street, with Jane Bowden—I was half drunk—I went to sleep—I about say what time it was—I was awoke, and missed my money—I had about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there were two half-crown pieces, and the rest were shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the public-house, in New Tothill-street, that night—I saw the prosecutor with Bowden—in a quarter of an hour M'Bride came and spoke to Bowden—she took the newspaper, and stood before the prosecutor, and I saw Bowden take out the prosecutor's hand out of his pocket, and put her hand in three times, one time I saw a half-crown and when she got it out the third time she put it into her left breast, turned to M'Bride, and said, "Come on, it is all right, I have got it"—she was going out—I stopped her, and said, "It is not all right"—I sent for the policeman—M'Bride turned and said, "It serves you right; I told you How it would be"—Bowden resisted as much as she could, and tried to bite me—the officer came, and I told him to look into her bosom and he would find some money.</p>

I caught hold of the skirts of his coat and cried murder! he threw me down in the passage, I held him fast by the coat.</p>
               <p>Did any assistance come to you? - Not directly; I held him fast till we got to the street door, and he cut me with something over my arm, but what he had in his hand I did not see.</p>
               <p>Was it much cut? - It was not much cut, but it was very much bruised.</p>
               <p>Court. It could not be with his hand? - My gown was cut through, and my arm bruised very much in several places besides, but I do not know that he struck me any more than once; I went to catch hold of his side, and he got from me; he went to give me another push, and I could not hold him any longer, and I ran out after him and cried out murder! and a man crossed the street and took him; I saw him stopped, he was never out of my sight; he carried nothing out with him; when I returned, there was a suit of clothes of my master's packed up in the prisoner's bag, and another suit put out of the chest ready to put up, they had been in the drawer of the bureau.</p>
               <p>Was the drawer locked or open? - It was not locked, he left his hat behind him, he was without a hat when he was taken, and the hat was in the room when I returned back.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Prisoner's Council. Are not there some lodgers in your house? - Yes, the whole is let out to lodgers, but only five rooms, it is a very large house.</p>
               <p>Were all your lodgers at home? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was he acquainted with any of them? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>The lodgers come in and out when they please at all proper hours? - Yes, till twelve at night.</p>
               <p>You saw nothing at all in his hand? - No.</p>
               <p>You had a light in your other hand, had not you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If he had had a hanger, or any instrument of that sort, you must have seen it, I should think? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was certainly terrified? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Was you sure in the street it was the same person that was stopped? - Yes, and the other got off.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure you saw him come out of your master's room? - Yes.</p>

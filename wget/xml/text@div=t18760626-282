                  </hi>. I am a butcher in High Street, Deptford, on Thursday night, 15th June, about 10.30 I drove to Church Street, Greenwich, with a horse and cart, which I left outside a door with a; horse rug, umbrella, and whip in it—the prisoner was standing round the corner—he said "Shall I mind your horse, Mr. Martin"—I said "No, my horse does not require any minding"—I afterwards went to a public-house, three doors from where I had been stopping—I stayed there five minutes—on going out I missed the rug—the horse was backed about 5 or 6 yards, under the shade of a lamp—I also missed an umbrella and a waterproof—they were in the cart—a constable came up and said "Have you missed anything"—I said I had, mentioning the things—he said "This is the man who has taken them"—the prisoner was a few yards behind—the constable took him into cus<lb></lb>tody—the articles are my property;.</p>

I was" on duty this night in Church Street, Greenwich, at about 11 o'clock—I saw the horse and cart there—there was no one in it—I saw the prisoner on the other side of the road—I saw him examine the whip—he backed the horse about 5 yards into the shadow of a lamp—he got hold of the. horse rug and put it under his coat and went into a narrow court—I did not lose sight of him—he was not there a second—he came back and took something else out—I spoke to the prosecutor—I found the property in a court—on the way to the station, the prisoner said "God blind you, I shall have you up and down before I go."</p>

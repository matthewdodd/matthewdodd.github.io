On the 2d of July, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came in; Macquire called for a quartern of gin, which came to four-pence; She gave me a half-crown, which I put into my apron pocket - I had no other there. They drank the gin together, stopped full an hour at the bar, and then called for a quartern and a half more, which came to sixpence. Macquire paid for it with another half-crown, which I put into my apron pocket. Another woman came in, they drank together, and went outside; came back, and Welch called for another quartern. While I was drawing it, one of the three put down another half-crown - I put it with the others, and Welch took the change up. I had no others, but what they paid me. I afterwards examined them, found them all bad, and gave them to the officer.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Hall. After the prisoners had gone out they returned; Welch called for a pint of beer, and paid me a half-crown; I found it was a bad one, and told her it was not worth a penny - she gave me twopence halfpenny. I observed a small cotton bag in Macquire's hand. During this time another woman came in, had a pint of beer, and gave me sixpence; I said it was a bad one; Wortley took it, gave it to the woman, and she ran away. This made my sister look at the half-crowns, and she found them bad. One of the prisoners had gone out at the side door, leading to Field-lane; I think it was Macquire, Wortley went out and brought her back. My brother at night found a bag, at the side door, which was the same I saw Macquire with; it contained one half-crown, and some sixpences, folded in separate papers.</p>

            . I keep the One Tun. My sister gave me the sixpence, and I examined my wife's half-crowns, they were all bad; before I could examine them, they all ran out in different directions; I gave them to Dent. Wortley brought one of them back, she then threw six good shillings and one bad half-crown upon the counter. When I went to shut the door, about half-past ten o'clock, I found the bag which I produce; it has a bad half-crown, and a quantity of sixpences, with paper between them.</p>

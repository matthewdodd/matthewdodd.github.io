I was out of place on the 20th of January. I have been living at the City of London Tavern, since I have been a gentleman's servant - I left there the beginning of the summer, and since that I have been at home with my father at Bury St. Edmunds - he is a bookbinder. On the 20th of January, about one o'clock at night, I was in <placeName id="t18280221-51-crimeloc271">Fenchurch-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. How were you knocked down? A. I received a blow behind my head quite suddenly - I could not tell whether it was from a fist or what - it knocked me completely down; the blow was on the back part of my skull; and when I was down, I received a blow on the forehead; I could not tell what it was from - I resisted as much as I could, and recovered my feet; I can swear there were two men about me; but there might be three - while I was down my watch, chain, seal, and ring were taken from my fob;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210061"></xptr>I felt them drawn out by the man while I was down - I struggled and got up - one ran one way, and one another; there might be a third man - I followed the prisoner, who was one of them - I called "Watch!" and "Stop thief!" and pursued the prisoner - I am confident he is one of the men who assisted in robbing me; I cannot say whether he is the man who struck me - but he is one who robbed me. I was not above ten or twenty yards from him when I got up - I kept him in sight all the way, till the watchman took him; I swear he is one of the men - when he was taken, I asked if he knew any thing of it. He said he was the man who took my watch from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you ask if he knew any thing of it? A. I mean, I asked if he had got my watch, hoping to get it again. He said No; he had not got it, but he was the man who took it from me, and gave it to his companion, John Francis - I have not recovered it.</p>

            . I am an officer of the ward. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house - I searched him but found no watch - he said, he had been to the Cobourg Theatre. I said, "Now you want your friends - where are they? "he said he went with three young women. I said, "Where do they live? I will send for them; "he said they lived at Aldgate; and when I said I would send for them, he seemed much agitated. The prosecutor said,"Give me my watch." I said I had searched him, and he had not got it. The prisoner said he should have the watch by twelve o'clock to-morrow. I said, "You have not got it."He said, "I'll tell you all about it: a man named John Francis has got it, and if you go to Bishopsgate Church-yard you will be sure to meet him." I went with the prosecutor, but did not meet him - I went at two o'clock to Savage-court, where John Francis lived, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He promised me what he would do, if I could get the watch. I said, I happened to know the young man who was in the custody of another watchman - they let him go, and took me. Witness. That is not true.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Gracechurch-street; at the end of Fenchurch-street, I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running - he was the first person running, and ran against me. I prepared myself for him; and when he saw me get close to him, he crossed - I followed him; he turned round to me; put his head down, and his hand out to touch me in the breast - I caught hold of him, and asked what was the matter - he said it was nothing but a fight - I took him up to the crowd, and they said he was the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is false - I stopped directly he took me; he said, "What is the matter?" I said "There was a cry of Stop thief! and I think there is a fight or robbery - now take me to the mob, and see if I am the man;" he took me to the mob, and delivered me to another watchman; they had the young man in custody - he went away. I am a Jew - it is our holidays, and my friends are at the Synagogue. The prosecutor was quite intoxicated; he fell down twice, and was obliged to lay hold of the officer's arm; he told the Lord Mayor he was intoxicated, but just as he was saying so the Lord Mayor was inquiring for the watchman, and it was not put down in the deposition.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTOR. It is false; I did not fall down at all - I was not intoxicated.</p>

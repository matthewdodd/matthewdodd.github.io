                  </hi>. I live at Wellesley-terrace, Royal-street, Woolwich—on the morning of 9th of this month, about 2 o'clock, I was awoke by the ringing of my door-bell—I came downstairs, opened the street door, and found two policemen at the gate—they called my attention to the breakfast-room window being open—I let them in, and in the drawing-room they found the prisoner under a couch—I had gone to bed that night about half-past 11—the window was shut then; I am not prepared to say whether it was fastened or not—the shutters inside the window were open, pushed up</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, R</hi> 14). On the morning of the 9th I was passing Mr. Sargent's house, and saw his breakfast-room window open—I called him up, and searched the house—we found the prisoner under a couch, in the drawing-room—I asked him to come out two or three times—he did not make any move, so I moved the couch—I then asked him what he did there—he said he did not know how he came there, he was sure—he acted as if he was drunk—I think he was sober—I searched him, and found a lid of a card-case—I afterwards found a glove in the back yard—he must have been at the back of the house first—I traced a foot<lb></lb>mark from the back to the front; somebody had been there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had been drinking for two or three days, and at the time the offence was committed I was under the influence of liquor, for which I am now sorry; I did not mean to steal anything from the house; I can't answer how I came by the lid of the card-case, as I do not re<lb></lb>ember taking it from any place; I don't recollect in what way I got inside the house, and when the policeman woke me I thought I was in my own quarters, as I had my clothes off, except my trousers and shirt; if I had wanted to steal, I should not have left my jacket in one place, my cap in another, and my boots and stockings in another, as the policeman said he found them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lead and glass merchant, of 12, Commercial-street, Whitechapel—on Saturday, the 4th June, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was brought by the prisoner, and handed to me by my clerk—the prisoner was in the warehouse—I went to him with the letter, and asked him if he brought it from Mr. Dears-ley? he said, "Yes"—I said that Mr. Dearsley had no account with us, that we were unacquainted with his form of order, but that we would send them on, and I told him that attempts had been made to obtain goods from us by means of forged orders—he replied that they were for a country order, and he was very anxious to have them that they might go away that evening—it was then 3 o'clock—I said my man should put them up immediately, and I would send them round; I added, "If you will wait a minute my man shall accompany you"—he said, "Get them ready, I will just step out and come in again in a minute or two"—I said, "I would rather you wait, it will not take us more than a minute or two"—he said he would: step out, and that he would not be more than a minute—I said, "I do not like your going out, and if you go I shall suspect you"—he then said he would remain—I told my foreman to get the things ready—the prisoner again seemed very anxious to leave, but I put my hand upon his shoulder and said, "No you shall not, I now suspect this case"—I followed him till I met a policeman, and I gave him into custody, upon which the prisoner replied that as the policeman was off duty he could not take him—after leaving our warehouse, and before meeting the policeman,—the prisoner said, "I do not know what I am walking with you for"—I replied that I did.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Great Turnstile. On the 14th of April I put an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—on the 15th I received a note; this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"If you will call on Mr. Knight, 6, Church-street, Soho, between twelve and three on Monday, he can inform you of a situation likely to suit you"—on the 17th I went, and saw the prisoner—he answered to the name of Mr. Knight—he told me it was the messengership of an insurance office, at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I was to give him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get it—I told him I must consider of it, and asked how he was going to get it—he said through the interest he had with the clerk of the insurance office—on the 21st I law him again—he wished to have testimonials as to my character—I brought him one as to my respectability, and he referred me to Mr. Parker, whom I called on three times, but never could see him at home—I told the prisoner so—he said he was gone into the country for a week, and he thought we could arrange the busi<lb></lb>ness</p>

Dear Sir,—I am instructed by the gentleman who will appoint you to your situation, that he would wish to decline an interview until Monday, the 8th of May, at half-past eight in the morning, when you will be immedi<lb></lb>ately appointed, and commence your duties from that time. I am, &amp;c., Francis W. Knight."—Next day I called on the prisoner, and told him I did not feel satisfied—he said it was all perfectly right—I pressed him several timet to tell me what insurance it was—he said the National Life Insurance—he went to a drawer, and took out a dozen papers—he selected one, and said that was it—it was in King William-street—I left him, and felt satisfied—in five or six days I called again—he had then left—on Monday, the 8th of May, I received this letter, which is in the prisoner's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Mon<lb></lb>day. <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR</hi>,—A temporary difficulty is the sole cause of my not being able to see you to-day. I sincerely regret that it should have happened, but if you will have a little patience you will soon be made straight and comfort<lb></lb>able. I am, &amp;c., F. W. Knight."—A few days after that I put an adver<lb></lb>tisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> in hopes of detecting him—I used different initials, and a different place, and I received this other letter—"To A. Z. 7, Great Union-street, Newington-causeway, May 11,1843. <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR</hi>,—If you will call at the above address between the hours of eleven and two o'clock to-morrow or the follow<lb></lb>ing day, I can introduce you to a messengership of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week, if you can give satisfactory references.

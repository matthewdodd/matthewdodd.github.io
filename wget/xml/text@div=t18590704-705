                  </hi>. I am a chemist, and live at Brixton-hill—on Wednesday afternoon, 22d June, the prisoner came to my shop between 3 and 4 o'clock—he asked for a seidlitz-powder—my assistant served him, and then brought me a shilling—I examined it, and it was bad—he said the prisoner had given it him, and he had given him a bad shilling three or four weeks before—the prisoner did not make any reply to that—I had seen the</p>

               <p>prisoner in my shop on the first occasion, three or four weeks before—my assistant served him, and a bad shilling was then shown to me, and it was returned to the prisoner—on this 22d I sent for a constable—we were some time before we could get one, and the prisoner wanted to go out for a necessary purpose—he went towards the garden fence—I should not think he was gone more than a minute and a half—when he returned I said to him, "You have been out to get rid of some bad money"—he did not make any reply, and I went out in the garden, and looking over the fence where he had stopped I saw a paper parcel—I went round to the gate and picked up the parcel—it was close to the fence—I found it contained three bad half-crowns and a bad shilling—I showed the parcel to the prisoner, and said, "Do you know this?"—he made no reply—I went behind the desk, and he came towards me and made an attempt to take the parcel from me—I put it in my pocket—I afterwards opened it in his presence, and I said, "I think this will give you six months, old fellow"—he said he might as well have six months' board and lodging as others—he said he got the shilling in change for a sovereign, at Bromley—he afterwards gave me a good half-crown to pay for the seidlitz-powder—the policeman came, and the prisoner was given into custody—I gave the policeman the shilling that the prisoner had given to West and the half-crowns and shillings which I had found in the parcel—the half-crowns were wrapped up in paper, each piece separately.</p>

I am assistant to the last witness—the prisoner came to the shop on Wednesday, the 22d, between 3 and 4 o'clock—he asked for a seidlitz-powder—I gave him one done up in paper, and he said he wished to drink it in the shop—I mixed it for him, and he gave me a bad shilling—I gave the shilling to Mr. Swire, telling him that I believed this was the same party that came some time ago for the same article, and then tendered a bad shilling—Mr. Swire told the prisoner to wait, and he would send for a policeman—the prisoner went towards the door, and said he wanted to go—Mr. Swire told him to remain where he was till the policeman came—the prisoner said he must go, and he went out, and re<lb></lb>turned in a very short time—I don't think I saw the packet of coins opened—the prisoner afterwards tendered me a good half-crown—I gave him no change at the time, but he had it afterwards—the price of the seidlitz-powder was 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

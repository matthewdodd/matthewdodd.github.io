               <p>W. Ross. No, not as I know of: that very day week she took the room I had word brought me she was taken with a warrant, for robbing a gentleman of a great quantity of silk: I went to one Murrell, in the Tower, whom she calls her husband, to enquire where she was; he told me she was not his wife; he said he heard she was in Clerkenwell-bridewell. I went there to her, and asked her for the key of the room, and where the goods were; she delivered me the key, and said she had made away with the saucepan and a sheet: I came home and looked in the room; there I found all the things, mentioned in the indictment, were gone: she told me she had pawned the sheet at Mr. Taylor's, Catharine-wheel-alley, Bishopsgate street, and the saucepan at Mr. Dellope's. I went to her again, and told her the other things were missing; then she owned she had pawned them also, and told me where; the pail and bellows at Mr. Dellope's, and the box-iron at Mr. Taylor's: we found them accordingly.</p>

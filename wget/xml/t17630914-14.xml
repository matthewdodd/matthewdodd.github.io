             was with me, the prisoner met us. He first stopt me, and demanded my money; he held a knife in his hand, which he took out from under his waistcoat; he had 2 waistcoats on, but never a coat; I made all the haste I could to get my money out being frightened; in the mean time he went to Mrs. Cook, and took her silver buckles out of her shoes, then he came to me again, and I gave him my money, as I thought, I had 12 or 13 s. 6 d. in my pocket, but when I came before the Justice, I found half a guinea and a shilling in my pocket; then he went to Mrs. Cook and demanded her money, after that he came to me again and demanded my purse, I told him I had none, and held open my pocket that he might feel; then he went to Mrs. Cook and demanded her purse, she told him she had none; then he came again to me and demanded my bundle which I had in my hand, in which were a counterpane, a silk gown, and the other things mentioned. Then he made towards Newington Green, I seemed to follow him, he was displeased and said, I must go back again, then he said, do you go towards Newington Green, and I shall go the other way; he went towards Canbury-house, I stood about a minute, he said, if you follow me, I have another or two of my comrades that will meet me; I followed him, he turned and saw I followed him, he held up what I took to be a knife, then I turned myself as if going towards Newington Green, he ran as hard as he could, and I followed him at a distance, thinking some body or other might come to my assistance; he was got near Canbury-house, when I was got to the last field towards it, I ran as hard as I could, and called, stop thief! a soldier<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176309140008"></xptr> and two or three men ran out of a house, I pointed which way he was gone, he had just turned the corner, they ran and took him, he had dropped the bundle before they laid hold of him.

                  </hi>. I keep the Grapes public-house, in Lime-street. I knew the deceased, William Gaywood, about eighteen months. On Wed<lb></lb>nesday, the 21st of September, about half-past ten o'clock, he came to my house—he was very tipsy—he was a sort of jobbing man in the market—he had left the situation of a journeyman butcher three of four weeks be<lb></lb>fore—there was nobody in the house when he came in—he had half-a-pint</p>

               <p>of beer, which he drank off at one draught—he then sat down, and was dozing off to sleep—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, you had better get up and go home, you have had more now than will do you good"—I said so two or three times—he made no reply—in a minute or two after, the prisoner came in and looked at him, and Gaywood muttered something—I do not know what it was—the prisoner said, "What do you want? what do you want?" the prisoner was the worse for liquor, but not near so bad as the deceased, who was beastly drunk—Gaywood said he should like to give him a d—d good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi>, and Watkins directly hit right in the face—I directly ran round the counter, and said, "I am going to have no fighting here, and if you want to fight, go out"—Watkins went out—I put Gaywood out gently—I just took him by the shoulder, and walked him out—about ten minutes after this, my wife came down stairs, and I went out to protect my side window, as a great mob had collected—there was a regular fight—Gaywood was standing up—I saw no second, nor any body with Watkins I saw the last blow given, just as I went out—Gaywood was standing with his hands down—Watkins walked towards him in a fighting attitude and hit him with his left hand in the face—I did not see Gaywood put as his hands to defend himself—I should have seen him if he had—I consider he did not put himself in any attitude—he fell back ward on the flag-stones very heavy—I went in directly, and saw nothing more—no blow was gives by Gaywood in my house before Watkins struck him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased in the hospital—he came there on the Thursday morning, about a quarter to eleven o'clock, the day after the fight—I found him in an insensible state, evi<lb></lb>dently labouring under compression of the brain—we were aware it arose from violence, from the statement made at the time, and seeing external marks of violence—he had a black eye—the pupils were dilated, but they contracted a little to the light—I am perfectly satisfied there was injury of the brain—we made incisions to ascertain if we could detect any fracture—he rallied during the time we bled him—we bled him largely, and it re<lb></lb>lieved him—he would try to speak, but we never could get any thing dis<lb></lb>tinct from him—he at last became as bad as ever, he had paralysis at Friday, and died on Saturday—there was a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—there was a fissure on the right side of the skull, extending not very far—it was at the anterior angle where he had fallen—we took off the scalp and opened the skull, and on the left side, the opposite side to the fracturs there was an extensive laceration of the left hemisphere of the brain—there was an effusion of blood on and beneath the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>—I have no doubt his death was caused by some injury he had received—a heavy fell on a pavement would account for the injury of the skull—it might pro<lb></lb>bably be worse if the man was drunk than if sober—I am clearly of opi<lb></lb>nion</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the deceased and Watkins outside the public-house, on the morning in question—I cannot say which came out first, for five or six, or perhaps more, came out together, and I saw them collected about the door—I did not see either of them come out—when I first observed them together, they both appeared in a sort of spar<lb></lb>ring attitude, with open hands—they were not three yards from the door—I observed two persons backing the prisoner, urging him on to fight; and one supported Gaywood—after a little sparring they commenced fighting with doubled fists—Gaywood clenched his fist for about two rounds—they had a regular fight—Gaywood had the worst of it—after about two rounds. they made a sort of stand-still, and the deceased was in a state of stupor, not able to speak, and stood with his arms alongside him, supported by a man who was holding him up to be struck—he could neither speak, stand, nor walk—they stood for a minutes or two in that state, when the two per<lb></lb>sons who were backing the prisoner urged him, on to strike Gaywood again, and he did strike him a blow—the deceased did not raise his hand—he had not power—the prisoner struck him a severe blow on the temple, and he fell backwards lifeless on the pavement, his coming on the pavement with a very severe concussion.</p>

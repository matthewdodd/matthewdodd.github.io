               <p>Prisoner. I am not the man: I was committed by a prosecutor from Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Russell.) Is he the man? - A. He was not in soldier's clothes at that time, and I really cannot say; he was dressed in very shabby clothes.</p>
               <p>Hixon. He is very much like the man in the face; but he is so altered, from being very dirty at the time he was taken, that I cannot ascertain; he is very much like the man, but the man that I took was very much knock-knee'd.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kirby. This man is very straight.</p>
               <p>Hixon. Then he is not the man.</p>

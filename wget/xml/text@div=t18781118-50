I lire 16, Ashdown Street, Haverstock Hill, and am a clerk at the North Western Railway—on the evening of 1ST November I was at the Westminster Aquarium and left at 11 o'clock, and went to supper at a public-house at the corner of Bridge Street and King Street—at about 12 o'clock I walked slowly towards Leicester Square—my watch was in my waistcoat pocket—it had a black guard—I saw seven or eight people talking outside the Alhambra, I went up to within about three feet to listen, when the prisoner struck me in my stomach and I fell on my back—I had not said a word to him—I got up and found my coat unbuttoned and my watch gone—I found a policeman standing there, and he took the prisoner—just before that I took hold of a woman, and said, "I think you have got my watch"—she commenced to cry and said she knew nothing about it, and I did not charge her—the prisoner was standing close by and no doubt heard this—she was one of those outside the Alhambra talking—I am not aware that the prisoner made any answer when I charged him—a cabman named Hurst came up about the same time as the policeman—I had had four or five glasses during the evening—my watch was safe before I came into Leicester Square.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I should have told you if I had not been sober—I left home between 7 and 8 in the evening—I dined between 1 and 2 and was at work all the afternoon—I got to the Aquarium between 8 and 9—I met with two friends—the sisters of one of them keep a stall there, those were the only ladies I spoke to—I had about two glasses of ale, and left when the place closed—one of my friends supped with me—I had two or three glasses of ale with my supper—we had it in the bar—we sat and had a smoke after—I had nothing to drink between there and Leicester Square—I did not speak to anybody in Parliament Street—I was going to walk part of the way and then have a cab—I looked at my watch in Parliament Street, it was then about 12.30—it was a gold watch with a white face, and a vulcanite chain to hook in the button—I am certain I went through St. Martin's Court—I did not wish to go through Seven Dials-—I am under the im<lb></lb>pression that I was walking in the direction of the crowd—I did not go into Leicester Square to look for a woman—I lost no money—the policeman was standing close by when the altercation took place—the prisoner was not smoking—he was standing with his face towards me—I did not run against him—I did not notice him quarrelling or with speaking to the others—he had a walking-stick—he did not strike me with that, "but with his fist in the pit of the stomach—I did not see the stick used—the blow gave me a sudden shock—I don't know that I was stunned—I don't think my coat was unbuttoned while I was on the ground, but immediately before---</p>

               <p>I did not see any one else do it—I did not see any of the women come near me while I was on the ground—I fell with my head towards the Alhambra and away from the crowd—one of the witnesses picked my cap up—I was excited—I wish I had given the woman in charge—she wag the next nearest to me—it is difficult to give people in charge without you are sure—I am sure the prisoner knocked me down, but I am not sure that he took my watch—I am sure the watch was not gone before—it was a cold night rather, and I had only one coat on and I kept it buttoned—the prisoner did not run away—he went quietly with the policeman. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. No one pushed against me that I remember—I buttoned my coat after looking at my watch, and it was so when I came into Leicester Square—I came in at the corner of Leicester Square—I don't know the names of the streets in that neighbourhood—I went down a turning very near Trafalgar Square—I thought it was St Martin's Court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabdriver, of 22, Little Guildford Street—on the morning of 2nd November I was in Leicester Square on my cab against the kerb, when I saw a disturbance about two doors from the Alhambra—there were about four men and four women, and the prisoner amongst them—I saw the prisoner speak to a stoutish woman—I did not see a pipe in the prisoner's mouth—I saw him hit the prosecutor with his fist in the stomach and knock him backwards—the prosecutor had done nothing to him—I jumped off my cab, I picked his hat up, and saw another man come to do so, but I was first, and he and the others ran away—a constable came up and the prosecutor ran after the stout woman and got hold of her, and said "I think you have got my watch"—that was the stout woman to whom the prisoner had been speaking—she began to scream and said that she had not seen it, and he let go of her and came back—the constable had got the prisoner, and the prosecutor gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Crow-examined</hi>. At the police-court I did not say anything about the female speaking to the prisoner—I didn't know it was anything—I have not talked to anybody about the matter since—they never asked me the question—my cab was two doors from the entrance to the Alhambra—the crowd was in front of me—I had not been out for a fortnight or three weeks—the females were third-class we will say—they looked like women of the town—there were one or two other men besides the prisoner—I saw a stick in his hand—no pipe—I fancy he put the stick in his left hand and hit the prosecutor with his right—the prosecutor was standing behind—I swear he did not strike the prisoner—I saw him all the time he was there—I did not see the prosecutor speak to any one—I was perfectly sober—the prosecutor was excited by the blow, but not with liquor that I saw—I don't think the prisoner was the worse for drink.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I saw the whole thing clearly.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman C</hi> 215). I was on duty at the time and place in question, and saw the altercation two doors on the south side of the Alhambra—there were about four men and four women—I saw the prosecutor standing there and also the prisoner, who struck the prosecutor somewhere about the chest—I came up and caught hold of the prisoner—I was in uniform—the others dispersed quickly—the prosecutor caught hold of a stoutish woman close by—he then came back and said "I will charge the prisoner"—I took him into custody for knocking the prosecutor down at first, and he then gave him into charge for stealing his watch—he said he was innocent and I took him to the station.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. On the way to the station the prisoner said that the prosecutor had cut his lip—I could not see that it was bleeding—he had a thick stick in his hand—it is not uncommon for a crowd to assemble there, that time of night—the prisoner did not run away—I did not get hold of the woman—I found no watch on the prisoner—I found about 13 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze—I searched the neighbourhood for the watch in vain, and it has not yet been found—I should say the prosecutor had had two or three glasses, but he was not drunk—I should not like to say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Inspector Shepherd took the charge—he is not here—I was there—the prisoner did not call any one's attention to his lip—I saw no pipe.</p>

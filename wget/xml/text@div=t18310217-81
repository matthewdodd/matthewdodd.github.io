               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How many persons occupied this room? A.

            . I keep the house - the prosecutor told me he had lost money, and wished me to witness his marking twoshillings and a sixpence; he put them into his breeches pocket - when the other young man, who sleeps with the prisoner, had gone out, I concealed myself under the stairs, and in ten minutes I saw the prisoner come out of his room, without his shoes, and go into Dovey's room, which is on the same floor; he remained there a few minutes, and I heard some money chink - he then went into his own room, and shut the door; I went down and told my husband - we then went up to his room, and saw him brushing his clothes with some brushes, which he had taken from Devey's room; we asked what he had taken - he said nothing, and we might search him; he turned out his pockets and there was nothing there, but there was some silver in his hat - we sent for the officer, and the money was taken which had the marks on it; I believe the prisoner was in distress - he had a good character, and this was his first offence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could not the other man have gone into the room? A. The other came down at nine, and went out to breakfast, and then I stood under the stairs - Dovey returned at half-past nine o'clock, and then the money had been found.</p>

I am sixteen years of age, and am niece to Mrs. Cockle—on Sunday evening, 10th February, my aunt went to chapel between six and half-past, leaving me and my cousin Emily in the house—I bolted the door after my aunt as she went out, also bolted the back door—we were sitting in the room over the kitchen, beside the table—we heard a noise like the fire-irons;—I listened, and we heard two men coming up stairs—it was between eight and half-past—I ran into the shop and screamed, "Father!" half a dozen times, and "Murder!" twice, and the other man came and dragged me into the parlour—before he had got me into the parlour he put a handkerchief over my nose and mouth, and then put me on the sofa and told me to look up—he said, "You know Richard, don't you? there's Richard," and when I looked up I saw Richard—the prisoner is Richard—he is the one I saw—the other man told me that my aunt was dying, and whilst he was telling us that Richard lit the candle by the gas and went up stairs—he was there about a few minutes, and then we heard him come down again—I heard him go into aunt's bedroom—the other man said, "Go and put on your things and come with us, because your aunt wants you directly;" so we put on our things, and then we all went out together, I and my cousin and the two men—I shut the door and told my cousin to fasten it, because she knew how to do it; but she could not—I said, "We cannot fasten it;" and not Richard, but the other one fastened it—he locked it—I had the key—I gave it to him to lock the door—when we got to the top of the street they both told us to wait there till they went and fetched a cab—we waited there about a quarter of an hour; then I and my cousin went up to the chapel to see if we could fetch my aunt home, and when we got there there was no one there, so we came back again and tried to un<lb></lb>lock the door—Richard did not come back at all—my aunt then came home.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Walworth Road—my papa is manager of the Canterbury Hall, and I was serving there—I know the prisoner by sight only; I have seen him there nearly every Sunday—I saw him there on Sunday, 10th February, from eight to a quarter past—I cannot say for certain—he was standing at the side of the engine and the bar—I remember the day, because it was the last Sunday that I was at the bar.</p>

Q.</hi> Were there a great number of people you know by sight there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was Saturday week when I was first asked about his being there—I do not know who spoke to me about it: it was the man who subpoenaed me—he came and asked me if I knew Mr. Copland—I said, "I do not know the name"—he showed me a portrait, and I said directly that I knew him, and then I remembered that he was there at a quarter past eight.</p>

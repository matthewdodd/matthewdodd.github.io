(<hi rend="italic">This bill was dated 3rd July, 1866, at one month, accepted by J. Read, payable to Edward Brashier, or order, and endorsed by Edward Oliver and Edward Brashier.</hi>. I think the bill was presented when it became due—I can't now say by whom—I think it was by Gardner, but I won't be positive—I know Gardner, I have seen him several times during the examinations—I believe he came once about the bill, and I told him I had not got the money to meet it—after that Brashier, or Heath, came to me, I can't say which; they often came to my shop—I have paid them money since that, I can tell the amounts by re<lb></lb>ferring to my book—I paid up to April 5th this year, I paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in nine small payments—I have also supplied them with fish, the last supply was on 6th April, it began on 15th December—the total amount is 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in about thirty-four deliveries—they often used to take it with them—they came together most times—that applies to the cash payments also—I have delivered cash and fish to Brashier alone, and to Heath also, but it was all put down to Brashier's account—I had no particular orders to do that—I paid the money and supplied the fish on account of the bill—when the bill became due I was asked for the cash and told them I would pay them as soon as I could—in giving the fish I thought I was liquidating the bill—I don't remember whether they told me so—I have sometimes sent the fish to Heath's residence in Marylebone Road—Brashier was living in Portsdown Road.</p>

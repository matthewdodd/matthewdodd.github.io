               <p>read the list, and said, "I do not see the name there; I thought it began with an 'S'; I do not intend to say any more about it; not without I am promised that I shall not be prosecuted"—I told him that I had seen the solicitor, but I was not authorised to do anything of the kind—he said, "I know who had the wearing apparel and the jewellery; I saw the gold being melted, and the diamonds sorted out into different carats"—I said, "What do you mean by different carats?"—he said, "Different sizes put together; some of the emerald and diamond necklaces we sold whole, as they were, for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a Jew who lived on the first floor in Bishopsgate Street"—I said, "Can you tell me which house?"—he said, "No; and some of it was thrown down a watercloset in Spitalfields, and the diamond eardrops were thrown away in a field at Whitechapel"—I said, "Can you tell me where?"—he said, "No, I cannot; but if you will let me out of here, I will try and find out"—I said, "I have nothing at all to do with that"—he said, "When they brought the box to my place, I told them to take it out, I would have nothing to do with it; they said they had carried it far enough, and did not intend to carry it further; it was taken into the parlour and broken open; and when I saw what it was, I told them I would have nothing to do with it; we thought they were theatrical dresses, and belonged to some theatrical person; the jewellery was taken away in a red handkerchief and the wearing apparel was put into a black bag."</p>

I washed occasionally for Mrs. Jackson—I have looked at the handkerchiefs produced—I think I have seen several of them before, but this plain one I think I saw a year and eight months ago—I remember Mrs. Jackson's baby wearing this frock this time twelve months—I once saw two diamonds in Mrs. Jackson's possession; that must have been about last May or April twelve months, I cannot say to a week or a month; they were not set in anything, they were quite naked—the first or second week in Feb. last she gave me a few things to take charge of; they consisted of some jewellery, a few gold rings, some brooches, a few little lockets, some silver tea spoons, little trifling things; the greatest portion of them was in a copper tea kettle—the rings were set with pearls and different coloured stones, there were no diamonds—I never saw this black shawl till I saw it at Worship Street Police Court—I met Mrs. Jackson on one occasion while</p>

             and William Froggatt, I live in Three King court, Lombard street. The prisoner was our <rs id="t18070218-8-deflabel44" type="occupation">servant</rs>

On the 6th of this month Mr. Griffiths and Mr. Nowland, two officers of Lambeth street, informed me that they had one of our men in custody; I attended at the office, and saw the prisoner at the bar; there was some soap produced there, I believe it was our soap, there was some yellow marks upon it, that seem to correspond with the soap we had at home; this soap happened to be put in a frame that had palm soap, and that palm soap had adhered to that soap.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any soap - A. We did not miss it, through the quantity that we had in the house.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer of Whitechapel. - A. Yes; I produce some soap that I found in the prisoner's coat pocket. On the 5th of February, at eight o'clock at night; I was in company with Griffiths; we apprehended him close to a receiving house.</p>
               <p>Q. You took him on suspicion. - A. Yes; he resisted a good deal, he would not be searched; we took him into a public house, opposite where we apprehended him; we found these cakes of soap upon him, he confessed that he had stolen it from his master, we apprehended him; we asked him whether he had sold any at that same shop before, he said never but twice; we asked him his master's name, he said he lived in the city, but he did not chuse to tell us his name; he said if we would let him go we might have the soap. He produced two half guineas, he said he would give us all the money he had in his pocket.</p>

               <p>PETER NORRIS. I work for the prosecutor, I manufacture the soap from these bars into squares for sale. To the best of my knowledge it appears to me to be my master's property.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (read in court). My lord, and gentlemen of the jury. - Being truly sensible of the enormity of my crime, I have nothing to say in extenuation of the punishment I deserve; I only plead for mercy for the sake of my distressed wife and children. Grant that I may be permitted to the benefit of clergy, and be once more restored to my family, and I will endeavour to render myself a useful member to society. Mercy is all I want; it is what God will shew, and man can grant.</p>

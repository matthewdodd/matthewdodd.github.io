               <p>Was your house broke open last month and when? - The 22d of November. I have a wife and three children; no servant. I believe we went to bed about eleven o'clock at night; there are lodgers above stairs. I believe they were come in.</p>
               <p>Were the doors fast? - They were.</p>
               <p>Can the lodgers let themselves into the house after you had gone to bed, without calling you up? - They can't, because it bolts within side; we always bolt it when we go to bed. I have only a man and his wife lodgers that belong to me, they have lived in the house many years; they have others, I believe. I am the house-keeper only. I heard no noise in the night. I was up first in the morning; I got up as soon as it was light enough for me to see to work, about seven or eight o'clock. When I came down stairs out of the dining-room where I slept, and opened the back-room that goes into the parlour, I saw the window quite wide shoved up; I went first into the parlour, the window shutters and window were open. I did not see any violence.</p>
               <p>How is it fastened? - There are two sashes and a post between them, and there are two bolts come a cross and fasten into it; one window was shut down, the other quite open.</p>
               <p>If fastened, how can it be opened without any appearance of violence upon it? - I am not acquainted with that.</p>
               <p>What did you miss? - Two shirts, my wife's red cloak, a silk cloak, a scarlet cloth cloak belonging to my little boy just breeched, and one scarlet cloth cloak, my little girl's.</p>
               <p>Were there any other things of value in the room? - There was. I suppose they were frightned; my son and the lodger thought they heard some noise and called out. My two youngest children slept in the first floor back room; my wife and I in the front room; but my eldest boy about thirteen, slept in the shop, and another young man with him.</p>
               <p>Who was the other young man? - A man that lodged with me about a day or two before this affair happened; he slept with my son. I can't say positively whether he was in bed or no; the goods were found upon the prisoner: I did not see him take them.</p>
               <p>Did you see the marks of any foot there? - No.</p>
               <p>How came the shutters broke open? - With a knife, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Did you see any mark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the parlour door locked? - It was.</p>
               <p>Was the door between the shop and parlour locked? - No; very often left open to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050006"></xptr> hear the better. The prisoner had lodged in the house.</p>

               <p>And put the sash down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any fastening? - No; there is no fastening.</p>
               <p>How were the outside shutters fastened? - Thrown back each way and bolted into a post, the window post was straight up between the two sashes.</p>
               <p>A bar comes across? - There is no bar, the two bolts come across.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether your son was in bed when you went to bed? - Yes; my son and the young man with him.</p>
               <p>How soon did you come down after your husband? - He alarmed me and I came down immediately.</p>
               <p>Can you explain how the shutters that were fastened by the cross bolt within side was opened? - I cannot; I could see a step from the dirt of a man's foot in the chair. There was no appearance of force without side the shutters. I could see something of the trampling of feet without side the door as the dirt was soft. No dirt in the room.</p>
               <p>How did you know where the things were or who had got them? - His wife came and told me.</p>

             M'Carty, a Watchman of St. Giles's deposed, he met the prisoner just by the church, on the 22d of November, when he was crying half past four. That he had two shirts that were wet with him under his arm, and he stopped him. That he had a silk cloak in his pocket, and the red cloak and coat in his bosom. The prisoner told him he came from on board a ship where he brought them from, and he had not time to dry the shirt).</p>
               <p>(The Prosecutrix was asked, whether the shirts were wet, to which she answered, they were both hung up wet about an hour before they went to bed).</p>
               <p>(The Watchman was then asked if he said any more at that time, he said, the prisoner told the constable of the night, that he and his wife had quarrelled, and that he had run away from his wife, (as he was going to the round house) he confessed the robbery and wanted to go for a soldier.)</p>
               <p>Where did he say that? - Before the justice.</p>
               <p>Did he say how he took them out? - No.</p>
               <p>(The constable produced the property in court, and the prosecutrix deposed they were the property of her husband).</p>
               <p>To Prosecutor. You are sure your house was not broke open before you went to bed? - Yes; I am certain it was not, we went up immediately to bed from that room.</p>

               <p>The jury desired to know of the court, whether confession before a Magistrate is evidence?</p>
               <p>The court said, confession before a Magistrate, if taken in writing and signed by the justice and the party, is evidence, and parole evidence cannot be taken then; but if it is not in writing, then the confession is evidence that may be proved by parole.</p>

             had known him the same time. That he had been out of his apprentriceship about a twelve month, behaved very well when an apprentice, and if acquitted would take him into his employment.</p>
               <p>Court. This is an indictment for a burglary, and stealing several things out of the house. The robbery being committed in the night time, upon the 22d of November, the man was stopped about four in the morning with the things upon him. If the back window was fastened and the sash down, he could come at these things no otherway but by getting in at the window.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050007"></xptr>Supposing there had been no shutter, only a sash window and that was down, though not bolted, if he had lifted up the window and took the things out, it would be sufficient in law to constitute the crime of burglary.</p>
               <p>But to constitute the crime of burglary there is another thing necessary, it must be committed in the night. The time these things were found was about half after four in the morning, it is dark then in November.</p>

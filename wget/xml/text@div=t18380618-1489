                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. John Logsden, and have the care of his farming stock, at Willatt's farm, South Mimms, Middlesex. On Saturday the 2nd of June, at half-past eight, I counted the sheep and lambs—there were nineteen lambs and ten ewes—I went into the field next morning at seven o'clock, and missed one lamb—I looked all round the field, and traced footsteps from there into another field—I there found the skin, the head, the entrails, and one kidney of the lamb I had missed—I knew it by the features—there was no mark on it—it was a cosset lamb, but I had had it in the house a week or ten days—the mother died, and I put it to another ewe—I went to the prisoner's house at South Mimms, on the Sunday, with Pye and Austin, two officers—it is his own house I believe, but I am not certain that he is not a lodger there—we found about 2 1/2 lbs. of lamb in the house, dressed—the prisoner's shoes stood under to bed—there were two beds in the room—there is only one room in the house I believe—I went with Pye and compared the shoes with the footmarks about the place where the lamb was slaughtered, and about a hundred yards from it, and they corresponded—it is about a mile and a half from where the prisoner lives—they were common labourer's shoes—there were some re<lb></lb>markable nail marks in the impressions—there were no nails in the heel—we only compared one shoe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> One tip of the shoe had been off for a week, and I had not worn them for three days before, and the shoe he swears to has a tip on it—I never wore it after that tip was put on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Sunday I went with Shepherd to the prisoner's house—there is only one room in it I believe—I did not see any stairs—there is only one floor—he and his wife and two children live in the house—I found some lamb there dressed—it appeared to be boiled—there was a shoulder, loin, and breast altogether, but it was a small quantity, about 1 1/2 lb.—there was wool all mingled in between the shoulder and breast of the meat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Sunday, the 3rd of June, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the prisoner's house, with Shepherd and Austin—he occupies the house himself—I found a pair of shoes under the foot of his bed—I took them to near where the lamb was slaughtered—I compared them with the footmarks for about fifty or sixty yards, between where the lamb was taken from and where it was slaughtered, and for about a hundred yards beyond, and then I came to a grass field—I compared both shoes in several places, but a tip had been put on the toe of one, which altered the shoe—the other parts of the shoe exactly cor<lb></lb>responded with the nails—the ground was very moist there—they are com<lb></lb>mon labourer's shoes, but not nailed regularly—I do not recollect seeing</p>

            . Mrs. Lushington informed me, by a letter directed to me at Uxbridge, that her trunk had been cut from the coach as it was coming to town with her father, Mr. Baldero, the banker. I returned to town on Sunday evening, there I found, by an advertisement, that some such things had been taken upon a suspicious person. I went to Justice Girdler's, where I saw the box and the goods. I knew a tambour work-bag, and a pair of slippers to be Mrs. Lushington's, they had her name in them.</p>

            . I am Mr. Baldero's butler. I rode to town, attending the coach with Mr. Baldero and his daughter, Mrs. Lushington. There was a box of Mrs. Lushington's behind the coach; I rode on horseback behind the coach the greatest part of the road. When we came to Piccadily, I rode before the coach, the box was then safe. It was half after nine o'clock on the 7th of June, Mr. Baldero called out some thieves were taking the luggage; I looked behind, I did not see any body take it away, but the box was gone.</p>

            . Coming through Queen-street, Westminster, at ten at night, I saw the prisoner and another boy; the other boy had the box in his hand; I suspected the prisoner, as I had known him before; I looked after him twenty yards. After the two boys had gone together about twenty yards, the other boy gave the box to the prisoner. I pursued him, and took him with the box upon him. I took him to the watch-house that night, and the next morning I took him before Justice Girdler; the box was produced before the justice, and then these things were in it, and it was sealed up before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run away.</p>
               <p>Gregory. No, he made no resistance.</p>
               <p>The box was produced in court, with the things, particularly the tambour bag, and slippers, which were deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>I found the box in the middle of the Hay-market. I am employed to water the hackney coachmen's horses.</p>
               <p>Banks. The coach did not go through the Hay-market.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. Was the box secured behind the coach with one strap or two?</p>
               <p>Banks. Two straps; the portmanteau was not taken away; they had not time to take the portmanteau, that was at the bottom; the straps were at the top of it.</p>

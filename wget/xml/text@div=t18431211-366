On Monday, the 14th of Nov., I came home for good about twelve o'clock—I had been drinking, but was not tipsy—the prisoner, who is my wife, had been out, and returned with me—I found my two children at home—my eldest is about ten years old, the other about five—when we got home I told my wife to shut the street door, which she did—I went up stairs, and she followed me—I sat down in a chair, and said, "Where is the candle?"—she said, "We have not got one"—I said, "Why don't you get one?"—she said, "Why not get one yourself?" using a bad expression—I asked her if I was to have any peace here—she said not—I said, "If I am not to have any peace here, I will go to one of master's barges at the Mill"—I went towards the door, which was open—she shut it in my face, and prevented my going out—I returned from the door, and laid down—she then opened the door, and began to abuse me again—I went to the door, and she shut it again—I went from the door to the window, opened it, and was looking out, because I would not hear her abusive talk, and said I would not answer her any more, or listen to her abuse—while lean<lb></lb>ing out of window, she came behind me, took hold of my legs and threw me out—she said nothing at the time—I lost my senses—I came to next day,</p>

                  </hi>. I am ten years old, and am the prosecutor's son. I was in bed with my little brother when he and my mother came home—I heard them quarrelling—mother began making bad words—I do not know what about—my talker was at a wedding, and came borne about one o'clock—mother stood with the door in her hand, and began making wicked words—I saw her catch hold of my father's legs and throw him out of window—I am sure I saw her take hold of hit legs—he was looking out of window, and said, "I will have nothing at all to say to you, I do not want to make a dis<lb></lb>turbance"—mother crossed over the room, took hold of his legs, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> him out—she then ran down stairs, clapped her hands together, and said, "Oh dear, he hat fallen out of window"—I am quite sure he did not fall out—he was <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> out—I saw that distinctly—she did not cry.</p>

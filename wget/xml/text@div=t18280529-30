               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you got up you saw the prisoner standing motionless, and the others at a distance behind? A. Yes; he stood in front of me; I never said I was not hurt - I was not sober nor yet intoxicated; I had taken a bottle of wine with a friend - I was stunned with the blow, or I should have known what passed; I did not go to the office till I was summoned, which was on Thursday - I never said. I believe the prisoner did not rob me; I said I believed he was labouring under a state of intoxication; I was waited upon by two women who said they were his mother and sister - they came twice - I did not tell them I did not believe he intended to rob me, or anything like it; I had ordered a new hat; I gave them the hatter's address, and said if they would go and pay for the hat, I would not appear against him, and I did receive a new hat - he is the person who knocked me down; I cannot say he intended to rob me - it was not my wish to prosecute him; I heard nothing about his being held to bail for assaulting me - I got a hat of 23s. value; I did not pay for it - I told these women I had paid for a bottle of wine and received change for half a sovereign; but what it was I could not tell - I did not say I could not tell whether I had put it into my purse or not; I did put it in with other silver - the officer called and told me he would be before the Magistrate on the Monday; I understand he told the Magistrate I was unable to attend, but I was able although<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290021"></xptr>I was greatly abused - I was up at five o'clock that morning, and at the hatters by seven; I told the officer if it was consistent with his duty, to let the prisoner go, after I had seen his mother, as I could not prove he had stolen the articles - I might have lost them before he met me; my handkerchief could not have dropped out of my pocket, my coat was buttoned up - after I was summoned I went to his mother to see if he was a deserving character; as a friend said I had done wrong by shewing so much lenity - I then saw the same two women and another, but did not tell them I was not sober, and could not tell whether I took the change of the half sovereign or not - I said, I did not wish to prosecute, but not that I did not believe he did not intend to rob me; I told the Magistrate I was unable to say he had robbed me, or that he intended, as nothing was found on him; that was my only reason - I will not swear I did not lose my money before; I had not drank to excess - I believe he was intoxicated, but cannot say to what extent.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the memorandum you wrote for the hatter's address? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was in Holborn, and saw the prisoner and two others beating the prosecutor - that was before he fell; I saw the prisoner knock him down - they all three ran away immediately he fell; I did not see either of them stop, or endeavour to take anything from him; I was crossing the road when they ran - that was before the prosecutor had got up - I am sure of that; I pursued the prisoner, and my partner went after the other two, but did not overtake them; I took the prisoner - he had run round the coach stand - there were about three coaches on the stand; I brought him back to the prosecutor immediately - he had run about fifty yards; we searched for the hat, but could not find it; I did not see either of them take it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you brought the prisoner back was the prosecutor on the ground, or had he got up? A. He was up; I gave the prisoner to a watchman, and went away - the prosecutor appeared intoxicated, and said he had lost his hat; I think the prisoner appeared sober - I am sure he is the man who knocked the prosecutor down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was a good deal of beating before you got up, I suppose? A. No, not that I saw; I ran across, and they ran away - I saw all three strike him; he was bleeding at the nose and mouth; I took the prisoner about one hundred yards, and then gave him to another watchman, as I had to go to another desperate row; I am certain the prosecutor had got up before I returned to him with the prisoner - he was not standing motionless by him when he got up; I brought him up to him by the collar in custody - the other men had run away; the prosecutor could not have seen them a little way behind him; I went before the Magistrate the same day, and expected to find the prosecutor there - I did not tell the Magistrate I had seen him, and he was unable to leave his bed; I swear that deliberately - I never said so; the Magistrates sent me to tell him to come on Thursday, but he did not appear then, and I told the Magistrate he did not wish to appear, not liking his name to be in the newspapers; Mr. Taylor had told me so; the Magistrate ordered a summons - he did not tell me he could not swear the prisoner was the man who robbed him; De Caster, the night constable, told the Magistrate on the Monday, that the gentleman was so ill-used he dare say he could not attend; the Magistrate talked of holding the prisoner to bail for an assault.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live at Kentish-town; I am not related to the prisoner. On the Tuesday after this happened I went with Esther Porter to Mr. Taylor; I saw him at Mr. Barnet's, a surgeon, where he is assistant; he said nothing to me about the half sovereign - he said he had no wish to prosecute the prisoner, and did not believe he intended to rob him; he said if he had his hat made good it would be all very well - he did not mention the loss of his purse or money; he said "I am a hat and handkerchief out of pocket," and if that was restored it would be very well.</p>

            . My husband is a gentleman's coachman. I accompanied Mrs. Moss to Mr. Taylor - he said to the best of his recollection all he had was the change of a half sovereign, which he had given for a bottle of wine, and he was not quite sure whether he had taken up the change or not; and that he rather believed the prisoner's intention was to rescue a cabriolet man from the watchman, than to rob him; and if his hat was made good he should hear nothing more of the matter; he said nothing about losing a purse or money; I was with the prisoner's mother when she paid for the hat - I went on Sunday with his mother to Taylor; he said the hat was not new, but if we made him amends for the crape and hat it would do.</p>

I was store-keeper at the victualling yard, Deptford, in 1868—I know the prisoner, he was at that time chief clerk in the cashier's office in the dockyard—a man named Brietzcke being cashier—I know the prisoner's writing, these receipts on white paper are his, signature and all—it is the practice in the dockyard to receive wheat and oats to be ground up for the use of the victualling yard, and the offal resulting from the grinding is sold to contractors—as store-keeper I have charge of the offal—the contractors come and take it away from time to time during the month, and I furnish to the cashier's office a note of the quantity taken, through the several con<lb></lb>tracts at the end of the month—it is the course of business that the statement should be furnished to the yard, to indicate the amount of money to be received—I or my chief clerk furnished vouchers for the quantity of offal taken away during September, 1868—the offal should be paid for once a month after the cashier received the document.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the employment of the Admiralty, in 1868, and had been so forty-four years—I left in 1869—my pension is 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum—in 1868 I was store-keeper of the dockyard, and cashier of the dockyard and the victualling-yard—the prisoner was chief clerk to the general department—it was his duty to receive money paid into the cashier's office—it was his duty to enter it in the rough cash-book first, and at the end of the month all sums were transferred to the fair cash-book—the money received would be put in the chest; that was not paid into the bank at the end of the month, we should keep our balance and check the amount in the chest by the fair cash-book—if any sum was not entered in the fair cash-book it would not have been taken into account—I received monthly from Mr. Ede's department an account of the sales of mill offal during the month—that statement was the only check I had on the amount received from the contractor, and it was on printed forms—that would be sent to the cashier's office, and in the course of business the prisoner would have access to them—in the absence of those vouchers, I should have nothing to guide me in the amounts received for them—I have gone through the rough cash-book and the fair cash-book repeatedly—there is no entry in the rough or the fair cash-book of 325<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Gripper, in August, 1868, or of 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 1st September, or of 143<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 30th September—there is no record of those sums—the prisoner never paid me any of those sums—I never got any statement from the superintendent's office of that amount of mill offal being sold to</p>

               <p>Gripper—if I had received it, it would have indicated to me that Gripper had to pay those sums, and I should have made enquiry—the prisoner was in a position to have got access to those statements and to remove them—there was no means by which it could come to my knowledge that this money was going to be paid into the cashier's office by Gripper—these sums have never been paid to the Admiralty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> These vouchers would be sent into my office—they were the only means by which I should know the amount to be paid—the defendant had access to them, and could have received them—I had the same access to them, I could have received them—two clerks and two writers, with prisoner, were employed in the office—Mr. Pinhorne was one clerk, and Mr. Jeffrey the other, who I believe is here—it was not part of the writer's duty to receive money—that duty was performed by me in Mr. Pinhorne's absence, and I made the entries in the rough cash-book—I cannot call to mind ever forgetting to do so—it is not a fact that in Janu<lb></lb>ary, February, and March, 1868, I received a sum of 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and that I made an entry of it in my own writing in June following—I said when I was before the Magistrate, that there was a doubt about it—entries of money received from Gripper in February and March, should appear in this rough cash-book, and I have looked through it in reference to this matter, and the entry is not here.</p>
               <p>

(<hi rend="italic">The sheets were here produced</hi>). It was my duty to send in monthly, this sheet, containing the particulars—here is no entry in February or March, 1868, of 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd received from Gripper, nor do I see it in the June account—I should put my name to a receivable order for 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd when it accompanied a voucher—my receivable order for this 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. accompanies the sheet sent to the Admiralty—it did not sometimes occur that I received the money and handed it over to Mr. Pinhorne, and desired him to make the entry—if I received it I should make the entry—it is his duty to obey my orders—in the prisoners absence, from sickness or leave, Mr. Jeffrey would receive amounts—the receipts handed to Mr. Gripper might be signed by Mr. Pinhorne "pro cashier"—I did not sign receipts when Mr. Pinhorne was present, but I was always at my duty when he was absent—if Mr. Jeffrey received money in September, 1868, that does not prove that I was absent—there would be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187108140089"></xptr>
               <p>a receipt by Mr. Jeffrey in his own writing, and it would be his duty to put the money in what we call the public money chest to which there were two keys, and the prisoner had one, but only during office hours—he received it in the ordinary course of business every morning, and returned it to me in the evening—he had no other key—I had another duplicate key which I kept at my house—I do not remember a single occasion when the prisoner and I were absent at the same time—if he was absent in 1868, I should be there—I should entrust the key to Mr. Jeffrey—we both sat in the same office—we had a counter across, and we left the key in the door while we were at our posts—a rough coin-book was kept in that chest—I suppose that has been transferred, with all the books, to my successor—it was the prisoner's duty to make entries in it (<hi rend="italic">The, book was here produced</hi>). Up to a certain point this book is all in the prisoner's writing—we used to take the weekly balance for the Admi<lb></lb>ralty not very accurately, but sufficiently accurate to enable us to say what we should require for salaries and other expenses—there would be an entry of the contents of the chest, so as to tally with, the fair cash-book—I call this the rough coin-book—it would afford no test of the amount of money if it had not been put into the chest—all that it ought to contain, is an entry of the money in the chest.</p>

Sir. With reference to your letter of Saturday, I have been advised to allow Mr. Huddleston's report to go to the Lords of the Admiralty, being unaware what action their Lordships would take. Any other communication I shall be glad to receive at the above address, or at Mr. Hughes's, solicitor, Wool<lb></lb>wich. To E. Brietzcke, Esq"—at the time I was examined, I learned that Pinhorne had been up to the Admiralty—I cannot say that I heard he had been before you—I had not heard at the time I was examined, that Pin<lb></lb>horne had stated that I had taken money from the Admiralty chest—it was not spoken of at all—it was after I was examined, that I heard he had made that statement about me—the prisoner had every opportunity of changing notes and coin for notes and coin in the chest—it was the easiest thing in the world to put in one note and take out another equivalent—a portion of my income is put by, to pay my creditors, but I have not mortgaged my pension—I am married, and have four sons and three daughters—the money I bor<lb></lb>rowed from the Sovereign Insurance Company is paid off—I had had all that money—it was the Sovereign where my friend borrowed part—it is all paid off, I believe—I put it in the hands of my solicitor, and the other sums are in his hands, in the course of liquidation—I never took any portion of the Government money for the purpose of paying my debts—I have had no ap<lb></lb>plication about the balance to the General London Bank—that is one of the sums my solicitor has to deal with—I made good the sum of 101<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which underwent investigation before Admiral Wilmot; I believe the prisoner re<lb></lb>ceived the money for that cheque—it bore my endorsement, and therefore I made it good—my firm belief is, that it was sent to the bank to be cashed—I did not hear the prisoner say who received the money for it—I was the first person who drew the attention of the Admiralty to it—Pinhorne's first expression was, that he must look up his friends, and the next day he said that he would find 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I would find the remainder; that, of course, I declined to do, and said that if it did not turn out to be a clerical error I should report it officially, and I did so—Pin<lb></lb>horne had nothing to do with receiving money after that inquiry—at that time I had not heard the least about the embezzlement of these three sums—I never took any money out of the chest without putting in a cheque or memorandum, and I always called Pinhorne's attention to the fact—I may not always have done it <hi rend="italic">viva voce</hi>, but it was in black and white, in the chest—there is no entry in the rough cash-book, in March, of "Gripper, 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," but it appears on 1st June; I do not believe that to be in my writing, but in the prisoner's—the 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is three items made up into one, 101<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—here are Pinhorne's receipts for them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which show that he received a portion in February, another portion on 7th March, and another portion in April—they ought to have been entered in the rough cash-book at the</p>

               <p>time he received them, but they are not—they appear as received in June—the largest sum which I took from the cash cheat and put in my cheque for, was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the outside, and I always paid the sum at the end of the month, when I got my pay—I received my salary minus what I owed—it was in my own power to do that—I admit that it was an irregularity—the rough coin-book contains an account of the number of notes, sovereigns, half-sovereigns, and different kinds of coin, and the margin of it applies to all the leaves—that shows how much cash there was in the bank on any particular day, not what ought to be there, but what actually was there—Jeffrey would sometimes have Pinhorne's receipts to give for money which would come to the cash-box—I could have access to these vouchers, and could have received them, but I never received any of them—I put perfect confidence in the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I was clerk in Mr. Brietzcke's office at the same time as Pinhorne—I did not receive any of the money com-prized in these three receipts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> During the whole time I have known the defendant he has borne a good character, and was most punctual and regular in the performance of his duties—there was only myself, Mr. Pinhorne, and Mr. Brietzcke, to perform all the duties, with the exception of the writers—I do not remember any occasion when I forgot to make an entry in the rough cash-book at the time the money was received, and did not make it till subsequently—I made entries in the rough cash-book myself—I do not remember any occasion, when Mr. Pinhorne was in the office, that I merely received the money and handed it over to him—I have no recollection of receiving money and keeping it till Mr. Pinhorne came in, and handing it to him—it was not my duty, but Mr. Pinhorne's, to make entries in the fair cash-book—these receipts of 2nd June and 3rd July, 1868 (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in my writing—having received that money it would not be my duty to make this entry—we never made entries of this kind of thing; it is money received from Mr. Gripper, the contractor—these receipts were given by me to Gripper for mill offal—it was Pinhorne's duty, most decidedly, to make the entry on my handing it to him—when I received money I entered it, except these running accounts—I find no entry at all of these amounts in the rough cash-book, but in the fair cash-book the 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is entered on September 8th, and the 107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 4th August, both of tfaem in the prisoner's writing—the reason they were not entered was that they were all running accounts—Gripper's accounts were all running accounts—the non-entry of them till September quarter would be because they were running accounts for that quarter, and there would be no voucher from the victualling yard, but the money was actually received—when the money was paid to me and I gave the receipt, I put it in a bag with a tally, and put it in a bowl on a shelf in the chest—that was the ordinary practice</p>

               <p>when I received the money—the chest is built into the wall; you cannot get into it, it is not a room—when the money was placed there it was considered in Mr. Brietzcke's custody, decidedly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We do not enter these things in the rough cash-book at all, because we only enter the things which are brought to account during the month—I was always ordered to do as I, did—I should not enter any of these sums—I put a tally on it, with a record of the name and amount, and that would be for the prisoner to bring to account, and both these sums are brought to account in his writing—there is no difference between these sums and the sums in the indictment; they were all running accounts too—there were no vouchers, or else I should have brought them to account—this "Gripper, 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,"is in my writing; Mr. Pinhorne received that and gave it to me with the voucher, on my taking the duty from him.</p>

I understand you that at the end of each month you made out a list of all quantities supplied to the contractors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the statements I supplied are in the office books, but those of Gripper, and of another contractor, were paid only monthly, the statement was made out at the end of the month and I initialed it, that authorized him to receive the money from the contractor, he applied for payment and the contractor paid him, and the money was entered—before the money was paid by the con<lb></lb>tractor there must have been a statement sent to me and forwarded to the contractor, or I don't see how he could get it, these are 2nd June, and 3rd July, very near the time; I sent them in at the end of the month, and this is at the beginning—there is no reason for treating these sums differently to others, I should imagine that they were from monthly documents, they received them from time to time—that is not an account furnished by me, the contractor takes them away, and at the close of the month we get the total quantity—the contractor generally sent his clerk down to the office to compare his memorandum with the office books to see if there had been any disagreement between the Government and the con-tractor; this is bis document, not mine, and he is prepared to pay the same as soon as he is called upon.</p>

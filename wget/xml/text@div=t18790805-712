                  </hi>. I am an artificial flower manufacturer, of 19, Bridge water Square, Barbican—Harris was in my employ about two years as a maker of flowers—I had been losing things for a long while, and on 18th July I caused my manager, Leatham, to watch Harris after she left off work, and on 19th July, in consequence of something he told me, I caused Harris to be searched by Mrs. Castell in my warehouse—I was then almost immediately called into the room, and Mrs. Castell gave me some artificial flowers—I had a conversation with Harris, who mentioned a name, an address, and a sum of money in Sergeant Fluister's presence, in con<lb></lb>sequence of which I took out a warrant to search Rarp's premises, 191, Hoxton Street—I went there on the 19th with Fluister, Leatham, and the warrant officer at 6 p.m.—there are two doors to the shop; it is at the corner of a street; the front entrance is in one street and the private entrance at the side—the officer read the warrant to Mrs. Rarp, and Sergeant Fluister asked her whether Lizzie Harris had been in the habit of coming there—I did not enter at the first moment—the premises were searched, and a quantity of leaves and flower materials were shown to us, the major portion of which are mine—they are technically known as unmounted goods, but there are some here which I can identify more fully, as they have my private mark on them in Mr. Leathcam's writing—I bought them in Paris—I have the same patterns on my premises—I have never sold this leaf in this form, and I never knew Rarp—here are some leaves of a peculiar character which I gave special orders for to Mr. Dean—I also buy leaves of Gatti and Co., of Farringdon Street, and I find some leaves here which came from their premises, but I cannot swear to them with certainty, as other people can buy them also—Harris dusted the warehouse in the mornings, and had an opportunity of taking goods, as she would be by herself.</p>

Do you know a person named Harris?"—she said "No"—I gave her Harris's description, and then she said, "I had a woman of the name of Harris working for me some time ago"—I said, "Would you give me the description of her?"—she described a tall woman—I said, "That will not answer the description of Lizzy Harris"—we then searched the place, and found in the shop 52 gross of leaves and eight sprays of flowers, and on the stall outside 44 sprays, and in the workroom and stall 55 sprays and three gross of leaves; on the first-floor 67 gross of leaves in one box and 77 gross in another, which the prosecutor identified in her presence—here are five boxes of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said to her, "Have you got any receipts?"—she said "Yes," and produced two files—I have been over them, and found one receipt in 1879 for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and some in 1878—I took Rarp in custody—her shopwoman, Flora Kemp, was there.</p>

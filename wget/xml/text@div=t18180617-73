                  , a subject of our Lord the King feloniously, wilfully and maliciously did make an assault, and with a certain sharp instrument feloniously, wilfully, and maliciously did strike, cut, and stab him in and upon his right thigh, with intent to kill and murder him

               <p>WILLIAM WATTS. I am fourteen years of age, and have known the prisoner about four years. On Sunday, the 24th of May, about four o'clock in the afternoon, he wanted me to play with him, I would not, and he threw a stone at me; I left him, and in about half an hour I saw him again, ran after him, and was going to give him a pat on the head for throwing the stone; he took out his knife, pointed it at me, and swore he would stick me if I came near him. About eight o'clock I met him again, opposite my grandfather's door, at Hackney, I put my hand on his shoulder, and said, "Don't you say you will stab me any more;" he said he would stab me - I ran from him, there were several boys there, he pursued, and ran the knife into the side of my thigh once. It was a pointed knife.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not strike me first - A. No; I meant to pat him on the head, but did not.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner and Watts together in the road. Watts put his hand on the prisoner's shoulder, and said, "Will you say you will stab me any more?" Gott said, "Yes, d-n you, I will." Watts ran away, and pushed against me to get out of his way. The prisoner ran after him, and put his hand to his side. Watts said, "O L-d! he has stabbed me." The prisoner immediately ran away, and Watts ran to me. I had seen them together before, they were apparently scuffling together, and turning each other round.</p>

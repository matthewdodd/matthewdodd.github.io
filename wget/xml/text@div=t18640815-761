I am a merchant, of 14, Surrey-street, Strand—on the night of 19th July, I was in Endell-street, near Sharp's-gardens—there is a urinal there a little way down—I saw the prisoner standing at the corner before I went in, and as I came out, two other men rushed up to me and stopped me, and at the same moment, O'Brien put his hand at the</p>

On the night of 19th July, I was on duty in plain clothes in Endell-street, near the corner of Short's-gardens, and heard a cry of "Police!" "Stop thief!" at about twenty minutes to 12 o'clock—I ran up, and saw the prosecutor—I saw two men run down Short's gardens, and saw the prisoners run down Brownlow-street, across Drury-lane, into Charles-street, where I lost them—I hare known them standing about the coal-yard for the last four months—I had not seen them that evening—I have no doubt that they are two of the men who ran away from the <hi rend="italic">King.</hi> At the station, when Ackrill said, "Do you know him?" you said, "No."</p>

I live at 23, Short's-gardens, and sweep the urinal there—on 19th July, near 12 o'clock, I was in the urinal—I saw the prisoner and two more men standing at the corner of Endell-street and Short's-gardens—the prosecutor came in, and as soon as he went out he was attacked by the four men at the corner, and his watch and chain taken from him by O'Brien—he was assisted by one who is not here, and King went behind and helped him—I heard the prosecutor call "Police" distinctly—I am sure the prisoners are the men.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live at Chelsea. - On the 23d of June, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was in my parlour, in Beaufort-place, and heard a coach coming along <placeName id="t18250630-66-crimeloc320">Duke-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18250630-66-crimeloc320" type="placeName" value="Duke-street"></interp>

Alford appeared intoxicated - Green was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Alford's not answering you appear to arise from his intoxication? A. He was certainly stupified with the accident. While I was making the inquiry a man crawled out of the carriage window - I put my hand under his arm to assist him; he told me to let him alone, it was all right - he appeared stunned or intoxicated; his name was Burgoyne. At that instant a lantern was brought, and held to the carriage - we then discovered the deceased in a dreadful mangled state; he was dead: I knew him perfectly well - his name was Samuel Featherstone; his body was taken out of the carriage, and carried into a public-house; a vast quantity of blood had come from his head: some neighbours then gave the prisoners in charge - Alford, who was the coachman, said he was ready to go any where; Green was very riotous, and declared he would not go. We could get no information as to the circumstance from either of them. Immediately after the accident happened Green was laughing heartily, which we reproved him for. He broke from the watchman, and got away, and was taken in an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was Featherstone a large heavy man? A. Yes; when I discovered him his head was out of the near side front window - his injury was at the back of the head. There is a deep gutter on the side of the road, and an iron grating over a sink. The carriage laid on the off side of the road, over, or on the grating - the wheel might have gone on the grating, and overturned the coach. Alford's head was very much injured - it was enough to stupify any man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Who took the horses out? A. Green - he was furthest from the carriage (when I came up,) at the horses' heads, as if to prevent their going on; the carriage did not appear to have been dragged. I think the state of the road, assisted by the weight of the deceased, sufficient to cause the overturn. - When Green laughed I thought he was in hysterics, but his conduct afterwards convinced me that was not the case: I have since learned that he had been in liquor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he was laughing did you observe any thing? A. They were saying it was all right. The deceased had not then been discovered.</p>
               <p>Q. If the carriage was driven at a proper rate, was it likely to be overturned? A. Certainly not; carriages pass over it fifty times a day: it was overturned ten or twenty yards from the turning; the road may be thirty or forty yards wide: it is a large open space, at the foot of Battersea-bridge; the coach was in the way from the narrow street to Beaufort-row.</p>

            . I live in Duke-street, Chelsea - four doors from Long. I saw this carriage pass my door at eight o'clock, towards town; it went so fast that I did not notice who drove; it was a sky blue chariot: I was at my door at half-past ten o'clock, and saw it coming back; I do not know who drove; I think there were two persons on the box - it was galloping as fast as the horses could go; I did not hear them whipped; Featherstone put his head out of window, towards the coachman - I cannot say whether he said any thing, but the coachman immediately turned the horses very sharp round into Beaufort-place - the fire flew from the horses' shoes; I saw the carriage overturned in a moment; I cannot tell how it happened; I went up to it in about five minutes - saw Long and several more there. I heard Green's voice but saw neither of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You live in Duke-street? A. Yes, just at the corner, where it turns into the wide space where Long lives; the coach overturned about twenty yards from my door; Featherstone was leaning out of the left-hand side widow - not the front.</p>

            . I live in the Broadway, between Lombard-street and Duke-street. I was at my window about half-past ten o'clock, and heard a chariot coming down Lombard-street with great rapidity; I opened my window; it stopped suddenly, directly under my window, as a stage coach was coming down to meet it; I saw Featherstone in the chariot, and a stranger: the prisoners were on the box; I cannot say which had the reins - they were both intoxicated - Alford particularly so; I heard them calling to the stage coachman to get out of the way; the stage was walking at a moderate pace; immediately as the coach cleared the chariot they flogged the horses most desperately; the horses started off at a full gallop - I saw them for fifty yards, which is the extent of the street, and heard the carriage go over with a most tremendous crash; the horses went at the same pace till it overturned; their shoes struck fire all the way up the street; I ran down stairs and went to the spot, found the prisoners in custody, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300023"></xptr>put several questions to Alford, but could get no answer; he appeared very drunk - Green was asking why he was given in charge; he broke from the watchman, and was afterwards taken; he appeared sorry for what had occurred; it was known then that the man was killed. There is a grating near to where the coach fell, and a little slope, but there was no danger if they had gone at a proper rate - a hundred carriages pass over it daily - there is a gas light close to the place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How far from the end of the street did it pull up for the stage to pass? A. About fifty yards; my house stands in the broadway, between two narrow streets; it was overturned fifteen or twenty yards from Duke-street, immediately off the stones; the horses started at a full gallop the instant the stage passed - they had been galloping before.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had overturned by the violence of the horses, would they not have dragged it some way after? A. I should think so: Alford said his head was hurt; I had seen him drunk an hour and a half before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Green seemed sorry when he found the man was dead? A. I think so - I have frequently seen him with Featherstone, on friendly terms.</p>

               <p>This document was here read, stating, that he (Alford) had driven the deceased to various public houses, where he drank a considerable quantity of wine and spirits with him, and got intoxicated; that he held the reins at the time the accident happened, but could not tell how it occurred.</p>

            . I am the stage-coachman, who passed the coach. I called to them, and they backed, about the length of their horses, out of the narrow part, to let me pass: the horses must have been quiet to let him back: I saw them go on after I had passed, but did not notice at what pace - they could not go very fast, for the space was not a hundred yards; they were job horses, and could not be got into a full gallop in that space - the carriage had no perch.</p>

The Intestines were so inflamed, that they seem'd to be blown up artificially, and compress'd the Diapbragma; that the Lungs having but little blood left in them, when the blow was receiv'd, and not having time to recover themselves and breath again, it might be the occasion of her Death, though it might not have injur'd a stronger Person in other circumstances.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Charing-cross hospital. I remember Carroll being brought to the hospital, on Sunday, the 5th of April, at 10 o'clock in the morning—I examined him—I found four or five wounds on the scalp, all of which were trivial in their nature, excepting one over the left temple-bone—there was a slight wound on the cheek-bone—two fingers on his left hand were wounded, and he had a wound in the right knee-joint—they were cut-wounds, evidently inflicted by some sharp instrument; a sabre or knife would inflict them—the man was exceedingly exhausted when brought into the hospital—I presume from the loss of blood, and partly from having been drinking—he remained in the hospital until his death, which was on the 19th of May—inflammation arose on the knee-joint, followed by an extensive formation of matter, which is the com<lb></lb>mon consequence of wounds in the larger joints—in consequence of that, it was thought necessary, three days previous to his death, to amputate—it was decidedly my opinion that amputation was necessary—he would un<lb></lb>questionably have died without amputation—I performed the amputation—it was done very successfully—he was so much exhausted previously, that it was a matter of great importance to perform it very expeditiously, and to save is much blood as possible—it was removed within two minutes—there was a very small quantity of blood lost, but he died on the 19th of May—I attribute his death to the irritation and exhaustion consequent on the wound inflicted on the knee-joint (<hi rend="italic">looking at a sword</hi>)—that weapon is quite capable of producing such a wound.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you observe what age he appeared to be? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was stated to be 35—I should think that was his age—he was nearly six weeks in the hospital before he was subjected to amputation—his pulse was feeble at the time the operation was perform<lb></lb>ed, but regular; it was done between twelve and one o'clock, and he died at half-past four—the infliction of pain and the loss of however small a quantity of blood, in a system already exhausted, would be likely unques<lb></lb>tionably to accelerate his death; but it was the result of two deliberate consultations to give him that chance—the man was willing to the inflic<lb></lb>tion of the amputation, and had the full consequences of it communicated to him; after that it was found unquestionably desirable to amputate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not believe he would have survived a day or two longer, if amputation had not been performed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps scarcely that time—he lost but a very few ounces of blood by the amputation, scarcely more than the blood retained in the limb which was removed—he did not lose two ounces from the part above—his pulse was about one hundred and twenty just before the operation—it is the custom to feel the pulse during the progress of the operation—there was no sensible change.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not believe that the death of this party ensued at the time it did by reason of the operation which had been so recently performed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Cer<lb></lb>tainly not—he might probably have lived a few hours longer if it had not</p>

               <p>been performed—at the same time we know it to be possible for an indivi<lb></lb>dual suffering under extreme exhaustion, to sink at any moment, without the infliction of the operation—we communicated to him all that might be apprehended—no operation is done in any hospital without communicating to the individual the probable consequences of it, and having his consent—in the opinion of all the medical officers in the hospital, it was justifiable, on the ground of its absolute necessity, in consequence of the impossibility of his surviving unless the limb could be removed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 7, Star-court, Newton-street, Holborn, On Sunday morning the 5th of April, between four and five o'clock, I was alarmed by a noise—I knew Carroll by sight, but never spoke to him, he lived at No. 3, nearly opposite to me—I got up, in consequence of hearing the noise, and looked out of the window—the row began in the parlour on the ground-floor—Carroll lived in the two-pair—it was a family affair among them—I saw no persons in the court at first, but I saw two women jumping out of the parlour window in their petticoats and shifts; they cried out "Watch and police," and the police came to their assistance very soon—I do not know who was the policeman—he told them he could not enter unless there was murder cried—one or two policemen came—I can<lb></lb>not exactly say it was one—one, to the best of my knowledge—after this the court was quiet for a time—the woman said to her mother who was inside, "Mother, cry out murder," which the old woman did—at this time the court was quiet—when she cried out "Murder," the daughter cried out "Murder," and the policeman entered at the door—I saw him no more—in about twenty minutes after I heard a noise in the court—I jumped out of bed and went towards the window—I saw two policemen running out of No. 3—they sprang their rattles the moment they came out, and ran up to the end of the court, and some more came to their assistance very soon—some of them ran into No. 4, instead of No. 3—I told them that was not the right house, and directed them to No. 3—there was no noise in No. 3 at that time—they could not get up stairs, seemingly—I heard no noise inside, but seemingly there was a man at the top of the stairs, and they could not get up—I then saw policeman No. 103 get upon the window shutters—he wanted to get into the one pair window—the shutter not being steady under his feet it was impossible for him to do so—Carroll came forwards with a quart pot in his hand, which caused him to jump down—he came to the one pair window—he lived in the one pair—he put his arm and body out of the window, trying to keep the man No. 103 out of the window—he came down, and not long afterwards the prisoner Davis brought in a ladder on his shoulder—I did not notice Davis before—he put the ladder up to the one-pair window, and went away, leaving it there—No. 103 went up the ladder, and broke some of the small panes with his staff—Carroll had the quart pot in his hand, reaching it out to keep him from coming into the room—I did not see him strike him—No. 103 came down, and Davis came with a sword afterwards—this was the first ladder that was there—Davis's sword was drawn, he pulled it from under hit coat—he ran up the ladder with the sword, and made a blow at Carroll—the first blow he made, Carroll put out his hand as a guard, to keep it from his head—he did no injury with the first blow—it did not strike him—the second offer he made, the deceased caught the sword in his hand, and Davis pulled the sword through his hand, which cut all his fingers; and he made a blow at him, and cut him in the head afterwards—Carroll was trying to guard himself with the quart pot—Davis struck him at different times afterwards</p>

               <p>on the head with the sword, and made different stabs at him—the other policemen were on the ladder at the time, trying to get at Carroll with their staves—there were three ladders brought at last—there were a good many policemen behind Davis, on the ladder he stood on, trying to get in, and the other ladders had men on them trying to get in—they did not get in then—the ladder gave way, and Davis fell—Davis was telling Carroll to come down, all this time—I cannot say exactly his words—I heard him telling Carroll to come down; and Carroll asked what they wanted of him, that he had neither beer, gin, or any thing else to give them—they made no answer that I heard—Davis fell on his left shoulder and face—I saw no more of Davis then—the next man I saw with the sword was Yates—he went up a small-round ladder—not the first ladder that came—not the one which Davis fell off—he had the same sword in his hand—I saw him go up the ladder, and make a blow at the deceased—it took effect in the head—I afterwards saw him catch him in the left-side of the head with the sword—that was another blow, it caused Carroll to stagger back three or four steps—he came to the window again with the quart pot—I saw Yates strike him at different times with the sword; but whether it took effect or not I cannot say, for the man was covered over with blood—I am sure be struck him—he made a blow at him which missed—the sword came against the side of the window, which broke the sword—he then came down the ladder—he was often called down by the rest of the police and his officers—I saw a serjeant there—when he came down, he went back again, took the sword, and went up again—and said, "D—n you, will you come down? I will have you down"—Carroll came forward with the quart pot, and put his knee on the open window—(he had all his clothes on)—Yates struck him over the knee—he was then called down, and came down and said, "D—n his eyes, one blow more would have settled it"—I saw no more of the prisoners then—the man who was on the stairs, in the course of a few minutes was taken prisoner—I do not know who that was—Carroll gave himself up, when the man on the stairs was taken—the policemen made their way up stairs—two or three men went in at the window, and Carroll gave himself up—Carroll and the other man were carried away as prisoners—I did not see Carroll strike either of the policemen—he struck at them very often—he made the attempt.</p>

               <p>lived at No. 4, Star-court—I was not at the wake—I was alarmed by a noise, about half-past four, and got up—Daniel Carroll lived at No. 3, in the one pair—I came to the door of No. 3—there was a noise there—when first I came to the door, the police and I were just going in together; for Mrs. White, who lived in the parlour of No. 3, cried "Watch! Police!"—one policeman, No. 103, was going in at the door along with me—White's daughter had her hand to her cheek, where her brother had struck her, as she said—she was not bleeding—her cheek was quite red, as if she had had a blow—her mother wanted the policeman to go up stairs, to take her son out of the room from the wake—she said that the son was striking his own wife, and the daughter went in at the door, between him and his wife, and he struck the daughter—Mrs. White is not Carroll's mother—the policeman said, he could not go up, at his peril—it was very quiet and still at this time—he said, "I cannot go in, without murder being cried"—the daughter who got the blow from the brother, desired her mother to cry out, "Murder"—I then just came in, to put on my clothes, having nothing on at the time, but a quilt about me—I had not stopped above twenty minutes—I heard no noise during that time, nor till I came out again—I then saw two policemen coming down the stairs, one of them without his hat or staff, and the other had his hand against his mouth, as if it was bleeding—I cannot say whether he was bleeding; as it was darkish—I returned in again to get my shoes, as I had not put them on—the police sprang their rattles very fast; and No. 103, who was one of them, ran down from the top of the court, by my door, to the water<lb></lb>closet—he had his hat on—he ran to the privy, took hold of the door, and shook it—he looked in, turned about, and stooped for a big stone which was by the privy-door—I said, "Pray, Sir, don't throw that stone; if you do, you will commit murder"—he could not take it up, it was too heavy—he came further, and got a bit of a stone-jug, and <hi rend="italic">slung</hi> it in at the win<lb></lb>dow—I begged him not to do it, as the child laid there dead—he then got up on the window-shutter, and put his hand on the little bolt of the shutter of the parlour window—he then got his hand on the ledge of the window, and struck up with his staff—they had put his hat and staff out of the window to him, and said they would have nothing more to do with him—Carroll then came to the window, as he struck the win<lb></lb>dow first with his staff—Carroll had a pot in his hand, and said, "What do you want with me?—I have thrown you out what you wanted, your hat and staff; what more do you want of me?"—there was no disturbance on the stairs—then the policemen were all coming very fast—when Carroll came to the window with the pot in his hand, as he opened the window, the po<lb></lb>liceman No. 103 fell down off the shutter—then a step-ladder was brought and placed against the wall—No. 103 was the first man who <hi rend="italic">entered</hi> the ladder, and he broke the window with his staff—Carroll was at the window at the time, and No. 103 <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> his staff into the window at him—Carroll was at the window at the time, with the pot in his hand, telling them to keep down from his place, that there was no <hi rend="italic">row</hi> nor disturbance; that he had done nothing that they should try to enter his place; that he had thrown the staff and hat out, and he had a child lying dead; that he was a poor man out of employment, and out of there he would not go, for he knew not what he had done—No. 103 ran down the ladder; there were several of them besides on the ladder, trying to get to Carroll with their staves—No. 103 took the staves out of the hands of the other policemen, and <hi rend="italic">slung</hi> them through the window—Carroll came to the window, and</p>

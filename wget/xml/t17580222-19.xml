               <p>Andrew Seymore. I keep an oil shop at Ratcliff-cross. On the 14th of January the prisoner came and asked me if I would buy some Stockholm tar, which he said he would sell at 18 s. per barrel. I told him I would give him 18 s. per barrel. He brought three barrels in a cart. It appeared to be what they call plantation tar. I offered him 9 s. a barrel for it, in order to try him, suspecting he had stole it. I asked him how he came by it. He said a young man desired him to sell it for him. I stop'd it, and advertised it, by which means the right owner came to the knowledge of it, but I not having paid for it, the prisoner sued me for the money.</p>
               <p>Captain Robson. There was a quantity of tar that lay in a lighter at Iron-Gate, the property of

             and Co. Some of it being missing, upon its being advertised I went to Seymore's house and saw it; it was the same that was missing from the lighter. The prisoner was secured, and taken before justice Berry, where he confessed his taking it out of the lighter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the confession taken in writing?</p>
               <p>Robson. It was [ Produced in court, and the hand-writing of the justice and prisoner proved. It was then read, in which the prisoner acknowledged he did steal it, and carry it to the house of Seymore, &amp;c.]</p>

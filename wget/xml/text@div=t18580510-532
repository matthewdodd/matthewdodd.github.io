Bank of England note, as I supposed, and gave it into my hand—I gave it to my daughter, to get change; I looked at it, but did not examine it much—I gave it to my daughter, immediately I received it—she was in the parlour behind the shop—I returned into the shop, after I had given it to her—shewent up stairs, to get the change, and brought it down—she called to me, and said she wanted to speak to me—the prisoner heard her call, and he stepped up to the parlour door, and asked if it was any thing amiss; she said, "No, I called my father"—the prisoner then passed me, and went out, saying he would call again in five minutes; he did not take the bridle with him, or the change—I went direct to the police station with the note, to ascertain if it was good—I put my name on it—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is my name—on the following day, in consequence of information, I went to a public house in Long Acre, called the John Holt, and saw the prisoner there, and two others along with him—when he saw me, he walked out, and the other two along with him—he was dressed similar to what he was the day before—I am quite certain he is the same man—I followed him, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Palmer, the proprietor of the Swan stables. The prisoner had a horse standing there for sale—I was at the stables on Easter Monday—I saw the prisoner there in the morning part—I saw him in and out during the day—the last time I saw him was in the evening, about 5 o'clock, in Mr. Wilson's house, the Mitre Tavern, St. Martin's Lane—he was there drinking along with Mr. Bridges—I saw nothing of him afterwards—I went away to start off my coachmen, and did not return till 7 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am proprietor of the Mitre tavern, St. Martin's Lane. On Easter Monday, I recollect the prisoner and a man of the name of Bridges coming to my house—he had been in the habit of using my house at times for some time previously—the first time I saw him, on Easter Monday, was, I think, about 11 o'clock—I think he remained there for about two or three hours—he came back about 2 o'clock, and stopped till past 5 o'clock in the evening—I think it was a little past 5 o'clock when he went away—hesaid, if a gentleman called for him, he was gone to the stables—he re<lb></lb>turned about 6 o'clock, and asked if the gentleman had called on him, I said, "No," and then he said, "I will stop till 7 o'clock"—it was about 6 o'clock, as near as possible, when he returned—he remained at my house till 7 o'clock—hewas in the parlour part of the time, and in the front of the bar at the last, before he went away—he was with Bridges—I do not know much about Bridges—Ihave only been eight months in the house altogether—that is the man—he was with the prisoner the whole of the time—I saw him go out about 7 o'clock—he told me, if the gentleman called on him again, to say that he was gone, that he could not wait any longer—he could not have left my house between 6 and 7 o'clock without my knowledge.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you know Bloomsbury Street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do—that is, I think, about a mile from my house, I do not know exactly, I am no judge of the distance—the prisoner stopped at my house from 2 o'clock till past 5 o'clock—itwas as near 5 o'clock as possible, for the groom from the yard came in and said, "Are any of my coachmen here? for it is 5 o'clock, and I want to send them off," and the prisoner was there for five or ten minutes after that—hecame back as near 6 o'clock as possible; I was in the bar when he came in, he came into the front of the bar, and went into the parlour, and said if any gentleman called, he would find him in the parlour—I did not know what he might be doing in the parlour; he had some ale—I did not go in to see what he was about—I continued in the bar, and partly in the parlour, going backwards and forwards; we were pretty busy on Easter Monday; there were a great many people there—there is a glass door between the parlour and the bar—there is a curtain to it, but you can see over it.</p>

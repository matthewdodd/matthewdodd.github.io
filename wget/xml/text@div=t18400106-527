                  </hi>I am coachman to Mr. Hendrick, an omnibus<lb></lb>keeper—his stable is in John-street, Church-lane, Whitechapel. On the night of the 15th or 16th of December, I was at the stable about half-past ten o'clock—I left my coat hanging in the stable—there was a horse<lb></lb>keeper there—we came away together, leaving the stable locked—I went next morning, and found the padlock had been wrenched off the door and thrown away—I missed my coat and a Macintosh cloak belonging to John Riddle—the prisoner had worked twice for my master—I saw my coat on Saturday morning on Groom, the driver of a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, in Piccadilly.</p>

                  </hi>I live in Little Park-street, Regent's Park, and am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-driver. The prisoner sold this coat to me in the yard at the King-street bazaar, in Portman-square—he brought it down the yard and said he had brought a bargain for some one to buy—I looked at it, and he said he wanted 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I offered him 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and stood with him for almost half-an-hour—I at last bought it—I wore the coat for about five days, and then lent it to Groom, who drives a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I am certain it is the same coat—I did not know his name at the time—I never saw him before—Loader afterwards told me his name.</p>

He said his wife and children were badly off, and he had not food to eat—there were four men in the yard, and I asked Loader if he knew the man—he said, "I have known him for four years, and I should say it is all right in buying it"—I know this is the same coat by buying it and wearing it—I know it by the velvet collar and by the lining of it which I believe is bear-skin—I never saw one like it—I cannot tell the day I bought it.</p>

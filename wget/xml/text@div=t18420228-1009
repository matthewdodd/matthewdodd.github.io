                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a clothes and shoe-shop in High-street, Poplar. On Saturday afternoon, the 26th of February, Stratford and Evans came into the shop, and Lawrence staid outside the window—I knew Stratford before—he asked if I had an old cap I could sell cheap, that would fit Evans—I handed him one, and said. I could sell him that cheap—he tried it on Evans, and said it would not fit—I said I had no other for less than 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he told me to show it him—I reached it to give it to Stratford to try on Evans—he tried it, and said it would not do, he would buy one at the corner of North-street—they all went away—I put the caps back into the window where I took them from, and in a few minutes I missed a pair of shoes—Evans had his back to the counter, and Stratford stood facing him—they did not ask for any shoes—Lawrence had a bundle like a chimney-sweeper's machine—he is a chimney-sweeper—I gave information, and saw the shoes at the station.</p>

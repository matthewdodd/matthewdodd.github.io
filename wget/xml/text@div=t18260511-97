On the 29th of April, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming into the shop from the street, and saw the prisoner at the till, inside the counter - the till was open, and his hand was in it; as soon as he saw me he came away from the counter, and put his hand, which had been in the till, into his pocket; I asked what he was doing there; he said he came for a penny loaf - he then said he had been getting the money out of the till; I felt in his breeches pocket, and found two shillings, one sixpence, and one half-crown; I called the maid up directly.</p>

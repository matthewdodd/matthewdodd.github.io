               <p>Mr. Garrow.

               <p>Jury.

               <p>Mr. Garrow. By whom? - By a man who went by the name of mad Tom; I did not see the prisoner carry it; the coals went on the shoulders of a man whom the prisoner employed; Hands came into the yard, and said to me, Trevet, there is a backer for you, (that means a large coal) and the men had a pot of beer, and I was to put it to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the prisoner in the passage with these men at the same time that they took away the coals? - When I saw the prisoner, there was nobody in the passage but a gentleman that wanted change; at the time his servant took the coals away, they were both together in my yard; the coals were in the yard.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him give any directions or say any thing to him? - None at all.</p>
               <p>How did the man carry them? - On his shoulders.</p>
               <p>Who conveyed it on? - I did not see.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The man carried them publickly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner is a dustman, and of course sells breeze and soil to brick-makers? - I know he dealt with Mr. Scott for these articles, to the amount of 20 l. or 30 l. a week.</p>
               <p>Then I fancy it was not very uncommon for him to treat Mr. Scott's men with a drop of drink? - They had often pots of beer, for which I believe the prisoner often paid.</p>
               <p>How long may you have known the prisoner to be dealing with Mr. Scott at that rate? - I have not known the prisoner a long time.</p>
               <p>You knew all this that you have told, last sessions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But you was not here last sessions? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you help us to any reason, why the prisoner was not indicted last sessions? - No, Sir, not at all.</p>
               <p>You do not know of any dispute that may have taken place lately between the prisoner and any body about breeze and soil? - The prisoner was a good civil sort of a man.</p>
               <p>Court. You say the coals were in your yard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner present at the time the servant carried the coals away? - The prisoner came out of the yard behind the servant; I did not see where the coals were carried.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You made no objection to it? - I could make no objection.</p>

               <p>Not charged with any crime? - No, I was a servant to Mr. Hands.</p>
               <p>What happened on the 11th of April? - On the 11th of April, in the afternoon, I came home with my load of dust to my master's yard; I could not get into the yard; this Shaw and Larney were coming by at the same time; they took my baskets off my cart; I says to Shaw, you have no business with those baskets; I shall not pay a pot of beer for you; because if we do not take the things into the yard we are liable to pay a pot of beer; my master came to me at the gate and bid me go along and mind my business; afterwards he went to the White Hart; he followed the carts there; I waited the spaae of a quarter of an hour; I went to my master and desired him to come into the yard to shoot the load of dust; he said, he would come; but he did not come according to his promise; I went to him again afterwards; he gave me orders to go and shoot my load of dust; after I had shot it, I went to him again and asked him, whether I should put my cart on the outside of the gate, or in the yard; he asked me to drink out of a pot, I believe there might be a gill of brandy or hardly so much; then he came out of the tap room and took me into the yard belonging to Mr. Trevet; he says to me, take these two baskets of coals and put them into my yard.</p>
               <p>What baskets? - Bushel and half baskets; they were the baskets that I had in my cart before, that my master directed Larney and Shaw to take them into the White Hart; there was coals in the baskets, but when I had them before, there was nothing in them; put them out, says he, take this basket of coals home to my yard; there was a great coal in particular, the basket would not hold it; he put it down by the side of the water tub; says he, that is for Mr. Trevet; after I took them coals home to where my master ordered me, I returned into the stable, and carried both these baskets pursuant to my master's directions, into the back yard; I directly unharnessed the horse, and rode him down and saw no more about the coals.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. So they only sent you to Bridewell because you had not a better lodging? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in Bridewell? - I believe I have been there about fourteen days.</p>
               <p>Why, you was taken up for stealing these coals was not you? - No.</p>
               <p>Which other of your good deeds was you taken up for? - Because I could not get sufficient bail.</p>
               <p>Bail for what? - Bail for my appearance.</p>
               <p>Has friend Trevet supported you in gaol? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Who did? - I had money sent me.</p>
               <p>Belike you can tell who sent it? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How much has been sent you during this fortnight? - I cannot rightly tell, I believe about twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>Now try your hand at recollection, who sent it you upon your oath, did not Trevet send it you? - No Sir, upon my oath, he has not sent me any, I believe it was Mr. Clarkson.</p>
               <p>Pray, might you carry any of those coals home to your own lodging? - No Sir, none at all.</p>
               <p>That you swear positively? - Yes, nor to no other place but the prisoner's yard, I believe I have worked for him about three or four months.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230036"></xptr>Did Mr. Scott use to deal with him? - Yes, for breeze and soil.</p>
               <p>Pretty largely? - I do not know how much a week; he had large dealings; as fast as he could make the cinders into ashes, Mr. Scott was ready to take them from him.</p>
               <p>How many of you honest men might your master keep? - There were eight of us to fetch the dust, besides the people we employed in the yard, and seven or eight carts.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I apprehended the prisoner Hands; on Thursday, the 10th of May; I had a warrant to apprehend him; he was drinking at Mr. Trevet's, the White Hart, in Old-street; he was under confinement; as he was going to gaol, he said in the coach, he was surprised to see Mr. Trevet come to speak before the Justice, for he had left Mr. Trevet two coals, and he had four.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you told him, to induce him to make this confession, that he should not be prosecuted, or receive favour, or any thing of that kind? - No, it was his own talk; he had his hearing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He knew you was an officer; I ask you, it is a tender question now and then; did he at all confess that he received them, knowing them to be stolen? - No Sir; he said, he wondered that Trevet should speak, for he had left two coals at Trevet's, and he had four.</p>
               <p>Did not he constantly profess his innocence? - He certainly did; he never confessed himself guilty, any more than these words.</p>
               <p>Have you known Mr. Trevet much? - Yes Sir, he lived in our parish; I never saw the last witness till I apprehended him.</p>
               <p>You locked him up directly? - The moment I took him into custody, says he, I will not suffer myself to be served as the other two men were, for I will go before the Justice and tell the whole truth, for I am a servant, and what I did, was by my master's orders; but my orders were to take him away and not let him speak to any body, which I did; he has been in custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am innocent.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, N</hi> 14). On the morning of 1st July, I was called to the prosecutor's house, No. 15, Nicol-square, Hackney-road—I went upstairs and saw the prosecutor standing on the landing, bleeding from his left arm; there was blood on the landing and on the walls, and a great quantity on the floor—there was a man on the landing holding the bedroom door, to keep the prisoner inside—he opened the door and I went in, and found the prisoner standing on the top of the bed, naked, with his arms extended, a razor in his right hand, and a cloth bound round it—I told him to drop it—he said, "l am glad you are come," and instantly threw the razor down on the wash hand stand—he was secured and taken to the station—as we were going along he said that the prosecutor was going to murder him, and that he put the bedstead and chairs against the door to protect himself, to keep them from coming in—I sent for a doctor for the prosecutor before I left the house, and when I returned I found Mr. Wallis there—the prosecutor was in a fainting state when I went down stairs with the prisoner; he was confined for a week, and not able to appear before the Magistrate—I found marks of blood on the prisoner's bed, as if he had trodden in blood, and then stepped on it with his naked feet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live at No. 15, Nicol-square, Hackney-road—the prisoner lodged there. On Saturday night, 30th June, I came home a little before 10 o'clock—the prisoner lodged in the back room first floor—I went up to him and asked him if he knew whether his time was up, as I had previously given him a week's notice—he said, "Mr. Wayman, don't turn me out to night; allow me to stop, I don't feel very well"—I said, "I cannot allow you to enter into another week; your conduct is such, coming home at all hours of the night, I cannot allow you to remain in the house"—after a while 1 consented to let him remain in the house, and I then left his room—we retired to bed about a quarter to 12 o'clock—I had not been in bed above five minutes, before I heard the prisoner making a great noise, swearing to himself, as I frequently heard him do before, and making a most awful groaning noise, and pulling things backwards and forwards, which annoyed me, and I could not go to sleep—I went up to ask him whether he would be quiet—I knocked at his door</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185508200041"></xptr>
               <p>first, but got no reply—his door not being fast, I opened it and just looked in—I saw him standing upright on his bed; he had only his night shirt on—the moment I opened the door and put it back to step my foot in, he flew at me with something—I did not know that he had anything in his hand—he struck me very violently—I held up my arm to defend my face from the blow, and received a very severe wound in my arm from some sharp instrument—I bled very much indeed—my arm was cut in three places, and my hand was very severely cut in one place—a constable was sent for, and he was given into custody—Mr. Wallis came and dressed my wounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You and he had had no quarrel, had you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not a world—I never had an angry word with him—he is rather an excitable person—I saw little of him, but I saw enough to induce me to give him a week's notice—I had a very respectable gentleman lodging with me, and I did not want my house upset—I do not know that he was apprehensive of persons doing him an injury—he never said so to me—I spoke to him at 10 o'clock—my wife told me that she looked into his room between 10 and 12 o'clock, but did not speak to him; she found him asleep—I had no difficulty in getting into his room—he had pulled the wash-hand stand so as to prevent the door from opening wide—it would only open straight, but there was plenty of room to get in—I do not know what his motive was in placing it there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WAYMAN</hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife—I was at home when this matter happened, but did not see anything of it—the prisoner had been lodging with us about a fortnight—I did not observe anything particular about his conduct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he very nervous? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We gave him notice to leave in consequence of his keeping very irregular hours—on the Thursday, a geranium which he had in his window was blown down, and I put it into another pot, and on Friday morning, in consequence of my not taking it up again, he was quite, in a rage—I am not aware that he was afraid that persons were going to injure him—when he came in in the evening, he called for a cup of tea, which I made, and he called for his bill, and I gave it him—I went up to see if he was ready for his tea, and he was in bed, and apparently asleep—not a word passed between us—I went down again, and waited till my husband came home—it was about 9, or 20 minutes past 9 o'clock, that I went up and found him asleep, and my husband came home a little before 10 o'clock—I did not go up after 10 o'clock, until my husband went up—I went up with him, and took the light—his notice had expired that night—he was making a dreadful noise over our heads, and my husband said he would go and see what it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in the Hackney-road—I was called in to attend Mr. Wayman, on Saturday night, 30th June—I found a very extensive wound on the left arm on the under part, as if it had been received while protecting his head—it was six or seven inches in extent—there were three wounds of a slighter nature; two on the bend of the arm, and one on the back of the hand—that on the arm was certainly inflicted by a sharp instrument—he had lost a great deal of blood—I do not know the prisoner at all—I never saw him till he was before the Magistrate—his conduct then was very violent and extraordinarily irritable, and he appeared to me quite in an unsound state of mind—I expressed that opinion to the Magistrate.</p>

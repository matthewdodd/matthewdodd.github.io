                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Great Northern Rail<lb></lb>way—all excursion arrangements are made in my office, and the fares fixed—we have excursions from Bradford to Paris and back at 72<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. first, and 46<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. third class, the tickets being available for sixteen days—those fares are made up of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the third-class excursion fare from Bradford to London and back, added to 31i. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from London to Paris and back—those are the lowest fares—transferable return tickets never have been and are not issued by any railway company—through tickets from any station are issued, but the starting station must be filled in, and the ticket is only available from that station—I have had no communication with the prisoner with reference to excursion traffic—arrangements for convey<lb></lb>ance to Paris are made through Mr. Harris, the manager of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway.</p>
               <p>

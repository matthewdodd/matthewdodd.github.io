On Sunday, the 28th of September, in the morning, I brought the cash-box down stairs, it contained one 50l., one 5l., one 2l., and four 1l. bank notes, a sovereign, ten guineas, twelve half-guineas, and 40 seven-shilling pieces, in gold; two Spanish dollars, a bill of exchange, and some papers. I went up stairs to clean myself, and took it with me; I put it in the cupboard in my bed-room, which is on the first floor. I told my girl to lock the bed-room door. I went to church. When I returned I saw the prisoner; he asked leave to go out, which I granted. I went out, and returned about half-past ten o'clock; he had not returned. I went up, and found my bed-room door ajar. Next morning, finding he did not return, I became suspicious, examined my cupboard, and missed my cash-box; it was brought to me on the Saturday following, from the Bull and Mouth Inn, inclosed in paper, and directed to me in the prisoner's hand-writing-the contents were gone. The 50l. note was marked"Mrs. Wells, Broad-court," of whom I had received it, in my hand-writing; I received it from her two days before. The prisoner had often seen me put money in the cash-box.</p>

            . I am clerk to the Redford Bank, in Nottinghamshire. On Tuesday, the 30th of September, at eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came with his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290014"></xptr>brother to change a 50l. Bank of England note; the prisoner said it was his brother-in-law's, whose name was Taylor. I gave Taylor ten 5l. notes of our bank. Taylor produced the note. I am certain the prisoner is the man who came with him. Taylor said it was his brother-in-law's note; the prisoner was present, and did not contradict it, but said it was his note, and he was going to lend it to Taylor I produce the note.</p>
               <p>CHARLES HUMPHREYS. I am a Bow-street officer. I went in pursuit of the prisoner, and traced him to Sheffield, and found him lying under a hedge, without his hat, close by Sheffield Park - I took him into custody. He begged I would not hold him as he went through Sheffield, as he was known. I asked him what he had done with the money? he said he had none about him, but had left part of it at his sister's, in Sheffield. I asked him where she lived, and went there. I found his hat, and gloves, there-it had his name in it. The prisoner said he had sent the cash-box, and its contents, to his master. I told him that was false, as I had traced the 50l. note to the Bank. He said he did it himself, was very sorry for it, no person was concerned with him, and he must suffer.</p>

I am the son of James Bayes, a shoe-maker, in Orchard-street, Ball's Pond—I had known the prisoner for about a week, and on the 17th of November we were playing at marbles—he asked me what trade my father was—I told him—he said, "Can't you get a pair of shoes?"—I said, "What to do with them?"—he said, "To get some money for them"—he said, "You get a pair and bury them in the ground, and we will get them"—I said, "No"—he said, "You can't be hurt"—I did so, and buried them in the ground in the garden, and he came at night and took them away.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Police Inspector</hi>). I have compared the docu<lb></lb>ments purporting to be written by W. B. Ward with others known to be in Barnes's writing—they are alike—I apprehended Day at Perry's stable yard in Leather Lane, Holborn, upon a warrant charging him with obtaining from Mr. Woods of Southampton a number of sacks—I told him those sacks were obtained at 23, Snow's Fields—he said "23 Snow's Fields was established by old Dick May 12 months before I went there, Humphreys and Billy Barnes did the writing and have let me in for this, I had nothing out of the John Street affair"—I had mentioned 21, John Street, Smithfield—" I once took away some pigs for Humphreys, but he gave me nothing out of it; if it had not been for such men as Humphreys, White, and Barnes, I could not have done these things, as I cannot write; I have been going straight for the last 15 months. "The John Street business was carried on by Humphreys and Houghton—Humphreys has been convicted—on one occasion I went to 21, John Street in February, 1876—I saw Day there and I spoke to Mary Robson, who has been convicted in this Court—I told Day on his entering the shop that a friend of mine had been defrauded in Wales of some pinks, and Day said that he had been defrauded also—I said "Give me your name and address and we will co-operate together to prosecute these fellows"—he said "I cannot do that"—I went away—I watched the shop during that day and night—I saw Day going backwards and forwards to the shop during the evening—when I took him into custody I alluded to the conversation at this inter<lb></lb>view—I said "Do you remember meeting me at John Street just before Humphreys was arrested when you represented that you had been defrauded?"—he said "I do not," and smiled.</p>

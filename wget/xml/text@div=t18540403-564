                  </hi>. I am a furniture dealer, at No. 33, New-cut, Lambeth. I have a warehouse in Windmill-street, New-cut—I had in that warehouse a new Waterloo bedstead, two new tent bedsteads, a second-hand four post bedstead, and others—I saw them there safe on Thursday, 9th Feb., about ten minutes after six o'clock—the warehouse gates were shut, and fastened with a new padlock—I locked it myself, and left it secure—a few minutes after 9 o'clock I found the padlock gone, and missed the four bedsteads—the gates were then shut, but not locked—I received information on Saturday morning, and went before Mr. Norton the Magistrate—I after<lb></lb>wards went with Romain and Smith, two officers, to the prisoner's premises—I saw him, and asked him whether he had got four bedsteads, or whether he had bought four—he said no, he had nothing of the kind—I told him I had been before Mr. Norton, and I had got a witness to prove that he had four bedsteads in his possession, and he had moved them on the Friday from where he used to keep his truck and his cart standing—he said, "You can do as you like, Mr. Crawley, but I have not got them, and have not seen them; I moved four bedsteads, but these were the four," pointing to four bedsteads in his shop—they were not mine, and I told him so, and said, "What is the use of your denying it so?"—he said, "You can do as you like, I tell you I have not got them," and with that I gave him into custody—I assisted in searching his premises, and found several parts of the four post bedstead behind a lot of wood in the kitchen under the front shop—the officers were then up stairs—I went down into the kitchen by myself—it was in the front kitchen, but the back as you go down the stairs—the staircase is at the back of the house—I brought the pieces of bedstead up stairs, and the prisoner then said, "Mr. Crawley, I will fetch you your four posts; they are round at the turner's, going to be altered"—I asked him what he had done with the rest of the bedstead—he stood a minute or two, and at last he said, "I have cut it up, and burnt it"—he said, "Mr. Crawley, though you don't know me, I know you, and I will fetch you your three new bedsteads, and whatever you like to charge me I will pay you for it; but drop this case, and I will make you a new frame for the one that I have burnt"—I told him whatever the officers or the Magistrate did I should be perfectly satisfied with, but to alter the case I would not—I will not say whether I said I would not alter the case, or whether I would not take it out of their hands—I remained at the prisoner's house while the prisoner and Smith the officer</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chair maker, and live in Robert-street, Waterloo-road. About nine o'clock in the evening of 9th Feb. I went to fasten the gates that shut my yard where I put my trucks, and saw four bedsteads there, standing up against the wall; they were two tents, one Waterloo, and a four post—the prisoner puts his cart and truck in that yard—I saw him there next morning, between 8 and 9—he came in and said, "Here is a job, I am obliged to take these three bedsteads back, because I cannot get the money for them, so I have brought them back; better have them than have no money"—he was alluding to the three new bedsteads which belong to the prosecutor: as regarded the four post, the prisoner said, "I hardly know what to do with this; what do you think?"—I said, "I don't think you will sell it in London; you will have a much better chance with a country dealer," and mentioned a man at Ewell—he said, "I think it would be a chance to sell it to him"—he then went away he returned in about ten minutes, bringing a letter in his hand, and said, "Here, I have just got an order, and I can work it up"—I said, "Work it up I"—he said, "Yes; with a little alteration, it will answer the order that I have got just come in"—I said, "Can you? well, you are lucky!"—he began to untie it, but could not, and asked me to lend him a chisel, which I did; he cut the cords top and bottom, and took a portion away; his boy took another por<lb></lb>tion, and returned twice for the other; it was a very heavy bedstead—he took them all away—I have seen the bedsteads produced here, and believe them to be the same; but I did not take so much notice of the others as I did of the four post, and there is only a portion of that here.</p>

Between 11 and 12 o'clock on Satur<lb></lb>day, 11th Feb., I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's house, in Gibson-street—I told him I had come from Mr. Norton, the Magistrate, respecting four bedsteads he had in his possession belonging to Mr. Crawley, and that there was a witness to prove that he had them; that Mr. Crawley's place had been broken into on Thursday night, and the bedsteads were brought over by him and his boy from the yard where his cart and horse stood, to his premises—he said he knew nothing at all about them—I asked him where those bedsteads were that he removed over from the yard; he said, "There they are," pointing to some that stood just inside the door—Crawley was present; I called his attention to them, and he said they were not the ones he had lost—I told the prisoner he must consider himself in my cus<lb></lb>tody, and I should commence to search the place—I left him in Smith's cus<lb></lb>tody, went down stairs to the kitchen, which is used as a workshop, and saw Crawley's attention called to a portion of a bedstead, which he iden<lb></lb>tified (two men were at work there)—it was brought up stairs into the prisoner's presence; and I said to him, "It is of no use your denying this any further, here is a portion of it found, and, to save anything unpleasant, you had better state where the other portion of it is"—he then said he had taken the posts to his turner's to have them altered, and that the other bed-steads were removed to his polisher's in the Waterloo-road—I remained in the prisoner's house, and Smith went with the prisoner and brought the two post bedsteads back; the prosecutor saw them, and said in the prisoner's presence that they were his.</p>

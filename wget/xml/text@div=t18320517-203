The prisoner lodged at my house by the name of Mrs. Fisher, with a person who either was or passed as her husband - she left us on the 20th of March, and left some goods there; on the 10th of April she came again, and asked to be allowed to go to the room which she had occupied, and I went with her - it was then about half-past five o'clock; I had six silver tea-spoons laying on a table in that room - I saw them distinctly; I left her in the room about ten minutes; she then came down and went out; in about an hour I went to the room again, and missed the spoons - there was nobody in the house but me; my wife afterwards told me her gown was gone, and on the same day I missed a pair of trousers.</p>

             (Police-constable H 133.) In consequence of information I went to a house in Gloucester-row, Chelsea; I found the prisoner in a lodging there - this gown was laying on the bed-post; I asked if it was not Mrs. Cussen's - she said it was; I took her and told her she was accused of stealing six tea-spoons and a pair of trousers - she denied all knowledge of them, but said Mrs. Cussen gave her the gown.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH CUSSEN. I am the prosecutor's wife. This is my gown - I never lent it, sold it, or gave it to the prisoner - I had it in my own bed-room a fortnight before she quitted; and five or six days after St. Patrick's-day I missed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She gave it me when I was going to an Irish club. Witness. No, I never gave it - she never wore it in my presence - I am quite sure I never gave her authority to wear it; our street door was open in the day time - I do not know that another person might not have gone in, and taken the spoons; they have never been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have witnesses to prove that I wore this gown in her house before her and her husband.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CUSSEN. Their furniture is left there, and is, I believe, worth from 25s. to 30s. - she owed me 6l. 5s.; she did not offer to pay two sovereigns, nor did the man; I never saw her wear this gown.</p>
               <p>Witness for the Defence.</p>
               <p>MARY SULLIVAN. I lodged in the prosecutor's house for ten months, and never saw a silver spoon there - the prisoner lived there at the time; I saw this gown new upon Mrs. Cussen, and I afterwards saw it on the prisoner - upon my soleman oath I saw the prisoner wearing this gown for two months, while she was a lodger there.</p>
               <p>MARGARET DONOHUE. I live at Blackwall. I have been in and out at the prosecutor's for three months in the last winter - I saw the prisoner twice with this gown on, in the presence of the prosecutor and his wife.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CUSSEN. Sullivan left my house on the 17th of December - she had owed me a debt, which I got of her, and she has not been in my house since - Donohue has been there, but very seldom.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Upon your oath have you been into the prosecutor's house since the first day of the year? A. No, but I have seen the prisoner wearing the gown both in and out of the house - I live close by.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE DRISCOLL. I used to go to the prosecutor's house to see their baby - I have seen the prisoner wear this gown; I am sure it is the same - I saw it on Mrs. Cussen's back when it was new.</p>

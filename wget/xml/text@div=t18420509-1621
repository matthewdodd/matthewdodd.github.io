                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Lower Chatham-street—the prisoner lodged in my house with her father and mother—I lost the key of my parlour—I put a sovereign into my snuff-box to pay my rent, and went out between eleven and twelve o'clock on the morning of the 11th of May—when I came home I found the plants I had put against the place where the snuff-box was, were moved, and the sovereign gone—it has not been found—the prisoner came home at one next morning—she and her sister went up to her father's room—the next morning I challenged her with robbing me—she disowned it—I sent for the policeman and took her before the Magistrate, and then she owned it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called on Thursday evening, about eleven o'clock, and the prisoner was given into my custody—she denied in the first instance having seen the sovereign—her mother came in and said if she had done wrong she had better acknowledge it—she said, "I have not done wrong, I cannot own to anything I have not done"—I took her to the station—the sergeant told me to take her to a pawnbroker—I took her a little way and she fainted away—I returned and left her at the station—before the Magistrate she acknowledged it, and offered to pay 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. On the contrary, according to the depositions, she said, "I did not take it," <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She said she did take it—she had taken a gown out of pledge at the pawnbroker's, and my object in going there was to ascertain whether she had changed a sovereign there—she had not—it was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. she had paid to take the gown out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I did not say I had taken it; I said I would pay it back rather than go to prison.</p>

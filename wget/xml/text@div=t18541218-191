(I had one in my pocket book)—he said, "The matter is now arranged"—I went up stairs—I did not see the receipt written—I saw it after it was written—I do not know the handwriting—I had written a receipt for Mr. Petre to give to the prisoner—it was written in English, and the receipt that was afterwards written was a copy of mine, with the exception of its being for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. de Curgas read the receipt to the prisoner in French, and translated it into English, and he said to him in French, "This is for the purpose of giving a full discharge for all"—the prisoner said, "Yes yes, yes," as to its being a full discharge for all or any charge that he might have against Mr. Petre—I saw the prisoner sign it, the receipt, and it was given to Mr. Petre—I saw Mr. Petre hand a cheque to the prisoner—he went away, and came back some time after<lb></lb>wards, and came up stairs—the said to me and Mr. Petre that the cheque was wrong—the mistake was that it was dated the 24th, and this was on Satur<lb></lb>day, the 23rd—I said we had discovered the mistake, and Mr. Petre would give him another—Mr. Petre put himself to the table to give him another, and I took the first cheque and wrote on it "Spoiled," and wrote the same in the cheque book—Mr. Petre then wrote a second cheque, and it was handed to the prisoner—the first cheque remained on the table.</p>

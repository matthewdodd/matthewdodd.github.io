            , the prisoner. On the 15th of November, I had business to do in the city, and I returned from the city to my own house, about half after five in the evening; I no sooner got home, than my wife told me something of the half crowns, and I went to every shop that I thought the boy could get rid of such property, to enquire if he had changed such coin.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of property did you look after? - Two half crowns, nothing else at this time; - I made this enquiry on Friday the 15th, about seven o'clock in the evening. On Saturday I asked him, if he did not take two half crowns out of the till, when I was absent, and whether he did not take a parcel of halfpence that I put on a shelf in the bar, a few days before? he made me no answer; I walked on from where I stood, to where I was talking to him, to the kitchen, and when he saw me going to the kitchen, he walked towards the door that goes to Edgeware road. I ask your pardon, my Lord, before I walked towards the kitchen, I told him, you know you are a villain,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040104"></xptr>(this was after I had accused him of the half crowns) I have a great mind to send for a constable immediately, and have you searched; accordingly I called for a servant out of the tap-room, and gave him directions to go for Jones, the constable; then after that I walked off into the kitchen, as I mentioned before; it is on the same floor with the tap-room; the prisoner saw me going towards the kitchen, he went towards the door that goes to Edgeware road, I stopped in the kitchen about half a minute, and came the same way that he did, towards Edgeware road unto the bar. Our bar is quite against Edgeware road. I stopped in the bar about a quarter of a minute, and not seeing him at the door. I had a suspicion he had my property on him at this time, I followed him in about half a minute; I went into the stable yards, and asked the hostler. if he had seen George? when I came out of the yard. I saw him about a hundred and twenty yards from me in the Edgeware road, going towards Edgeware from Paddington. I called to him as loud as I could, and beckoned to him with my hands in this manner, as he looked, and in so doing, he began to run as fast as ever he could. When I saw him, I began to run after him as fast as I could; I saw him with both his hands, seeming to me, as if feeling for his pocket; I followed him for a hundred yards before this; and then he turned into Church-street, that goes towards Paddington; I saw him, as it appeared to me, to throw something out of his left hand into Church-street, he was about four or five yards from me at this time. I did not stop to see if any thing was thrown there, I followed him; he run about a hundred yards from there, then I took him. You villain, says I, what did you run away for? says he, you said, you would have me searched; says I, what, was you afraid of, if you had nothing but your own? I brought him back to where he threw the property away before, I looked about there for the value of two minutes, at last, I saw a piece of brown paper lapped up very curious; I had hold of the prisoner with my right hand, and with my left hand I picked up this piece of paper, where the two half crowns were lapped up in; there was another parcel of silver tied up in brown paper he picked up, Oh! says he, this is mine; you have no business with this, I made an attempt to take it out of his hand, I could not; I threw him down on the ground, I asked another man, that stood by, to help me take the money out of his hands; this man did help me to take the money out of his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. What money was it? - We did not examine it, till such times as I brought him back to the house. I had it in my left hand all the time; when I got to the house, I gave him to the constable in charge, and the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open that second paper? - I did, it was sixpences and shillings, it was not reckoned there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Murray, your wife, I take it has the principal care of the till? - No more care than one of the evidences that you will see presently.</p>
               <p>Q. You have brought her to give an account of the transaction? - She don't know much of it.</p>
               <p>Q. She at first gave you the information? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. She gave you the information on the 15th? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you waited till the 16th? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time? - A little after one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time on the 15th, did your wife give you the information? - About half after five.</p>
               <p>Q. From that time, you did not mention a word to the prisoner? - I did not see any occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us, that the prisoner went out of the house? I believe,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040105"></xptr>you are a pretty violent master sometimes? How many blows had you struck this young fellow before he ran away? - I never struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. Be cautious! how often did you strike him before he left the house? - I do not recoliect that ever I struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. You know, that this happened not a fortnight ago? - Somewhere thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. And you cannot recollect? - I am positive I do not think, that I made any attempt; I do not know, that ever I made an attempt.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear, man, that you did not strike him before you left the house that day? - Never.</p>


               <p>Q. You are positive of that? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You seized him by the collar, and accused him of having robbed you? - I did for a certainty.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did you knock him down, when you laid hold of him? - Once, he might push his head against the wall, but it was his own seeking.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is not truth, that you knocked him down? - I was pulling him along.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, I will have a direct answer; Did not you dash his head against the wall? - In pulling him along, when he did not like me to take him, to have justice done to him, he might possibly dash his head against the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was it, you have sworn both ways; did you knock his head against the wall, or did he dash himself? - You want to bother me, to swear that I would not wish to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention a word about there half crowns before the justice? - I don't know, that ever I was asked the question; I don't know, that I mentioned them; I mentioned then, the same as I do now.</p>
               <p>Q. When a person is on oath, he is expected to be correct. Did you mention any half crown before, or claim them as your's? - How could I swear they were mine till they were produced by the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you swear to them when they were produced by the constable? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your wife well? - She is.</p>
               <p>Q. And she had the care of this till? - At times.</p>
               <p>Q. She attends at the bar, does not she? - She does some time.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons had access to the bar and till besides this man? - I take it every servant in the house has access to this bar at times. If there is a glass of gin, or bread and cheese cut out, they may go in and take it out.</p>
               <p>Q. They may all go in? - They may.</p>
               <p>Q. How many are they that have access to this bar of your's? - Five of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the till kept locked? - Most part of the time it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the key kept in or out? - Sometimes in and sometimes out.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not threaten him before he went away? - How do you mean?</p>
               <p>Q. To kill him, you understand the question? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath don't you understand? - I told you before, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you threaten to kill him, or did you not? - I answered you before that I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you persevere in that? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you might have answered it at first.</p>

               <p>I am a cousin to Mrs. Murray. On the 15th of November about twelve o'clock in the day the hostler brought me half a crown to take two shillings out for a gentleman's note, he asked me for six-penny worth of halfpence in exchange, because the gentleman wanted some change to pay the turnpikes; I gave him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040106"></xptr>six-pennyworth of halfpence; a little before two o'clock on the same day some gentlemen came in to order some pork chops, I went out of the bar to look for the maid servant to come and do them; I went to the kitchen, she was not there, and I ran up stairs, I immediately came down and looked into the kitchen, and from the kitchen I came to the bar, then I missed the money, and a few halfpence. I missed the half crowns in particular, I thought there were more silver.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the half crown that you received for the gentleman's horse? - I put it in the till, we are continually going to the till taking money. In a few minutes I opened the till after I went to the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been at the till during that time, to the time the hostler came? - O, yes, ten minutes before I missed my money; it was at twelve o'clock in the day I took the half crown, and there was another half crown taken after that.</p>
               <p>Q. When these gentlemen came to order the chops, did you take any money of them? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you introduced this story for? - That was the time that he took it, while I was gone out of the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any before two o'clock? - Not till just after two; I went immediately from the kitchen to the bar, and missed the two half crowns from the till.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave an account of one half crown taken, but you never told me about the other? - I see them both in about ten minutes before I missed them; he seemed very much confused all the afternoon, and agitated in his mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you mentioned the loss of these half crowns to any body? - Yes, to Mrs. Murray, and the hostler, I mentioned it immediately to Mrs. Murray, Mr. Murray was out, and to the hostler about a quarter of an hour after I missed them; there was more silver gone, but to the half crowns I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner know that you had mentioned the loss of these half crowns? - I don't know whether he knew it or no, I did not tell him of it. About six o'clock when Mr. Murray came in, Mrs. Murray and me told him of it, we were both in the bar, Mrs. Murray told him of it, he seemed very much flurried all the evening, and when we were talking to Mr. Murray he listened.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then I find you are a physiognomist, perhaps I am very much troubled in my mind? - I will not say that you are, but he was very much confused in his mind afterwards all the afternoon, I am certain he was from the manner in which he was, when he was called to do any thing, he seemed in such studies that he would hardly move, he seemed quite in a study whenever we called him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told your cousin of it he was in a very great passion? - No, in no passion at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he break out the next day? - He was not in any great passion.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a very violent man I believe? - No, he is not, he was rather in a passion.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did he threaten to kill him? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you did not hear what past? - I was in the kitchen all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did he threaten to kill him before he left the house? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go out of doors after the man? - I see him go out of the kitchen into the bar and immediately out of the bar to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear him threaten to kill the man then? - He did not, he was only just a little in a passion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shake him? - I did not see him shake him; the prisoner ran away up Church street, because he did not chuse to be searched.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040107"></xptr>Q. Before he went away did not you see your uncle go up to him and shake him very violently? - He did not, he would not eat any dinner or breakfast.</p>

               <p>I am a housekeeper; I am an hostler to Mr. Murray. On the 15th of November, the middle part of the day, a gentleman came for his horse that had been in all night; when I led his horse out he asked me what it came to? I told him two shillings; with that he gave me half a crown, he desired me to look at it to see it was good; I looked at it and took it to the bar, and gave it to the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you should know it again? - Upon my oath I cannot say whether I could or not. She took it and looked at it, and said, it did not want any trying; they generally try their silver on a stone; I went in to dinner very soon after, and my mistress came into the kitchen to get some stakes or something to be dressed for a gentleman's dinner; when she returned she found the prisoner in the bar, he seemed rather frightened. There was six-pence in the prisoner's possession at the time he was taken, I took it of a gentleman about ten weeks before that; the gentleman told me that he took it of my master, it seemed suspicious; the gentleman gave it me for myself, and told me if I did not like it to return it again to my Master, and he would give me another for it, I returned it to my master, he said he knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what your master did with that six-pence? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether that was in the till or not? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You had not seen that six-pence for ten or eleven weeks? - I had not seen it from the time that I took it.</p>
               <p>Q. And the moment you had it, you exchanged it with your master? - I did.</p>
               <p>Jury. Should you know that six-pence again? - Yes, there was a large piece out of it.</p>

               <p>I am an officer, a constable. I know Mr. Murray, I was sent for by Mr. Murray's servant; I had the prisoner delivered to me, charged with robbing Mr. Murray of twenty-six shillings, two half crown pieces, some shillings and sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the money given to you? - It was delivered into my custody, the whole of the money, as far as I know was delivered to me, I put them in a cloth together, where they remain. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Jury to Murray. Have you any recollection of a six-pence you received of the hostler in changing one? - He brought me a six-pence to the bar, and said that he took it of a gentleman that I gave it to, he asked me if I knew any thing of it? yes, says I, that is an old warrior of mine, I have had that six-pence a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with it? - I put it in a cup in the till, where we keep the silver that we take in the day, and at night it is put into the silver bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it again? - I Should, this is the six-pence, I can swear to it, and some more of the silver I believe, but I cannot be positive, if that had not been so remarkable a one I would not have undertook to have swore to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How many months was it since you first took this six pence? - I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Q. This silver is put into a cup the day it is received, and then it is put in the money bag at night? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose your wife has the care of this money bag, and gives exchange at times, and your cousin? - They do.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether they had parted with this six-pence you don't know? - I do not.</p>

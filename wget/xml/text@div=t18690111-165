On Saturday, 19th December, about 5 in the afternoon, Mr. Cockerell came up to me in the Kensington Road, he gave me certain information which led to my following Thompson—I took him into custody on a charge of being concerned with another man in uttering counterfeit coin—he only said, "Oh!"—as soon as I took hold of him, he shifted something from his right hand to the left—I got hold of his left hand, but there was nothing in it—I took him to the station and found on him a pocket-book, containing 157 postage stamps and a knife—just before I searched him Mr. Cockerell said, "You will find my stamps in seven fives and an odd one," and I did so—I also found on him some money, a quarter of a pound of cheese, and a pair of children's mits—I received four bad half-crowns from the witness Cole.</p>

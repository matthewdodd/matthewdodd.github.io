               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Lathaby. This was about two in the afternoon or a quarter after; he asked me if I knew one Whitaker a Marshalsea court officer; he asked me to sit down by him, which I did; I told him I had known Mr. Whitaker some years, but I had not seen him for about six months; he said, does he belong to the Marshalsea court now or not; I said I do not know, he has been gone out of this neighbourhood 5 or 6 years; he said he believed he could hear of him at Longbottom's in Great Russel-street, Seven Dials; he staid about a quarter of an hour, and kept me in talk; after he was gone, I had some business up stairs; I asked my wife for the key of the room, when I came to open the door the lock was unlocked, it was only upon the spring.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go out of the house?</p>
               <p>Lathaby. I did; my tap-room goes into a passage that communicates to the street, and the stairs that go up into my room, the passage goes out into another court; the passage has no communication with the tap-room at all, the stairs go up on the same side of the passage as the tap-room door does, more towards the back court; that is the only stair-case belonging to my house, the passage is always open except at night, when I shut it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a door at the bottom of the stairs?</p>
               <p>Lathaby. There is, but that door was not shut I believe at that time; my wife told me she had double lock'd the door but a little before; when I came to open the drawers, I found there was five of them open, and the locks were all spoiled; every farthing of my money was gone, 20 l. and upwards, boxes and all; one that I kept my silver in, and the other my gold; as near as I can recollect there was 12 guineas, 4 half guineas, one 9 s. piece, one 6 s. and 9 d. piece, a 5 s. and 3 d. and 5 l. in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the money last?</p>
               <p>Lathaby. I had seen it in the boxes not an hour and a half before, there was my watch, table spoons, punch ladle, and other things of value, but nothing of that were meddled with; then I went up to Sir

Sir John asked me what sort of persons these were; I described them, and when I came to the bottom of Bow-street, I saw the prisoner cross and go into a house in Russel-street; I said to Mr. Marsden, that is the man that kept me in talk at the time; I went and took him, and charged the constable with him immediately; he was taken to the

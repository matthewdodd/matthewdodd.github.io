               <p>Q. At what time of the day was you asked the question? - In the morning by eight o'clock, by William Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you keep your geese of a night? - On the common.</p>
               <p>Q. It was on the common you saw them on the night before? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had these geese? - I bred them myself there was one old one, and two young ones, they are pretty near a twelve month old now.</p>

               <p>Q. There was a gander, was not there? - There was.</p>

               <p>I was coming home the 23d of Octo ber from my work between ten and eleven at night; I live at a place called Nowel-green, and I work for Mr. Pigot at Staines, I heard a great noise of geese in a place called Shortwood, it is near Mr. Watson's house, within a quarter of a mile, and I called the neighbours up to go and see what was the matter with these geese, when we came on the common we saw a man with a sack on his shoulder, it was the prisoner, we pursued him and he threw the sack down and ran away, I ran after him, I picked up the sack and there were two geese and a gander in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to know whose geese they were? - Not before the man owned them; I applied to the man in the morning; I enquired about the geese, whose geese they were, and this man owned them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Watson? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court to Watson. Tell me whether the geese that the last witness shewed you were your's? - Yes, they were.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury; the time I was taken up, I was going to my mother's, when being within a mile of Staines, a man stopped me; on my asking him what he stopped me for, he d-n'd me, and told me, he did not know, but that I should wait till this man came up, for he heard a cry of stop thief; and when the man came up, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150011"></xptr>sastened a rope from my neck to my legs, so that I was very near being choaked; I told them I had done nothing to be served so, on which, one of them stampt on my head, and told me, I had stolen some geese; which I declare is utterly false; I was taken however to Staines, and from thence I came to Newgate, where I remained till the last sessions, when I was discharged by proclamation; I then set off to go and see my mother again; about fourteen miles from Staines, two men overtook me on the road, and said, this is the man; d-n'd me, and told me, I was his prisoner, and if I did not stop, he would fire at me; I told him, I was on the King's highway, and I would not stop, unless they told me, what I had done; they said no more to me, but fired a large pistol at me, and lodged the contents of it in my legs, by which I have been lame ever since. I am entirely innocent of the crime laid to my charge, and I humbly hope, your Lordship and the Jury will think favourable of me; I humbly beg the indulgence of this honourable Court, that I may not suffer any more, for a crime that I am entirely innocent of.</p>
               <p>Court to Brown. Did you carry him to gaol directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he discharged after that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he dropped the property, did he say any thing? - He did, he said, we molested him on the high road, that was all he said.</p>

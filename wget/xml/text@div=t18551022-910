                  </hi>. I live at Hendon, and deal in coals. On 17th Sept I was in Edgware-road, going towards Hendon—I had been in London collecting clothes for washing—I was at Dolley's-hill as near 9 o'clock as possible, in the evening—I was in the cart, going gently up the hill—Mary Bingham was with me, and a little boy—two men came up to my horse, one from one side of the road, and the otter from the other—they caught hold of the horse's head—I called out, "What do you want?"and one of them let go the horse, and raised up a heavy bludgeon and struck at me—that was the one who is not here—the prisoner still held the hone—the one who struck at me said, "Deliver, deliver!"—I should say he said it ten times—when he said it the second time, I said, "I will deliver," and I began flogging him with my whip, which was the only protection I had—he went round the cart, striking at me with the bludgeon, and I at him with the whip—I should say he struck at me forty or fifty times, and he struck Mrs. Bingham once across the knees—after some time I missed both the men—I never saw them go—I did not lose anything—I went on to the Harp public house, and gave an alarm—a policeman afterwards brought the prisoner to me, and said would I give him in charge—I said I could not swear to him, but he was the same stature as the one at the head of the hone, and he said, "I am the man that held the hone"—I did not know it at that time, but I had seen him before repeatedly.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, S</hi> 223). I was on duty about 10 minutes past 9 o'clock—I went to the spot, and saw the prisoner under a hedge—I asked him what he did there—he said, "I beg your pardon, I did not strike the man, I only held the horse, while the other man struck at Plumb"—the prisoner had this large stick with him, and he told me that he and the other man went into a field and made an agreement to commit a highway robbery, and share the money between them—he said that he never was in London before, and that he came from Ireland.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the cart with the prosecutor. Two men stopped the horse—I saw the prisoner hold the horse, but I never saw him strike, nor heard him say a word—the other one said, "Deliver!"and he began to strike across the cart—he struck me once.</p>

            . I am carman to Mr. Wreford. Mr. Dunstan told me to take some parcels to Mr. Turner; I cannot say how many there were of them. I went about half-past four o'clock on the 13th of November, and went straight to Mr. Turner's door; I did not get off the cart till I got there. On Monday, the 15th, I was told by Mr. Turner that these two parcels were missing.</p>

            . I live in Crown-court. My father is a bricklayer's labourer. Mr. Turner's house is at the corner of our court. I saw a tilted cart at his door on the 13th of November, about four o'clock - the prisoner and three or four more were there. I saw the prisoner step up the step of the cart, and take a parcel out - he gave it to another, who gave it to a third, and it got to the prisoner again; he then walked by me, and asked what I was looking at - I said nothing; he gave me a blow in the face, which made my mouth and nose bleed; I had seen him before, and knew his person. The parcel was about twenty inches square.</p>

            . I live at No. 97, Long-alley. I saw the prisoner, (whom I have known four years) pass my window about five o'clock, on the 13th of November - he had nothing with him; he went towards Crown-street, with four or five others, and returned with a paper parcel, about twenty inches square, under his right arm. I looked after him that night, but could not find him. I apprehended him on Monday morning, at the George public-house.</p>

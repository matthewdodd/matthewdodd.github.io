                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of 41, St Mary Axe—about two years ago I succeeded a Mr. Werner, and when I took possession of the office I found the cheque-book there—it was kept in an unlocked place, and the prisoner, who has been alone in the office many times, had access to it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Had other parties access to your offices? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes. I am not aware that a person once got in at the window and took some things—I know a person named Jefferys, he has been left alone in the office, and so has Mr. Marshall, he had a key of the office and of the desk also—Mr. Bias has also been left there—I will swear that I never knew any one named Thomas Lucas come to my office, and I don't believe any one of that name ever came there—I have often left persons alone in my office, and they have had the same chance as you have—you have not worked twelve months for me for nothing; if you sold bricks for me you had a commission.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector V</hi>). I had charge of this cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I placed it in an envelope, with a number of pieces of paper—it was produced in Court on several occasions, but on pulling out the other pieces I must have pulled it out and let it fall on the floor, and, it being very dirty, I have no doubt it has been thrown in the fire as waste paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I served Thomas Lucas, a builder, with five truck loads of bricks and tiles, which were sent to Bricklayers' Arms Station. I afterwards met Lucas, who said that he should have some cheques in a day or two. Two or three days afterwards I received three cheques filled up, but the body was not filled up, and I filled it up. He told me not to pay them away at once as there was not sufficient money there, but to forward him more bricks at once. The bricks were sent to him in railway trucks, to East Grinstead. I am as innocent of the signature as a child unborn, but the body of the cheque I filled up. When I found there was no account at the bank I went to Charing Cross; there was no account there, and then I went to Grosvenor Gardens, and the gentleman there said that he thought I was in a mess. I then went to East Grinstead, but could not find Lucas. Before I left I told a policeman next door to me that I was going. The policeman told me that he could find Thomas Lucas, and he went into the country for a few days, and because they could not find him they try to make out that it is Thomas Lucas of Pimlico, but there is no such firm; there is a firm of Lucas of Westminster. I am as innocent of the forgery as a child unborn, and as to uttering them I did not know any difference till I heard that a party had been to the bank and there was no money there, and never had been. My father went into a fit when I was taken before the Magistrate, and it has been his death.</p>

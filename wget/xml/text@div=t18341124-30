                  </hi>. I was living as nurse at St. Katherine's Cottage, Regent's-park. Allen came there to clean knives—on Tuesday, the 21st of October, I delivered my boxes to him to take to my mother's, at No. 9, York-row, Kingsland—when I got home in the evening they were there, but I found a band-box had been opened—I missed from it two small boxes with trinkets in them, and a cap, and several things; a bonnet, a remnant of lace, and other things, which were quite safe when I delivered it to him—I went next day to St. Katherine's Cottage and saw Allen—I told him of it—he denied it for some time—I threatened to get</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman, and live in Cirencester-place, Fitzroy-square. On Wednesday, the 22nd of October, I met the prose<lb></lb>cutrix in Tottenham Court-road, in company with Allen—she said she had been robbed, and Alien could point out the person who had done it—I went with him to a house in High-street—Allen pointed out Morris, and said that was the boy who had done it; and I found a trinket-box on him, containing a necklace, and brooch, and earring; and six duplicates, one of which led me to Crush—I went to No. 10, John street—Allen told me he had some property there, and I found a small box, containing a brooch and buckle, and three duplicates not relating to the property—Allen told me those were his lodgings—I took him into custody also—I found the articles on a rabbit-hutch, in the back-yard, by his direction.</p>
               <p>(Thomas Rental, John-street, Tottenham Court-road, and Thomas Webberly, coal-dealer, Windmill-street, gave the prisoner Allen a good character.)</p>

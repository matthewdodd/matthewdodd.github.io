                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at 10, West-street, Upper-St. Martin's-lane—on 6th February, I was passing through Long-acre; just at the corner of Bow-street there was a crowd—I went off the flag-stones to go on the causeway to avoid them, and immediately I got off I received a stroke in the mouth, and one at the back of the left-ear, both at one instant—I did not see the person that struck me—my teeth were loosened—I became insensible, and know no more; when I recovered I saw the constable, Monckton—he was in plain clothes—I told him I was robbed of my pocket-book, money, and some keys.</p>

About half-past 12 on the night of 6th February, I was on duty in plain clothes in Long-acre—I saw the prosecutor, and several men and women standing round him; the prisoner was among them, standing in front of him—she had his waistcoat-pocket in her hand—her baud was outside the pocket, holding the bottom part of the waistcoat—I went forward and asked the prosecutor if he had lost anything—the prisoner ran away directly—the prosecutor was bleeding from the mouth—he told me he had lost some money—I assisted him to the station, and then went in search of the prisoner; I arrested her two or three hours afterwards at a coffee-house in Great Queen-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields—she was searched in my presence.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the bank note, value thirty-pound, brought to you for change that morning - A. There was; that note is here I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Davis, just put the note into the other gentleman's hand.</p>
               <p>(The note handed to Mr. Dickenson.)</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Dickenson. Was that thirty-pound note brought to you for change - A. It was, No, 14,277, dated 9th of January 1813.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe sir, it is not usual at the Bank ever to have in circulation two notes of the same number and date - A. No, they are never in circulation at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time in the morning was that thirty-pound note presented to you for payment - A. From ten to half past ten o'clock, to the best of my judgment by the appearance of the day's work.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person who presented it to you a stranger - A. Yes, a postman.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say he was a postman - A. Why it is unusual for us to put the name of persons upon the notes, and I see this is my writing, the name and address; the name and address of Jones, 23, John-street Minories, is written upon it by me; that is the name and place of abode given to me by the person who presented the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your practice to require persons who present the notes to write their names with their own hands - A. Yes, that is our usual practice.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how happened it that you wrote that name - A. Because the person that presented it had his hand full of letters, and I wrote the name; he appeared to be a postman.</p>
               <p>Q. He had post letters in his hand - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he desire you to write his name - A. Seeing his hand full of letters I asked him his name and address, most likely I writ it voluntarily, seeing his hand being engaged.</p>
               <p>Q. After that was done, do you hand the note to another person - A. I do hand it to another person; I enter the note in the cash book, and then hand it to Mr. Davis. My entry in the cash book is two ten's, and ten one's; the particulars of the notes are written down by me in another book; this entry is made by myself, two ten's, 1206, and 1209, dated 13, January, 1813, both of the same date.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the ten one's - A.6357, to 6366, inclusive, all dated 7, January, 1813.</p>

Plomer came in about five minutes afterwards, I gave it to Plomer; I am quite sure that I gave to Plomer, the very note that I received of the prisoner.

Yes; in consequence of that bank note having appeared to come from the Bank of England, a note was sent to me of it, that it was paid in by the receiver general of the Post office; I set on foot an enquiry, and ascertained it had passed from the hands of the prisoner, by what appears upon the endorsement of the note. I desired that the prisoner might be sent to me. I told him how the bank note had passed through the various stages; I asked him where he had received it; he admitted that he had received it for postage of letters I mentioned to him that he had not written his name upon the note; I asked him why he had not written it upon the note; I knew that was the order of the board; he said he had not written it, it was an omission, and he was sorry for it. I asked him from whom he received it; he named one or two persons; I do not recollect. He said it was received for postage of letters. I recommended him to apply to these persons; he said he would; and I desired him to call again upon me. After a few days he called again; he said he could not make out from whom he had received it, but certain he was it was for postage of letters. It must have been a day or two after, within the 14th of February, that I had this conversation with him, by a memorandum I have in my hand. The prisoner was not in custody at that time; he was not taken into custody untill the 1st of April.</p>

               <p>Q. The person, whoever it was, purchased some articles and gave in that name - A. Yes. The amount of the articles was upwards of one-pound. Mr. Weves gave the change in my presence.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day that Mr. Parkins sent me a letter to attend him; I went to him. He said he heard I was applying to get into the office again I answered yes, I had been so long suspended I had got another situation. He asked me if I knew a person of the name of Jacobs; I said no. He asked me if I changed a one-pound note; I told him I had. He then said, we will have these two gentlemen in, and in came two gentlemen, which proved to be Mr. Jacobs and son. They asked me if I knew them; I said, no. Mr. Jacobs asked me if I knew his son; I said, no. He took from his pocket a piece of breeches stuff, and compared to mine; he said I don't think this is the stuff I sold you for a pair of breeches; he took from his pocket a pen-knife, and cut a piece out of my breeches; he told Mr. Parkins he could not swear this to be the same that he sold for the ten-pound note. My breeches were ordered to be taken off by Adkins the officer; they were taken off. Then when I came back after searching my house, they were to be produced to shew to Mr. Parkins. The breeches were given to me again by Adkins; he said, here, take your breeches, they are of no use. Mr. Parkins knows that he had a piece of stuff to compare with the breeches, that I had on. As I am brought here, I call God to witness I am an innocent man. I think Mr. Parkins had the piece of stuff which he brought in his hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parkins. Jacob had furnished me with a piece, the pattern of the stuff that he had sold.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

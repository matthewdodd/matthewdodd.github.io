On Saturday, 5th Aug., I was in my father's shop—he is a grocer, at Willesden—it was the fair-day—the prisoner had a booth there—I had seen him in the course of the day—about eight or nine o'clock in the evening he came and bought some bacon, tea, and sugar, and paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—he then asked if I had any sixpences and halfpence, as he should want them before the night was out—I gave him six sixpences and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of halfpence—he put down four shillings, and said I had given him but 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth—I said I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth—he then took out 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more, and said I was quite right—he gave me six shillings—after he was gone I saw the money was very black—I put it into one corner of the till, apart from other money—in about two hours I called my mother's attention to it, and gave it to her—I had remained attending to the shop the whole of that time—no one else had put anything into the till—I took all the money that evening—when I opened the till the shillings were in the same corner where I had placed them—these are the shillings he gave me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

               <p>Q. What was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Evans. He had worked about our neighbourhood all the winter. He owned before the bench of Justices he stole the horse. William Green of Bethnal Green sent word the horse was with him; there I found him. He is the property of Gamelia Key.</p>
               <p>William Green. I live at Bethnal Green. I keep a chandler's shop and deal in horses. My son had bought a horse of the prisoner at the bar, at Hounslow fair, which was stolen, and he was taken from him. He meeting with the prisoner on a bay one eyed horse with a Switz tail, took him in custody, and brought the horse to my house, which proved to be the prosecutor's horse. He bought him on the 1st of June. I asked the prisoner who the horse belonged to, he told me he belonged to Mr. Key at Ardley. I sent word to Mr. Key, and the evidence came and owned him as his master Mr. Key's property.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

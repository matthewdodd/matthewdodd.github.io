I live in East-lane, Barking-road, and am foreman at Mr. Reed's rope factory, East-lane—I was on the premises at 5 o'clock on 18th November—a large copper, belonging to my employers, was then safe, with a large fire under it—it will hold about 150 gallons—from information I received I returned at 11 o'clock at night, and the copper was gone—I saw it at the prisoner's house, on Monday, the 20th, chopped up; cut down at the sides—it was worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On 20th November, about 2 o'clock, I was on duty in North-street, Plaistow, in plain clothes—the prisoner's house is in that street—I saw him standing at the door, and, having received information, said to him, "Can I see the copper?"—he said, u I will show it to you"—I accompanied him to a shed on his pre<lb></lb>mises, and saw a copper broken up, some pieces of which I produce—also, this chopper, which is jagged, and has marks of copper on it—I asked him where he got the copper—he said that two men came on Saturday night and brought it with a horse and cart—he produced this book, pointed to this entry, and said, "These are the men that I bought it of "<hi rend="italic">This was a</hi>

Q.</hi> Did not he say,"I put their names in the book, but I do not know that those are their names?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I went to Swans-combe-street and Abbey-street, but could find no such persons—both streets are near each other, and within a quarter of a mile of the prisoner's, and a mile, or a mile and a quarter, from where the copper came from—the copper was in a shed in the garden, some little way from the house—the road runs alongside the garden—the shed door was closed—the door faces the road—there was no truck in the shed—the truck stands in the yard—the shed door is an ordinary size—we had a little difficulty in getting the copper out—the copper had, I believe, been used some considerable time—I am not on duty on that beat—you can see the door of the shed from the road—it opens into a fore court, and there is the road—if the door was opened for him to go in and out, people could see the copper—there was no secrecy, he took me there at once.</p>

I am a carman, of Plaistow—on Sunday morning, 19th November, a man named Bowles spoke to me at my stable-yard—the prisoner was not with him—on Monday morning Bowles came again with the prisoner, and asked me to take the copper in my wagon to London—I do not know whether the prisoner heard that, but I think he might—I agreed to take it if they allowed me to take it as I liked, but they asked me to conceal it, and I declined it.</p>

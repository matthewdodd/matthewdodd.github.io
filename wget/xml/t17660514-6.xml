            . I live in Turnmill-street; I heard a great uproar in the street between twelve and one in the day, on the 19th of April; I pursued, hearing the prosecutor had been robbed, I stopped the prisoner; she had the two coats under her arms; I carried her back to the prosecutor's house. She was taken before Justice Girdler, and he committed her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. I was at the prosecutor's house in the back parlour; there was an uproar in the street, which made Mrs. Gillilan go into the shop; she then missed the two coats; I had seen them at coming in a little before. I went out, and met Mr. Blowman bringing the prisoner back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I am a young beginner in buying and selling old cloaths; I gave 13 s. for these two coats, and was going by the prosecutor's house, and the people cried, Stop that woman: I bought them of a woman in Cow-cross.</p>
               <p>Q. to Smith. How long before the prisoner was brought back, that you saw the coats at your going in?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176605140005"></xptr> Smith. I went into the shop about one o'clock, I believe I had been in about 4 or 5 minutes, when I heard the alarm given by a baker and a dustman, who came and knocked at the door, and asked Mrs. Gillilan if she had lost any thing; I believe it was morally impossible for the prisoner to contract a bargain in the time.</p>

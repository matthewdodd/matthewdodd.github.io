               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Eade. I do not know that I ever saw her before.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say?</p>
               <p>Eade. I only saw her deliver the tea-kettle to my wife; she said nothing to me.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Eade. I went out to warm some broth for my husband between two and three o'clock. When I went out the tea kettle was in the corner, on one side of the grate.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Eade. In the lower room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you gone?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Eade. I was gone no longer than while the broth was warming, not a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your husband?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Eade. I left him in the house making an end of his dinner, in the same room from whence the tea-kettle was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock the door?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Eade. The door was left open. When I came into the passage I met the prisoner, and ask'd her what she wanted. She said she wanted to speak with somebody, and said she had knock'd twice, but could make nobody hear, and in going out she turn'd her cloak aside, when I saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175709140026"></xptr> tea kettle under her arm. I told her that tea-kettle was mine. One ask'd me who made it mine. I call'd my husband, and then she said, if it is your tea kettle take it, and delivered it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing else?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Eade. She had got a shirt and a scarlet cloak in her lap and said, if you will not go before a justice of peace with me I will give you this shirt and cloak.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was going of an errand for a man that is distressed. I met that woman, and the tea-kettle was in the passage. She said, who do you want ? I said, I want the woman that goes out a washing. Said she, what are you going to do with this tea-kettle. Says I, I did not see the tea kettle. You lye said she. Her husband came and said, who had the tea-kettle ? She said I had, and ask'd me how I came by this cloak, and said, I believe you have been stealing of this somewhere, if you will give me the cloak I will not carry you before a justice. I said, I will not give you the cloak, for I have done no harm. I never saw the tea kettle before she saw me in the entry.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Cole brook-row, Islington. I had a watch in my front parlour, which I saw safe on the 23rd of May, early in the morning—I put it there myself—I missed it at eleven o'clock the same evening—this now produced is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service. On the 23rd of May the prisoner came and brought a parcel, which he said contained books—I took it from him, and went up stairs—the parlour where the watch was, adjoins the passage where I left him—I do not know what the parcel con<lb></lb>tained—I took it up, and asked my master if he had purchased these books—he said no—when I came down* the prisoner was in the same place where I had left him—he took the parcel, and went away.</p>

I produce a gold watch pawned with me on the 23rd of May—I cannot swear to the prisoner—it was a person very much resembling him, with his hair—I cannot recollect his face—I saw his face, to the best of my belief—I do not think that is the face of the person that pawned the watch—I do not recollect his face at all—I asked him if it was his property—he said no, it was Mr. James Con well's, of No. 40, Rosoman-street—I have heard him speak since—I cannot recollect his voice.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 15th of July I was in the Blackfriars-road—I saw the prisoner riding down the New-cut—I was about crossing over to the other side—I cried out, seeing a man crossing just at the moment that the prisoner was up to him—I also heard the prisoner cry out after me—he was riding at a very rapid rate indeed, galloping and urging on the horse, beating it on the side of its flank with his hand—I saw nothing in his hand—he had a spur on—he was quite near to the man when I hallooed out—the man was crossing from Rowland Hill's chapel—there was plenty of time for the prisoner to pull up—there was no traffic of carts at the time—he could have seen the man—the deceased had got about half-way across the road—I ran as fast as I could, not knowing which way he would turn, and by the time I got across he was up opposite me, or very near me—I saw him knocked down by the horse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital. On the 15th of July, Read was brought into the hospital perfectly insensible—the cause of death was extravasation of blood into and upon the surface of the brain—I inquired into the nature of the accident—the blow and concussion that he received were the cause of death—the appearances were such as were likely to have been produced by the accident described—there was a small scalp wound which was trivial, but there was extravasation of blood sufficient to cause death.</p>

I was driving my own omnibus this day from Kennington-gate to the Angel at Islington—I saw the prisoner on horse<lb></lb>back—there are four roads meet at the spot described—I saw the deceased and the little boy about the centre of the road, in the carriage way, and the prisoner coming along out of Great Charlotte-street to go into Little Char<lb></lb>lotte-street—he was in a condition to see the deceased before he called out—he called out twice—he pulled up sufficient to have cleared the deceased if he had not turned, but his hat blew off, and he stooped—the boy ran back again to the pavement—while the deceased was stooping the shoulder of the horse struck him in the side, which knocked him down—I did not see whether the horse kicked him or trod upon him—the prisoner was travelling a gentle canter, at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour—he certainly was not galloping furiously.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a consulting surgeon. I am not at all acquainted with the prisoner or his friends—Cowling told me the prisoner was to be tried for manslaughter—I said perhaps it was important for him to have as many witnesses as he could, and as a matter of justice I had no ob<lb></lb>jection to state what I knew—I was riding upon the box of Cowling's omni<lb></lb>bus this day with the driver—we were going very slowly, and were very close to Great Charlotte-street—I saw the prisoner coming along on horseback, at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour—the horse lifted his feet very high, and made a great noise, something like what they call a butcher's trot—when about half way across Black friars-road the prisoner hallooed out—the deceased was passing along from Rowland Hill's chapel, as if going along Blackfriars-road towards the Surrey gate—he was not going along the crossing that is used there—he was further in Little Charlotte-street—the boy was with him—they made a movement to cross before the horse, after the prisoner had called out—I did not notice the deceased's hat fall off, but he seemed to make a halt and hesitation, and turned round—the little boy ran back, leaving him in the road, and it was then that he was struck by the horse's shoulder—the prisoner was not beating or spurring the horse at that time that I saw—he checked when he hallooed out—he might have stopped the horse entirely, but I considered at the time it was the deceased's hesitation, and turning round in the road which caused the coalition—I should say the prisoner pulled up his horse within six yards of the deceased from the place where he was struck—he turned back of his own accord, and rode back to the accident, and then the omnibus I was on drove on—I had no idea the coalition would have killed the deceased—he was not thrown forcibly on the ground, but made a rotary motion, and then fell—I do not think there was any kick, as from the position of the parties, if there had been, it would have been at the lower part of the man, not his head—I did not observe anything furious in the prisoner's driving—it was not a place which was likely to be dangerous—I consider he gave sufficient warning, that if there bad been more persons on the crossing they might have got out of the way.</p>

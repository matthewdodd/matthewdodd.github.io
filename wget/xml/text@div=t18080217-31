New stockings, new handkerchiefs, caps, and other articles, all new; when I took the duplicate out of her pocket, I asked her how she got these new articles, when she was obliged to go to the pawnbrokers in the morning; she hesitated on the road going to the office, she said there was another girl concerned with her; she took only three of the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told her what you took her for. - A. Yes, for taking the notes out of Collins's box; she said she had slept at the Portland Arms, in Portland-street, she had bought a new bonnet, and there it was left; I went there, I found she had been there in company with a coachman; she had left the bonnet there, and a pair of gloves; she said she was agreeable to give all the things up to Collins, and he would write to her friend to make him satisfaction;

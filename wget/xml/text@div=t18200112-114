             re-examined. From the 15th of July to the 19th of December he was put down two pots of beer every day to Smith, and never paid me a farthing. He got intoxicated when he was going out with the beer, and I told him to take the lanthorn, and I would carry the beer, but he said he could carry it. When I came to Mrs. Smith's they put the money into my hand, upon which I was surprised, thinking she owed me above 3 l. The prisoner put the lanthorn down, and started off immediately. I secured him on the following Monday.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On Sunday morning, the 23d of April, I and an officer went to the prosecutor's house, and examined it about twelve o'clock - I found marks of footsteps in the garden - the back kitchen window had been lifted up, and the inside shutter bored with a centre bit, and the piece taken out; I found this piece of wood on the window cill - it fitted the hole in the shutter - the door leading from the back to the front kitchen had been forced, and there were marks of the crow bar on the side of the door; I went up stairs, and in the parlour found two cupboards forced open, and marks of a crow bar on both of them; the inner lock of a very handsome writing desk had been forced; on the Friday following, the 28th of April, I went with other officers to the Blue Boar tap, Aldgate; the prisoners Binfield and Savage were sitting there in a box together, smoking their pipes - (Wilson had been previously apprehended); Armstrong and Van immediately stepped up to Savage - both prisoners dropped their pipes, and Binfield, who sat on the right of the box, stood up and put his hand into his pocket; I immediately stepped into the box on the opposite side to him, and seized his right arm just below the elbow, as he drew his hand out of his pocket, and in about half a minute something dropped out of his hand; I afterwards found it was this pistol, loaded with powder and ball and primed (producing it); I have taken the priming and flint out; I proceeded to search him and took a screw driver from his pocket - he seemed very uneasy; I held him while Attfield searched him further - I saw him take from his pocket a powder-born, containing powder some bullets, a bullet mould, a phosphoros box and matches, with some other articles, a small knife, and a tooth-pick case; we secured them both; one of the officers pistols went off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long after you took hold of his arm did you find the pistol? A. After the search had been made, but I heard it drop; I looked under the table and found it, perhaps four minutes after - it had a stop lock - he had not time to cock it - he made no attempt to seize it when it dropped.</p>

            . I live in Thrall-street, Spitalfields, and am a watchman of Shoreditch. On Sunday morning, the 23d of April, about twenty minutes or a quarter to five o'clock, I was on duty in Hackney-road, it was broad day-light - I saw three persons coming out of Union-street into Hackney-road - it was the three prisoners - I noticed them; I particularly noticed Binfield, as having a shooting jacket on, made of the skin of some animal, and am surehe was one of them - the other two prisoners were with him - I am sure they are the three prisoners; just as they got rather past me, two of my brother watchmen turned out of Union-street, and beckoned me to stop them - I went back towards them, all three turned round with their faces towards me - I then noticed Savage having on a dark brown coat; I went up to Wilson, who had a parcel under his arm - he turned round and ran away - I threw my stick at him - he instantly dropped the parcel, containing this work-box - I picked it up directly; he ran towards Shoreditch, and the other two down Cooper's gardens, and all got away in different directions - I did not know them before; I saw Wilson at the office on the Thursday following; I am positive they are the three men; when I went back to them I had a full observation of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was in Hackney-road? A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110025"></xptr>Yes; I always said it was broad day-light when I met them, but said I could not tell when it got light; I do not know where the prosecutor's house is; I had them in my sight four minutes perhaps, it was not five minutes; I was close enough to Wilson to put my hand on him - I had to go close to the houses to let the three pass me; I first saw them ten or twelve yards off, but could not observe their dress so plain then as when they came close to me; I saw Wilson in custody on this charge on the Thursday following, going up to the bar - he had his hat on, and so he had on this morning; I saw the others in custody on the Saturday following - I swore positively to them then, and said what their dress was - they changed their dress every day they were examined - Wilson appeared to wear the same dress on the Thursday, but I could not swear that it was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How was Wilson dressed when you saw them come from Union-street? A.

            . I am a stick-maker. On Sunday, the 23d of April. about a quarter to five o'clock in the morning, I was at the end of Union-street, Hackney-road, going a sparrow-shooting, with a friend, and saw three men turning out of Union-street into Hackney-road - it was broad day-light - I did not know them before; I noticed them, and know the three prisoners are the men - I am quite sure of them; I pursued them after they ran away; I had observed two of their faces in following them - because Savage and Binfield turned round and faced me as I pursued - and Wilson had a yellow handkerchief with something in it, with a yellow bright foot coming through it - he wore a blue-coat, corded breeches, and white stockings; I have no doubt whatever of them; I ran after them because the watchman sprang his rattle; I was stopped by the inspector - ran round another way, and met Savage and Binfield; I saw Binfield give Savage a stock and bit, which he threw over the wall in Loggerhead-lane - I was quite close to them, but they got away; Binfield had a small bundle in a silk handkerchief - I do not know what became of that; I pursued them to Friar's-mount, when both Savage and Binfield turned round and faced me - they presented their pistols at me - I had a pistol in my pocket loaded with bird-shot, and presented it at them, and they presented their's at me; their pistols were short, with bright barrels like those produced; they made towards me, and I ran away, and saw no more of them; I did not face them above a minute - I did not see their faces before - I was agitated, but still am quite certain of them; I went back into Loggerhead-lane, informed the inspector, who got over the wall, and brought the stock and bit from where I pointed out, and gave them to Morton - Binfield were a shooting-jacket and light trousers to correspond - I did not notice his waistcoat; I saw Wilson in custody on Wednesday evening, it was just dark, and at that time I did not knew him; I saw him again on Thursday at the bar, and knew him; I saw Savage in a public-house next to the office, and knew him directly, and Binfield, when I saw him; I am sure they are the men who presented the pistols at me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you had any conversation with Parker, the watchman, about this? A. No; he pursued the men as well as me, and must know that I pursued them; we have not talked about whether I should know the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Your only opportunity of seeing two of them was when they presented a pistol? A. Yes; I did not run away directly, for I faced them, and pulled my pistol out to them - it might not be so long as a minute - I saw Wilson's face, because he turned round to me, but I did not see him drop the box - that was the only opportunity I had of seeing him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not sent into the lock-up-place, where there were several persons, to pick them out? A. I stood at the door, looked at the prisoners for a very short time, and said, "No, there is none of them there;" there were only four in custody - it was just before seven o'clock in the evening, and not quite light; I knew him next morning.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty in Hackney-road on this Sunday morning, the 23d of April, about a quarter or twenty minutes before five o'clock - it was light. I heard a whistling and tuning in Union-street - I went towards the street, and saw three or four persons coming towards Hackney-road, together, one after the other, walking. I saw Binfield among them - I have known him two or three years - he once lodged near my beat; I am sure he was one - he had a lightish coloured dress on. Wilson was one of the others; he was walking fast; I did not know him before - he had something red under his left arm, in the shape of a box; he walked very quick towards Shoreditch; I walked quickly after him, on the other side of the road, and when he came up to Parker he gave a spring off the pavement, and looked round, then began to run; I ran after him, and tried to hit him with a stick, but could not reach him - a stick came very quick past me, and he dropped the box - Parker picked it up; he wore a blue coat, light small-clothes, and white stockings. I cannot speak to Savage. I am sure Wilson is the man who dropped the box; he was nearly within reach of me at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was that all the opportunity you had of seeing his face? A. I could see his face when he was on the other side of the road; when he was before me he looked over his left shoulder towards me. I have not talked this over with Parker or Jackson particularly; I said I knew Joe - I do not know that I described him; if we had any conversation it was very trifling; we mentioned their dress before they were taken, but not after.</p>

            . I am watchman at the corner of Union-street, Kingsland-road. On Sunday, the 23d of April, about twenty minutes or a quarter to five o'clock (it was broad day light), I saw the three prisoners turn out of Kingsland-road into Union-street; I knew them all three before; I have known Binfield twelve or eighteen months; I knew the others by sight; I knew Savage by name for three months, and knew Wilson by his driving a sand cart - I had only known him a week or two; I am sure of them all three; they were in company together;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110026"></xptr>they passed me on the other side of the way. Wilson had a red handkerchief under his left arm, and wore a blue coat, white stockings, and light corded breeches. Binfield had a shooting jacket on, and a pair of trousers. I saw Binfield look into my box - he went on to the Union public-house, and danced on the shutter of the cellar; I then began to follow them, and called out twice, "Joe, stop;" they did not stop, but pushed away quicker, and turned into Hackney-road, and by Cooper's-gardens they divided; Wilson and Binfield ran down Cooper's-gardens - I saw no more of them. I got over a wall in Loggerhead-lane; a man came out of a house there undressed - I saw him pick up a stock and center-bit some distance from the wall, as if it had been thrown over - he gave it to me, and I gave it to Morton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you directed to look for the prisoners in the lock-up-room? A. I was not there. I never said I should not know Wilson; I had a good opportunity of seeing them; there was a bill up close to the office offering 40l. reward in this case - I have talked to several people about it before the prisoners were in custody. I never told Armstrong I could not speak to Wilson.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Cording, a pawnbroker, of Aldgate High-street. I have a coat, which Binfield pawned with me, for 6s., on the 28th of April, in the name of Tugall; I gave him one of the duplicates produced. I did not know him before, but am certain he is the man - he was about five minutes in the shop. I took particular notice of him; I picked him out at the office, from about thirty persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was it? A. Between five and eight o'clock. When I saw him among thirty persons I said I believed he was the man, to the best of my recollection, but I immediately recognized him, and was positive - it was nearer eight o'clock than five - it might be rather dusk - I think the gas was lighted.</p>

            . I am Bowen's daughter.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How lately before the 28th of April will you venture to swear you saw Binfield there? A. About a month.</p>

We drank a pint of beer at Mills's and Topping tore part of the directions off, the Bundle, and burnt the rest, and then we agreed to go to Topping's house in Rupert-street, and open it. We found in it 6 holland shirts, and I went with them to Mr. Grubb's in Market-Lane, where they pawned 2 of them for 15 s. Then they gave me two, which I pawned at Mr. Hodges's in Charles-street for 16 s. and gave them the money; and in 2 or 3 days afterwards I carried the other two to Hodges's, and had 15 s. for them, and gave them that money likewise. About a month after this I fell sick, and the 3 women quarrelled about the things, and when I got well, I challenged Hilliard with them, and she told me they were taken from the White-Bear.</p>

I shewed them into the bar-room where they had 2 pints of wine, and as soon as they were gone, I missed this bundle.

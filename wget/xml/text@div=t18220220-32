            . She first came to live with the prisoner as his wife, about four years ago. On the evening of the 9th of February, between six and seven o'clock, or rather later, she asked me to feel her eye; the prisoner was sitting by the fire, smoking his pipe. I felt her eye - it was very much bruised all down her face. She said, in his presence, that William had done it through her wanting to take some money to the landlord. She said,</p>

               <p>"I have got 5 s." I said,</p>
               <p>"You had better take it up." She said,</p>
               <p>"If I do not go up to-night I cannot go in the morning, for I owe him so much money." The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I will serve you ten times worse if you do not hold your noise." He then kicked her several times about the legs, and said he would serve me as bad as her. She went out with the 5 s., as I understood, to take it to the landlord, who lives in the neighbourhood. I sat in the room; I was in and out in the course of the evening, until two o'clock, when she returned from paying the landlord. The prisoner asked her for sixpence; she said she had not got it; and, using very bad expressions; he said, if his father and mother came out of their graves, he would kill her that night; he up with one hand, and had a pipe in the other, and he dashed her down, stood with the pipe in his hand, and with all his force, stamped on her belly several times. I said,</p>
               <p>"Do'nt, William, do'nt do that." He said, if I offered to pick her up, he would serve me worse than her. I being very ill, dare not get up, for fear he should knock me down. She lay there about a quarter of an hour, and was very stiff; she put out her hand and asked me to pull her up; she got up herself by a chair, and he came from the fire-place, kicked her several times on the legs and hurt his bad leg; and repeated, that if his mother and father came out of their graves he would kick her ten times worse. I asked her to go and have a glass of gin, as she was so ill - she was quite sober. We went to Mr. Peach's in Church-lane, and she called for a quartern of rum; it was not many steps off; three of us drank the rum between us; and when we got back he was sitting by the fire smoking his pipe - he took her by her two arms, dashed her against the bedstead, and said she had been spending his money. She said she would give him a pot of beer if he wanted it, and sent for one for him; after he drank it, she went to Peach's again and had half a pint of beer herself - I went with her - she could not drink it, and I did. I cannot tell what time this was, as there was no clock; I was there till one o'clock in the morning, staying in the room. When we came back from Peach's again, he took her and dashed her against a fender with all his force. I never saw him more severe in his life; and as she lay on the floor, he said, he did not care if his father and mother came from their graves he would kill her that night. She lay on the fender a good while; when she got up, she said something had had burst on her right side, putting her hand to the top of her neck. Morris came in then; I cannot say what time it was, but when I went out for the gin, I met the patrol, and wanted her to give charge of him; she said,</p>
               <p>"No, I won't, and I shall not be obliged to any one else who does."</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when any thing passed about her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200025"></xptr>pockets - A. When she lay on the floor, before she was thrown on the fender; he had taken her by her arms and dashed her on the coals, which lay in the corner of the room by the side of the bed; she lay on her back and fainted; she was quite stiff; I thought she was dead. He cut her pockets off, as she lay there, put them into his coat pocket, and sat down; and then she got up by the chair, as I said before. She said, he has got all my money, and sat down on the chair. I asked her if she would go to bed; she said, yes - and then I put her on the bed, without undressing her; - he took her by her arms and dashed her down on the floor; (this was the time he dashed her on the fender.) After he got her pockets he went out, and then came back again and sat by the fire smoking; she went and sat by him. Mr. Morris came in and fetched her some raw beef to put to her eye. I then went to bed; it was then, I think, between one and two o'clock. She never struck or offered to strike him, or did any thing to him. She called him one very bad name after he struck her. She was a thin woman, and had been very ill; she was tall but not strong.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the prisoner drunk - A. No; he appeared to have been drinking - I slept in the garret.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you so long in the room - A. My knee was so bad I could hardly move - I boarded with the prisoner, and only slept up stairs; I am an unfortunate woman - I had no quarrel with the prisoner; I saw him at breakfast, he appeared very severe then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Will you swear I knocked her down at all - A. Yes. A young man and woman lodge in the back room; four or five people lodge in the house, they were all out at the time.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When you went to bed, did you leave them sitting by the fire - A. Yes; and she had her eye tied up.</p>

            . I lodge in the one pair front room of this house. Lees, alias Duggan, lived with the prisoner as his wife, in the parlour; nobody else slept in that room - my room is over the prisoner's. On Saturday night, the 9th of February, I had been at home all day, and about seven o'clock, I heard a noise in the parlour where they lived - I went into Long-acre for somesugar; got back very near eight o'clock, and before I got to the door I heard violent screams from the woman - I went into the parlour, and found her and the prisoner there; she was lying down on the floor, on her back - the prisoner was with his left hand leaning on the table, kicking her on the belly; he did it several times with great violence - when I went in, she said,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Nicholls, shelter me from this villain, for he will kill me." I said, he should not ill use her, and got between them - he said, if I interfered, he would serve me the same way - I then desisted, got the woman from the ground, and got her into a chair; she cried out several times, in a low tone, as if she was hurt - she fainted away in the chair - he was sitting down by the fire, and did not help her; he did nothing.

             came in while she was fainting, which lasted five or six minutes - I gave her water, but she could not take it - when she recovered, I assisted her to a chair, and placed her by the fire; I saw the side of her left eye was very black, and swollen - I had seen him kick her there; he kicked her on the stomach, and on the head - I noticed the blackness, she said, in his presence, he had kicked her there, and that she felt very ill in her inside.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this - A. About eight o'clock when I went in, and I stopped there till about eleven o'clock; I got him quite peaceable, and then went to bed - he went to sleep by the fire, and she went to sleep in her chair, with her head against the wall. I remained awake; she groaned very much when asleep - I left Morris and Smith there. After I got into bed I heard a noise in the prisoner's room; I got up and went in again, and found Smith and Morris there. I believe it was between twelve and one o'clock; they were peaceable - Abbot was sitting by the fire, smoking; I went to bed in five or six minutes, and was not disturbed in the night. About eight o'clock in the morning I went out on an errand; on coming back, I went into Abbott's room, and saw him and Morris there; when I came to the door, I heard him turn from the bedside, and say,</p>
               <p>"D - n her eyes, she is dead" - I went to the bed side, and saw her lying on her right side, quite cold; she was dead; he turned away and sat by the fire, and said,</p>
               <p>"Well, she is dead, they can only have to bury her." I remained in the room till Bartlett came and took the prisoner away - he did not attempt to get away; I do not think that he knew Bartlett was sent for.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had you lived there - A. Only five days. My husband is sergeant of the 90th regiment, and is at Malta; I am from Manchester, where the regiment had been, and being a stranger in town, I went there to lodge, without knowing what place it was - I came here to get sent to Malta, but was bound over to appear here. The deceased was a tall, thin, spare, delicate woman; she gave no offence to him.</p>

            . I lived at this house, in February, in the back garret. I came home on this night, between twelve and one o'clock; all was quiet then. I went into the parlour to pay my rent. Abbott was asleep by the fire; Lees shewed me her black eye, and said, she had been used very ill. I got a piece of beef, and came back to her; the prisoner was still asleep - I put the beef to her eye; she went out of the room, and I stopped there - she returned in about ten minutes; Abbott was then awake - she sat on a chair, he got up, pulled her off the chair, threw her on the floor, and stamped his foot upon her several times, and kicked her about the body; she lay upon her left side; I do not know on which side he kicked her. I lifted her up, and put her to bed; she remained there a short time, and then he again threw her on the floor, kicked, and stamped his feet on her several times - he used a bad expression, and said, he wished he could kick her more without hurting his leg; I did all I could to hinder him, but he fell on her with such violence, I could not get between them time enough - I then lifted her upon the bed a second time. I never heard her speak again; it might then be between two and three o'clock or later - I had no watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she, while you were there, give him the least provocation, either by word or action - A. Not the least - when I put her on the bed a second time, something came from her, through his kicking her, as I thought, and he said,</p>
               <p>"the **** has **** the bed;" he then dragged her off again, and kicked her - I told him he would kill her;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200026"></xptr>he said, if he did, he would take her to Brooks's next morning, making use of a bad expression; Brooks is a surgeon, in Gray's-inn-lane, as I understood. The servant girl came into the room, helped me to get her clothes off, and got her into bed a third time - I never heard her speak afterwards; I sat by the fire all night, and about six o'clock in the morning, I heard a ratling noise in her throat - I heard her breathe afterwards; I took the ratling noise to be her sobbing and crying.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to remain in the room - A. He sat up all night; I remained there, because she asked me to stop there to prevent his beating her. I left the room about a quarter before eight o'clock; I then thought she was asleep. Nicholls was comingin as I was going out; I believing her to be asleep, told her not to disturb her - Nicholls had been in the room before that, went out for something, and then came back again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are you - A. A wheeler. I never had any quarrel with him; I had been there three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not call for assistance - A. I prevented him myself, then he was quiet for a short time, and then went at her again. I understood the watch had been called several times before, but she would never give him in charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not she begin first - A. She did not give him an angry word in my hearing.</p>

She came to my room about a quarter past twelve o'clock; she was dressed - she was very much bruised about the eye; she staid with me about ten minutes, and asked for some porter; she was perfectly sober; I was in bed - I had none. After going to sleep, I was disturbed again by a noise from Abbott's room, like somebody falling down - I heard a man's voice say</p>
               <p>"Bill, do'nt beat her so, for you will kill her;" I thought it was Morris's voice; this was succeeded by a noise and scuffling again. I did not hear the woman's voice at all.

I went to bed between four and five o'clock in the morning, that was the time I undressed her; Morris lifted her into bed, for the other could not, he had no strength.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you been doing from eight o'clock till the time you went to bed - A. Standing at the street door to let the beds, because he would not let me come into the parlour - after putting her to bed, I asked him if I might go and lay down myself, and told him Mary would not be able to get up in the morning, nor him either; he said he would make her get up, for he would drag her out of bed, she should not play her larks with him - I went to bed, and saw no more of him till to-day. I think he had been drinking, he knew what he was about, and spoke very correct. I do not know that the deceased had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you remember our going to the public-house together - A. No. They were in good humour at breakfast time.</p>

            . I am assistant surgeon to the infirmary, for the parish of St. Giles, and St. George. On Sunday morning the 10th of February, between eight and nine o'clock, I went to examine the body of the deceased; I found her laying strait in bed, undressed - she had her shift on, it appeared very wet; I examined the body, and found no external marks of violence, except a contusion extending over the upper and lower eye lid. I examined every part of her person - I saw her again on Tuesday, about one or two o'clock in the afternoon, and attended the opening of her body; the head was first examined, there was a large coagulation of blood, of three or four ounces; It had been formed in consequence of a rupture, of a blood vessel, in the base of the brain - the coagulation was between the dina mater, and the brain - this was sufficient to cause her death, and I believe it to be the immediate cause of her death, I have no doubt of it - the extravasation would arise from being kicked or beat about the body; the treatment described, would be sufficient to cause the rupture. Apoplexy would be produced by such causes - I should think the rupture happened within four or five hours of her death; she did not appear to be at all a person likely to have apoplexy, from natural causes. External appearances of bruises are occasioned by the extravasation of blood, which settles under the skin; it is visible earlier when they are made near the bone, than on any fleshy part - it sometimes appears much earlier, and sometimes much later, but after death, it never appears unless it is produced before.</p>
               <p>MR. OGLE. I am surgeon to the Infirmary, and was present at the opening of the deceased's body. I have heard Mr. Davis's account, it is very correct, full, and satisfactory - I agree with his statement in every particular. If discoloration does not appear before death, it does not after.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard acts of violence described, can you account for the absence of all symptoms of external violence - A. Yes; there might be the termination of blood<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200027"></xptr>from the head, as to be the existing cause, without any marks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. We went out, came home, and sat by the fire; I got smoking, and having three or four glasses, which got into my head; I found she was getting on too, and told her not to drink too much - I went out, returned, and said something to her; there was nobody in the room - she called me names, and hit me twice on the shoulder with something; I turned round, and hit her right in the eye with my flat hand, she said you have given me a nice eye, I said it serves you right, for you always begin with me first; she went out three times, and kept on having gin and rum, and was never further gone in liquor.</p>

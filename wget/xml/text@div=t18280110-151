            . I am a watchman, in the Lower-road, Islington. I apprehended the prisoner a little after six o'clock, on Tuesday morning, with a bag on his shoulder - I asked what he had got; he said some ducks and fowls, which he was going to Newgate-market to sell - I asked where he had brought them from; he said from Winchmore-hill, and he left there at three o'clock - I asked if he had been stopped by any person; he said No - I asked if he came along the road; he said No, across the fields; he said at the watch-house, that he believed there were six fowls in the bag - I asked if he dealt in poultry; he said Yes.</p>

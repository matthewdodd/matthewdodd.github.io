On the 1st of June, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came to my shop for some salt and cheese - Glare asked for it - Rosier stood leaning against the counter opposite to where the till was, and Glare stood before him; I was on the other side of the counter, nobody else was there. I turned my back to go to the salt bin - they had the things, and Glare paid for them - it was less than sixpence. A few minutes after they were gone I missed a 5 l. note from the till - nobody had been in after them, and I only had the notes a few minutes before they came in - a person might reach over and open the till, it was exactly opposite to where they stood. I had given change for the note not five minutes before. I had it from Mrs. Barnham's servant. Next morning, between seven and eight o'clock, I had both the prisoners taken up; I knew them both before, and saw the note in the possession of Squibb.</p>

            . The prosecutor applied to me on the 2d of June, between seven and eight o'clock, Rosier was then in custody at his house. I went and took Glare where he worked, and told him the note was lost<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280012"></xptr>while he and the other boy were in the shop, and I was confident he must know something about it. Soon after that he said it was in his box at his lodgings in Brady's-passage, Camden-town. I knew him before. I went and found the 5 l. note in his box, in a little pocket-book, as he said.</p>

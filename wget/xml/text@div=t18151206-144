I had last seen it on the landing-place, outside my room door, at about four o'clock in the afternoon; it was put there because my wife was going to clean my room; there were four coats, four waistcoats, four pair of breeches, five pair of pantaloons, two pair of white silk stockings, five handkerchiefs, some gloves, and gaiters.</p>

            . I am a stage-coachman. I have a bundle of things, which I bought at the sign of the Coach and Horses, St. Martin's-lane, on the 18th of November; I bought them of the prisoner Scullon. I was in the Coach and Horses when he was offering them for sale, at between nine and ten in the morning; I gave him six shillings for them; there were two waistcoats, and a pair of small clothes. I saw he offered a pair of leather breeches for sale; but nothing else. Smith, the other prisoner, was with him; they appeared to me to be acquainted with each other. Smith seemed to interfere as a friend to the other, in saying he was selling the things for too little.</p>

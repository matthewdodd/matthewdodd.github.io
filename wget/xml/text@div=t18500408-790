                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Keith and Co., of Wood-street, silk-manufacturers. On 29th April, 1849, the prisoner came there, and said he was sent by Messrs. Seddons, of Gray's-inn-road, for two pieces of tabaret—Messrs. Seddons are customers of Keith and Co.—I said it was not the quality they were in the habit of using, and he had better take a pattern, and see if it would do—he came back the following day, or the day after, said they were quite satisfied with the quality that Mr. Fife, the foreman, sent him down for it, and he would take it with him; they were in a very great hurry, and as soon as they had it, the order would be sent down by post—I gave him the tabaret in consequence of those representations—it was worth 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave him an invoice.</p>

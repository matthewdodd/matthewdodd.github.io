                  </hi>. I am a sugar baker, and live at Limehouse. On the night of the 17th of May, I saw Barrow in the Commercial-road—I went with her to where she lived in Dorset-place—she did not go to bed, but I fell on the bed, and went to sleep—I had been down to the Nore that day, and was tired—Barrow afterwards awoke me, and told me I must get up, as her husband was coming—I got up, and went out—I then put my hand into my pocket, and missed twenty sovereigns—I had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd in silver, loose, and twenty sovereigns in a purse—when I went into the house I had my hand in my pocket, and knew the money was there then—when I got out the twenty sovereigns were gone out of the purse, and about half the silver was put into it—I went back to the house with a policeman, who knocked several times—they would not open the door—he was obliged to break it open—the policeman asked the landlord for a light—he went up stairs, and left me to mind the door—I had treated Barrow—I had paid for what she bad with sixpence in silver.</p>

The prosecutor came to me about two o'clock in the morning, on the 18th of May, in the Commercial-road; I went with him to No. 3, Dorset-place—I saw a light, and heard a talking up stairs—I knocked at the door for I suppose ten minutes—I then heard the back-door open, and it appeared as if they were clambering over a wall—I heard several bricks fall into the water tub, which we found after<lb></lb>wards, and the light was put out—I got the door open, and told the pro<lb></lb>secutor to mind the door while I got a fresh light, and went up stairs—I found Barrow and another young woman there in bed—the prosecutor then came up, and said, in Barrow's presence, that he had been robbed of twenty sovereigns, and he pointed out Barrow as the one who had robbed him—I told her to get up, and dress—the other female who was in bed said, "If there has been any thing stolen, you may search my things before I put then on; I know nothing about it"—I searched the room, but found nothing—I went with Barrow to the station—I then went</p>

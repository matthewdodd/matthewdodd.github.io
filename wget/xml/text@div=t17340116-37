            . The Prisoner and I frequented Mrs.Church's Brandy-Shop, at Salt-Peter-Bank, in Rag-Fair, we were often there from Morning to Night. On the Sunday before New-Years Day, we went from thence about 10 at Night to break open the Prosecutor's House, which we had attempted once before, but were hinder'd by the Watch. When we came to the Place, I wrenched open the Lock of the Cellar-door with a Chissel; but it making a Noise, we look'd up and saw a Light in the Window, and being afraid the People were alarm'd, we went off a little, and stood upon the Watch; but the Candle being soon put out, we concluded they were gone to Bed, and had not heard us. So struck a Light in my Tinder-box, and the Prisoner went down with it, and lighted a Candle below, for he had a Candle and Matches in his Pocket. I waited above to look out; the Watch coming by past 11, I bid him lie close, and stepp'd aside; but they taking no notice, I return'd to my post. The Prisoner brought up one Firkin, which I set by, and then he fetch'd another, and each of us taking one, we carry'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173401160017"></xptr> them to Whitechapel-Mount, and cover'd them with Dung. We staid there till 4 a Clock, and then went to Church's Shop, for we knew she would be up by that time. When it was light, I propos'd we should fetch them; but the Prisoner being very sleepy would not go himself, but gave another Man (we call him French Peter) Six-pence to bring one of them. Peter and I went together and brought them to Church's. Where they stood all Day, for we could not find a Chap. Next Morning I met

The Firkins weigh'd about half a Hundred and eight Pounds a-piece, but one of them not proving so good as the other, the Women would give us but 16 s. for the Whole. We knew not where to mend our Market, and so we consented to take their Money: Anderson carry'd one away, and I carry'd the other, to a House hard by, to which I afterwards directed the Prosecutor; but it was gone before he came. She said she would come to Church's and pay us. I went to eat a ha'p'orth of boil'd Potatoes in the Fair, and going back to Church's I met Anderson, who told me she had paid the Money to the Prisoner. I went to him, and he gave me 8 s. for my half - No, it was but 7 s, 9 d. for we had two Pots of Cherry-beer, which he paid for out of the Whole.</p>

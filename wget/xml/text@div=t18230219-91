            . I am warehouseman to Mr. Alderman Thompson. Maxwell has a warehouse opposite my parlour window. On Sunday last, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner go into the warehouse,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190042"></xptr>and move some empty bottles, which stood at the door; he then took two bottles and went into the warehouse, and in about twenty minutes, he went out with one of them, a basket will hold six dozen - he brought out another soon after and fastened the door up as before. I threw up the window and heard two voices, and saw a man assisting him out of the gateway with them; I went round and was up to them in a moment, and said,</p>
               <p>"Where are you going with those; bottles" the other man said, he knew nothing about it, and that he only helped him out with them; I told the prisoner I must detain him, he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! No, look over this, it is nothing, I am in your hands." I took him to the watch-house, and then made the other man assist me, in taking the bottles back to the premises. He seemed rather fresh with liquor, and said he had been to an Irish raffle - he fell on his knees, and begged me to look over it, and said, he was going to make a few shillings of them, he would not tell me where he was going to take them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fruiterer, living at Sydenham—I have known the prisoner about two years—he was a neighbour of mine—he came to me three or four times about October last, and asked me to pur<lb></lb>chase a pony and cart and some old harness he had got—I ultimately bought them for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were three old carts, three old sets of harness, and a little Shetland pony—I paid him the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at three different times—these are the cheques—the first was on the 23rd October, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 28th October, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and 3rd November, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he represented that they were his own property, and I bought them on the faith of that representation—he did not tell me anything about the state of his cash accounts—he asked me to allow him to have the pony and carts back, if he could raise money, and pay me interest—the things were afterwards claimed by Messrs. Harrison, of Bayswater, under a bill of sale—they brought an action against me for having the pro<lb></lb>perty—I met the prisoner, after I was threatened with proceedings, in St. Paul's Churchyard—I said "You are the man I have been looking for for some time, it appears that the property you sold me belonged to some one else"—he said "Oh no, they did belong to me, you are quite right in keep<lb></lb>ing them—he said he had a bill of sale on them, but the party's agent allowed him to sell them to me.</p>

I live at 13, Chepstow Street, Bayswater, and am an auctioneer and estate agent—I produce a bill of sale dated and filed on the 31st July, 1869—it was given to myself and brother by the prisoner—he assigns his property, furniture, and effects, pony and carts, &amp;c., according to this inventory—there was a spring cart, a butcher's cart, a small cart, three sets of harness and a Shetland pony—I advanced the prisoner 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that bill of sale, and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was deducted for interest, making 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the articles were left in the care of the prisoner—he had no authority to dispose of them—I brought an action against the prosecutor in this case for the goods, and I recovered damages against him.</p>

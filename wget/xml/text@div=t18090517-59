               <p>Q. During the time that she was in your service do you recollect the loss of a key - A. Perfectly well, about this time twelvemonth.</p>

            . Q. You are the wife of the last witness - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing respecting the loss of a key - A. Perfectly well; the key of the closet in the front parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. That closet contains a bunch of keys on which was the key of your cellar - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that key being lost do you remember whether the prisoner was aware of the circumstance - A. She was asked if she had seen the key, and helped me to look for it; it was not found at that time, not till lately.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the key not being found what was done - A. The lock was taken off; the wards were a little altered, and another key was made.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time the prisoner lived in your service did you lose any silk stockings - A. Yes, one pair out of my bed room, and the half silk handkerchief I lost; I enquired for it among the servants; I did not miss the other things until they were brought from the prisoner's mother.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of something that passed in your family were all the servants in your family summoned before you - A. There were, a fortnight ago; all asked to deliver up their keys; they all did except the prisoner, she denied having her keys about her, she said she must go to the kitchen for them; I insisted that she should not leave the room, she should search her pockets for the keys and give them up; she did so, and gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170036"></xptr>up her keys. I insisted that she had more keys about her, that she had a particular key of mine; she denied having the key of my closet, and to convince me that she had not, she would take her pockets off, and in doing so, she took the key out and tucked it up her clothes somewhere; she then sat down. Mr. Lyndon went to search the boxes, and took her keys; I continued in the room; a loud knock happened to come at the door, she got up, and the key dropped from her clothes; I picked up the key, and found it was the key that I wanted; it was the key of the front parlour closet that I had lost. I gave the key to the officer, and the prisoner was taken to Hatton-Garden; and in consequence of what passed at Hatton-Garden, the house of Halesworth was searched, and the property was brought to my house the next morning. I saw it afterwards at the office, it is the subject matter of this indictment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long ago was the key lost - A. This time twelve month; the stockings in September, and the other things at various times; the fan and books I did not miss at all, nor never suspected that the prisoner had taken them. The prisoner said she found the key in the kitchen among some dirty rags.</p>
               <p>Q. And did not she add, that she did not know what key it was - A. She did so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Have you any reason to know that that key was made use of by the prisoner for opening of any thing - A. I am positive to her opening the closet with it, I heard her; the key was tried by the officer, and Mr. Lyndon; it opened it perfectly easy, better than the new key.</p>

            , No. 1, Brook's-market. In the premises I found these silk stockings, this one handkerchief, and one half silk handkerchief, two books, and a fan; she came down to the office, she was not taken in custody that day; on the next examination, she came voluntary to the office, and then she and the daughter were fully committed.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you searched Halesworth's premises, was any thing said by her of the property that was found - A. She said she had bought the property at different times; the stockings she bought of a jew a twelve month ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. At the time that you went to make the search, she readily gave up the keys - A. She did, and then she came to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. There was plenty of time for her to go away if she chose - A.She was allowed to go away from the Friday to the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>The prisoners left their defence to their counsel, and called four witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Was he off Mr. Lyney's premises at this time? - A. Yes; he was on my premises, I suppose, about 100, or 150 feet from Mr. Lyney's premises.</p>
               <p>-LYNEY sworn. - I am the son of the prosecutor, I was sent for into the accompting-house, rather before six o'clock in the evening of this day week; Mr. Hill had got the prisoner by the collar, I looked at his feet, and saw four pieces of iron; I then sent for an officer, and he was taken to the office at Shadwell, two pieces were left with a runner, and two with the watchman, marked; there is one piece that I know to be my father's property, it is a piece that we had from the country, from Mr. Jessey, it is the same sort of iron that we had in our warehouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have more iron of the same manufacture in your warehouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you cannot tell, I suppose, whether you had missed any or not? - A. No. (The officer produced the property)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going to pick up a bit of chip, as we are allowed to do, and I ran against this iron upon Mr. Hill's premises, and I was going to take it back again, when Mr. Hill stopped me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called David Quinn, who had known him near four years, and gave him a good character.</p>

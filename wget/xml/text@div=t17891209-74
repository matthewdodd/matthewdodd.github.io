             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am clerk to Messrs. Barnett, Hoare, and Hill. On the 9th of November the prisoner presented one of the drafts in the indictment to me for payment, as near as I can recollect about two o'clock; I asked him what he would have for it; he said, money, or if I pleased a bank note: I shewed it to Mr. Barnett, and he detained the man, and sent for a constable: I have had the draft from that time to this, except a few hours; it was taken with the prisoner to Bow-street, as I understand; I put no mark on it then; it went out of my hands the same day it was presented to me; I cannot say who had the care of it, but one of our clerks went with it in a coach; I gave the note to Mr. Barnett; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Are you sure this note which you have in your pocket was the note which you parted with, and which you received from the prisoner? - I can, by some marks on the back; there were several sums on the back of it, by which I am sure of the identity of the draft, that induced me to stop the prisoner; because I was informed of those marks, and if they were on it I was not to pay it.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what those sums were? - Fourteen pounds eight shillings was one sum, and two or three ten pounds, in black ink, it was dated the 9th of November, 1789, drawn by W. Austin, the sum was ten pounds; it was on our house.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the figure? - No. 84, or 84; I do not recollect whether there was No. or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp submitted to the Court, whether the draft should be now produced, as it had been in other hands, the law requiring the best evidence.</p>
               <p>The Court was of opinion it was a fact to be left to the jury.</p>
               <p>(The note handed to the Court.)</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot read this note, it is not the note he has described; here are no sums of ten pounds, but one sum of thirty pounds on the back? - I said two or three ten pounds; they are comprized in one sum, thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. I never can take it in that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090075"></xptr>Jury. Is there fourteen pounds eight shillings upon it, my lord.</p>
               <p>Court. The sum, gentlemen, here is fourteen pounds three shillings.</p>
               <p>The Court then informed the jury that this note, which was offered to be produced, not corresponding with the note described by the witness; and the notes not being traced from hand to hand, there was therefore no evidence against the prisoner.</p>

The prisoner came to lodge at my house about five months ago - he lodged there twice, and altogether about four months; he slept in the top front room, which is up two pairs of stairs; I slept in the back room on the first floor.

On Thursday last I examined the prosecutor's house - I went into the privy, and found this chisel; the marks on the box correspond with it - the box was locked, as it has a spring lock, which fastens on being shut down; I found four common keys in the privy, one of which unlocks the servant's room, and one a bureau in the bar - I opened the box with the chisel; I found a piece of iron between the sacking and the prisoner's bed - I produce the handkerchief and money.</p>

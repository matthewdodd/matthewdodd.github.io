            ; it is in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square - we both slept in one bed. On the 30th of March I came home about twelve o'clock in the day, and found the lock of my box, which was in the bed-room, had been taken off and nailed on again - I had left it locked. I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which were worth 66 s. - I saw them all in the box that morning about eight o'clock, when I went on duty. I left the prisoner asleep in the tap-room when I went out. I took the key with me. I went to the barracks, and reported to the pay-sergeant that I had been robbed, and that the prisoner was absent. I have since seen a pair of shoes, which were taken from another box in the room which was not locked. I had seen them that morning.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Saturday night, the 1st of April, about half-past eleven o'clock, the prisoner came to me, and asked where the watch-house was? he said he wanted to give himself up as a prisoner, as he had robbed his comrades of a watch and other articles. I asked him if he had not better give himself up to his regiment? he said they would punish him, and afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120004"></xptr>turn him over to the civil power. I took him to the watch-house.</p>

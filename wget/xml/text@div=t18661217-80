I am in the employ of the Mint—on 24th No<lb></lb>vember, about three o'clock p.m., I went to 23, Dunk Street, Mile End New Town, with Sergeant Elliott and Doughty—we were admitted to the front parlour by the landlady, and shortly afterwards saw Dean come down stairs and go out—I followed him with Doughty to the middle of the street, and said, "Well, <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>, you are suspected of being in that house for the purpose of coining; what have you got about you?"—he said, "Nothing; what house?"—I said, "You must come back"—we took him into the house and forced him into the front parlour—I then asked Cowell what she had about her—she held her left hand out, which contained a little leather purse—from the action of her arm under her shawl I seized her right hand, and found this packet, containing seven counterfeit crowns, hot, in an unfinished state—I said, "Oh! this is what you mean, is it?"—she said, "What?"—I said, "This is counterfeit coin, you must account for the possession of it"—she said, "I found it"—I said, "Very well"—I left Doughty and Elliott in charge of the prisoners, went up to the second floor front room, and on the top of a cupboard found this earthenware pipkin, hot, and three warm pads, which are used for holding the moulds—there was a clear bright fire in the room—Inspector Broad said, "Look here," and showed me this plaister of Paris mould, which was hot, and these three counterfeit crowns, also hot, wrapped up in this black rag—there was nothing in the mould—the crowns are un<lb></lb>finished and of the same date as those we had down stairs—going to the station Carter said, "Oh! Mr. Brannan, it is that villain <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>; you know he has put many a score away"—I said, "What you say it is my duty to repeat to the Magistrate"—she said, "I will tell the Magistrate all about it myself; you know he is a great villain; they sent me out for a long errand, and while I was gone they made these things, and when I came back they were made"—Cowell might have heard that, but to the best of my belief Dean could not, as she did not speak very loud—after they were locked up I went with Inspector Broad and other officers to 19, Gun</p>

               <p>Q. Did not they take his watch from him. - A. No, I did not see that.</p>

            . On the 9th of June I received information of a burglary committed upon Saffron-hill; myself and Chapman went down Saffron-hill, knowing disorderly persons that lived in White's-yard, Saffron-hill. We then watched there; one of the persons was pointed out as supposed to be one of the persons that committed that burglary. I watched; after that I saw Barker come out in company with a young woman, whom he keeps; I took him in custody on suspicion of that burglary. The consequence was two or three days afterwards the prosecutor made application to the office to know if there was not a person of the name of Barker in custody. I told him there was.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Barker before - A. Yes, perfectly well; in consequence of that, with the magistrate's approbation, I took the prosecutor down; immediately he saw Barker, he said he was one of the men. The prosecutor told me there was a girl that knew more of the robbery than he did; I took a summons, left it with her father, she appeared, she swore to Barker, and told me of the other, Engan.</p>
               <p>Barker Mr. Trott is giving that girl presents every day, because she is to have eighty pound to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Court. (to Ridley) Have you had any money. - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Barker. You told Margeret Engan so. - A. I did not, I have not had one halfpenny given me. I am in danger of my life for speaking the truth.</p>

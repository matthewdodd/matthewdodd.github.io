            . I am shopman to Mr. Job Townsend and others. On the 10th of February the prisoner came in with another young man, and asked to look at some gloves and handkerchiefs; I left the box of handkerchiefs before them, and went to get the gloves: the prisoner put one piece of handkerchiefs into his pocket - he bought one handkerchief and one pair of gloves; he paid me 5s., and I gave him 3d. change; I then desired him to walk into the back warehouse, and take the piece of handkerchiefs out of his pocket: he denied having it, and I took them out myself; he begged we would let him go and speak to Mr. Townsend - his companion exclaimed that it was a d-d bad job, and went off directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. In what position were you when you saw him take them? A. Only getting the gloves - my face was towards him; he did not say he had taken them by mistake.</p>

            . I am Mr. Townsend's warehouseman. The prisoner denied having the handkerchiefs, but they were taken from him there; he requested we would not send for an officer, but said he would pay for the handkerchiefs - when the officer came, he took the candle, and found behind where the prisoner was sitting three handkerchiefs and a piece of ribbon, containing thirty-six yards; the prisoner said nothing about that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was in the warehouse? A. Yes; such articles are not kept there.</p>

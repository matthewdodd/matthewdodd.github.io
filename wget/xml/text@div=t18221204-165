            . On the 23d of October, I was on duty in Holborn. I saw the prisoner coming towards Drury-lane, with something under his jacket. I watched him into a house in Charles-street - I waited outside - he came out with this lead on his shoulder - I followed him to White-Lion-street, Seven Dials, into a plumber's, he came out without the lead. I took him and asked what had become of the lead, he said he had none. I took him back and found two pieces of lead which were what he brought in, he denied it but afterwards said he did bring it in, and that it was Mr. Brooks's. Brooks said it was his, and then said he knew nothing of it, and referred me to his man.</p>

               <p>Was there any thing of your's found upon him at any time? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you swear that is the man? - I swear by the clothes, he run before me, and another man followed him; all I know is, that the man was brought back in the same clothes; I lost two watches.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. I think we have gone so far that nothing was found on the prisoner? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>When you went out the first time you suspected it was a boy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who is that boy? - I do not know, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080180"></xptr> is not the boy that is now to give evidence, I went into the shop, I did not think of any harm.</p>
               <p>You jumped up in a hurry for fear they should get all the watches? - There was a great bounce made by the four shutters, then in the instant two panes of glass was broke, the prisoner immediately run away, and run much better than me.</p>
               <p>How far had he to run, till he came to the corner of Denmark-street? - I believe I could run it in a minute.</p>
               <p>Four out of five of your shutters were close? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were the other shops in the street open or shut? - There is a watchmaker's shop shut up at seven.</p>
               <p>Did the other shop shut up before you or not? - They may do as they like.</p>
               <p>But did they? - My neighbour never shuts up her shop till nine, as to the other shops, I do not know whether they were shut or not.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the man's coat? - I observed it was a little drabish.</p>
               <p>How many of your neighbours might have the goodness to join in the pursuit? - Nobody run but one, but a little higher up there was a few.</p>
               <p>Is the boy to whom you had spoke, one of them? - He might.</p>
               <p>Was you at your tea? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>The person that run from your door, had a round hat on, flapped? - It was not flapped, I suppose it was a little flappish, I am not a maker of hats, I call it a round hat.</p>
               <p>Now a man with a round hat of whom you had about the third part of a minute, running from you with his back to you, you undertake to swear to? - He was not above thirty yards off.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - It was not moon light.</p>
               <p>Was it rainy or fair? - It was a little sprinkle of rain.</p>
               <p>A little sprinklish? - It was not very dark or light.</p>
               <p>It was a little darkish, so upon a darkish night about one third part of a minute a man running from you, with his back towards you, with a hat flapped on, you seeing him for only twenty seconds, undertake to swear to him? - He had two white buttons on his side.</p>
               <p>That is right, now you can swear to them, two white buttons upon his hip; to be sure a man with two whitish buttons upon his hip, is the most remarkable creature in the creation; I will not keep you any longer Mr. Levy, good night to you? - Good night to you.</p>

               <p>On the 15th of November, between six and seven, I had just left work, and passing by the end of Denmark-street, I heard the cry of stop thief! I took no notice of it, at last I saw the prisoner at the bar come up between the posts, there is a bar at the end of the street, he came into the new road from Denmark-street.</p>
               <p>Was he walking or running? - He came running up to me when I stopped him.</p>
               <p>When you first saw him, was he walking or running? - He might be standing still when I first saw him, it was dark, and I could not see him.</p>
               <p>When you first saw him what was he doing? - He was coming through the posts, I was about twenty yards from the posts, he came running up to me, and I stopped him, I took hold of him, he asked me why I stopped him, I told him I did not know, I supposed he was the thief; soon after Mr. Trevallion who keeps cows came up, and desired me to keep fast hold of him; then Mr. Levy came up and said, that was the man; we took him to Denmark-street, to the sign of the Kettle-drum, an officer was sent for, but no property was found upon him.</p>

               <p>Was it a rainy night? - No, it did not rain at all.</p>
               <p>Now do you mean to swear that? - It rained afterwards, that same evening.</p>
               <p>Nay man, never blink it, did it rain or not? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself a little? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>May be it was a light night? - It was dark, but not so dark but I could distinguish the man coming through the posts, he had a drab coloured coat and metal buttons.</p>
               <p>After you took hold of him, you took care he threw nothing away? - The constable took him away, there were no watches found upon him.</p>

               <p>I am a cow-keeper, I live in Denmark-street.</p>
               <p>How near is that to Levy's house? - About fifty yards, I cannot say how long the street is, it is a longish street, I heard the cry of stop thief, I saw a young fellow in a light coloured great coat, with metal buttons, and a blue coat under it, run along, there was a lamp, I saw him very plain, I run after him and fell down on one knee; I made a stumble at the top of the street, a young man stopped him, and we took him to the public-house and searched him, he had a bit of myrtle in his mouth.</p>
               <p>Had you sight enough of him to know that the man that was stopped was the same man? - Certainly, he never was out of my sight, he had not got by the door when I saw him; when I turned out of my door he stepped over my cellar window; there was a knife in his pocket; Mr. Levy came up crying stop thief, and partly out of breath.</p>
               <p>Did you see any boys running? - Yes, towards the top of the street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The boys were a head of the person that came past your door? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of these boys that were running? - I saw no boys till the cry of stop thief, there are many alarms in that street, the prisoner was taken at the upper end of the street in a back lane, the boys ran after me, and some overtook me; I keep a chandler's shop at home, and carts and cows.</p>
               <p>Stand up that the Jury may see you, you keep carts; what the handy jockey carts, do you keep any of those convenient things for the benefit of the country poultry? - No, Sir, I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you deal in any other animals, do you deal in horses? - I never buy any but what I buy for my business, I buy them with a good face.</p>
               <p>Was you in your front room that you was drinking tea? - My rooms are all in front, I have but three rooms.</p>

               <p>Was it a moon light night? - It was not.</p>
               <p>It was a dry night, that you recollect? - I will not be positively sure of that, to the best of my knowledge it was a dry night.</p>
               <p>Did not it sprinkle a little? - I did not know, if it did I forgot it.</p>
               <p>Did you dirt yourself much in falling down? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you trace back the way that the person had run from Mr. Levy's house? - No, Sir, they brought the prisoner back, I saw him make a halt back; I sent Mr. Levy back, it was not my business, there was nothing found on the prisoner.</p>

               <p>How do you know it was the prisoner? - Because I am sure of it, I went close by him, he had a bit of myrtle in his mouth, and a light great coat on.</p>

               <p>How came you to take notice of such a circumstance? - I did take notice, he was walking backwards and forwards, and I looked at him.</p>
               <p>What sort of a bit of myrtle was it? - A little sprig.</p>
               <p>Was this a very light night that you saw a little bit of myrtle? - He was near the windows, and by the lights you might see his face very plain.</p>
               <p>What led your attention to him so much to observe he had a bit of myrtle in his mouth? - Because he looked at me, I went in doors and saw no more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What time of night was this? - Between six and seven, all the shutters were up excepting one, and there was a little space between every one, I did not see any body thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Do you know the lady that lives at next door? - Yes, the prisoner was looking at her shop as well as Mr. Levy's.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body with him? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>It was a moon light night? - I cannot say directly, the lamps were alight.</p>
               <p>It was a dry night? - No, Sir, it was a wet night, it rained small rain a good pace, that made me look the more, because the person stood still in the rain.</p>
               <p>You frequently have been alarmed in that neighbourhood with thieves? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called four witnesses, who all gave him a good character.)</p>
               <p>Court to Read. Was you present when the prisoner was searched? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see what was found upon him? - I saw nothing found in his pocket, he had a pair of gloves on his hands, I am positive of that, I took particular notice of it.</p>

My wife found a curtain hid in the prisoner's bed; upon her being charged with it, I heard her say she had pawned several other things.

               <p>What did she say before that? - That she had pawned several other things; and mentioned the other curtain, and the child's shirt; I do not recollect any thing else she mentioned. I went to the pawnbroker's immediately, and found several things.</p>

               <p>I have a curtain here, and a shift; I have several other things at home, that Mr. Bailey could not swear to. The prisoner brought these things to me about the 27th of April last; I have known her backwards and forwards at my shop six or seven years. She told me where she lived, and said she brought them for her mistress: she had pawned things and fetched them out several times.</p>

               <p>I thought to bring them home again as soon as my quarter was up; the Saturday following, I thought to bring them in again.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. Is that so? - I can't tell exactly; she had some money of her quarter; she told me she meant to take them out.</p>

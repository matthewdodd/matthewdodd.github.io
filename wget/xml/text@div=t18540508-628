                  </hi>. I am in the employ of William Mannell, in Cable-street, within the Liberty of the Tower. On 15th April the prisoner came to my master's shop—she bought a pig's head—Mrs. Mannell served her—I saw her take a piece of bacon, put it in her apron, and walk out into the road—she had paid 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the pig's head—it was being chopped, and she took the bacon, put it in her apron, and walked out into the road—I went out to her, and asked her for it; she said she had paid for it—she said she had had three pence out of half a crown—I had seen her all the time she was there—she put down 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was for the pig's head—the price of this piece of bacon was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I bought the bacon of Mrs. Mannell, and then went out, and left the bacon on the counter; the pig's head was not chopped, and I took the pig's head under my apron, and as I got to the door he stopped me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The bacon had not long been cut, and lay on the board—I saw it cut, and the other part sold.</p>

                  </hi>. I remember the prisoner coming to my shop—I weighed the pig's head, and took the money for it—I had not sold the bacon to her—she had not said a word of dealing with me about it—I had seen the prisoner in and out two or three times, but she only purchased the pig's head—I am quite sure she did not buy the bacon at any of the times she came in—it was not cut when she came in and out—it was only being cut when she was looking about for the pig's head—it had not been weighed—she asked the price of it.</p>

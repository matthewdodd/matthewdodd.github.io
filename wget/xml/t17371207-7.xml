               <p>William Haines On the 12th of Oct. about 9 in the Evening, I was coming with some Friends from Mr. Dobney's, and in the Field between the Pond and the <placeName id="t17371207-7-crimeloc44">New River Head</placeName>

I was going to make up to my Company and a Man stopp'd me, and demanded my Money, Watch and Rings, and gave me a Knock on the Head, I told him I had no Watch but he searched me all down to my Shoes, and said here's a good pair of Buckles, and took them away; then he jump'd away, and a Pistol went off, and one of them cry'd, D - n you take that among you. After I was robb'd I ran back to Dobney's and got his Man to come over the Fields with me with two Dogs. We call'd in at Sadler's-Wells, and there I found my Friends and the Prisoner.</p>

            . I was coming from Dobney's with 4 Friends, and I happen'd to be foremost; when I came to the Stile, I saw the Prisoner and two more, one of each Side of him. The Prisoner jump'd off the Stile, and said D - n your Bl - ds deliver this Minute. I was surpriz'd, and while I was putting my Hand in my Pocket, I heard a Pistol go off at one of my Friends behind me: Then I heard another Friend say, - fight away Boys, they have nothing but Powder, the Prisoner immediately clapp'd a Pistol to my Face, I struck it by with my Hand, and off it went.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173712070007"></xptr> Then I grasp'd him about the Middle, and he broke my Head, I suppose with his Pistol, I held him 'till one of my Friends came up and knocked him down. He never was from us, nor out of my Sight, but the other two ran away. Haines was the last Man in the Company; what happen'd to him I can't tell, but we carried the Prisoner to Sadler's-Wells; and when he came in to us there, his Buckles were out of his Shoes. The Prisoner confessed the next Day, that he had sent to the Men that were concern'd with him in this Business, to tell them that they had no need to abscond in order to get them taken up, and with an Intent to impeach them.</p>

I told them I would not be concern'd, but they dragged me along, and when we came to this Field, they attack'd these People. I was making the best of my Way off, and Mr. Stevens follow'd me and knock'd me down. <rs id="t17371207-7-verdict45" type="verdictDescription">

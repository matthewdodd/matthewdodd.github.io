I returned to town on the 12th, in the evening; I found many letters in one of the desks, which should not have been; on the next morning he did not come to the office; about twelve o'clock I received information from a person that he had received ten pounds; in consequence of which I searched his desk; I there found a second letter; this is one of the letters I found:</p>

               <p>"Dear Tucker - Enclosed you have ten pounds. Your's, respectfully,</p>
               <p>W. Wood."</p>
               <p>I gave him no authority to open any letters but country letters; I do not find fault with him, he was my clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. My clerk has no authority to open my letters? - A. Country letters I gave him authority to open. Having found this letter, I sent the porter of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300076"></xptr>lodge for him; I did not see him till about seven or eight o'clock at night he came so drunk I told him to go about his business, and to come when he was sober. A day or two afterwards I met the postman, he told me that he had lent him 6 l. 10 s. he offered it me, and I took it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have said this man had authority to open letters, which no doubt he had? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner tell you, and you found it a fact that he had lent the postman 6 l. 10 s. of of this money, which money the postman afterwards paid to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There were some other expences that he paid? - 
               <persName id="t18051030-67-person796">A. </persName>
            Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You and he kept a book? - A. Yes, my memory was so short.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he charge you with the 10 l. in the book? - A. No, here is no entry of it, subsequent to receiving this 10 l. note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you and he settle, and did not there remain a balance of 3 l. to him? - A. He owes me 8 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he receive it from you or from others? - A. I cannot tell, only by the books. It is money that he has received from other persons, every halfpenny is on the creditors side.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have had no settlement of this to the subsequent time? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18051030-67-person797">Q. </persName>
            After you returned from the country, did you indict him for a felony? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you remain in town before you went into the country? - A. About a week.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that week had you seen the prisoner? - A. I think he has called three times, twice out of which I have seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he then tell you he had expended the 10 l.? - A. I mentioned it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you that the postman was to pay you? - A. Yes, and I took it of the postman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the man tell you he was in distress for money, and the postman came to be paid, did you pay him monthly or in two months? - A. Whenever it was two or three pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes you have lent the postman money? - A. I do not recollect having ever lent him money, I would have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the man tell you that with the rest of the money he was obliged to keep himself while you were out of town? - A. No; this book I found in his desk, and that letter with another letter.</p>
               <p>Q. It was about a month after this before you thought of indicting him? - A. I indicted him immediately I came up to town.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him if he would pay you the balance, you would not indict him? - A. No, I never said any thing, he wrote a letter to that effect, I never wrote a syllable to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you charged him with the 10 l. what did he say to it? - A. I mentioned it to him, and a 1 l. note he had taken out of another letter, he admitted that he had it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. At the time Mr. Tucker came to town, it was very late in the evening. On the Saturday morning I went to the Office, he said, Mr. Settle have you received a 10 l. note, I told him that I had given the postman 6 l. 10 s. and the rest I had made use of on my account. Upon that, he pulled out the account book and settled it, and made me debtor for seven or eight pounds, upon that, he said, how do you mean to pay me. I told him it was not in my power to pay him then, he said to me, the sooner you can pay it the better, and as for your character, you must do as you like, I did not hear of it for five or six days; I wrote a letter and told him it was out of my power to do it, but if he would give me writing to do I would write it out. He came to my lodgings, I told him then it was entirely out of my power, that I had no money, I would write it out; he said, I have made up my mind, and walked out.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

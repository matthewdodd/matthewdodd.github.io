I live in Burlington-arcade, in the parish of St. James, Westminster—it is my dwelling-house—my house adjoins the shop—it is all one house—about the 22nd of December, the prisoner came to my shop and asked to look at some brooches—I have no doubt it was the prisoner—I remember her face quite well—it was in the afternoon—I do not remember the exact hour—I showed her a great variety of brooches, and afterwards some buckles—after she had examined the brooches she said there was none that would suit her—she required two alike—I had none according to the description she wished, and promised to get her some—she desired me to do so, and to send them, giving me the address of Mrs. Brownbrig, or Brownbrig, No. 1, Clarence-terrace, Regent's-park—I sent the brooches there that evening—there was no such person there—they were</p>

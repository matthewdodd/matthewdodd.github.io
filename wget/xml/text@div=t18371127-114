                  </hi>. I have chambers at No. 27, Lincoln's Inn-fields. on Monday, the 20th of November, I gave this cheque for £65 to Mr. Wilkinson—it is on Messrs. Snow and Co.—at half-past five o'clock the evening, I received a sealed packet from the prisoner—it contained 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bank-notes, four £10 notes and four £5 notes—there was £5 short—the prisoner is a servant to me and others at these chambers—afterwards opened it without breaking the seal—it is now as I had it—I called the prisoner, and said there was £5 short, and I wanted to know be knew any thing about it—he said it was a serious thing, but he should speak to his grandmother or mother—I had not charged the prisoner with stealing it at that time—the wax is in the same state as I received it.</p>

I am clerk to Samuel Stratton, Esq., of No. 27, Lincoln's Inn-fields—he is out of England at present I remember receiving this draft, on the 20th of November, for £65, on Messrs. Snow—I went and got it cashed that day—I received four £10 notes, and five £5 notes—I took the money to the chambers, and locked it up in my desk—in the afternoon, about five o'clock I enclosed it in an envelope, and directed it to Mr. Streatfield, and sealed it with a small head seal—this is not the seal I put on, I can decidedly swear it—I delivered to the prisoner four £10 and five £5 notes—I am positive there were five £5 notes—on the Thursday after I saw Mr. Streatfield, I saw the prisoner, and said, "Here is a pretty <hi rend="italic">go</hi>"—he said, "I know nothing about the note; I have not taken it"—I had not said a word about the loss of a note—this was about half-past ten o'clock—I cannot recollect the time exactly.</p>

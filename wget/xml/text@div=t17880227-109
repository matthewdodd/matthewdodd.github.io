               <p>What o'clock was this? - Between the hours of eleven and twelve at night; we met with a party of smugglers.</p>
               <p>Court. Where were you going? - To intercept them at the Indian Queen, where they were to cross the road; but we met them at the eight-mile-stone, as near as I can recollect; we met a gang of them; there might be eight, ten, twelve, or fifteen, I cannot tell; Gliddon was rather before us, and they beat him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. How forward was Gliddon before you? - From ten to twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Did you see them attack Gliddon? - Yes, and they came up to me; I asked them what they carried, and they said, who are you? or clear the road, or something to that purpose.</p>

            . What did they carry? - Ankers of liquor upon the horses; when we attacked them, and insisted upon knowing what they carried, some of them said, off! off! and immediately quitted their horses; two or three of them passed me on horseback, with each of them two ankers under them, particularly the prisoner at the bar; they would not get off their horses; they stood in a party off the road; they had engaged some of my officers before; I came up to the prisoner, and a little scuffle ensued between he and I; I insisted upon his stopping his horse, but he would not; I rode side by side with him, close to him, for twenty yards, or more.</p>
               <p>Had you during that time, an opportunity of observing his person? - Yes, I have not the least doubt of his person.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough to speak with certainty? - Quite sufficient.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt? - None at all; I had an opportunity, about nine days or a fortnight afterwards, to call at his house; I had cut him with my cutlass in the arm, and when I saw him at his house, his arm was in a sling, and he looked very sour at me; I had before seen the prisoner, and knew his person, but the reason of my going to the house was, because I did not know his name; I went to see if the man that I knew by sight, was the prisoner by name; we had drove three horses that they had quitted with ankers of liquors upon them, before us; Mr. Gliddon came up, and the smugglers followed us, beating us with large bludgeons, till my arms and back were quite black, and so were the officers that were with me; they called out after us a cant word,</p>
               <p>"Ooro;" swearing, that they would lose their lives, before they would lose their goods; we went on till the road was firm; for where we attacked them first, there were tin works, and it was dangerous to turn a horse out of the road; when I came to that part of the road which I knew, I turned my horse upon the common; I told them, now my lads, I will shew you some sport; they turned back, and said, let them go and be d - n'd to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270119"></xptr>What liquor was upon the horses? - Brandy, rum, and gin.</p>
               <p>How do you know? - I got it home and tasted it; I got three horses and six ankers.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive any blow from any particular person? - Yes; I had a blow from the prisoner with a stick upon my arm, but not so hard as from the others.</p>
               <p>Was your horse wounded? - Yes; something run through his cheek, an edge-tool; there was another horse that was shot, and had the mark of a bayonet, or some instrument, I cannot tell what, run into his buttock, as they tell me; I do not swear to that.</p>
               <p>Nor you did not see the horse shot? - I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>(Cross-examined by Mr. Lens.)</p>
               <p>What time of night was it? - Eleven or twelve, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>What sort of night was it? - Tolerable; neither very light, nor very dark; but it was light enough for me to see a man and horse at the distance of three or four hundred yards; I saw a man and horse at that distance, which I believed to be a smuggler, out upon the spy.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to suppose that horse was at so great a distance? - He stopped, and we rode up to him, I believe about two or three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes; I had surveyed several places where I had seen him.</p>
               <p>Then what was the occasion of your going to his house when he looked so sourly at you? - I went to convince myself that it was the same man I saw upon the ankers.</p>
               <p>Be kind enough to to tell us what you mean by looking sourly? - I went in, and said, how do you do, and he said, what is that to you.</p>
               <p>You say they followed you, beating you with bludgeons five or six feet long? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know what you say? - Yes; they could not have reached me very well, without being that length; you may give them what term you please, but they had sticks of that length.</p>
               <p>How long was it after this transaction that you charged the prisoner with being concerned in this business? - It might be nine days or a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him how he came wounded? - I told him I was very sorry to find he had been engaged in the practice of smuggling, on account of his family.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Are you perfectly sure that the prisoner is the man; be quite sure? - I am perfectly sure; I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Had they any permit with their liquors? - No; none at all.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of excise; I was with Mr. Llewellyn, on the 22d of April last, between nine and ten o'clock, I called Mr. Shallcross, and a corporal and serjeant of marines.</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Shallcross an officer of excise? - Yes, we all went about seven or eight miles; about eleven o'clock we were OR Gauce Moor.</p>
               <p>Was it light or dark? - It could not be very light, because it was a new moon, but it was so light that I could see the colour of a man's clothes; I saw a man at the distance of ten yards with a white jacket on.</p>
               <p>What happened? - I rode foremost; I passed one or two horses loaded with ankers; then I called out to them, and said, halloo, gentlemen, what do you carry here? immediately a man cried out, all off! all off! then I saw two of them talking together; one of them said to the other, lend me your stick, if I don't do for him, I'll be d - n'd; I attempted a blow at them with a stick I had in my hand, but the stick flew out of my hand; I received blows from them, before I struck either of them, and I do not know that I struck either of them at last; I had received a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270120"></xptr>great many blows; my horse was killed under me, he was shot in the rump, and likewise stabbed near the same place; we drove on three loaded horses before us, and they kept following us and beating us; they said, they would sooner lose their lives than their goods; I believe we rode on a mile, and they followed us, beating us, and huzzaing; by-and-by we began to huzza as well as them; they then said, d - n them, let them go, it is of no use to follow them any further.</p>
               <p>Have you any recollection of the prisoner? - Yes; but I cannot swear to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lens. You do not profess to have so good a sight as the last witness; you say, that at the distance of ten yards you could discover a man with a white jacket on? - Yes.</p>

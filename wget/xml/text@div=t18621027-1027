I am the wife of Mr. Charles Newton, of Harringay-house, Hornsey—on the morning of 3d September I came down at half-past 6 o'clock—I was the first down—I found all the doors open leading into the back yard; there were fourteen doors in number open, with the room doors and back doors; there were two doors leading to the back yard—the doors of the house were all open except the hall door—I missed articles to the I amount of about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—this workbox (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is worth about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it is my property; it was in the drawing-room the night before—the things that were missing were taken from various parts of the house—the two doors I found open were the only two back doors which lead into the yard; there is another door leading into the conservatory—there were some candles which had been taken from the morning-room and burnt in the drawing-room—we searched to see whether there were any traces of how the entry was effected; we suppose some one was secreted downstairs in the billiard-room; there were marks of pressure under the table—this handkerchief is one of a dozen that were taken; it is my property; it was on the library table the night before—all the doors were locked the night before; I know that as a fact myself; I always examine them myself; in the passage upstairs I always look—they were all locked the kitchen back door, I cannot say about that, it was closed, but all the other doors I am positive were locked—I found the kitchen door and all open.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a servant of Mr. Newton's on 3d September—in consequence of what I heard, I made a search round the premises, and found the ivory workbox now produced—I went into the field from the front of the conservatory, and there I tracked some footsteps; there was dew on the ground—those footsteps led through a hedge; on the other aide of the hedge there was a heap of rubbish, and there I found this ivory work-box underneath it; it was quite underneath the heap of rubbish.</p>

In consequence of information I re<lb></lb>ceived, I, with another constable, Gall, went to watch this workbox; it was concealed under some rubbish on the prosecutor's premises—we went to watch about 7 o'clock, and about a quarter past 9 the prisoner and another man came direct across the field to the heap of rubbish—I saw the prisoner stop down, take the rubbish off, and take the workbox and try to place it in a leather bag which the other man held—we pounced upon them at the time, and both men ran away—I made after the prisoner, and my brother officer went after the other—after the prisoner had run a little way I took him into custody—he spoke first to me, and asked what I was going to do with him—I told him I was not going to do anything with him provided he would go to the police-station with me—he went along about the distance of one hundred yards quietly, when I had to open a gate; he then threw me up behind, and fell on the top of me—we had a desperate struggle, and I got the best of him—I tried to get my hand round his throat, and he seized my finger in his mouth, and drew the flesh from the nail to the first joint—it drew the flesh and nail right off; I have a new nail now—I then got my staff out of my pocket—I felt very faint and sick—he drew a knife out of his pocket, or from under him, in some way or other, and stabbed me—he at first pricked me a little way at the back part of my head; in a few minutes, as we were lying on the ground, he got it in dagger fashion, and gave me a desperate stab in another place—I felt very faint, and he got away—I went after him again, and just as I got to him I slipped down; he instantly turned round and said, "You b——, that will do for you now," and gave me another desperate stab in the head in the same dagger fashion—the three cuts were all within about an inch of the same place—I halloed out "Help" and "Murder," and my brother constable came to my assistance, and took the prisoner into custody; I was almost insensible at the time; I lost a great deal of blood—I am not out of the doctor's hands yet; this is the first time I have had my uniform on—I am not able to do duty yet.</p>

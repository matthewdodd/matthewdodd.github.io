I met the prisoner in Sr. James's-street, a short time after I had returned from Canada, where I had been on service; he was looking in at a shop window, and seemed, as I thought, in very great distress; he addressed me, and told me that he was in very great distress, and had been out of employ for six months, and had been obliged to pawn all his clothes from poverty; from a feeling of charity, I took him into my service.</p>
               <p>Q.How long after this was it that you missed any dollars - A. I don't know exactly how many days it was; but it was between the 5th and the 8th that I missed them, I only missed a portion, about five hundred and fifty-five, within one or two. After the prisoner came to live with me, I believe the next morning, or the day after, he appeared in a new coat, in an extremely nice new coat, and his appearance was changed very much indeed for the better. I had left my lodging for one night to go to Richmend, and foolishly left my keys behind me; one of those keys would open the box in which the dollars were deposited. The prisoner was my only servant. In consiquence of my suspicion, I went to Bow-street. I was present when the Bow-street officer apprehended the prisoner; he was not living in the same home with me; he slept in one of those old houses in Bolsever-street. At the time he was apprehended I told him what I apprehended him for; I told him I missed a quantity of dollars, and I conceived it impossible for any one else to rob me. He then became rather abusive, and he said, he was extremely sorry that he ever came into my service, on account of his character, and he never had taken any money of mine. On taxing him with the alteration for the better in his appearance; he said, he bought the new coat from a jew in the street. I went with the Bow-street officers to his lodging in Bolsover-street I took the prisoner with me. I saw the officers examine his lodging, and we found a parcel of women's new shoes, a quantity of trinkets, and silk handkerchiefs quite new. We did not find any dollars.</p>
               <p>JOHN HARRIS. I am shopman to Messrs. Rochforts, in Jermyin-street, they are pawnbrokers. I know the prisoner at the bar; he purchased a watch at our shop, I think on the 9th or 10th of July; a silver watch; he paid me in Spanish dollars, fifteen in number; the amount was three pounds two shillings and sixpence. The next day be bought a gold seal, I think for twenty seven or twenty eight shillings; he paid me with nine Spanish dollars, and I gave him the difference of a few shillings; he did not make any other purchases of me; those he made he paid for allia Spanish dollars.</p>
               <p>HENRY MYERS. I keep a sale-shop, in Swallow street. The prisoner bought something of me, about two or three days before he was taken up; he bought a coat; I asked him two guiness for it, and he gave seven Spanish dollars; I allowed him four shillings and four pence a piece for the dollars; so then he paid me in all dollars. I am sure he is the man; he used to pass my door almost every day.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Wilkinson, the jeweller, in Piccadilly. I know the person of the prisoner at the bar; he came one morning; I think Thursday the 11th of July; we asked him four pounds for a gold seal; be bought it. I agreed for three pounds ten shillings at last. He paid me eighteen dollars, and I gave him two shillings change out; they were old Spanish dollars; at that time he had a number of dollars in his possession. He asked if we could not give more than four shillings a piece for them; and we told him no. He brought sixty four other dollars in his possession; he said he could get four shillings and sixpence and five shillings a piece for them in Swallow street; but the person to whom he applied had gone out for change of a fifty pound note, to make a purchase of them. We purchased the sixty four dollars. I saw him in custody with in three or four days after this, I knew his person.</p>

There is the Colonel, and I will leave it to him to say whether I was or not. I had been paid for my work in Spanish dollars, and went to lay them out where I was well known; and as for this old man, Myers, I did not lay a halfpenny out with him. I purchased the things of his son.</p>

Yesterday morning about 10 o'clock my family were at breakfast, the prisoner came in, he asked for half a pint of hot, drank it, and called for another; after he had been in the kitchen some time by himself, he went out, my wife took notice of something bulging out under his arm, she called to him, he made no answer; she went and got hold of him, then I went to him, and found these four pewter plates under his waistcoat, they are my property, there are N. C. S. upon them all. He said, he brought them with him; I said, they were my property; then he said, I might do what I would with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brush-manufacturer at 2, Blackman-street, Borough. At the latter end of Oct. a person called on me for a list of prices, which I gave him—he gave me this card, "R. M. Campbell and Co., Chandler's Warehouses, 8, Billiter-street"—my brother called on Campbell and Co. and got this written order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know nothing about it myself—in consequence of that I supplied some goods, made out this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and gave it to my brother to take with the goods and get paid—he did not bring back the goods—there is discount at the bottom of this bill; I sold these goods for cash—I knew nothing of Camp<lb></lb>bell and Co., selling for cash I never look for a reference—I went the next day to 8, Billiter-street, and found the office closed—I went several times and tried to see Campbell at the office, with "Campbell and Co." on the door—I went, perhaps, four times before I saw him—the office was closed all one day and open the next morning, and I saw a lad there—when I saw Campbell I asked him whether he intended paying for my goods—he said, "No;" and said something about it being a credit transaction—I said it was no such thing, I should either have my money or goods—he said the goods had been sent away—the bill amounts to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—my brother has been obliged to go to Cork—I made inquiry, and in consequence of what I ascertained, I went with Fenning to Camp<lb></lb>bell's place in Billiter-street, and told him I did not wish to have any more trouble about it; I was determined not to be cheated, and if he gave me my money or goods I would have done with it, but if not, I should arrest him—he said he would not let me have either; dared me to do my worst, and said he would turn me out of the office, he was going home—he locked the office up, and I gave him in Fenning's custody for defrauding me—he afterwards showed me the invoice—I afterwards made the charge at the Mansion-house—my brother, Amos John Varian, was there examined, I think—Mr. Goodman took his evidence—after he had been examined Campbell asked him some questions.</p>

On 25th Oct., Campbell and Pomfret came together to our premises—they were then perfect strangers to me—they both spoke, and said they had been recommended to us to buy some books and general sta<lb></lb>tionery, and they wished to see some—Pomfret gave me two cards, one of which I kept—this is it ( <hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Pennington and Co., English and Foreign Timber Brokers, 65, Lower Thames-street")—I do not know what has become of the other—it was "R.

Campbell and Co.," and they said it was their card—they wrote down on a paper the articles they wanted, but I cannot find it—they then said, "You would like a reference;" and Pomfret gave me the card, with "Pennington and Co." on it—they then left—the next day, Saturday, I called at the address of Pennington and Co., in Thames-street, and saw the prisoner Pennington—I told him that two parties representing themselves as Campbell and Co. had called to buy some books; they had given his card as a reference, and I called to know if it was all right—he said Mr. Pennington was not within, I had better call on Monday to see him—I said, "Are they trustworthy people?"—he said, "No doubt it is all right," and I went away, and I did not go on the Monday—before I went, Pomfret had called alone, and asked if I had been to see Mr. Pennington—I told him I had not been able to go yet—he said they wanted their books and papers very much, and I told him I would go as soon as I had an opportunity—after that my brother, John Bunney, made a statement to me, in consequence of which I made up some goods—Pomfret called that afternoon and said, "I suppose you have been told that I brought my friend Mr. Pennington"—I said, "Yes; my brother has told me so," and in consequence of that I let him have a book, and promised to complete the order, which amounted to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a few days after, I heard that Campbell had been taken into custody—that was the same day the order was completed, and the last of the articles ordered to be sent, and I imagined they were sent—I went next morning to Pennington's, in Thames-street, saw the prisoner Pennington, and said, "You were kind enough to offer to pay for some articles Campbell and Co. have had," and gave him the bill—he consulted with his clerk, (who I saw here this morning—he is neither of the prisoners,) and then took me down into the street—he went about five doors along, hesitated, looked at the bill, and said, "I do not know what to say about this; I have never been to you," and his clerk said, "Oh no; it is some old fellow we keep, we</p>

In Sept. and Oct., 1849, he made application to members of the Society, which applications came before the Society, and he has received money since in consequence—I know he received three donations of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each in Sept. and Oct., and I have a letter which he addressed to me subsequently; it is his writing—I saw him write the receipt for the money—( <hi rend="italic">letter produced—this was a letter ad<lb></lb>dressed to the witness, dated Nov. 19, 1849, signed "R. M. Campbell;" it referred to the relief he had received, stating that he was a solicitors clerk out of employ, and requesting the witness to employ him</hi>)—I went to identify him, in order to prevent giving him any relief in future, and on that occasion he told me he was the same person who had received money from the Society, he was very sorry for it, but he had been led into it by Pomfret—Pomfret was in the same cell, but I do not think he heard it.</p>

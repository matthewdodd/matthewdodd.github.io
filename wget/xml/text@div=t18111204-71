            . I am a constable. On the 19th of November, about seven o'clock in the afternoon, I saw Benjamin with this basket of soap on his shoulder, he was in Harrow-alley, from Petticoat lane it leads into Cutler-street; I asked what he had got there, he said it was soap, he had brought it from home from the bottom of Primrose-street, Bishopsgate-street, he told me he got the soap from a man to sell for him, he would shew me where the man was. I secured the soap and Benjamin took me into an alley at the bottom of Primrose-street, up one pair of stairs; Diffner was sitting there, and a woman and child in Benjamin's house; Benjamin pointed to him. Diffner jumped off the chair and said, good God, I thought you would not do so, or betray me. I asked Diffner in Benjamin's hearing how or in what manner he came by the soap; Benjamin said he had it of him. Diffner was in such a flurry he made no reply. Diffner said he worked at a sugar bakers. I took him down stairs. Going along he told me that he was a <rs id="t18111204-71-deflabel408" type="occupation">watchman</rs>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Montague. After the prisoner was apprehended I went to him, I said it was a shocking thing; he said nobody else was concerned in it, he took it himself; that the man who locks up the soap-bin had left the key on a bench in the soap-house, near to the copper, and was going to wash himself. Diffner said, I want that key to get the saw to saw some wood for the house, and that he had take about a dozen pieces of mottled soap; the soap has no mark upon it; it is not perfectly boiled mottled soap, it answers to what we were possessed of. The basket that the soap was in is mine.</p>
               <p>Diffner's Defence. I told Mr. Eames that I found it as I went through Smithfield, I took it up, and in Long-lane John Benjamin came up to me, he had a knot; I said I found a parcel, he said come along with me and we found it was soap.</p>
               <p>Benjamin said nothing in his defence.</p>

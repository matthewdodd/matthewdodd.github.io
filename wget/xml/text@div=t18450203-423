                  </hi>. I keep the Yorkshire Grey public-house, in High-street, Whitechapel. On Friday, the 3rd of Jan., the prisoner came to my house, and asked for 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of peppermint—she tendered a shilling, which I discovered to be a counterfeit—I told her so—she said she had taken it from a baker up the street—I told her she had better fetch the baker—she went away, but never returned—I kept the shilling, and finding she did not return, I marked it, and placed it on a glass shelf behind the counter—it was frequently through my hands and under my notice, in the course of dusting the glasses—no other money was on the shelf near it, and no one but myself and wife had access to the bar—on the 16th of Jan. the pri<lb></lb>soner came again to my house, and asked for 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of peppermint—I recollected her the moment she came into the house, but I did not give her any intimation that I did so—I served her—she tendered a shilling, which I discovered to be counterfeit—I told her it was a bad one, and that</p>

               <p>it was the second time—I told her I had cautioned her before—she said she was very sorry, or something of that kind, and produced a good shilling—she did not say anything, she merely laid it on the counter—I had then taken up the bad shilling—I retained it—an officer was in the house at the time—I gave the shilling to him, and gave her into custody—I saw that second shilling marked—these are the two shillings—I find on this one the same mark that I put on it—I can swear to it—and on this other is the mark that was put on it in my presence.</p>

            . I think it was on a Saturday between one and two o'clock, or it might not be so late, that I went to Mr. Partridge's shop - I did not take notice of the time - George Drew and William Pickard went with me - when we got there, one of the windows round the corner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100094"></xptr>of the shop was cracked - I put my finger against the glass, and it cracked all across and fell out - I got under the iron bar in front of the window, put my hand in about a foot, or a foot and a half, and brought eleven gold rings to the hole; three were hair, but the tops of them were gold - I took nine of them out, and gave them to Drew - both the prisoners stood at the window, and told me when any body was looking at me - their standing there would prevent people seeing me so easily; but people could see if they looked - they covered me - we all went to Mrs. Pickard's and looked at the rings - there were three hair - the other six were all gold - I only took nine, because a gentleman dressed in black went along, who I thought noticed me; and William Pickard said, "Come on;" so I took no more - the three hair rings were on one card by themselves, and three of the gold ones also - when we got home, Mrs. Pickard said they would fetch 2s. apiece, and some not so much - she went and pledged two wedding-rings at 
               <persName id="t18340410-191-person1205">Mr. Cotton</persName>
            's - I went with her; and another one she pawned in Ratcliffe-highway for 2s., and one for 1s. - I do not know the name of the shop - after we got home, we had one of the hair ones apiece - Mrs. Pickard said one of the rings would not pledge, because it was not worth taking in - she said the pawnbroker said so - when we got home she gave me part of the money - I do not know what it was now - we tossed for the ring that was not taken in, and William Pickard won it - he told me he had pawned it at Cotton's for 1s. - he showed me the duplicate, and said he had got the best of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sur you did not give it to him? A. Yes - I always kept in my mind where I had been - I may make a mistake sometimes - I have told a great many of these things to my father, and he tried all he could to stop me from committing these depredations; but he could not keep me from going - I do not mean to continue it - it was quite daylight when this was done - I have never been convicted.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been tried in your life? A. I was never tried more than before the Lord Mayor once, about a handkerchief - I was discharged then - I was never before a Jury except here last sessions, for a gold watch - that was Blake and Hall's business - I never did any thing wrong till I knew the prisoners - they enticed me, and said what good things they got.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you stole things, who did you take them to? A. Mrs. Pickard, I went with her son and Thomas Hall - my father endeavoured to persuade me from it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This is not a hair ring? A. No; it is a gold stone ring - they are coloured stones, not glass - a shilling was all he asked on it- I knew him before - I have seen his father at my shop, but not these nine months.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was 1s. all he asked for it? A. Yes; we do not offer more than people ask - I should not consider the stones in the ring worth two-pence.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to Ware. Q. Did not you say it was a hair ring, that Mrs. Pickard said nobody would take, and which you tossed for? A. No; I said there were three hair rings, but I did not mention what sort of ring it was at all.</p>
               <p>CHRISTOPHER PARTRIDGE re-examined. The ring is one which I lost that day - I am positive of it by a mark on the back of it - it is one I manufactured myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you sold any of them? A. No; it was the only one I manufactured of this pattern - it was made too large - I cut it and resoldered it - the stones are pink topazes - I think I paid 4d. each for the stones - it is a gold ring - I should sell it for 18s. - it had got discoloured by being put in the ink at the office - this ring found in the woman's drawer, is one of the hair rings that I lost.</p>

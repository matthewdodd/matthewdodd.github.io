                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer's labourer—I live at 4, St. James's-place, St. Saviour's. About half past 11 o'clock on the night of 22nd July I was going down the steps towards the Borough Market—I met the prisoner on the top of the steps—he said, "Are you going to stand any beer?"—I said, "No, I am going home"—I had never seen him before, to my recollection—when we came to the bottom of the steps he looked round him, and then he up with his hand and hit me in the face—I put up my hand to save my face, and he struck me on the hand—he seized me by the neckcloth and put his hand into my left hand pocket, and as soon as he got his hand out he took me by the</p>

At a little before 12 o'clock that night I was in Worcester-street—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw the prisoner running, and the prosecutor after him—the prisoner ran down Castle-street—I lost sight of him, and found him at last secreted under a truck, in Castle-lane, which is no thoroughfare—when I saw him, he said, "What a fool I was to run away! it will just <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for me"—the prosecutor had been drinking, but was not drunk.</p>

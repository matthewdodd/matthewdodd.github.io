                  </hi>. I keep the Princess Amelia public-house, in Ox<lb></lb>ford-street. On Thursday, the 2nd of January, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in, and called for two penny-worth of rum—he gave my daughter sixpence, which she passed to me—I am sure it was the one he put down—I put it on the shelf—I considered it was bad—he received the change and went out—after he was gone, I put the six-pence into my waistcoat-pocket, where I had no other—he came again next day for two penny-worth of rum and shrub, and offered me a sixpence—I suspected it to be bad, and put it into my waistcoat-pocket, and gave him change—I had nothing in that pocket but the other sixpence—I have no means of distinguishing it from the other—he came again on the 6th—my wife was in the bar—I am not sure what he came for—he had been in the habit of coming to my house—I saw him served—he gave my wife a sixpence edgeways—I took it, and put it into my waistcoat-pocket with the other two—I then went to the door to look for a policeman, and gave him in charge—I kept the sixpences in my waistcoat-pocket, and gave them to the inspector—I am sure these are the three—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)</p>

On Monday, the 6th of January, the prisoner came for two penny-worth of rum—he gave me a six-pence—I examined it, and saw it was bad—I handed it to my husband—he walked out with it, and fetched a policeman—I had not given the pri<lb></lb>soner his change—he asked me afterwards for half a pint of porter, and told me to warm it—while I was doing so he walked out, without his change—my husband was then at the door—the prisoner had seen me hand the sixpence to my husband, and my husband go out.</p>

I took the prisoner, and received these three sixpences from the prosecutor—I asked the prisoner how he came to pass them—he said he was not aware they were bad, and he had taken them from his customers in selling oranges—he had a carpenter's basket with him, but no oranges—I found on him a good shilling and 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers, three pieces of silk, and a small piece of wood—I never saw him before.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 10th of March, about half-past two o'clock, I saw Hutton going along Hounslow with a basket. Mrs. Hancock was close behind him - I followed him half a mile, and asked what he had got - he said some lead from Mr. Hancock's house, and he was going to Brentford to sell it - at the further end of Hounslow I got an officer, and we took Hutton - Mr. Emmerson and I went to Hancock, who is a shoemaker, and lives at the end of Hounslow - both the doors were fast - he went to the front door and I to the back; Mrs. Hancock said her husband was gone to Harlington, but a man said he had seen him just before - we then broke the door open and found him. I said to Hancock "You are my prisoner, you must go with me;" Emmerson went up stairs, and brought some lead, which Hancock said had been in Taylor's room; we asked where we could find Taylor; he said "If you go to Crawford-street, you will find him;" Emmerson went there and found him - we got a search-warrant a few days afterwards, and found some more lead in Taylor's box; as we were coming to London on the 11th, Hutton said "If we have taken the lead from Mrs. Canham's gate they can't swear to it now, because it is cut in pieces" - the other two prisoners were close to him, but made no observation. I believe they all lodged in Hancock's house.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. We apprehended Hutton with the lead - we then went to the house, and I found four pieces more, which Hancock said was Taylor's - I found two more pieces in Taylor's box - I took them to the office, and took two or three tradesmen to see where the lead was taken from; the lead here produced matched exactly to the top of the building; I knew that Taylor lived at Hancock's, but I did not know what room he occupied; I heard Taylor say he knew the lead came into the house the same night it was lost off the lodge - there were 87lbs. of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Swiss, and live at No. 38, James Street, Man<lb></lb>chester Square. On 27th February I was looking for a situation—the prisoner came to me while I was in Oxford Street, looking at some photo<lb></lb>graphic portraits—he said to what perfection they brought them, and he asked what I was doing; I said I was looking for a situation—he told me he was acquainted with a butler who was going to leave his situation because the family was going out of town, and he thought I should do for the place, and he would introduce me to the butler about 6 o'clock—he asked me if I would take a glass of ale, and if I would go with him I should have a chance to see the butler—we went into a public house near where we were; we had a glass of beer at the bar—he told me he was in business as a poulterer—we then went out to see this butler, and he took me to the parlour of the Coach and Horses—while we were in the parlour another man came in, and he asked if that was a general room or a private room—I said, "I suppose it is public"—the prisoner and he began to bet about the stone that they would throw at the skittles, and we went down stairs to the skittle-ground, and the prisoner betted with the other man, and he advised me to bet—I said, "You may bet yourself," but at last I did bet, and we played altogether—after they had betted about the stone we all began to play—I lost 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the first game, and I would not play again—the prisoner advised me to play again, and said I would be likely to win—I put down 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. again, and lost the second game—we were playing all three together—when I lost the second time I would not play again, and the prisoner advised me to play for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said I would be sure to win—I put the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the third game, and I saw the prisoner and the other party speaking privately together, and I thought it must be wrong, that they were robbing me, and I said I would go up stairs, and the other man gave me back 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had at that time given 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the other man by the prisoner's advice—the game was not over—I went up stairs and spoke to the landlady—the prisoner followed me—the others remained down stairs—there were two others besides the prisoner, but one did not play—when I came out of the room from speaking to the landlady, the prisoner was in the house—I went down to the skittle ground with the landlady, and the two men who had been there were gone—we came up stairs again, and the prisoner was gone—I saw the prisoner again a fortnight or twelve days afterwards in Berners Street, Oxford Street; I went to him, and asked him if he recollected me, he said, "No"—I went to look for a constable to give him in charge, I could not find one—I passed by the prisoner again, and he said, "Yes, I recollect you; how do you do?"—I came with him, and gave him in charge to a constable; I said I charged him with robbing me in skittle playing by false pretences—the prisoner offered me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he made me the offer more than once—the policeman was present when he made the last offer—he offered me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

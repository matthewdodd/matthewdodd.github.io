            . It was the prisoner's duty to carry out beer, and to account to me in the evening for what he had received; it was the custom to deliver to the draymen these cheques to take out with the beer - this pile of cheques is his hand-writing, down to the 15th of June last, but those since then are not written on - he kept them till the book was full, and then returned it; I sent him out on the 11th of July; he did not account to me on that day for 5s. 6d. received from Parker; here is his book of that day, but no entry of this kind; on the 13th of July we received a letter, complaining of the beer, and desiring it might be changed - in consequence of this, I went there, and found a nine-gallon cask belonging to our brewery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go yourself in consequence of this letter? A. Yes; and the beer was changed; it was not my duty to call on the prisoner to account for it, but to report it to Mr. Haddon.</p>

            . On the 11th of July I purchased a cask of beer of the prisoner, and paid him in silver; I paid him some shillings; I received this receipt for it. - (read.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You trust to your memory, I suppose, when you say you believe it was paid in shillings? A. I am sure of it; I did not ask him for a receipt with his master's name on it; he did not say, "If the beer is bad do not write to me or my master," but he gave me this printed receipt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have so many customers, that I am obliged to put it down going along, and on a wet day it is very troublesome; it must have been booked to some old customer.</p>
               <p>JURY to JAMES SHARP. Q. How came you not to complain of his not filling up these books of receipts? A. We do not examine the book till it is quite full; what he collected was more than 1000l. a year.</p>

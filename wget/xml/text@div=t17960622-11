               <p>Q. Where had you seen them before? - A. They were in the brazier's shop in a kettle, they were taken there that day, the iron anvil was under his bench, removed out of the copper snop, into the tin shop; having a search warrant, I went with the officer to his lodgings, and there I found a tobacco-box, which I believe to be the property of my father, he was taken before a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You had not seen these things for some time? - A. Not the anvil nor copper.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen the rivets? - A. I cannot say I saw these, I saw a quantity of rivets in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear that the tobacco-box is your father's property? - A. I believe it is.</p>

               <p>Between the hours of one and two the prisoner came into the brazier's shop; I was in the warehouse along side the shop, he came in to boil potatoes for his dinner; there was a hole made in the partition on purpose for me to look through; my master directed me to watch; he put the saucepan on the forge, and looked about the shop to see that all was clear; finding nobody there, he went to the kettle under the work-bench, and took the rivets out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the rivets there any time before? - A. Yes; I saw them there the same morning; before he laid them on the forge, he put a few in his pocket at the time; I went and informed my master of it, he put me there again, and I saw him take some more, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How long have you lived in this place? - A. About two years and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distant was the hole you looked through? - A. About six yards.</p>

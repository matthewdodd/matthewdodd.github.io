                  </hi>. I live at 30, Nottingham-place. On 8th Sept. between seven and eight in the evening, I was in Fieldgate-street—I was surrounded, and received a violent blow with a blunt instrument on the back of my head, which deprived me of my senses—when I came to I missed my watch from my waistcoat-pocket—the guard had been cut—my pocket was turned out, and four sovereigns and a shilling were gone from it which were safe five minutes before—I called, "Thieves! Murder!"—the watch was returned to me—I have suffered from concussion of the brain ever since; I never had an hour's illness before.</p>

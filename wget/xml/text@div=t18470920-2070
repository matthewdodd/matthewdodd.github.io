On the 1st of Sept. the prisoner came in—we kept the gold and silver on a shelf in the bar—the gold was in a horn, and the silver was on the shelf—I heard a jink, that induced me to look, and I saw the prisoner on the counter, with his hand on the horn—I looked at the shelf, and the silver was gone, I suppose there was about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I called out, "Thief, thief, he has stolen all the silver!"—the porter came, and ran after him—I followed him till he was caught—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver was found on him, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—he had no gold—he had left in the horn.</p>

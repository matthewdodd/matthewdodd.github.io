                  </hi>. I am 10 years old, and live at 3, Middle-lane, Blue Anchor-road, Bermondsey—on Thursday, 16th May, about a quarter-past 8 o'clock, I was at the top of Middle-lane—I saw Kelly—he said to me, "Will you go and get me a half-quartern of brandy? "—I said, "No"—he said he would give me a halfpenny—a little boy, Thomas Dowdy, was coming up—he asked him, and he went—Kelly gave him a shilling, in a piece of paper, and a bottle—I saw the shilling—I saw him wrap it up—Dowdy went into Mr. Dibbs', the Queen Victoria—Kelly went down by the ditch, where the black fence is, round the corner—Dowdy came up, and Kelly came forward to meet him, and stopped at the top of the lane—when he met him, Dowdy gave him the bottle and some money in change, and he gave Dowdy a halfpenny—after that I went into Mr. Dibbs' to get change, and told the landlady something—I came out, and Dray, the potman, came out with me—I pointed out Kelly—he was going further on.</p>

I am potman at the Queen Victoria—on Thursday morning, 16th May, Wymark came to me, and in consequence of what she said, I went out of the house—she pointed Kelly out to me, in the distance—I followed him; and saw him meet the prisoner Chapman under an archly, in Church-street, Bermondsey—I there saw him take a bottle out of his pocket, and give it to Chapman, who drank something from it, and gave Kelly back the bottle—they then walked on together to Tooley-street, where I followed them, and then gave them in charge—it is some distance from the arches where I saw Kelly join Chapman, to Tooley-street, where the police stopped them.</p>

On the 15th of May I was alarmed by some one breaking my window, at four o'clock in the morning; I got up, and dressed myself, and told my apprentice to do so, which he did - I went out, and as soon as I got to the door the prisoner ran round the corner, and knocked me down; I got up - he knocked me down again, and said he would silence me; he took my hat: an officer came and took him to the watch-house - I went there, but was in an ill state of health, and it was booked as an assault; we went before the Magistrate, and he was ordered to find bail - he had my hat in his possession before the Magistrate, and I said so, but the Magistrate did not seem to pay much attention to me; he was talking to a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you not know him before? A. Yes, perhaps for ten months; he lived at an oil-shop, kept by Brown - I do not know that he lived there afterwards; I went every where to look for him after I filed this hill, which was in September - he was held to bail that I might file a bill against him; he had a hat on when he knocked me down, and I think he had one at the watch-house: I do not know who broke the window- my wife was not at home; she came up after this - I did not see her at the time I saw the prisoner; my hat cost 25s. - it was a pretty good one: the officer who took the prisoner is not here. Vann, the officer, stated before the Magistrate that the prisoner had my bat, and the Magistrate said, "I have ordered him to find bail."</p>

I am in the ostrich-feather business. -The prosecutor lodges with me; he had been in a dangerous state of health: I called to him to see who broke the window - the prisoner rushed up, knocked him down, and took his hat; I went up to him, and he knocked me down- the prosecutor got up, and the prisoner knocked him down again, and said, "I will silence you;" he appeared before the Magistrate with the prosecutor's hat - I cannot say whether he was sober or not.</p>

             sworn. - I belong to Marlborough-street office; I apprehended the prisoner at Camden-Town; she made many excuses, but I told her she must go with me; as I was taking her down Titchfield-street, she told me the spoons were did in the house; I took her back to the house, and the moment I entered the room, I saw her put her hand in her right hand pocket; I told her I would search her myself, and she dropped the spoons under her apron; I picked them up, and she said, that either me or the prosecutrix dropped them ourselves; I searched her pocket, and found this duplicate of a tea-spoon, (produces it); I took her to Marlborough-street, and then I went to the pawnbroker at Hamp-street, and got the spoon.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PAXON sworn. - I am a pawnbroker; the prisoner pawned three spoons with me, on the 16th, I am sure she is the woman; on the 28th, she fetched two spoons out, and left the other one; she pledged them in the name of Courtney.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That is my husband's name.</p>
               <p>(The spoons were produced, and deposed to by Mrs. King). The prisoner put in a written defence, as follows: My Lord, and Gentleman. It was my great misfortune to work two days with Mrs. King, a milk-woman, as a carrier; I cleaned the kitchen, where, in raking up some old dirt, I picked up two teaspoons, and a little further, one more, which, from their colour, must have lain there some time; there are a great many lodgers in the house; I thought I would speak to every one in the house; I told Mrs. King to look if any thing was lost, before I went; and she looked, and said, no, she had lost nothing; and the same with the lodgers; thus finding there was no loser, I thought myself a fortunate gainer, if they were silver, for from their black appearance, I could not tell; when my mistress came to me, I did not deny having them, though I denied stealing them, for which offence I stand charged, for the first time in my wretched life. Oh, my Lord, look with an eye of benevolence and compassion upon your humble petitioner, and cast not away an unfortunate woman, who never intended to injured any one; and who once never thought to be reduced to such a situation.</p>

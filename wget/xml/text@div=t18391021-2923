               <p>leaving my house all fastened except the kitchen window, which was closed—all the property stated was safe in the front parlour—I got up next morning, at a quarter to seven o'clock, and found the kitchen-window open, and all the things gone—I saw footmarks in the garden, which is on a level with the kitchen-window—I have since compared both the prisoners' shoes with those footmarks, and Sinfield's boots and Young's naked foot corresponded with them—there had been rain between the Wednesday and the Friday, when I compared them—the prisoners lived at the stable at the back of my premises, and Young said they had slept there on the night of the robbery—Sinfield was not present then—there are a very bad set of men round there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical student, living at Mr. Fuller's. I was called up on Wednesday morning, about half-past seven o'clock, and found my desk open on the floor—it had not been locked—my Bank-notes were taken from the cupboard—I slept in the back-parlour, and that window was open in the morning—I believe it was shut at night, but I am not certain—there was a ladder placed against it outside, which was at the other end of the garden overnight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Wednesday morning, about ten o'clock, I accompanied inspector Robinson to examine the premises, and, at the back, found two distinct footmarks, one of a shoe, the other of a naked foot—I afterwards went into the garden of No. 14, three doors from the prosecutor's, and found the print of a boot or shoe, corresponding with that in Mr. Fuller's garden—it was at the end of the mews—I went down with Robinson, and saw the prisoners and another man—Robinson asked what they were doing there—Sinfield said the other two came there to help him—I asked Young what he was, he said an engineer, working for Mr. Sherwin, in Cumberland-street, Curtain-road—Young was apprehended on the Thursday evening—I asked him what time he left the mews on Tues<lb></lb>day night—he said he was there along with two others, and they slept in the loft—that led me to take Sinfield—I told him the charge, and asked what time be left the mews that night—he said that was his business—on Thursday morning I took off Sinfield's right boot, and Tate brought Young to the premises—I gave the boot to Mr. Leach to compare—with the impression, which he did in my pretence, and it exactly corresponded, in my opinion—there was no particular nail or marks—here is the boot it has an iron beet—there was the distinct mark of that—I mean it might be made something like that—Young's naked foot was also compared with the impression, and corresponded.</p>

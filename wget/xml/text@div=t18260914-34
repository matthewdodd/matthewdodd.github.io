            , to milk the cows; I had a bag containing a scarf, a pocket-handkerchief, eight shillings, two penny-pieces, two halfpence, and two purses - we had to pass over Lea-bridge, when we got on the bridge; the prisoner Waters came on the bridge to me, and asked for a halfpennyworth of milk - I told him we had none; he threw up the bag which I had in my hand, and the halfpence rattled, as they were loose - he went down to the other prisoners - there were six of them altogether; we went straight on down the Marsh - Waters and Andrews came up and pushed me down, and held me down till they got my bag from me - I struggled a great deal to hinder them, and was very frightened; the tuck was torn out of my frock when I got up; I then looked to see where they were gone, and the four prisoners were looking into my bag - I called for assistance directly, and they all ran together up the side of the river Lea, towards a public house; they were pursued and taking at Bow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did they appear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140026"></xptr>to have been bathing? A. No; some boys were in the river, but not the prisoners - none of the six were in the river; some boys were bathing very near the spot where it happened - there were four bathing; I will not swear that neither of the six had his coat off.</p>
               <p>FRANCES LOW. I live just below Hackney-terrace - my father is a cow-keeper, and had cows on the Marsh. On the 31st of August, I was going down the Marsh with Lyons - we went over the Wick-bridge, and met Waters, who asked for a half-penny worth of milk - we told him twice we had got none, and he threw up Lyons' bag, which was in her hand, and the halfpence jinked; he went away to the others - there were six of them; in about five minutes, when we had got a little way from the bridge, Waters and Andrews pushed her down, and took the bag from her by force - she resisted; the other two prisoners were coming towards them when they pushed her down, and met them, and all ran away together down the river side; I saw them do nothing with the bag; I raised an alarm, got on the river side, and my brother ran to the White Lion, public-house, and gave an alarm; he was not with us, but by the next bridge; I did not see them taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On which side of the river did this happen? A. The left hand, going to Homerton-bridge - I was close to the river - I saw no boys bathing - I saw none but these six; I do not think there could be any bathing; I saw none of their coats off; I was much frightened.</p>
               <p>JANE LYONS re-examined. The boys in the river were by the side of the bridge; the prisoners were down by the side of the water with them; Low must have seen the boys in the water, for she said to me, "There used always to be boys on the river when I came this way." I saw some, and said, "Don't look this way."</p>
               <p>Q. Then she did not look? A. Oh, yes, she did.</p>

            . I live in James-street, Globe-fields, and am 13 years old. On the 31st of August, I was going along the Marsh, walking towards Bow - I was not far from the Wick-bridge, and met six chaps running; Waters and Andrews were two of them; I saw Waters throw a purse into the water, and Andrews threw the reticule into the river - I got them out; I am sure they are the men - I knew Waters before by seeing him often at the corner of Slaughter-street, Brick-lane, where I used to work; I had never seen Andrews before; I saw Lyons crying, and asked if they were her things; she said Yes - I went with her; I gave the bag and purse to Hudson the officer, that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there not a good many boys bathing? A. I saw one person in the river, and one outside; one of the prisoners had his coat off.</p>

            . I am a carman, and live in Well-street, Hackney. On the 31st of August, a young woman in the Marshes, gave an alarm - I stood and saw the prisoners leave her - they came by me; I pursued; Duff and Andrews ran up a yard at Bow, and into a privy, where I took them, and gave them in charge - this was a mile from the Marshes; while I pursued they turned round and pelted me with stones; I never lost sight of them; Gardner ran into the yard with the other two, and he was brought to me - I am certain of them all; I never lost sight of Waters till Lee took him.</p>

            . I am a carman, and live in Wick-street, Hackney. On the 31st of August I heard an alarm, went in pursuit, and took Waters at Old Ford, about a quarter of a mile from this bridge; brought him back to the Wick, and took him to Bow, where I found other three in custody - I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Homerton-bridge? A. Yes; there is no house near it; the White Lion is about four hundred yards from it; there used to be many boys bathing there, but it has been stopped a good deal lately.</p>

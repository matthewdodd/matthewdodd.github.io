I keep the White Horse public-house, at the corner of Stepney-green—the prisoner has been in my service seven or eight months—in consequence of something, I communicated with the police on the 24th of Jan.—I marked twelve shillings, and gave them to the police to spend at my bar—it would go into the till—on the afternoon of the 25th of Jan. I cleared out the till and found eleven of the shillings—I sent to the policeman</p>

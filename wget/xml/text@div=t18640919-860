                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer of 143, Copenhagen-street—on 28th August, the prisoner came and bought some coals and potatoes, which came to ninepence halfpenny—I served him—he gave me a shilling, which I put into the till, gave him twopence halfpenny change, and he left—there was no other money in the till; it was the first money I had taken—in con<lb></lb>sequence of something my wife said, I went to the till, took the shilling out, tried it, bent it back each way, and found it was bad—the prisoner had only just gone out—I went out and caught him at his own door, which is the first turning from us, a few doors down—I gave the shilling to him, and said, "I don't like this shilling; have you got another?"—he said, "Well, it is a rum-looking one," or some such words as those, and said, "Here is another one if that won't do," and he took out a handful of silver from his pocket, and I took a shilling out of it—I gave him back the bad shilling; it was not bent then—it gave way very easily—I bent it straight again in the detector—a few days after he came again and bought a few things—he then said, "That shilling that you brought me back was a rank <hi rend="italic">duffer</hi>—I broke it with my fingers."</p>

I am a daughter of George Barke, a cheesemonger of Copenhagen-street—on 6th September, about half-past 8 in the morning, I served the prisoner with some bacon, butter, and eggs, which came to six-pence; he tendered me a florin, which I bent easily in detector, though it sounded good—he said, "What, is it a bad one, because I have got a good shilling in my pocket if it is?"—I said, "Never mind, we will see directly," and called my father, who went for a policeman.</p>

On 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> August I found a bad shilling and two sixpences in my till—I wrapped the shilling up in paper and gave it to policeman 453—on the 7th my daughter called me into the shop; the prisoner was there—she said, "Father, this man has given me a bad florin"—I said, "You have given me two shillings before, and I shall give you in charge this time"—he said, "You have known me before, why have you not told me of it, if I have given you bad money previously?"—I said, "We had not a chance then, we have one now, and I shall give you in charge," which I did with the florin.</p>

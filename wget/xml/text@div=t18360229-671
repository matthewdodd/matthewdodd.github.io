                  </hi>. I am cellarman to Messrs. Meux and Co., and live No. 6, North-place, Somerstown. On Saturday night, the 6th of Fe<lb></lb>bruary, a little before nine o'clock, I was going home; and when I was in the middle of Drummond-street I was suddenly tripped up, and fell on my back—I found a hand at my right-hand waistcoat-pocket—I had eight half-crowns and a sixpence there—I had spent some of my small cash in coming home; I had received my wages, eight half-crowns and four shillings—I called out "Murder"—the man ran away directly—when I got up I put my hand to my pocket, and found I had lost some silver—I could not tell what I had lost—I did not examine then—I was then con<lb></lb>ducted to the station—one of the policeman came up, and took me to the station-house—I got none of my money back—I then found I had one half-crown and a sixpence left—I had been drinking—it was dark—I can<lb></lb>not tell who did it—I am sure I was not so drunk that I fell down and lost my money—I could walk—I cannot tell where the person came, but I think on me side of me—it was done momentarily.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 88.) I was in Drummond-street on the night in question, and saw the prosecutor on his back, and the pri<lb></lb>soner astride over him—I was about six yards off at the time "Murder" was called—when I got within about three yards of him he made off—I pursued the prisoner—he was stopped by a baker—as soon as he got hold of him on one side, I got hold of him on the other—he was never out of my sight at all—I took him to the station, and after the prosecutor came to the station I was ordered on search the prisoner—I found in his great-coat pocket seven half-crowns, five-pence in copper, a knife, and a shoe-horn—I have them here—the prisoner never said any thing about the money; he only asked what right I had to collar him—I said, when he got to the sta<lb></lb>tion-house he would hear all about it—the sergeant asked his name and address, which he refused to give—the sergeant said, "I think your name is something like Pye"—he said nothing to that.</p>

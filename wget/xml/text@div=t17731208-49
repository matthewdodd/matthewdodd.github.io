On the 5th of November between three and four o'clock in the morning, I missed this cow; it had but just calved; it was marked C L on the horn. I advertised it on Tuesday, and on Wednesday I received intelligence that it was killed in White-horse-street, Stepney; I went there and acquainted the man's wife of it; he was not at home, and the same night the prisoners were taken. As we were taking them to the Justice, Martin called me by my name and desired I would be as favourable to him as I could; when they were before the Justice they were in several stories.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in White-horse-street, Stepney; I saw the prisoners as I was coming from Whitechapel market, at the door of Mr. Davis, who keeps the Green Dragon at Stepney; one of them, I believe Ridley, had a cloth under his arm; I asked what they were doing; they said they were staying to receive some money; this was about eleven in the morning; the bell was going for church; I went home, and they both came to my house and asked me to let them kill a poor cow there; I told them I had never a beef tree nor rope, and they said they would bring them along with them, and said they should bring the cow in the evening; about seven in the evening they brought her; it was a dark brown and white spotted cow; she was very lame; I did not examine her, so I did not observe any mark on the horns. The cow was at my house all day on Sunday; on Monday morning about nine o'clock they came to kill her; they asked me to lend them a hand, and they would satisfy me any thing I desired.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the skin and entrails?</p>
               <p>New. After it was dressed they took the hide in a bag, and the feet in a cloth, and left the body till Tuesday morning, and then about five, or between five and six o'clock, came with a horse and cart, and quartered it, and put it in the cart; I bought the paunch and entrails, and gave them five shillings and seven-pence for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that as much as they were worth?</p>
               <p>New. More.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to buy them then?</p>
               <p>New. I thought I was to have the tongue, but they took it away. Laycock came in the afternoon to enquire about it; I was not at home; one of Justice Camper's men and I went to the house where Martin lodged, and told the landlord of it; he bid us stay a little and Martin would come in: we staid till he came in, and then we took him to the watch-house for that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer shop, in Chapel-street, Soho—I was in the parlour of the Hampshire Hog public-house, in Berwick-street, with the prisoner, on the 29th of January—I got rather intoxicated—I had two sovereigns, six half-crowns, five shillings, and eight sixpences—I was sitting down at the table, and the prisoner came up and took the money out of my pocket—I had two sovereigns in my trowsers' pocket—I raised myself up, and the girl said, "Mr. Paine, you are robbed"—I saw the prisoner taking his hand out of my pocket—he was taken, and the money found on him.</p>

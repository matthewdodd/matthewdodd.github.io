             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Were you employed by Rogers and the other officers on the 13th of June at the Red-Lion, to go to the prisoner's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Rogers, or any of them mark any money and give you any money? - A. Yes; they marked five shillings in my presence at the Red-Lion, Red Lion-street, Whitechapel; Rogers, Oliver, and Brown, were there; I went to the prisoner's house in <placeName id="t18050710-85-crimeloc471">Old Castle-yard, Whitechapel, or Old Castle-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did the officers go with you? - A. Yes, to the door, as near as they possibly could, without being perceived.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner then? - A. Yes, she was at home, and her servant, who is somewhere about thirteen or fourteen years old; I asked her if she had got any goods; she said, yes; this was in the back room, she keeps a chandler's shop, but she has not opened it yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Goods is a cant term for shillings and sixpences? - A. She knew what I meant perfectly; she asked me how many I wanted; I told her; she then asked me if I had seen any of her crooks, meaning sixpences; shillings she called shans.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you knew crooks meant sixpences? - A. Yes, I knew what she meant; she pulled a great quantity of sixpences, which were in paper, out of her pocket; I told her I would have eight crooks; she said they were threepence a-piece; I told her I would have two shans.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did she deliver you six sixpences and two shillings? - A. Yes, and I gave her three shillings for them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Were these three shillings a part of the five that Rogers had given you? - A. They were; I had no other money about me than the five shillings that Rogers had given me; when I was coming away, she asked me if I did not want any seven-shilling pieces, (they call them spangles); I told her I did not; she said they were very good ones, they would come as high as four shillings a-piece, they were such as nobody would refuse; I asked her then, if I called to-morrow, if she should have any more; she said she should.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew you had not bought all her stock then? - A. No, only she had so many customers; I came out then to the officers who were waiting in the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any signal to them? - A. Yes, I returned back, and Brown followed me in immediately, and the rest of the officers; Brown ran<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100083"></xptr>up to her, and laid hold of her hand in my presence, and asked her what she was about; he began to search her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing? - A. She gave no answer to Brown's question; I do not justly know what passed then; they searched me, and found eight bad sixpences and two bad shillings, and the two marked shillings that were left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I had your character last night - I think you told me that you was a wire-drawer, a lace-maker, and a smasher? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the prisoner's house for the purpose of buying bad money - had you been acquainted with the prisoner's husband? - A. I had not seen him above once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen him often enough to get into his debt? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not purchase a table-cloth of him? - A. I never bought any thing of him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Take care, Mr. Coleman, did you never buy a table-cloth of the prisoner nor her husband? - A. I never saw one in the possession of them, only when the house was searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they search the house when they searched the prisoner? - A. Yes, and they found a tablecloth; I do not know that I should know the husband, if I met him in the street; I never saw the husband above twice, that was when they lived in Rosemary-lane; I have seen the woman several times.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to her house the first time, she was not at home? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went the second time, how many persons did you see there? - A. A little girl and her.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - A. Between five and six in the evening, it was quite light; I cannot say there was not any body else there, but I did not see any other woman there.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot see very well, I suppose - will you swear that there were not two women in the shop at the time? - A. There was not a soul in the shop or the parlour as I saw but the prisoner, the girl, and me; the shop-door was a-jar.</p>
               <p>Q. When you go to people to buy articles of this sort, as you are acquainted with the trade, do you generally deal in public or in private - you, I should suppose, wish no person to be present? - A. Except it is some in the trade, and they do not care if there is half a dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever buy articles of this sort before servants? - A. Yes, because they are privy to it all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the servants are as bad as the mistress? - A. The girl saw what passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then openly before the servant this woman, you would have me to understand, exposed herself to the danger you brought her into? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not ask the woman to keep a parcel for you, and you would call again, and give her three shillings as part in payment, and give her all the bad money in the paper? - A. I know nothing at all of it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer of Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. You, together with Brown and Oliver, went to this Red Lion public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mark any money, and give it to Coleman? - A. I did, five shillings, in the presence of the officers; I shewed the marks to the officers and to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go and station yourselves about the house of the prisoner? - A. I stood at a distance; the other officers went nearer the house than me.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had stationed yourselves about the house, how long afterwards was it that Coleman gave you a signal? - A. Not many minutes; Brown went in first, and when I went in, Brown had hold of the prisoner's hands; I desired him to search what she had in her lap; he searched her apron and her pockets, and he gave me the marked money which I had before given to Coleman; I desired him to take care of the bad money.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had he taken any bad money from the prisoner? - A. Yes, at that time he had taken a great deal of bad money himself from her; he kept the bad money; I then applied to Coleman; I said, what have you done with the remaining part of the five shillings; said he, I have got them in my pocket; he gave them to me immediately, these are them, and these are the three marked shillings that Brown took from the prisoner, (producing them); Oliver took some counterfeit money from Coleman; I asked him where he got that from; he said, I got it from that woman, Mrs. Camel; I then said, do you hear what that man says; she did not immediately answer me; I again said, Mrs. Camel, you see I have got some money here from Mr. Brown, where did you get that money; she said she got it from Coleman; I asked her where she got all the counterfeit money, and she made the same reply.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her where she got the marked money? - A. Yes; then she replied generally she got all the money from Coleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to her, where did you get all that counterfeit money? - A. Yes, and then she said she got it all from Coleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a girl by at the time? - A. Yes; I took her into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100084"></xptr>Q. Did she say any thing in the presence of the prisoner about the money? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the girl did not say any thing? - A. She might have laid something to the other officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say that Coleman gave the prisoner all the bad money? - A. She did not say so in the house, nor I did not hear her say so afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the girl say any thing of that sort any time in your hearing? - A. Yes, before the Magistrate, but she never said so before, nor at the time she was in custody, till she was before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. The girl and the woman were confined together? - A. No, we kept them separate; the girl was discharged on the second hearing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you took these two people into custody, you kept them separate, so as they could have no communication together? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And when they were brought before the Magistrate, the girl said the money was given to the woman by Coleman? - A. She did say so before the Magistrate, but not before.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the girl present when the prisoner said that Coleman gave her the money? - A. Yes, she heard the woman say that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. It was about two o'clock when you gave Coleman the marked money, and then he had the marked money in his possession before he got into the house where the woman was? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You searched him at the time you gave him the marked money? - A. I did not, I knew he had no other.</p>
               <p>Q. From that time till six o'clock he had an opportunity of doing what he pleased with it? - A. No, he was in our company constantly; he had no opportunity, we were watching him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow him to that house the first time he went? - A. Mr. Brown followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as he told you the trap was set, you jumped in and caught the mouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You never let him be out of your view, the first time, nor the second time? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are an officer of Shadwell; we have understood how Coleman was employed - you went into the house first? - A. I did; as soon as I went into the house, I saw Camel sitting in a chair; I immediately took hold of both her arms, the girl was then in the shop, almost close to the door; there was nobody else there then but the girl and Mrs. Camel; I saw that Mrs. Camel had a quantity of money in her apron; I took hold of her apron, and in it there was a hundred counterfeit sixpences; they were done up in paper, and in each paper there were twenty sixpences, and likewise there were forty-four counterfeit shillings in her apron; I searched each of her pockets, and found one other counterfeit shilling, with a quantity of good money, and among the rest I found the three marked shillings, part of the five that Rogers had given him in our presence; I knew they were the marked shillings from my own recollection; I picked them out from all the rest.</p>
               <p>Court. How much good money did you find in that pocket? - A. I cannot say exactly; I believe it was half a guinea, a seven-shilling piece, some silver and halfpence, to the amount of a pound or more; I immediately took my knife out of my pocket, and put a second mark on the three marked shillings, and I gave them to Mr. Rogers; I then asked Mrs. Camel how she came in possession of this counterfeited money found in her lap; she told me that she had picked it up in Whitechapel; I asked her how she came by the marked money; she said then that she had it from Coleman, pointing to the person of the name of Coleman; afterwards she said that she had it all from Coleman. I saw Oliver take from Coleman eight sixpences and two shillings, all counterfeited; I then saw Mr. Rogers take from 
               <persName id="t18050710-85-person814">Coleman</persName>
             the other two marked shillings; Coleman said that the counterfeit sixpences and shillings he had, he took of the prisoner; that was after the prisoner said she had all the money from Coleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner make any answer to that? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The prisoner told you she picked up the money in Whitechapel? - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of, you heard that distinctly? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When the woman said that she had it from Coleman, what was it that the girl said? - A. When I went in, the girl sat close to the shop-door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the shop, who was there with the girl? - A. There was nobody in the shop but the girl; the girl ran out of the house immediately when I took hold of Mrs. Camel.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you what she said? - A. She did not say any thing, but ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she taken at? - A. She came back afterwards, and another woman with the child; in about two or three minutes she were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say? - A. We did not ask her any questions.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not say, as the woman said, that she had it from Coleman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She never said that, to your knowledge, at any time, or any where? - A. Never, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the girl was taken into custody, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100085"></xptr>you did not ask her one single syllable? - A. We considered her as a child.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the examination before the Magistrate? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many examinations were there? - A. A. Two.</p>
               <p>Q. You attended upon both examinations as a witness - upon the oath you have taken, did not the girl say before the Magistrate that the woman had the money from Coleman? - A. She did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to say so when I asked you whether she said so at any time -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. She said the same as the woman said before the Magistrate - did she hear the woman alledge that she had it from Coleman? - A. Yes, before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. When the woman was taken, did the girl hear the woman say that she had it from Coleman? - A. No, the girl was out at the time; I produce the money.</p>
               <p>DANIEL OLIVER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were one of the officers on this occasion - have you any thing to produce? - A. I produce eight counterfeit sixpences and two counterfeit shillings, which I took in the prisoner's house from the left hand of Coleman, and a bad shilling I found in a chair, and a bad sixpence on the floor.</p>
               <p>- PARKER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Will you have the goodness to take these into your hand - these are the eight sixpences and the two shillings? - A. They are all counterfeit; they seem to be of the same manufactory, they have never been in circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will put in your hand the sixpence and the shilling which the last witness found on a chair and on the floor? - A. They are both counterfeits, they have got the mark of the blacking upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Now here are the 144 shillings and sixpences found in paper in the prisoner's apron? - A. They are all counterfeit, they have the mark of the blacking upon them, they have never been in circulation since they have been coloured.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Rogers.) Tell me whether those are the same three shillings, and the two that you delivered to Coleman? - A. They are the same marked shillings that I delivered to Coleman.</p>

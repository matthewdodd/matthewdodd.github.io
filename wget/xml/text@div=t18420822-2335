                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Smith, who is at sea—I live at No. 10, Walton-place, Ratcliffe—the prisoner lives within fourteen doors of me. On the 16th of July, about four o'clock, I saw her in School-house-lane, and finding she had quarrelled with her husband, I allowed her to sleep at my place, because she was afraid to go home—I said I would speak to her husband in the morning and make up matters—in the morning I went out to work, and left her in the kitchen with my children—I came back between four and five, and she was gone—I missed from the clothes'-basket, a frock which I had taken in to wash, and an apron and handkerchief next morning—they were safe in the kitchen before I took her in—I suspected her, as there had been nobody else there—I found her about half-past ten that night, rather tipsy—I asked her if she had got the ticket of the frock—she said she had not—I said, "It is no use denying it, you certainly have, there was no one else in the place"—she said, "No, I have not got the frock, it is safe for you"—I said, "You will get yourself into trouble, come with me, and get it"—when I got as far as Whitecross-street, she said, "Mrs. smith, I have lost the ticket"—I said, "Then come with me to the pawnbroker's, and give me satisfaction about the ticket"—I went with her, and she asked the pawnbroker if she had pawned it there—he said, "No"—I brought her home—she would not confess it then, but she afterwards said she had taken it, but not pawned it—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—and this handkerchief also—I have not got the apron.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. The prosecutrix gave the pri<lb></lb>soner into my custody for stealing the frock—she was very much in liquor—she said she knew nothing of it, she had not had it—when the charge was booked, she said she had not got the ticket, but the woman who had, was named Warden, in Harriss-court—I went after Warden, and she said she knew nothing of it—I have not brought her here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. Walters, pawn<lb></lb>brokers, in Waterloo-terrace, Commercial-road. I produce a frock and shawl pawned, to the best of my belief, by the prisoner, in the name of Ann Smith—I am almost certain of her—I gave a ticket for it—on Saturday about ten o'clock, the prisoner and prosecutrix came to the shop together—the prisoner said, "Did you take a robe in of me?"—I said, "No"—after they were gone, I thought I had a recollection of her features, and what made me recollect it was, I put "a child's gown" on the ticket, in<lb></lb>stead of a frock, and that is on the ticket now—when the prosecutrix brought her, the shop was full of people, and we were very busy—I after<lb></lb>wards felt certain it was her—I am almost certain the prisoner is the per<lb></lb>son—I cannot positively say.</p>

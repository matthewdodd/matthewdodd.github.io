I am assistant to Messrs Keed, drapers and hosiers, of Coventry-street, Leicester-square—on Friday, 4th August, between 11 and 12 o'clock, the prisoners came in together—Nantze said, "This gentleman." pointing to Klinger, "has just come from Germany and he wants some goods"—he called him a merchant—Klinger did not speak the slightest English, but Nantze, who spoke very good English, interpreted for him—they spoke together in a foreign language—Klinger selected twelve silk handkerchiefs and other property amounting to 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Nantze told me to sent them to 15A, Clifford-street, Bond-street, at 4 o'clock, when Klinger would be there and would pay, but they were then out on other business—I took the goods at a quarter to 4, and Nantze was at the door waiting—I went up to the sitting-room with him and remainted there till about 5 o'clock, when Nantze said, I will go for my dinner as my gentleman has not come in; I except he is dining at Verey's in Regent-street, and where he generally dines—I said "As he cannot speak English, it is no use my waiting, but I will leave the parcel downstairs with the servant"—he said, "Well, you can either leave it with the servant or here, he will not be here till 8 o'clock"—I left the parcel and returned at twenty minutes to 8, but did not dind the prisoners or the parcel, though I looked for it, as the servant showed me into the same room.</p>

From information I received, I went in plain clothes to New-court, Hill-street, Finsbury, on 5th August, between 2 and 3 o'clock—I knocked at the door and Klinger put his head out at the window—I asked him whether his name was Klinger he said, "Yes"—he spoke English and I could understand him—I told him I had a note for him, and he came down and opened the door and let me in—I then told him I was a policeman and was instructed to apprehend him for obtaining goods at Mr. Keed's in Coventry-street with another man who I imagined was in custody at the time—he said, "I gave the goods to the interpreter"—I asked him what kind of man that was; he said, "A man with a moustache and whiskers"—I asked him when; he said, "At 10 o'clock this morning"—I told him that the goods had been returned and it was impossible for him to have given them to him—he walked away with me, and I took him to Vine-street station in custody—I found in his coat-pocket a pair of braces, a neck-tie and a pair of kid-gloves, which have all been identified—next day, Sunday, I went to 9, Charlton-street, Whitechapel, and the landlady gave me a parcel containing three shirts, and some other articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I subsequently went to 8, Nassau-street Soho, and found the pair of gloves and neck-tie—I pulled this portmanteau from under the bed, and a quantity of bundles of fire-wood rolled from it—I have known the prisoners for the last twelve months, and have seen them together at various times—I knew Klinger when he lived in Queen-street; his wife is a laundress—this bill of Mr. Keed's (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found on Klinger.</p>

I am the wife of adolphus Nitsche, and live at 9, Chambers-street, Whitechapel—on Friday, 4th August, Klinger came to our house with a parcel of linen, washing—next day he asked me to lend him a carpet bag; he took it away and brought in back in a couple of hours with something in it—he took out what was in it and left the empty bag with me the things were his own, that he wanted to start on a journey with them—the second day he came with Nantze—he has been in England more thean a year.</p>
               <p>Nantze lodged in my house for eight weeks previous to the beginning of August—I belive I have seen Klinger visiting him, I cannot swear to him positively, but to the best of my belief he is the man—he was there about every dat—when the policeman came to my house I went up with him to Natze's room and unlocked the door—I saw the policeman pull the port<lb></lb>manteau from under the bed; I did not see the fire-wood pulled out—I saw some in the cupboard; it was not mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Cliffor-street, Bond-street—on Thursday, 3d August, I let a loadging to the prisoners, who called-Nantze acted as spokesman-Klinger did not speak at all in English-Nantze inquired if I had apartments to let—I said yes he told me he wished to engage a drawing-room and bed-room for the gentlemenwho was with him—I showed the apartments—they convered together in German for a short time—he said he was very much pleased with them but they were too expensive, but if I would let them at a reduced rate, in a hort time he expected his wife with a servent and child to join him, and then he would give the price we asked—I agreed to that but they did not decide then—they left and said they would call agin if they concluded to take them, which Nantze did—he said the gentleman had decided to take the apartments, that they were going to dine at Vereys and would come in about an hour—I did not see them then—Klinger came that night; I never saw any luggage—the servant let him in; I believe the brought a hat-box and a small parcel, but I did not see it myself—he took possession of the apartments—Nantze told me two or three times that the luggage was coming, that it would be there probably the following day and in order that I might know it was all right he wrote the name "Klinger"—Klinger slept there that night and had breakfast next morning, and during breakfast Nantaz came; they breakfast together—I never saw klinger afterwards; I do not know when he went out—I saw Nantze in the hall in the afternoon; he sent for me and asked if I would make him some present for bringing the gentlemen to my house-I declined to do so—I said it was rather premature.</p>

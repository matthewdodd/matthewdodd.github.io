                  </hi>. I am a clergyman, and one of the district secretaries of the British and Foreign Bible Society at Blackfriars—we have district associations connected with the parent association—the prisoner was in our employment in February last, as a conveyances for the society, and to do any work that I might set him to do—it was not his duty to receive money and bring it to me—he ought not to have gone to these persons at Barnes and received the money—I knew on the following Monday, when he gave in his report, that he had visited Barnes—I did not know that he had received any money—he never said a word to me on that or any other occasion about having received money from Miss Hutchings or Mr. Lavington—I did not know of his receiving 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Mr. Lavington before—his salary was 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week at first, and in December he had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the object of the society is to circulate bibles under cost price—we discharged the prisoner shortly after, on account of some other matters—that was on 22nd February—after that we lost sight of him entirely—we set the police in motion as soon as we could get a clue to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

Mr. Tiddy, one of the clergymen who left, acted in a very similar position as myself—I am doing his work now—I have visited Barnes—I did so before February last—the matters were in an unsatisfactory state—I did not request you to go down to Barnes and break up the depot, and bring up all the books and money—I daresay I sent you to Barnes, but not to get money.</p>

               <p>received from Mr. Lavington—I paid the prisoner's salary every Monday morning, and on his leaving, oil 22nd February, I paid him an extra week, at the request of Mr. Hewlett—he never said a word about the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at that time—in the March previous he accounted to me for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Lavington—he has been in the society some years.</p>

               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">HILL</hi>.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I went to Barnes, because I was directed by Mr. Hewlett.

                  </hi>. On 29th June last, I was unloading pigs at West Ham Park—I took my coat off and put it on the shafts of a van—I found it was gone about half an hour afterwards.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective</hi>). On the evening of the 29th June, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I saw the prisoner under the West Ham Park wall, trying to put a coat over his other coat, and close to where the coat was lost from—I met him on the 13th July in Stratford Broadway, and he was then wearing this coat—I asked him where he got it from, and he said he bought it three months ago in Petticoat Lane—I said "I do not believe that, I believe it was the coat that was stolen at West Ham Park, and you will have to go to the station while I make inquiry"—he said "I don't want to go to any station, I did not steal it"—I took him to the station and sent for Taylor and he identified the coat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I bought the coat in Petticoat Lane and wore it times and times. I have been in Stratford fifty-three years, and always carried myself respectable. That policeman knew me for years and never knew me in trouble. I did not know it was stolen, or else I should not have worn it.</p>

About two weeks ago Molloy had a gown put by until she could afford to pay for the whole. She came to pay 6 d. on the Friday; my young man took the 6 d. and gave it to me. Abrahams then wished to look at some print. They came in together. I shewed her a considerable quantity. After a long time she purchased a yard and a half; she gave 3 s. 6 d. for it. I was serving a customer at the top of the shop; my young man brought me the money. I had scarcely got the money in my hand, when a young man looked in the shop after the prisoners had gone out, and said, here is a woman has gone out that I believe has got something that does not belong to her. I and my young man followed the two prisoners, and when we came to Molloy, she had got a piece of Irish linen under her petticoats; she had got hold of the linen, one hand at one end and the other hand at the other end, underneath her petticoats. We took her back to the shop, and as soon as she came into the shop she dropped it. I sent for an officer, and had her taken into custody. She must have done it under cover of the other, or else we must have seen her take it out.</p>

             came in the shop, and said one of the prisoners, he believed, had got a piece of cloth. I immediately pursued the prisoners; I catched Molloy about thirty yards from the house. I brought her back, and as soon as she got into the shop she dropped the cloth.</p>

            . On Friday last, about three o'clock, I was going past Mr. Beech's shop. I saw the prisoner Molloy just as she came out of Mr. Beech's shop; she dropped the linen from underneath her petticoats. I suspected that she did not come honestly by it. I went into the shop, and informed Mr. Beech and his shopman of it. Mr. Beech and his shopman jumped over the counter, pursued the prisoners, and overtook them about thirty yards from the house. They were brought back into the shop, and in the shop Molloy dropped the cloth from underneath her petticoats. Mr. Beach then sent for a constable, and had them taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Molloy's Defence. I was going to Covent Garden market to get something for my throat. I met Biddy Abrahams; she said she was going to get a frock for her child. I never saw any thing of the linen until the man followed me and brought me back; then the piece of linen was lying down in the shop.</p>
               <p>Abraham's Defence. I met this woman; she told me she was going to pay something off her gown. I went then with her. I bought a frock. That is all I saw of the woman.</p>

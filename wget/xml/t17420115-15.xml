About ten the same Night we went from Pig's House with a Sack in order to break open this Shop; but being disappointed in that and some other Designs, we were not willing to go Home without something , and at last we agreed to have a couple of Sheep out of a Fold that we had gone past that Afternoon. Pig caught one and put it into the Sack , and I caught another and tied the Legs of it, and then we carried them both to Mr. Pig's House. The next Morning we stead the Sheep , and then I sent him out for some Bread and Beer, and when he came back again, he told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174201150011"></xptr> his Wife some Men were coming to search; upon which I put the Sheep into a little Closet; the Guts and the Skins I put into the Chimney, and cover'd them with a Rug, after which I walk'd out pretty leisurely, 'till I got some distance from the House, and then I began to run. I had not gone far before I met with Pig, and we agreed to cross the Thames, and make our Escape to East-Ham : Accordingly we went to one Will. Clement's at Shugg's-Hill , and after we had been there some time the Prisoner was taken.</p>

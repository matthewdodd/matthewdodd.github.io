             sworn. - I am a watchman; as I was calling the hour of four in the morning of the 7th of October, I heard a person call out, watch, come up stairs; it was in Crown-court, Broad-street, St. Giles's; I went up stairs and found the prisoner standing in one corner of the room; the prosecutor was in the room; I asked him what was the matter, and he told me, he had been robbed of one pound two shillings and seven pence; I asked the prisoner if she had any money, and she said she had only two shillings and seven-pence half-penny; he said, he could swear to one of the shillings, it was marked with an L and No. 4, he told me that before he looked at them; I then told the woman she must go to the watch-house; then she said, I have got half-a-crown more, but that is not his money; then I took her to the watch-house, and in searching her I found half-a-crown more upon her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It was my own market-money that I work very hard for. (The shilling produced, and deposed to by the Prosecutor.)</p>

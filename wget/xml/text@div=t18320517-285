No - I refused you, and you took it out of my apron; I told you to stop while I looked at the basket, and you were gone - I only put my foot on the shop-door to ask the price of a basket; you did not return to me next morning with the duplicate and part of the money - you first told me you had the caddy, and you took me a long way, and then said you had neither caddy nor money, but I might have your body, and I had you taken - you were not so intoxicated but you knew what you were about.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where were you taking it? A. I was taking it home; when I and my cousin bought it I owed a little money at a public-house, and I left it there - I saw the prisoner the next morning, when a man went and fetched him to me from his own house, and then he took me by the shoulder, and said he had the caddy - he gave the duplicate to the Policeman.</p>

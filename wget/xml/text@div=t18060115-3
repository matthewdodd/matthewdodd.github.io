            . From information I received on Friday the 13th of December, about two minutes before nine o'clock, I stopped the prisoner as my men were going to breakfast. [The prisoner worked for me about three weeks]. I told him there was some metal missing, I took the skirts of his coat up, and found both his pockets loaded, I knew it was metal by the weight of it. I asked the prisoner where the ingot piece was, he pointed to his stomach. I then sent for a constable, the constable came, he searched him, the piece of ingot was found near his stomach, the prince's metal was principally in his pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these pieces? - A. I set the value, 11 s. 6 d. they are worth more.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any metal from your master's premises? - A. Yes. On the 13th of December, about ten minutes after eight I missed it. I saw the prisoner searched, and the metal was found upon him, he had inside and outside pockets, which the metal was taken from, and some was taken from some part of his bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the metal which was taken from him was the metal that was missing from your master's premises? - A. Yes, it was what I cut off myself, I knew it to be my masters.</p>

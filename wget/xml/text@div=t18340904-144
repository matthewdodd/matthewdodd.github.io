               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. How many persons were with you when you first went to the Compasses? A. I went alone - I told them all to go home at first - I told the woman I was going to take her to the watch-house for being drunk - I do not remember any policeman being there, but Garnham, Wells, Drake, Bolton, and myself - only Drake was near me at the time the prisoner made use of the expressions I have mentioned - I dare say he might have heard - all the tustling was directed towards me - Drake had got hold of the prisoner - I dare say he must have heard the expression.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner engaged in cutting a cigar at the time you came up? A. Certainly not - he had not a knife in his hand when I came up - I saw both his hands at the time - he seized me by the collar with both hands - as he struck at me, I cut him over the wrist with my truncheon - I did not notice any mark of stabs on my truncheon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to the prisoner, "I will get you on the gallows, or place you in a dungeon all the days of your life for this job?" A. Never - I never used such language as that, nor any thing like it, that I am aware of - I said nothing about getting him into a dungeon during the affray or afterwards - I never used any such expression on any occasion - the cut is rather inside my finger - it was not done in my attempting to get the knife out of his hand - I never attempted to get the knife out of his hand - I saw him brandishing it about.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Which hand was cut? A. My left hand - my truncheon was in my right hand - the hand I had hold of him with was cut.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. How did you hold the prisoner? A. By the right lappel of his coat - the front of my finger was not inside his coat - I do not know whether his coat would cover it - I know it was cut in the affray - it was not cut outside - I cannot say how it was cut - in the first instance he had hold of me, but did not hold me above a second - he merely laid hold of me to try to shove me from him - he had not hold of me while I held his coat.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was your finger whole and sound when you put it to his breast to take hold of him, and was it wounded directly afterwards? A. It was - I showed my finger to the policeman - it was bleeding - the blood was running down all the way to the watch-house - McCaffrey is a common prostitute - I knew her to be so before, and knew them all to be bad characters.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On the first occasion when the prisoner got hold of the woman, when you seized her, did he seize you at all? A. No; he did not touch me - he let loose of the woman till I got her about thirty yards - they were close behind us as far as the Orange Theatre - that was the first thirty yards - he had not touched me between the time of my seizing her and getting there - Bolton came up at the Compasses before that - he told me to take the prisoner at the end of the second thirty yards - the prisoner kept eight or nine yards behind us during the second thirty yards - when I had her at the end of the second thirty yards she was kicking, swearing, and fighting - the prisoner was eight or ten yards from me when Bolton told me to take him - I do not think that he had been nearer than that after we first started; he was walking between his companions, at the time Bolton told me to take him - I do not recollect that he was saying any thing at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it be from your first taking the woman to your getting her the sixty yards? A. I should think twenty or twenty-five minutes - I heard them all talking as we came along the road - I cannot say what about - I had not seen them nearer than eight or ten yards during the second thirty yards - I should think we were not more than five minutes going the last thirty yards, during that time I cannot tell any thing the prisoner said.</p>

             (police-constable B 119). I was present on the night of the 6th of August - when I first came up I was directed by the sergeant to assist Grove in taking the prisoner into custody - he did not tell me what for - he was with the woman - Grove took hold of the prisoner, and said he must go with him to the watch-house - he said he should not - Grove said he must and should - he went a few steps - I then saw him take a knife out of his pocket - Grove said, "He is taking out a knife" - I saw him feeling in his waistcoat pocket - I heard the prisoner use some words, but I cannot tell what they were - I saw him feel towards his waistcoat pocket - Groves said, "He is getting his knife out" - I saw him thrust several times towards Grove's right hand - Grove said, "He is trying to stab me" - I then heard Grove say he was cut, and saw him strike the prisoner on the right hand, which the knife was in - he then passed the knife from the right hand to the left - I caught hold of his left hand, and tried to get the knife from him, but he held it so tight I could not - he then thrust his hand with mine into his trowsers pocket - he got both my hand and his own into his trowsers pocket - he then let go of the knife - it was shut at that time - I did not see that Grove was hurt till we got to the watch-house - I saw his finger bleeding very much, and saw it was severely cut - I saw the prisoner's waistcoat with some blood on it, and some on his hand - he then went to the water, and his hand was washed, and there was no wound on his hand - when he was taken into custody he said it was his own hand that was cut and not Grove's - I found it was not so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you not at the Compasses when Grove first went there? A. No - I did not hear the prisoner recommend the girl to go quietly - I came up at the corner of Ebury-square - the girl was going with two constables to the station-house - I did not put my hand to the prisoner's collar directly I came up to him - I did about a minute after - I was about two yards from him when he said something.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose he said, "I will knife you, or rip you up," do you not think you would have heard him? A. Not distinctly I should not - I am not deaf - I generally hear pretty well - I was about two yards distant.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You said you heard him say something, you cannot state what? A. I cannot distinctly state the words - I heard him say something.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040074"></xptr>COURT. Q. Did you see the left hand of Grove used at all? A. Grove had hold of him with the left hand - he held his staff in his right hand, and struck the prisoner with the truncheon in his right hand - I cannot say that he never left loose of the prisoner with his left hand - I saw the prisoner thrust with his right hand towards Grove's hand - Grove had not his truncheon out when the prisoner first thrust at him.</p>

             (police-serjeant B 10.) On the night of the 6th of August, at twelve o'clock, I was going along Queen-street - I heard a noise of loud talking - when I got to the end of the Compasses, I saw Grove and Garnham, a policeman, endeavouring to persuade the prisoner and three other men, and a girl, to go away - I asked them why they suffered them to make such a noise - they said they were endeavouring to get them away - the prisoner and the others heard this; they were close by - I myself persuaded them to go away - they refused to do so till they had had something to drink - we told them the house was closed and the people gone to bed, and it was no use to wait there; we could not suffer a noise in the street - the girl was quite tipsy - I directed the constable to take her into custody - the constable went to take her - the other men and the prisoner went and took hold of her - I went to them myself, and told them they had better leave go - four of them had hold of her, but the prisoner most distinctly had hold of her, and one of the others - I said they had better leave go, and the girl said, "Well, I will walk" - she walked about forty yards, the men following close behind us - she then threw herself down, and would not go any further - the two constables had hold of her at the time - the prisoner and the other three came round me, and said,"Do you mean to let her go?" - I said, "Certainly not, till she has been to the watch-house" - this was when she was kicking - they repeatedly said, "Do you mean to let her go?" - I took Grove's rattle out of his pocket, and sprang it, and a constable, named Wells, came up - the prisoner then shook his fist in my face, and said, "You b - , I will be down upon you; I will serve you out" - he was close to me at the time - Wells assisted Garnham and Grove to take the girl on to the watch-house - I followed immediately behind them, and the prisoner and his companions were about five or six yards behind me - I repeatedly told them to keep their distance, and go away, or I should certainly take them into custody - when I came to the corner of Ebury-square, I saw policeman Drake, and directed him to go with Grove, and take the man who had threatened me, into custody, who was immediately behind me - it was very dark there, and I expected every moment they would trounce upon us - Garnham and Wells went on with the girl, and I followed immediately afterwards - Grove and Drake turned round and took the prisoner from the other men immediately behind me - I thought they were coming quietly along - I immediately heard Grove cry out, "He is trying to stab me; he has got a knife" - he cried out that repeatedly, upon which I returned - I saw the prisoner with something in his hand, but could not discern what - I immediately went behind him, and hit his elbows with my truncheon, thinking to make him drop the knife, which Grove said he had got - Drake immediately called out, "I have got the knife" - I said, "Then bring him along to the watch-house" - and with great difficulty we got him there - I saw Grove's finger - there was blood on his hand - it appeared bleeding - the prisoner had blood on his hand - I asked how it came there - he said it was from a cut in his own hand - he washed his hand at the watch-house, and there was no cut on it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not you hear him say Grove had done it himself, by seizing hold of the knife? A. I heard him say so at Queen-square, but not in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Tell me on what charge you ordered your men to apprehend the prisoner? A. For being disorderly in the street, and endeavouring to rescue the girl McCaffrey in the first instance - she was apprehended for being tipsy and disorderly - the prisoner and the other men said they would not let her go - the prisoner put his hands on the woman, I suppose a minute, after they took her - he was not persuading her to go quietly at that time- when she said, "I will walk," he said, "That is right, walk quietly" - she then went on about forty yards, then threw herself down, and would not go further - the prisoner and three other men surrounded me, and said if we did not let her go, how he would serve me - he was within a yard of us then - it was immediately under a lamp - it was a dark night, but it was not so dark but that I could discern what passed - I was not in confusion at the time - I was as composed as I am now - I will swear it was not one of the other men - that is the man - I did not tell my men what charge to take the prisoner on - I only told them to take him because he had threatened me, and I expected he would trounce upon me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had they used any expressions as they went along? A. They had used different expressions - I cannot exactly say what - I did not overhear what the men said - they were talking of something as I took her along- I repeatedly requested them to keep off, and go away - they kept at the same distance, until they got to the square - they were near enough to pounce upon me in a moment- I did not tell Groves that the prisoner had threatened me at the time - I only told him to take him.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Marsham-street, Westminster. On the morning of the 7th of August, Grove came to me - he had a wound in the fore-finger of his left hand, in the inner part - (I think such a knife as this would make such a wound) - it has been under my care ever since - I should consider it was well now, but he has been very ill since that, independent of the wound, and not connected with that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This is a common cut, has it gone deeper than the skin? A. Certainly, it was about a quarter of an inch deeper - I should think it had no effect on his general constitution - it is not a grievous wound - he has had an attack of fever totally unconnected with that cut - such a cut would not take many days to heal with proper management - if I had seen it at first, I should have dressed it as it had been dressed at St. George's Hospital - it was not necessary to have many bandages - one would be enough - the man is not out of danger, but he is not in danger from the cut.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I suppose the cut was such an one as a schoolboy might give his finger with his penknife? A. I have seen many such cuts given and no harm come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040075"></xptr>of them - I have seen many cuts produce very serious consequences - I have seen cuts like that produce a lockedjaw; and less cuts than that, a very slight puncture.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Supposing a person had laid hold of a knife of that sort when open, with a view to wrest it from the hand of another, and slipped his hand along the blade, might that have done it? A. I should think not, as in that case more fingers than one would be wounded.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose in the hurry of a man attempting to seize an open knife from the hand of another, and the edge of the knife got in contact with the fore-finger, and, feeling himself cut, he withdrew it, might not that have done it? A. I should think it might - I never anticipated any danger from that cut - such cuts are very frequent.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Royal Hospital-row, and going towards Westminster, about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock - I left there with three more men, but no woman - McCaffrey came up and said, "Will you go and have some gin?" - I said, "We are going to the Compasses, and can have some" - I went to the door of the Compasses and knocked - the landlord came out and served me with three quarterns of gin, and shut the door - while I had the gin, Grove came up and said, "Be off, or else I will take you to the watch-house." I said, "I must not go till I have returned the measure and glass, or I shall be taken for felony" - I knocked at the door, and the landlord came out and received the measure - Grove returned in a few minutes, and pushed the girl into the road - she said something to him - the serjeant of the police came up and said, "Take her to the watch-house, drag her away" - I said, "The girl has done nothing; if you will let her go, she is drunk, I will see her home" - he said, "I will not" - I saw her kick one of the men - I said, "Go quietly" - she got up and walked away - I was going that way, and went on - they turned up a street to go towards the watch-house- I went on about twenty yards, and three policemen came running after us - the policeman turned round before us, and said, "That is the man" - I had part of a cigar which a man gave me, in my hand, cutting it up with a knife, instead of tobacco - they turned short round - No. 119 was the first man that had hold of my collar - he was on this side, and Grove in front - the serjeant said, "This is the man" - Grove seized me by the collar, and said, "He has got a knife!" and, as it was in my hand, he seized the knife, and I seized his hand with my left hand, and wrenched three of his fingers from the knife, and with his pulling the knife he cut himself - if I was going to die to-morrow, I would say the same on the scaffold.</p>

            . I am a cabman, and live in Castle-lane - I was present at the beginning of this disturbance - I saw the woman McCaffrey - she might be the worse for a glass or two of liquor - we were having some gin at the Compasses - we knocked at the door, the landlord said we could not come in, but should have the gin outside, and we had three half quarterns of gin outside - the policeman came up afterwards, and said, "Go away" - we said, "We are having some gin, stop till we get the measure in," and we gave the measure - they took the female to go to the watch-house - she made a little resistance - they said they would drag her - we asked them not to drag her, and she would go quietly - another man gave the prisoner a cigar to put in his pipe, as he had no tobacco - we turned round a street - the prisoner was cutting up a cigar with a knife as we went along - I saw the policeman lay hold of him - I was on one side of him - they came up and said, "This is the man we want" - they did not endeavour to get any thing from him in my presence - I did not hear him use any bad expressions to the policeman - I went home.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you drive a cab now? A. No - I have not been in regular service for three or four weeks - I drove No. 343 - I was in service then - I have been out of service about five weeks, I dare say - I was with Mr. Hutchinson - this was a little after twelve o'clock - I was holiday making, and was in company with the prisoner the best part of the night, and with the girl McCaffrey - I got a few glasses of gin with her and the prisoner - we went to this public-house to get something to drink - I saw the girl taken into custody - I advised her to go home - she made a little resistance going along.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of you take hold of her and endeavour to get her away from the officer? A. No, she threw herself down on the ground, and they carried her - I was standing alongside.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you go along with the officers? A. It was in my way home - I do not know where the prisoner lived - I was quite close to the officers while they were taking the girl along, so as to see any thing that was done, and hear all that was said - George Stirrup gave the prisoner the cigar - he is a coachman - the prisoner asked the policeman to let the girl go - we said nothing about serving them out - I heard no offensive expressions - I think it was after the girl threw herself on the ground that the cigar was given, and the knife taken out to cut it - he took the knife out of his pocket, I believe - I did not notice where he took it from - I did not know there was any charge till next morning - I went away, as I thought they would take us all.</p>

            . I am a smith, and live at No. 27, Castle-lane, Westminster - I was in the prisoner's company on the night the disturbance took place - we went to the Compasses, and had six pennyworth of gin, which the prisoner paid for - I saw a knife in his hand - he was cutting up a bit of cigar that I gave him - he asked me for a bit of tobacco - I had none, and gave him a bit of a cigar to cut up - the policemen were about twenty yards from him at the time he had the knife in his hand cutting the cigar - when the policeman came up to him, he had the knife open in his hand cutting the cigar.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where was it you gave him the cigar? A. Just after we left the Compasses, not before the disturbance - the girl was going home - the policeman caught hold of her, and was going to take her to the watch-house - the prisoner and I persuaded them to let her go home quietly, and she kicked up no more disturbance - they took her to the watch-house; and directly we got a few yards, we were walking arm in arm, the policeman came and took the prisoner out of our arms - he was in between us - I did not go to the watch-house - they had a bit of a scuffle, I believe - directly I saw him going to the watch-house, I walked home - three or four policemen were going to take him - I could not see what took place - I think four policemen were at him - I think there were six policemen in all - I cannot swear that; there were two taking away the girl,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040076"></xptr>and three or four taking the prisoner - the girl was not sober nor quite drunk - she was a little the worse for liquor - I had been with her I suppose half an hour - I was in company with Beer and her that evening - I had been with Beer all the evening at Fulham - we met the prisoner as we came from Fulham - we met the girl in Jews-road, Chelsea, and came together to the Compasses - I had nothing to drink with her before I got to the Compasses.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing like an attempt to get the girl from the policeman's hands? A. No; we persuaded the policeman to let her go - we did not lay hold of her - we persuaded her to walk quietly - we were standing close by her when she threw herself on the ground and kicked - we were together standing close by the side of the policeman - I gave the prisoner the piece of cigar directly we left the Compasses - before the girl was in custody, he took out his knife and began cutting it - I did not see any attempt of the policeman to strike him with his truncheon.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had the Compasses been shut up when the policeman came? A. The door was shut, and the landlord gave us the liquor outside.</p>

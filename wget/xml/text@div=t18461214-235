                  </hi>. I live near Uxbridge. I had received two half-crowns on the 5th of Dec.—I was walking with them in my hand—I dropped one—a man named Bailey picked it up, and pitched it to the prisoner—he rubbed it in bis hand—I asked him for it—he said that would do for half-a-pint in the afternoon—I said I would go and tell my father—I went back, and the prisoner was gone—I went to his house for it—he said he had not got it, he had dropped it again—I am sure he went away with it.</p>

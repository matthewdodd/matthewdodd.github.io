             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am an Excise-officer: On the 25th of September I was stationed near Ashford, in the county of Kent; I know the prisoner perfectly well, and he knew me. On the 23d of September, 1795, in consequence of an information I had received, I went to <placeName id="t17980418-78-crimeloc407">Newchurch in Kent</placeName>

               <p>Q. What sort of bags were they? - A.Bags about forty pounds weight, the usual bags that are used by smugglers in conveying tobacco. When I rode up, Hayward told me that Hart was taking the reins from the shaft horse; I immediately rode round to prevent him from so doing; a scussle then ensued between us, in which I threw Hart into the hedge; he then sprung from the hedge, and caught me by the collar of the coat, drove me from the horse, and called Waddell to his assistance, and they both fell upon me, and beat me with their sifts; Hart sat upon me, and got his hand twisted in my neck-handkerchief; in that situation I remained insensible, and on recovering myself, I found Hart sitting upon me, with a large drawn knife, he swore that the goods and horses were not given up, and he would murder me. Waddell<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180074"></xptr>came back some time after, with the cart and horses, and they went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any fire-arms used? - A.Hayward said he had discharged his pistol, but that was while I was insensible.</p>
               <p>Q. What rendered you insensible? - A. He strangled him by the neck-handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the treatment you had received, were you at all ill? - A. I was not able to do my business for a month; I went to a public-house, and called the people up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you not frequently seen him since? - A.Once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. So that he has not been out of the way? - A. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. He made no resistance, till you made an attack upon him? - A. I made an attack to prevent his unharnessing the horse from the cart, and he held a stick to keep me off.</p>
               <p>Q. You were armed, I believe, with a cutlass? - A. Yes, and pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no arms? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have seen him since - have you seen him in such a situation as that you dared to take him? - A. One of the times we went to his house to take him, and he went away.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am an Excise-officer: I was with Mr. Walton on the night of the 25th of September, 1795; I knew the prisoner before, and he knew me; I staid in the field with the horses; Mr. Walton laid under the hedge, to watch the cart coming; Mr. Walton came to me, and told me the cart was gone by; we went after it; Mr. Walton went behind, and called to me, seize the horses and the cart, for it is loaded with tobacco; I seized it, and Hart was endeavouring to unharness the horse; I called to Mr. Walton, and almost directly Mr. Walton called out for help; I went up, and Waddell and Hart were both upon him; I told them if they did not leave off, I should be under the necessity of firing upon them; Hart said, d-n your eyes and limbs, fire and be d-d, for we have fire-arms as well as you; I then fired, and shot Hart in the hip; upon that Waddell came up to me with a pistol, and snapped it at me; he had a cutlass, which I supposed was taken from Mr. Walton; he said, d-n your eyes, we will soon settle you. Finding we could not do any thing, we gave it up.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards called out to Mr. Walton? - A. Yes, several times, but he did not answer; I thought he had been dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. At the time you were almost overpowered, Hart was not with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Walton strike him with a cutlass? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You fired at Hart, and hit him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very near him, were not you? - A.It is very little distance from him.</p>

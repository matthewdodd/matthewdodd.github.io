            . I am servant to Mr. Wheeler: about nine o'clock he sent me out, and as I returned I saw a light in the back attic, and the window half open- I came in and told master; I went up stairs before him and the servant girl before me - when I got up I saw the room very much disordered; I went down stairs and got a gun, then went out on the roof, but could see nobody - I returned and went back to Petersburgh-place, as I knew the persons must come down through the empty house, and come over the wall; I saw the figure of a man inside the carcass of the house - a person came on the wall, about ten yards from me, and stood looking, as if watching for an opportunity to come over; he seemed to be going back again, and I called out, that if he stirred, I would shoot him, but he went - a man came up with a lantern, and I went into the empty house, and found the prisoner concealed in the cellar of the second house from my master's; he had nothing on his head, and he asked for his cap in the watch-house - he claimed the cap which I found in the back attic of master's house; there was a cravat, marked G. W. in it - I found a phosphorus-box in the front attic, and also a small turn-screw; I found a hat a few yards from him.</p>

               <p>MR. WHEELER. I have brought the property here - this is the bundle, it was packed up just as it is now; many other articles had been moved from their places. -When the prisoner was taken, this hat was within a few yards of him - it belongs to me; he had taken it instead of his cap: this counterpane is mine, and I can swear positively to all the things - this is the cap he claimed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The cap does not belong to me; I know nothing about the matter. I was going home about half-past eight o'clock that evening: I live two hundred yards from the spot - I jumped over the wall to ease myself: I heard a rattle spring just as I got over, and saw the hat in the yard - I had a paper cap on; I picked up this hat and threw it into the back wash-house- the man came and took me out: Mr. Wheeler came to the watch-house about an hour after with the things, and said it would be better for me to tell him all about it, and he would make it go easy; I had been drinking all the afternoon, and he made me confess being there (which was false) in hopes it would be better for me.</p>

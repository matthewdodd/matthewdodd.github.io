                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police sergeant. K</hi>). On 25th March I went to the prisoners lodgings, 50, Hasenby Square, Lyndhurst Road—I saw the female prisoner and said to her, "I shall take you in custody for passing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188004260081"></xptr>
               <p>a cheque upon Mr. Munro, a grocer at Forest Gate"—the male prisoner replied, "Have you a warrant?"—I said; "Yes"—he said, "Read it"—I read it—he said, "I never passed any of the cheques. This is the spite of the solicitor over not getting his money in the last case, of the girl that is now in prison. Are you going to take me?"—I said, "No, I have nothing to do with you"—he said, "Then I will go and see Mr. Armstrong"—I took the female to West Ham Police-station, and from there to Peckham Bye railway-station—there Mr. Walker recognised her as she was coming out of the waiting-room—he said, "That is the woman that passed a cheque on me"—I had not seen Mr. Walker before that—I searched her the next morning—I found this letter, addressed to Mr. W. F. Smeeton from Mr. Roberts, in a box in the male prisoner's pre<lb></lb>sence—Mr. Roberts's bill of costs was with it—I asked him what it was—he said it was costs incurred in consequence of the girl that was in prison—I also found a newspaper, the account of the trial, in the box.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Viney went with me—I do not know whether he was there when Walker came up—he was with me when I arrested the woman, then he went away, and I saw him again at Peckham Rye Station—she had a baby in her arms when she came out of the waiting-room—I have not been asked before about the conversation—I have been in the force 12 years.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector K</hi>). I arrested the male prisoner on 3rd April, outside the Court at Ilford—I said, "You will be charged with a woman who has given the name of Edith in changing a cheque for the payment of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and defrauding Mr. Munro, of Forest Gate"—he said, "You have made a mistake"—afterwards, when the charge was read over to him, he made no reply.</p>

                  </hi>. I have made handwriting my study for 25 years—the signatures to these cheques are in the same handwriting; also the endorsements; I have compared them with the order for the cheque-book, and believe them to be in the same writing. (H. G. Sadgrove here stated the cheque were the prisoner's writing.) These letters are in the same writing and more natural—the other is a manufactured hand, and devoid of characteristic, or nearly so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Superficially, no one would think the cheques were in the same writing—one of the signatures on the cheques diners from the others, but that does not raise a doubt in my mind—I have nine pages of letters here to compare it with—they are press copies, which are as good as original except for the defects in copying—I may have made mistakes in my evidence before, and juries have decided against me—in some cases the verdict did not rest only on my evidence.</p>

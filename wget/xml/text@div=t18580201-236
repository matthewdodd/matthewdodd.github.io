                  </hi>. I am a whip maker, at No. 2, Hackney Road. On 15th Dec. a person, who I believe was the priconer, came and asked for a whip, which he pointed out—I told him the price was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he asked to look at a better one, which he did, but at last he took the one he had first seen—he gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece; I laid it in the drawer—there was no other 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece there—in about two hours, I looked at the crown piece; there was then no other in the drawer—I found, on comparing it with other silver, that it was bad—I gave it to Stocker about three hours after I took it.</p>

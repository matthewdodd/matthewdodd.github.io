               <p>Last Tuesday morning, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them), in the house of

               <p>Did you sleep there? - For three or four hours.</p>

               <p>Had you frequented the house before? - No. I was walking through Cross-lane, a little in liquor.

             accosted me, and took me to Sheers's house. Pearce was there in bed. I went into bed to her; and Smith lay in the room, on the floor. I had taken off my coat and waistcoat, but my breeches I kept on. I had been there two hours (I believe it might be between five and six), when I heard a noise in some part of the room. It waked me. I put my hand to my fob, and missed my watch. I jumped out of bed, and pursued Pearce. I had felt her hand upon my fob before; but the string was twisted round in such a manner, that it was impossible to get it out without getting something to cut the string: I am sure it would have taken me five minutes to have undone it myself.</p>

               <p>Did you say nothing to her when you found her pulling at your watch? - I just gave her a bit of a push, and told her to be quiet, and went to sleep. It was between five and six when I got up.</p>

               <p>How long might that be after you found her pulling at your watch? - It might be half an hour. I waked some little time before, and rose up in the bed; and there was no one in the room but Pearce. I ran down to the street-door: it rained hard: I could not go out without shoes. I believe she had concealed herself in the house; and while I was returning for my shoes, I believe it was, she made her escape to the next house. I gave an officer a description of the person of Pearce.</p>

               <p>Pearce. He left his watch because he had no money.</p>

               <p>Is that so? - No. I was afraid of it; for that reason I wound it round, as I observed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178107110131"></xptr> before. I had 5 s. in silver. I put that out of my breeches pocket into my fob; but that was gone with the watch. My waistcoat was gone, and an handkerchief taken out of my coat; and they took a couple of keys that were in my waistcoat pocket, and put them into my coat pocket.</p>

             sworn.</p>

               <p>I am an officer. I took this watch upon Pearce, in the apartment of 
               <persName id="t17810711-41-person615">
                  Jane
                   Dawson
               <interp inst="t17810711-41-person615" type="surname" value="Dawson"></interp>

            . The prosecutor described the watch very particularly, and said his name was upon the dial-plate: and also, upon searching Dawson, I found a silver seal, which the young man described, with B. P. upon it. She was in the same apartment with Pearce. He likewise lost a key and a pen-knife. I took the prisoners both up. Going along, Dawson said the waistcoat was pawned at Mr. Lynn's.</p>

               <p>Did you tell her it would be better for her to tell you? - I did.</p>

               <p>Court. I wonder that you, an officer, did not know better than to draw a woman into such a confession.</p>

               <p>(The watch produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>To Prosecutor. Have you ever been in this house before? - I believe I have once.</p>

               <p>What do you know of 
               <persName id="t17810711-41-person616">

            ? - When I lost my property, I made enquiry after it; and I went to the man. He said he was landlord of that house.</p>

               <p>Do not mention what he told you - You knew nothing of him before? - No.</p>

               <p>PEARCE's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>That gentleman came home with this girl. He told me he had no money; he would give me 5 s. in the morning, and would leave me his watch till he got 5 s. There was another young man with him. I took the watch, and put it by till morning. He made a sad noise in the morning about it. I said, If he gave me the money he had promised me, he should have it. He gave me his waistcoat and his handkerchief, to pawn for 5 s. I sent that woman's child with them. They got 5 s. upon them. When I got the 5 s. I said, if he would come up to my apartment for the watch, he should have it. Then Mr. Mitcham came up, and said, if I would give the gentleman the watch, he would give me half-a-guinea. He gave me half-a-guinea into my hand, and then brought another constable to search me for the half-guinea.</p>

               <p>To Mitcham. Did you give her half-a-guinea? - The young man promised her half-a-guinea, if she would tell where the watch was. She would give no account of it. I saw her run up to look under the bed, and I took the watch out of her hand immediately.</p>

               <p>(There being no evidence given to affect Smith and Dawson, they were not put upon their defence.)</p>

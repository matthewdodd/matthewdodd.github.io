On Sunday evening, the 11th of March, about seven o'clock, I was sitting in the parlour, with my daughters, and heard the alarum bell of the work-shop (which is at the top of the house) ring - I ran out, and found the staple drawn from the shop-window; it was safe at four o'clock, when I attached the alarum to the window - it goes on hinges, and had been wrenched open by a chissel. I put the light out into the gutter, but it was dark, and rained; I could see nobody - I found the prisoners at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Do not you know your house is in the parish of St. James? A. No; it is in St. John's.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was a wet night; were there any marks to indicate whether the party had actually got in at the window? A. No; I do not think they had entered.</p>

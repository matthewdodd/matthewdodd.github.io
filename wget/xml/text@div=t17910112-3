               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. Did you see the women come into the shop, or either of them? - I saw both come in, and both went to the counter.</p>
               <p>Did one stay behind, towards the door, while the other came up to the counter? - The prisoner stood rather behind, at a little distance.</p>
               <p>How far? - I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Guess a little. - About a yard.</p>
               <p>The other woman was the only person that asked about any cotton at all? - Yes.</p>


               <p>Court. Then this woman did not stand close to the counter? - Yes, they were both close to the counter, but one lower than the other.</p>

               <p>Court. Could you observe whether they took any thing? - No, Sir, I could not, though I was watching them; I did not see them take any thing; it was merely my suspicions of the woman.</p>
               <p>Had you no conversation with any woman, about that time, in Holborn? - Not the least.</p>
               <p>Then of course you could not have any conversation with the other woman that you described to be with the prisoner? - No, Sir, certainly not.</p>
               <p>Recollect? - I do, Sir.</p>
               <p>So, seeing the prisoner, whom you thought to be an improper woman, you let her go in the shop? - I did so.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect speaking to any woman, and saying, that if there were twenty in company, you would take her, and have forty pounds on each person that you took? - I have no recollection of that, in the least.</p>
               <p>Did you say that? - No, Sir, I do not remember it; I did not.</p>
               <p>Do you remember saying any thing to that effect? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you talk about a pretty woman in the Stormont gown? - No, not in the least.</p>
               <p>You did not say before the magistrate, any thing I have stated to you? - No, Sir, not in the least.</p>

               <p>You are sure you did not? - I am positive of it, Sir.</p>
               <p>How many people were present when this woman was examined at the magistrate's? - There were a number of people? - I saw the prisoner have a muff when she came out.</p>
               <p>So that if you had happened to say any thing of that sort, they must have heard it? - They must.</p>

               <p>Do you mean to swear to this by the pattern? - No, Sir; by my own private mark with a red pencil, towards the middle.</p>

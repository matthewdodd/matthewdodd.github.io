On the 10th of July the shirt was taken from a line at the first floor window, it was hanging there to dry. Immediately I heard a noise in the street I went to the door and missed my shirt, and then I heard the prisoner's door go. The prisoner lived next door to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this line hanging across the street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it not fall off - A. I cannot say; there were some few trifling things hanging there; it hung low, he might jump up and take it off with his hand; every thing else remain on the line.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 11th of July, in the morning. Lee told me of the loss of his shirt; I went to the prisoner's lodgings, I saw him come out and go into Carpenter-street, I called to him and asked him if he had not got this man's shirt about him; he said no, he had not; I told him I thought he had, and I would take him back to his lodgings and see if I could not find it; he said. I was welcome to search. I thought his hat did not set so well as it should, I took his hat off, and I found the shirt in his hat.</p>

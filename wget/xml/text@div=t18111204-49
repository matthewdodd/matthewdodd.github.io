On the 8th of May, in the evening, I went to the sign of the Three Compasses in Shadwell market, the lease of which was to be disposed of, I wanted the house for a brother and sister of mine who lived at Ipswich. The time I went to the house was about a quarter after seven in the evening, I stopped there about an hour and a quarter, in the course of that time I drank four glasses of cold brandy and water. After that I left the house and was returning to my own house. After I got out in the air I found I was intoxicated, I proceeded up Ratcliffe Highway and got into the entrance of <placeName id="t18111204-49-crimeloc276">Parsons-street</placeName>

I asked him what he did that for, and called him a d - d dirty fellow for so doing. I asked him who he was, said he, if your sister was here I would give her a swishing; I asked him how old he was to talk about such things; he answered, between fifteen and sixteen, and said he was just returned from the West Indies, where he had seen plenty of that. I asked him the way to Well-street, conceiving that when I got there I should know the way home; the prisoner said he would shew me the way He took me up a street which I have since found to be Neptune-street, when I got to the top of Neptune-street I had some faint recollection that I was in Wellclose square. He walked me part of the round of the square, and we came into North-East passage, when I said to the prisoner this cannot be my way; he said, come along, we shall soon be there. We then came to Pell-street, he there gave a whistle which greatly alarmed me, I set off running, I turned my head round and heard the feet of two or three persons, and a voice calling out stop him; I proceeded on when I was taken hold of by a man who held me until the prisoner and Norton came up, they informed the man that I wanted to commit an unnatural crime on the prisoner; I asserted my innocence to the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you a married man - A. I am, I have a wife and four children. I asserted my innocence; the man said he was an officer of the night and he was going to the watchhouse. He took me to the watchhouse. Before we got to the watch-house I requested him to send for a near neighbour there, but they took no notice of that. When we got into the watchhouse the beadle was in the watchhouse with two women, when the man who had taken me in custody told the beadle he had got a serious charge the women were ordered to withdraw. The prisoner then stated to the beadle the charge that he had against me. I asserted my innocence. The beadle said it was a most shocking thing, but he must take the charge. By this time there were four or five men collected in the watchhouse, besides the beadle, the names of the prisoner and Norton were written down by somebody, I gave them my address and name, and begged them not to take the charge of me, as I was innocent; the beadle said he must take the charge. The beadle put his two hands into my waistcoat pockets, and said he must search me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Give us the beadle's name - A. Lancaster.</p>
               <p>COURT. It is very fit it should be known.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I told him not to search my pockets,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040036"></xptr>I would shew him all that I had got; when I took out of my small clothes pocket a five pound note and three one's, I gave them into the beadles hands and told him he might do what he pleased with it; I told them they were welcome to that little money; Lancaster the beadle said, I see you are well lined; I said I was a man of some little property; he then made some little arrangement among the officers in the watchhouse, as well as with the prisoner and Norton, they were called out of the watchhouse at different times. Lancaster came into the watchhouse and told me that he had settled it with the prisoner and Norton, and they were gone. I saw no more of them in the watchhouse. Lancaster returned to me three pounds, the other five pound was kept back. I was suffered to go at last. I had not proceeded from the watchhouse above ten or a dozen yards when I was again accosted by the prisoner and Norton, who said, that as they only received one pound each out of the five pounds that I had given to Lancaster, they demanded the three pounds that I had received back from Lancaster, or that they would come down to my house and expose my character, and see further into the business, when I, through fear of such an accusation, gave them the three pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What age boy was Norton - A. He might be about nineteen. They left me, and I proceeded home.</p>
               <p>Q. They demanded three pounds of you, and you gave it them - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath what was the occasion of that -</p>
               <p>COURT. He has said that, he has explained himself in the most distinct way; - when I, through fear of this accusation, gave them the three pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Do you mean to tell the jury that you did not know the way home - A. I did know my way, but being intoxicated, and being in the dark street, I asked my way.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not that you did not know the way, but you were overcome with liquor, that was the reason you enquired the way - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have given my learned friend some account of the boy's indecency you have a perfect recollection of what he said to you and you to him the very words you recollect - A. I cannot recollect every word.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to trust yourself with such an indecent character you had chided him for his indecency - A. I said, pray which is my way to Well-street; I do not know that. I asked him individually. I did not ask him to guide me, only the way to Well-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Lancaster was the person who proposed to make it up - A. It was among themselves, not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the boys in the watchhouse say that they was dissatisfied and that they would not have the money - A. Never in my hearing, nothing passed of settling the business in the watchhouse; they were called out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Jones say that he would not make it up but that he would prosecute - A. Never in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. When they they came up to you at this distance of ten or twelve yards you were within the reach of the watchhouse why did not you go back - A. Because I was under such dread and confusion at the time I wanted to get home, and to hear no more of the business whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. When you parted with the money you did not part with it under any personal fear upon you - A. When they came up to me I parted with the money to get rid of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Were you under any personal fear at the time - A. I apprehended no personal danger; I was in great dread; I was afraid of injury to my character.</p>

               <p>Q. When the charge was made by the boy what said Mr. Cole to him - A. Mr. Cole seemed very much frightened and agitated, he begged for God's sake that we would settle matters; he said, for God's sake do not give charge of me, I am a man having a family.</p>
               <p>COURT. He said that - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his saying any thing about mercy - A. I do; he said have mercy on me, I am a man having a family, and do not wish to be exposed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, at any time while you were in the watch-house say there was no truth in the charge that the boy made against him - A. I never heard such a word. He said he would give any money so that it might not come to be known, or something like that. Them are the words as near as possible. Figgens can give better evidence than I can, he knows more about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of Mr. Cole saying the charge was false - A. I never heard such a word.</p>

            , Q. Were you present when the prosecutor was brought to the watch-house in last May. - A. Yes, I am a watchman. The beadle asked the boy what charge he had against the prosecutor, the boy said, he was coming down White Lion Street, the prosecutor seemed very familiar with him, and that as he came along he used very indecent touches.</p>
               <p>Court. And used very indecent actions. - A. So far that he pulled out his own nakedness and put it in the boy's hand untill they came to the corner of Pell Street. Mr. Cole begged for mercy and asked the beadle whether he would not mitigate the matter to settle it between him and the boy, he did not wish it to be spoken of, be went down on his knees and implored them as he had a wife and four children.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you speaking correct. - A. Those are the very words to the best of my knowledge. Mr. Lancaster asked the boy if he wished to persevere in it, he said not, but he wished to have an acknowledgment of Mr. Cole, whether he was guilty or not. He asked the prosecutor if he would make the boy a recompence.</p>
               <p>Q. Who asked. - A. I cannot say whether it was Lancaster the beadle, or one Tindall a carman that was there, he said it was the least that he could give the boy five pound, Mr. Cole pulled out a handfull of notes and gave one, and said he was very much obliged to Mr. Lancaster, he gave a note, what the contents of it was I cannot say. The boy Jones insisted upon his making an acknowledgement whether he was guilty or no, he said that he had done amiss, he was very sorry for it, he hoped it would be a warning to him for ever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Attend to me first, let me know who you are. - A. I am a watchman in St. George's parish.</p>
               <p>Q. You are an Irishman, are not you. - A. Yes, I live in Pell Street, and I work in the London Docks, I have a wife and four children.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in the watch-house when the charge was given. - A. It was opposite of our door, I accompanied them down to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Lancaster you say was there, who else - A. One Tindall a carman.</p>
               <p>Q. You said the man fell down on his knees, Lancaster is not blind, is he, I suppose he must have seen it. - A. I suppose he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he deaf. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him. - A. A twelvemonth, I never knew him deaf.</p>
               <p>Q. He can hear as well as you. - A. I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said the prosecutor said he had done wrong, he was sorry for it, must not Lancaster have heard that as well as you, if he was standing by. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You said the prosecutor fell down on his knees, said, Lord have mercy, he had a wife and four children begged for mercy, and acknowledged himself guilty. - A. No, he did not acknowledge himself guilty until after the boy had the money.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had paid the money, when there was no occasion, he said he was guilty. Did not the boy go out of doors, to negotiate with Lancaster. - A. Upon my oath I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What share had the boys. - A. A pound each, I cannot say whether it was Tindall or Lancaster that gave it them.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath did not you partake of the five-pound note. - A. No. I will give this information, I did not think it prudent to stop in the watch-house, I stopped long enough to hear the cause, I understood after a day or two my wife went up to Mr. Mills, he gave her ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in point of fact you had ten shillings of the plunder. - A. No otherwise than my wife got ten shillings of Mr. Mills.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner receive a one-pound note. - A. Yes, I saw the one-pound note paid in the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you in the watchhouse see him paid a one-pound note. - A. I know that Tindall or Lancaster said we must give the boys a one-pound note each.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it given in the watchhouse. - A. Positively I cannot say that. I know that I saw the boys had a one-pound note each, I know that I saw it with the boys at the watchhouse; whether it was given outside of the door, I cannot recollect well to say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I ask you upon the oath you have taken, did the prosecutor fall upon his knees in the watch-house and confess himself guilty. - A. Upon my oath he fell upon his knees, and confessed that he had done wrong, and said he was sorry for it, and he know'd that he had done wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Lancaster put his hands into the prosecutor's waistcoat pocket. - A. No, I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Prosecutor.) Is the account that that man has given true or false. - A. False.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you confess that you were guilty. - A. I did not, nor did I implore for mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not true that Lancaster put his two hands into your waistcoat pockets. - A. It is true.</p>

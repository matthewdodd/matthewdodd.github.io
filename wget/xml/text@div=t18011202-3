Hopkins and Gray, in Change-alley; I said, he was stranger to me and I to him, but that it was customary, when people looked out goods, if they did not pay for them, to leave some deposit, and asked him if he would leave me a guinea; he said, he had no objection, and felt in his pocket, but said he had not got any small change; and at last concluded that he would leave me this bill, which he did, and I took care of it form that time to this; he was to call again, but I did not see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020005"></xptr>him till about ten days after at Bow-street, when I was bound over to prosecute.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What business do you carry on? - A. A slopseller.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your partner's name? - A. I have none.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the goods come to? - 
               <persName id="t18011202-3-person66">A. </persName>
            Nine pounds eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. He produced you a bill? - A. Yes.</p>

                  <persName id="t18011202-3-person67">Q. </persName>
            This is not-the bill? - A. Yes, it is; he gave me a bill, which I returned, and he put it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether that he took out the second time is the same bill which he took out at first, you cannot undertake to say? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. When he produced a bill the second time, that he deposited with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he left that with you for the purpose of enquiring as to the validity of it? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not give him any thing for it? - A. No; he said he would leave it with me while he went and got change.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18011202-3-person68">Q. </persName>
            Until he went and got change to pay for the goods? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it he proposed to return with the money? - A. That evening, or the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. He was taken the next day, I believe? - A. That was the 9th; he was taken the 11th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you to make every enquiry whether it was good or not? - A. No, I don't recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the bill purport to be endorsed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the rest I see the names of Hopkins and Gray? - A. Yes, but they are not here.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he shew you this bill the first time? - A. To the best of my knowledge, but I cannot say; it was addressed to Sir James Esdaile that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mark any thing on it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Whether the bill you saw the first time was of the same amount as the second? - A. I believe it was, but I cannot take upon myself to swear it; I understood it to be the same.</p>

            Suppose you accept a bill by mistake, are you not liable, and would it not fall on yourself instead of the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Would they not look upon you as responsible? - A. No, certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the only acceptor? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the hand-writing of either of the partners? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The partners, who gave you the authority to accept, can give it to others? -

               <p>Q. You conceived the guinea as a deposit to bind the bargain? - 
               <persName id="t18011202-3-person74">A. </persName>
            First, I asked him for a guinea; he felt in his pocket, and had not got any.</p>

            Suppose he had given the guinea, you did not agree to part with the goods? - A. He was not to have them without ready money.</p>
               <p>Jury. We are not satisfied it is the same bill, and we understood he only left the bill till he went to fetch the money.</p>
               <p>Court. If you have made up your minds upon that, it seems unnecessary to go any further.</p>

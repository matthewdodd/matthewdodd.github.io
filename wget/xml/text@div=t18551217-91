                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at No. 6, Adelphi-terrace, facing the river. I know, the defendant—I believe him to, be the occupier of a wharf and premises on the bank of the river, in front of the terrace—it is called, I believe, Western-wharf—be is a dung merchant—the business carried on there is collecting dung from various parts of the town, and col<lb></lb>lecting it in a barge, or barges, in front of his premises, and sometimes on the wharf—it sometimes remains in the cart before it is dragged down to the barge, and when there the cart remains nearer to our noses—I have known the carts remain on the wharf all night—I have observed this between 1st Jan. and Oct. this year—it is so frequent, that you may see it whenever you choose to look—I observed it last Friday, morning, but have not observed it so much lately, as I have been a great of town—the barges are moored close to the wharf, at varying distances from high to low water mark—sometimes, they are dry, but, generally speaking, they are afloat—the manure remains in the barges until it smells very badly, sometimes for eight or ten days)—it is a large barge, a lighter, and is filled by degrees, in about eight or ten days—the manure is not always taken away in the barge, it is sometimes transhipped—it is sometimes stable manure, sometimes cow dung; in fact, it is an <hi rend="italic">omnium gatherum</hi>—we strongly suspect that there is human ordure, or contents of privies, from the intolerable stench, but I have not seen it—I have observed vegetable matter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185512170002"></xptr>
               <p>among it—there was an instance of a very large amount of carrots put into the barge, some months ago, which very nearly destroyed us—they were in a state of extreme decomposition—they had been secreted under the Adelphi arches for some time, by somebody else, and I believe Mr. Clewley was employed to remove them—I have not observed cabbages there of late—I used to keep a register of these things some years ago, when we were bringing him up before the parish, but latterly I have left it to my neighbours—the stench latterly has been that of stable manure—it is very bad at times—we have suffered very great inconvenience from it all over the house—as a medical man, I consider it injurious to health, and can prove that it has been particularly so in our neighbourhood—when it is being put from the carts into the barge, or from the large barge into the little barge, the whole buildings, almost to the Strand, are affected by it—Messrs. Coutts's banking house is affected by it just as much as we axe—some few years ago, I was continually speaking to the defendant about it, and have told him, as a neighbour, that there was a duty which he owed to us, to keep his premises more tidy; but he was always very rude—these conversations have been at his wharf, or at his door—I addressed him as the person conducting the business—I have seen him on the barges, directing his men—I believe he very seldom does anything himself but he sees that others do it—the turning takes place at various times of the day, and it becomes worse and worse in proportion as it is turned—it decays in the barge, and then becomes worse—turning it makes it ferment more, but I believe the inten<lb></lb>sion is to make it a more uniform compost for the market gardeners—there have been general complaints about this wharf and barges.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Are you aware that there are four common sewers within a short distance of your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there are two at Scotland-yard, one at the Adelphi, and one at the Waterman's Pier; there is one under the east, and another under the west end of the terrace—when the wind is south-west is blows directly on to the terrace—no doubt we smell the sewers sometimes—there is no smell from long litter, which is straw not quite trod<lb></lb>den into manure, partially used only—I have said that you were very rude to me—I never took up my stick to strike you or anybody else—you did not say, "By God I will pay you if you strike me with that stick"—I never could have forgotten it if it had occurred—the greater part that I have seen lately has been stable manure, as far as my knowledge goes—I have not seen anything else for months, but I only see it when I come to town—I have seen dung standing in the carts in the evening, and in the morning; I cannot say whether the water has been down then, so that you could not get to the barge—the barge reeks—I have not observed more than one cart—I did smoke a cigar there when I was engaged with the parish in putting down this abominable nuisance—it used to be a favourite walk some years ago, until they made it such a filthy place that nobody could go there—a smell undoubtedly arises from the urinal under the Adelphi, which is much frequented—the parish sweepings are not taken down there, they sweep the streets now which they did not formerly—I do not think it is swept into your dock.</p>

Villiers-street, Strand, immediately opposite the <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> where this business is carried on, so that I get the full benefit—it is underneath the terrace, below one street and above another—I occupy a long arch seventy or eighty feet long—there are three <hi rend="italic">rides</hi> fronting the terrace—this is the west <hi rend="italic">ride</hi>—my arch is ten yards from the defendant's wharf—I have a workshop there, and live in Villiers-street—I sometimes employ three or four workmen, principally in painting sign boards—from Jan. to Oct. I have seen dung of all descrip<lb></lb>tions brought to the defendant's wharf—it seemed like horse dung, but from the desperate smell I should think there is some pig's dung—the man I had there most frequently is obliged to stay away, as he cannot stand, it—he has complained to me most bitterly about it, and an apprentice I had there was taken with a slow fever two months ago, and was laid up for nearly a month—the stuff was reeking last Thursday—the arch I occupy has only a wooden floor, and the street is underneath where the carts pass along—when we open the windows to get a breath of fresh air, the smell is very fearful—when the tide goes down, there is a slope, and that is called the <hi rend="italic">ride</hi>—on account of the construction of our place, we get the stench</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185512170006"></xptr>
               <p>from the barge from almost every quarter from which the wind blows—it is very offensive, and smells more like night soil than anything else—I have a knowledge of the sort of smell, being a plumber—it smells more like soil from privies than stable dung—the stuff in the carts is sometimes in a decomposed state, but not always—it is let drop all along the <hi rend="italic">ride</hi>, and lies there till it festers, and the whole <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> is covered with it, and it is then gathered up, and put into the barge—I have seen the <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> covered with it for a week, stinking all the time—it may take a fortnight to fill the barge—I have seen it turned into the barge, and then the smell is increased, and the same when it is put in other barges—Mr. Gore's nuisance is totally removed, so that whatever smell comes now, comes from the defendant's place—our men complain more of this than they did of Gore's even while Gore was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Adelphi-terrace. The defendant's wharf is exactly underneath—I have observed cart loads of horse manure brought there both Sundays and workdays—I have seen them loaded into the barge—the smell from it has been that of a very strong manure, it was very offensive; I have often been obliged to shut the window when I should have had it open for air—I am not in any business, I take charge of offices and chambers—I have occasionally seen men, turning over the stuff in the barge, the smell has been more strong then—I cannot say how long it has remained in the barge, perhaps eight or ten days; according to when it was full, I suppose.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer, and am one of the superintendent inspectors appointed by the Board of Health. On 9th Jan. last I inspected the defendant's Wharf and barge—I have my original memo<lb></lb>randum here which I made at the time, for the information of the Board of Health—I went down to inspect Gore's premises, and also to ascertain whether there were any other nuisances of a like nature, and with respect to the defendant's, I state that I saw barges there loading with apparently reeking stable manure, the smell from which was very offensive, and quite perceptible from the terrace and the streets adjoining—that was so—it was in a most offensive state, wet steam was rising from it, and it smelt like stuff from a very badly kept stable—on 24th Jan. I again inspected the defendant's wharf—there was a barge partly laden with the same kind of manure waiting there at the time—it was not quite so bad as before—on the first occasion they were turning it over, on the second the wharf was idle, I think it was dinner time—there was a very perceptible smell, but not so offensive as before—I saw the defendant on the first occasion, and asked him if he was the owner of the wharf—he said he was the occupier of it—I made some remark about the offensiveness of the dung, and he was so Very insolent that I was obliged to leave him—I did not tell him who I came from.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer; I am a superintendent inspec<lb></lb>tor appointed by Board of Health. I was directed by the president of the Board of Health to visit Olewley's wharf, on 4th Oct last—Gore's was the adjoining wharf, but he had then entirely discontinued his business—I observed a barge on the defendant's wharf, with manure in it—the wharf is what is called a draw-dock, where carts go down to load and unload—it was low tide, and the barge was aground—there were no carts there then—the barge contained stable manure mainly, and a very small quantity of vegeta<lb></lb>ble matter besides; leaves of cabbages—it had a strong pungent smell, the smell of manure of that kind—it was not very strong that day—the barge was about three parts full; the manure was then undergoing the process of decomposition—I did not go again—I made a report to the President of the Board of Trade—the result of placing the manure in the barge was offensive from the evaporation that took place, the exhalation from the manure in a state of decomposition—I considered it offensive—the stirring up of manure of that kind would of course be offensive; a nuisance of that kind would no doubt be calculated to make the houses of the persons in Adelphi-terrace uncomfortable for their occupation—I considered it a nuisance.</p>

               <p>complaint of the defendant's premises for a long time, by the people passing by, and likewise by the inhabitants living in the vicinity—I see his pre<lb></lb>ttises every day, and two or three times a day—I have often seen the carts unloading into the barge, and have seen a man whom I took to be Clewley's son, at work in the barge with another man, throwing the stuff from the centre of the barge to the end, so as to fill it up, and make a regular load; I have also seen them put it front that barge into other barges to be taken away—when this has been going on, the smell has been altogether unendura<lb></lb>ble—I have not seen the defendant on the premises while this has been going on, for the last three or four months—I frequently saw him in the summer giving directions to his men, whilst this has been going on—I have frequently spoken to him about it not within these twelve months, but on previous occasions—I have known the premises for four years and a half in his possession—when I have spoken to him, he has made use of very abusive language towards me, and said he would put me and the parish at defiance to stop the nuisance he was making; that he had stood one trial, and he was ready to stand another—in my judgment it has been a very, great nuisance indeed; it has been very much worse in the summer, and worse since Gore's wharf has been done away with; for I think the defendant has taken a por<lb></lb>tion that Gore used to have.</p>

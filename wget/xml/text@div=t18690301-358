                  </hi>. I am a brick merchant, and carry on business with I Robert Martin—on 8th December, 1866, I entered upon a contract with the prisoner—this is the agreement—(<hi rend="italic">This was an agreement between the De<lb></lb>fendant and the prosecutors, dated 8th December</hi>, 1866, <hi rend="italic">for the lease of two plots of ground, on which buildings were to be erected by the prisoner forth-with, in failure of which the agreement was to cease and determine.</hi>) Under that agreement I advanced the prisoner 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on two houses—on 2nd September, 1867, he had expended on the houses about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he ceased to work at the houses three or four months afterwards, I should think; I can scarcely say, in consequence of his haying left the houses for about six months—I caused a copy of this notice to be served upon him, according to the agreement entered into—I did not serve him personally—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "To Mr. Charles Lyle. In consequence of your having failed to perform your part of the agreement between you and ourselves, we do, in exercise of the power reserved to us, we give you notice that we determine the same, and we shall take possession of the plots of ground. Dated 2nd day of September, 1867. Signed, William Standing and Robert Martin; and wit<lb></lb>nessed by Elias Davis.")—No notice was taken of that by the prisoner; he did not communicate with us in any way, and we took possession of the property—we were not interfered with at all by the prisoner—he came to us one day, and asked us to advance some money, and then we said we understood he had parted with his interest to someone else, and we had no power to advance him any money—he said he should go and have a row with them—I afterwards sold the property to Mr. Blackburn, on 10th August, 1868, under this agreement—I am not sure that I saw the prisoner afterwards—I saw him before, and he said he wanted some more money—that was about the end of last year, or the beginning of this—from the commencement of the houses, he continued working for about four months—at the end of that time, that would be about March, 1867, he took the things away, and did nothing to them after that—I can't say whether he went near the houses or not; I should say he did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know whether he did or did not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I only judge from the houses being neglected—I was not down there—by the terms of the agreement we were not bound to advance any money at all—we did advance some money—I have no doubt he gave us bills for all the money we advanced to him—I think the first sum we advanced was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he might have signed a promisory note for that—he did not give me a bill, it was merely a receipt in the form of a promissory note—he came to me and asked me to advance him some more money, and said he could not go on building with<lb></lb>out it, but that was after he parted with his interest to some person—and he said he could not get any money from them—he did not say if I did not advance him more money he would have to go and get it somewhere else; I am clear about that—he came to me before he parted with his interest, and always had the money—ho said that Mr. Cohen, the person he had parted with his interest to, did not give him any money, and I said we could not advance any after having parted with that authority, and he said "I shall go and have a row with them"—no were quite willing if he had been entitled to it, had it been in our power to have done so—our object was to get the houses completed—he had two houses to build in that agree<lb></lb>ment—there was another agreement that he was to build two more, but he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186903010078"></xptr>
               <p>never did so—he only raised two carcasses of houses—the agreement will show when the two were to job finished—you have it there—we did not take possession before the time was completed, I am quite sure we did not—I was very sorry to take possession of either—the other two houses in the second agreement were not advanced to the first floor, only four or five feet of brickwork—he very likely sent a message to me to say that unless I advanced him some more money he should pull the houses down again—I took possession immediately after I served the notice—the houses had been abandoned for six months at least, we had no alternative, and should have been glad if he had completed them—I positively state that I never asked the prisoner to run a bill—I don't know whether my partner did—I think it is very likely there were more bills than these—he had many bills—I don't know what interest he had to pay us on this bill—he never paid us any—I am sure he was not asked to run bills—the notice was served on the Saturday, and we took possession on the Monday—we had no com<lb></lb>munication with the prisoner in matters of account—we could not have got hold of him at all—we had no object except to get the houses finished—I sold the houses to Mr. Blackburn—no consideration has been paid—I suppose he would have taken up his lease before this if the prisoner had not pulled his property to pieces—the prisoner could not have asserted that the property was his own—he has not, that I am aware of—I don't see how he could have done so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live at Dorset Place, Clapham—on 10th August I took possession of the two buildings in question, under an agreement with Mr. Standing—they were carcasses at that time—there was nothing whatever in them—after I took possession, in August 1868, I did work upon them to the amount of about 520<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—included in that work, and covered by that money, there were fixtures of all sorts, doors, chimney-pieces, stoves, and so forth—and the houses were completed, with the exception of an outlay of about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—from the time I took pos<lb></lb>session, until the things were taken away, I did not see the prisoner—but I believe he interfered once—he did not assist me in putting the things in—I did not see him till he was at the Police Court—on Sunday, 17th January, I was on the premises—they were in a perfect state at that time time—on the following Sunday, the 24th, I went to the premises again—I found one house a total wreck—it had been broken in by the side door—the door was completely forced in—the box of the lock was forced off—and on going into the house I found all the doors wrenched from the hinges, and taken away—the sashes were taken out and taken away—the stoves were torn out of their places and taken away—there, were two kitchen ranges, two marble chimney-pieces, and 100 feet of lead pipe, which was fixed on to the water, were all torn down and taken away—I also missed 100 feet of inch-iron pipe, which had not been fixed—fifty-four feet of iron</p>

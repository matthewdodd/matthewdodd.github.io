               <p>Mr. Garrow to Alessi. In this first letter you talk of candlesticks, No. 2, and No. 5 - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you mean by these candlesticks - A. Notes; candlesticks No. 2, two pound notes; and candlesticks No. 5, five pound notes; and candlesticks No. 1, one pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. What does a dozen candlesticks mean - A. One note.</p>
               <p>COURT. There is twenty dozen mentioned - A. That is twenty notes.</p>
               <p>Q. The dozen is only colour; then twenty dozen only means twenty - A. Yes; and four dozen means four notes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you ever any dealings with the prisoner for candlesticks - A. We talked about candlesticks.</p>
               <p>Q. You never bought any candlesticks of him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you wanted a supply of forged bank notes, how came you to call them dozens of candlesticks - A. Because the first thing that we talked was about candlesticks,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110029"></xptr>of which I had a notion of buying some, not of him.</p>
               <p>Q In short, by whose direction did you describe forged notes by dozens of candlesticks - A By Mr. Nicholls' direction.</p>
               <p>Q You have told us at the time of this correspondence you were in custody - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Of course you were not at the Lemon Tree - A No.</p>
               <p>Q Were you taken to the Lemon Tree by Foy and some other person - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q When was that - A I do not recollect the day.</p>
               <p>Q Was it at the time according to the letter from the prisoner at Birmingham, when you expected him to arrive - A Yes, it was on that day.</p>
               <p>Q How long had you been at the Lemon Tree before you were informed that the prisoner had come there - A About three or four or five hours.</p>
               <p>Q Upon that you were permitted to go into a room by the officers, separated from them by a partition - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Did you agree with the officers for any signal that you were to do, if any certain event happened - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q What were you do - A To put on my hat when I was certain that Mr. Nicholls had the notes in his possession.</p>
               <p>Q What did the prisoner and you do after you went in to him - A We talked about this business about the notes; I asked him if he had brought them with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. What did you ask him - A What he had brought, if he had brought these things; I did not mention what; he said yes; I asked him for a pencil and and little piece of paper; I think he cut it from that letter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He took out some letter from his pocket and tore some paper off, which you believe was this - A I cannot say it was that.</p>
               <p>Q But you believe so - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q What was you to do with the pencil and the piece of paper - A To cast up all the notes - 20 dozen, No. 5, according to what I had ordered, at thirty shillings each, and to see what they came to.</p>
               <p>Q Was the price of the same proportion of the smaller notes as the large ones - A Yes, at six shillings for a pound; that was the price of all.</p>
               <p>Q So that you were to pencil the number of each, and cast how much six shillings in a pound would come to - A Yes; then I made out the account, and said it comes to so much money.</p>
               <p>Q Do you recollect how much it came to - A I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q But you mentioned to him how much they came to - A I did, and I put down the price of the notes, and two guineas for his journey.</p>
               <p>Q How came you to put down the two guineas for the journey - A Because in my first letter I proposed two guineas for the journey.</p>
               <p>Q Upon your putting down this money on the paper did you say any thing to him that this was a large purchase that you were making - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Do you recollect what he said - A One must get rid of them in the way of trade. When I was certain he had got the notes, I said now we will go up to my room, it is cold, I will put my hat on.</p>
               <p>Q Then as soon as you put on your hat the officers came in and secured him - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Now Alessi, when you were taken for uttering this note to Mr. Taylor, you were not permitted to go back to your lodgings again - A No.</p>
               <p>Q You were not in your own room when you met the prisoner - A No, in the club room.</p>
               <p>Q This room that we are talking of, is a room parted off by a separate partition from the club room - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Did you see the officer bore the hole through the partition, so that they could see what passed before the prisoner came - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q When you went out on the day that you were taken up for uttering the note to Mr. Taylor, had you left any forged notes that you had bought of Nicholls at your lodgings - A Four.</p>
               <p>Q Four of that nineteen that you spoke of - A Yes. I left these four behind the mantle shelf in the crevice of the partition.</p>
               <p>Q I believe you, after you were in custody, directed somebody to that crevice to find these four notes - A I did, to Mr. Westwood.</p>
               <p>Q You described to him the crevice where to find the four notes - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q to Westwood. Did you, from the direction of Alessi, go to his lodgings and find these four notes - A I did; these are the notes; I found them concealed in a crevice behind the mantle piece, wrapped up in brown paper.</p>
               <p>Q You found them readily by the decription that Alessi had given - A I did. There is four five pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q to Alessi. You are aware that you are acquitted of those charges that were against you - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. How long have you been in this country at this time - A About five months and a half.</p>
               <p>Q What, besides forged bank notes, have you been about this time - A I wait to go over to Holland to go into my own country.</p>
               <p>Q I did not ask you what you are waiting for - have you been about any other business besides forged bank notes - A No.</p>
               <p>Q Have you had forged notes from any other person besides the prisoner - A No.</p>
               <p>Q I do not ask you the name - do you mean to swear that you have not had dealings with another person resident at Birmingham - A Yes, I will swear it.</p>
               <p>Q How long were you at Birmingham - A Seventeen days the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. By saying the first time, I presume you have been there more than once - A I have been there three times in all.</p>
               <p>Q How long were you there the second time - A. A day and a half.</p>
               <p>Q How long the third - A Half a day; I came back directly.</p>
               <p>Q On the business of forged bank notes - A Not the first time.</p>
               <p>Q Only the second and third - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q You say you have not had any dealings with any other person for forged bank notes - do you mean to say that you have not given information of others for forged bank notes - A I did not receive bank notes from any other person but Nicholls. The first bank note that was shewn me was by another man.</p>

               <p>Q Had you dealings with that other man - A No.</p>
               <p>Q But you had conversation with another man on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110030"></xptr>forged bank notes - A Yes, because he shewed it me.</p>
               <p>Q. As a matter to deal in, did he shew it you - A Yes; he asked me if I wanted to buy it.</p>
               <p>Q Then whether you had this note among others that you uttered to Mr. Taylor, or whether you had that note of the prisoner, or of the other person, we are to take upon your credit - you have no other person to shew it - A No.</p>
               <p>Q You were taken up upon uttering that note to Mr. Taylor, is it so or not - A I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q When were you taken up first - A On the night of the 25th of November, I believe, at Mr. Taylor's.</p>
               <p>Q Then if you were taken up at Mr. Taylor's, do not you know that you were taken up for uttering the note - A I went to Mr. Taylor's for two bottles of wine, I presented that note; they said it was a bad note.</p>
               <p>Q Did not you know that the very moment you were taken up, that you were taken up for uttering of it - A I knew I was taken up for that; they said it was a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q How long have you lived in England altogether - A I have been in England three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q Altogether how many years, about fifteen years - A No, it is fifteen years since I first came.</p>
               <p>Q Have you lived several years in England altogether - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Then you know you were taken up about giving the forged bank note to Mr. Taylor - A Yes; on the 25th of November.</p>
               <p>Q And from that time you were kept in custody till within this half hour - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Perhaps you then began to think you should be hanged - A I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q Now you must know, therefore you must tell - A I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Q You cannot tell me what you thought - do you mean to state that upon your oath - A That is the last thing a man can be done to; I hope I should not be hung in this country.</p>
               <p>Q But as you were caught putting off a bad bank note you thought very likely you should - A I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Q Do you man to say that you did not know that they hung men in this country for putting off bad notes - A I did not know it.</p>
               <p>Q You swear that - A I swear that; I knew that people that forged bank notes they were condemned to die; but I did not knew that a person was to be hanged for passing them.</p>
               <p>Q Perhaps after you were taken up you were let into that secret, that they hang people for passing them - A No, I could not speak to any body, except a friend of mine.</p>
               <p>Q I suppose you spoke to the turnkeys - A No, I never spoke to them.</p>
               <p>Q No person spoke to you and told you that you were likely to be hanged - A I do not remember it; I did not ask any body.</p>
               <p>Q Then let me ask you whether you did not learn from any body that you were in danger of being hanged for putting off forged bank notes - A I cannot recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q From neither the gentleman of the bank, or them who took you up, or from the turnkeys, you cannot recollect being told that you were in danger of being hanged, or likely to be hanged - A I cannot say I recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q However you were determined not to be hanged if you could help it, so you desired to be a witness - A Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q Then did not you hope and believe that if you could catch Mr. Nicholls, or any body else, you should escape yourself - A I did not know any thing about that.</p>
               <p>Q I dare say you did all this for the sake of public justice - A I do think I did; I did not know whether my life was in danger or no; but at the same time I did it for my own sake.</p>
               <p>Q That is, you hoped if you were in danger of the halter, you should escape by doing this - A Certainly, that is the general case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I know it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have told us that you never received any forged notes from any other man - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q Did you ever correspond with any other about forged notes - A. No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q Never by letters, nor by the denomination of candlesticks, did you correspond with any body but the prisoner - A No.</p>
               <p>Q Who first made the proposition that you should buy forged bank notes of Nicholls - A Another man.</p>
               <p>Q In whose presence - A Nobody was present.</p>
               <p>Q Was that before you were acquainted with Nicholls - A Yes; I saw Nicholls that evening.</p>
               <p>Q You refused to buy the one the man offered you - A I did.</p>
               <p>Q When you saw Nicholls, tell us what passed - A I went to a public house to ask for a person who was clerk to some person at Birmingham, about seven or eight years; I met with the man that showed me the first note; I told the other man, that I had it in contemplation to go over to Spain, with some hardware goods; after this time the landlord and one man went out, this man stopped there; I had said before, I had been to one Johnson, a brass founder, to buy candlesticks with small figures; this man who offered me the forged one pound note, he said he could afford to sell candlesticks as cheap as any other man in England, he thought they would go in Spain; then he offered me dollars, which he said were more current in Spain; he said if they were liable to go in Spain he could serve me. Mr. Nicholls came, he said the other man said he would not come himself, but that he should come.</p>
               <p>COURT. You understood from Nicholls that the other man sent him - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You understood from Nicholls that the other man who had been talking about candlesticks had sent him - A Yes; Nicholls came and said he could not produce me a patent candlestick, but he shewed me a one pound note, and a two pound note; he said do you want to buy any thing of that sort; which I objected to buy at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention the price - A. Yes; he said half a guinea for a one pound note; I told him that the other man said only six shillings; well, he said, if the other man said six shillings, if you have a mind to buy, you shall have them for that; I objected to buy them at that time.</p>
               <p>Q How soon did you see him again - A I do not remember, but I know I bought some three or four days afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110031"></xptr>Q In about three or four days you had your first dealings with him - now attend to this question - upon the oath that you have taken, did you apply to him to sell you forged notes, or did he apply to you - A It was the other man that proposed to me.</p>
               <p>Q And then this man came to you - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do you mean to swear to the court and jury that the prisoner proposed to sell to you and you to buy of him - A Yes, I can swear so.</p>
               <p>Q At that time you declined having them - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Was that from a principle of honesty or the fear of being found out - A I do not know.</p>

            , they are officers also; I placed myself in a room that adjoins the club room.</p>
               <p>Q What sort of a partition is there - A A thin partition between that and the other room.</p>
               <p>Q Had you any means of seeing into this club room and what - A I had, through a small hole in the wainscot.</p>
               <p>Q Did you make that hole expressly for the purpose - A I did; I bored a hole with a gimlet.</p>
               <p>Q How long had you been there before any body came - A From seven o'clock in the morning till half after three in the evening.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you recollect what day of the week it was - A No, I cannot recollect; I think it was Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. You were there from seven o'clock in the morning till about half after three in the evening - did any person then come there and ask for Alessi - A Yes, the prisoner, Nicholls, came up into the room; I did not see him until he came into the club room.</p>
               <p>COURT. You had left Alessi in the club room by himself - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. You had the means of seeing through the hole what passed - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q About half after three the prisoner came - A Yes, he came into the club room.</p>
               <p>Q What passed between Alessi and the prisoner in your sight, you looking through the hole - A They asked each other how they did.</p>
               <p>Q Had you previously agreed with Alessi upon any signal being given - A That he was to put on his hat when he ascertained that the person that was to come to him had got the forged notes about him. After Nicholls had taken off his coat he sat down by the fire opposite of Alessi; Alessi asked him when he arrived in town; he said he had just come to town; Alessi asked him how long he was going to remain in town; the prisoner said he was going out of town at seven o'clock that evening. They were drinking together, they had got rum and water, and after some other talk that did not seem to belong to this business, Alessi asked Nicholls for a pencil, which he gave him, and a piece of paper, upon which Alessi seemed as if he was casting up an account; when he had added it up he said, well Mr. Nicholls, you will take all my money this time; Nicholls said never mind, endeavour to get it back again in the way of business; at this time Alessi was reaching back for his hat, which lay behind him as he sat in the chair, and said to Mr. Nicholls it was very cold; Mr. Nicholls then said to him put on your hat, sir, which Alessi did immediately; I then immediately went into the room and took Nicholls into custody; I searched him, a pocket book I found on him, and a small brown paper parcel in his left hand close coat pocket; his pocket book was in his great coat pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. That paper parcel was in his close coat pocket - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. Was it in that paper that you hold in your hand - A It was; I wrote the date on it, I marked the contents and each separate note.</p>
               <p>Q Look over these notes and see whether these are all the notes - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Were all these notes marked by you, and were they in the parcel - A. They were; there is twenty five pound notes, twenty four one pound notes, and these are the four two pound notes, all marked by me, they were in the same parcel.</p>
               <p>Q Now look at that letter, is that letter marked by you - A Yes, it is; I found it in his pocket book, dated December 13th, 1808. I asked him how he came possessed of the notes, he said he had found the parcel in the street; I asked him if he meaned any street in town; he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q Did he mention what street in town - A No; I did not ask him; he said yes, but did not mention the street; afterwards he said that some friend at Birmingham had given him the parcel and two letters to put into the post office, and he had two letters in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q Was the parcel directed to any body - A No; it was exactly the same as it is now.</p>
               <p>Q Did you understand him that the parcel as well as the letters were to be put in the post - A. No; it seemed to me as if he meaned the parcel had been given to him, and no account of the notes. The pocket book, I recollect, was in his right hand coat pocket, he had pulled his great coat off; in his left hand coat pocket were the letters.</p>
               <p>Q You before said the pocket book was in his great coat pocket - A Yes; but I recollect it was in his close coat pocket; I recollect he had pulled his great coat off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. In the first letter of Alessi's there is no direction to the letter but London, in the answer there is the Haymarket.</p>
               <p>COURT. I observed that. I want to know when it was the four notes were found.</p>
               <p>MR. WESTWOOD. I found the notes concealed in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110032"></xptr>the mantle piece on the 10th of December, the same day the letter was directed to Nicholls.</p>

             lodge at your house - A He did.</p>
               <p>Q Look at the prisoner Nicholls, do you know him - A He was at my house twice; he came first to my house soon after Alessi came from Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q How long before Alessi was taken up - A A week or a fortnight; I am not quite correct in that.</p>
               <p>Q When Nicholls first came to your house he was a stranger to you - Perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Q Who did he enquire for - A For Alessi. I told him he was not at home, but it was likely that he would be in presently; he seemed to be at a loss what to do; he had the appearance of a traveller; there was a good room and a fire up stairs; I asked him to go up stairs and sit down.</p>
               <p>Q Was it Alessi's room - A No, the club room. I told him he might have lodgings in my house if he wanted; he continued in my house four or five days.</p>
               <p>Q Was Alessi and he much together during the time he remained there - A A great deal.</p>
               <p>Q You remember the circumstance of Alessi not coming home at the time he was taken in custody afterwards - A Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q Do you remember Mr. Westwood coming to your house - A Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q Was he shewn into Alessi's lodging room - A Not by himself.</p>
               <p>Q Did Mr. Westwood go into Alessi's lodging room - A He did, I was present; he did not find any thing the first time of his coming.</p>
               <p>Q Was it occupied by any body - A No, I kept it locked up.</p>
               <p>Q Were you there when Mr. Westwood was there a second time - A I was.</p>
               <p>Q The first time was immediately upon Alessi being taken up - A It was.</p>
               <p>Q In the course of some days he came again - did you see him find any brown paper with any thing in it - A I did; he found it behind the wooden mantle shelf in a little crevice; he looked behind; there he found a little brown paper parcel; it contained four five pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q From the time of Alessi being detained, and to the time that the bank notes were found, had you kept it locked up - A Yes; no person was in the room but myself; I always kept the key, and my wife at times when I went out; I asked her particularly about it.</p>
               <p>Q Some time after this Alessi was brought there by the officers of the police - A He was.</p>
               <p>Q Did they go with him into one of the divisions of the club room - A They did; they went into the farther part of it, it is partitioned off.</p>
               <p>Q Were you at home when the prisoner Nicholls came - A I was, I waited at home on purpose.</p>
               <p>Q You were apprised of the object of their visit - A Of the whole.</p>
               <p>Q How long after the officers and Alessi came, did the prisoner come - A The officers came at seven o'clock in the morning, and the prisoner Nicholls did not come till about three in the afternoon, or a little after.</p>
               <p>Q Who did he ask for - A Alessi. Upon Nicholls' coming Alessi was permitted to go into the other room by himself, and Mr. Nicholls was shewed up to him; I shewed him up myself, and then went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q You know no more of it till after he was taken in custody - A I know the officers were watching him; I saw him searched.</p>
               <p>Q You have no doubt that this is the person that came to your house both times - A I am quite convinced of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. Is your wife here - A She is not here.</p>
               <p>Q She had the key sometimes - A When I went out, twice, I left the key in the drawer, and told her where it was.</p>
               <p>Q You told us just now that your wife had the key - A She knew where it was.</p>
               <p>Q She could get access to it if she wanted it - A She never wanted it.</p>
               <p>Q Then if she pleased she might have given it to any other person - you keep a common lodging house - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q In the course of a year you have many people like travellers coming into your house - A Yes.</p>

            . Q You are an inspector of the bank notes, employed by the governor and company of the bank of England - A I am.</p>
               <p>Q I am now going to put in your hand the first note, the note uttered by Alessi to Mrs. Taylor, look at that note and tell me whether that is a note of the governor and company of the bank of England - A It is not; it is a forgery; it is not the cashier's name, it is altogether a forgery. (The note read.)</p>
               <p>Q We are now going to prove the note that was uttered by Mrs. Meredith.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. The prisoner said he did not recollect any thing of that transaction.</p>
               <p>Q Look at that note, is that a forgery - A It is in every respect.</p>
               <p>Q These are the four what was found in the crevice in Alessi's lodging, are they a forgery - A The whole are a forgery; the signature and filling up, the paper, and all, are a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q Now I am going to put in your hand the twenty five-pound notes found upon the prisoner - A I have seen them before, they are all forgeries in every respect.</p>
               <p>Q Now look at those twenty four ones - A They are forged, and the four two pound notes they are forged likewise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Look at the one stated in the indictment and compare it with the hand writing of all the other five pound notes - I will ask you whether it appears to you that they are filled up with one hand writing, and whether they are from the same plate - A I have not a doubt of it; I have examined them before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you speaking of the twenty five pound notes, or the notes in question - A All the five pound notes appears to be filled up by the same hand writing, together with the note in question, and they are all of the same date, the 8th of April, excepting one which is only as it came from the plate; it has no writing at all.</p>

               <p>Q Does the bank in any possible instance part with any of their paper - A I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q Did you ever know of the bank parting with any impression of their plates that is not filled up with current notes - A Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The first note which has been shewn to you, which we call Taylor's note, and the four compared by you with the twenty five pound notes, or more correctly with the nineteen - they appear to be struck from the same plate - A Undoubtedly, and they are all filled up by the same hand.</p>
               <p>Q The imperfect one is from the same plate - A Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q The same observations applies to Meredith's, as Taylor's, they are all the same date - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q I believe in the course of numbering bank notes the usual method is to put them up in fifty - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q So that to illustrate it, if the first of the fifty should be 1000 they would go on to 1050 - A Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q That is the method of banking houses, and banking houses are supplied so, from the first to fifty and at last to four hundred - they never issue the same number of the same date - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q For instance you never have two of this day of the same number - A Never.</p>
               <p>Q The note in the indictment is No. 7484, Taylors, note; 7489 Meredith's; those found in Alessi's room 7486, and found upon the prisoner's person 7634.</p>
               <p>MR. TERRY. Q You are engraver to the bank of England - A I am.</p>
               <p>Q I first shew you Taylor's note, is that a genuine bank note or altogether a forgery - A Altogether a forgery, plate and every thing.</p>
               <p>Q I now shew you Meredith's, do you give the same account of that - A This is forged also.</p>
               <p>Q I now shew you the four found in the crevice by Mr. Westwood - A I have seen them before, they are all forgeries; the twenty five pound notes, nineteen filled up and one blank, they are all forgeries; they appear to be all struck from the same plate; I have not the least doubt of it; it is impossible that it should be otherwise; there are defects that were not intentionally put in, and that exactly agress in every one of them.</p>
               <p>Q Therefore you speak with certainty - A I do.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

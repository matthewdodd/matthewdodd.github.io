On the 24th of February, as soon as we opened the dock in the morning, an officer brought the prisoner and this coffee to the office - he said he had found this large quantity loose in the prisoner's pockets, and this small parcel tied up; I asked the prisoner where he got it - he said from a vessel where he had been employed; I asked at what quay, and he would not tell me; he said he was watching one of the vessels of rum - there was no vessel laden with rum, but I found one laden with coffee - one of the parcels was cut, and some coffee had been taken from it; there was a good deal of coffee scattered on the bottom of the craft - it belonged to Mr. Sage, the lighterman. I took some coffee from the bulk, and it corresponded exactly with that found on the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a lighterman, in the employ of Mr. Sage. I went into this vessel the night before, and saw the prisoner there - he had no business there; he seemed to have made a mistake and come to the wrong craft; it was my duty to watch them. I went away at one o'clock in the morning, on account of the weather being so cold; I had known the prisoner before, and thought him an honest man; the coffee was all safe when I left; there was no parcel broken, and none spilled about; I cannot say when he came on board - I think it must have been between seven and eight.</p>

               <p>What was the dress of the other man? - He had a dark coat underneath; they had both light coloured great coats on; the head of one horse was in the coach; one was a grey, and the other was a dark grey horse; we then arrived at the turnpike, and then I saw two or three officers, as they told me they were; I told them of the robbery by two men on horseback; a few days after I saw my watch advertised in the papers; I then went to the office in Worship-street, Shoreditch; the watch was shewn me; I knew it again; I then described the people before they were brought to me, exactly as I told your Lordship; as to swearing to them I cannot; it was not light enough for me to see their faces.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoners, can you say from their general appearance they were not the men? - No, I cannot; one was very tall, the other very short; the words I said, were, that one of them sat very losty on his horse.</p>

               <p>On the 5th of this present month, I in company with three other officers, was at Justice Wilmott's office; there came an information, that there were two people in Petticoat-lane, near the end of Gravel-lane that were suspected to have committed a highway robbery; we went into Petticoat-lane; the people were described to us; we went to the house where they were; they were eating and drinking; they were the two prisoners; we told them we wanted them; I believe it was twelve at noon.</p>
               <p>How were they dressed? - Much as they are now; the prisoner Lightfoot was in black; they got up; we were in a very bad neighbourhood, and had many bad people about, and we did not think sit to handcuff them in the house; but Shakeshaft and me took Lightfoot, one by one cuff, and the other by the other; there was an entry; and when we came to that, which was coming out of the tap-room, then he forced his hand down to his breeches, and I saw him put his finger into his pocket, or into his fob, I do not know which; directly I saw him with the seal or seals of a watch, and part of the chain in his hand; I says to my brother officer, Mr. Shakeshaft, he is going to pull a watch out of his pocket; and we had a very hard struggle with him, having each of us a stick we had but one hand to hold him; after we had struggled with him some time, Mr. Shakeshaft wrenched the gold seals out of his hand, and the chain parted from the watch; when I said, he was going to pull a watch out of his pocket, he then said, he had no such thing to pull out of his pocket; he said, he had no watch about him; we got the seals out his hand, and Mr. Armstrong, I believe it was, said, as to the watch, I suppose, that is sold; no, says he, I had none; we then sent for a coach and took them to Mr. Wilmott's office; as to the prisoner Tyrell, the whole time he behaved very well, and never offered to stir from the place where he was when we went in; when we got to the office, Armstrong, in company with another officer, took Lightfoot up stairs, and he brought down a watch with him; which he said, he found upon him; I have nothing to say against Tyrrell, only being in company with the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You are an officer belonging to Mr. Wilmott's office? - Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250037"></xptr>How long have you been so? - A-many years, and a housekeeper; I keep a shop in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>How many trials for highway robberies are you a witness on in the course of this sessions? - No more than this and the last trial.</p>
               <p>If these two men should be convicted it will make four forty pounds? - That is hardly worth while asking me for doing my duty, and the hazard I run in doing it; if there is any thing for me I hope I shall have it.</p>
               <p>You either have or not the impression on your mind that you are to get something by the conviction? - I certainly have, and so has every man that works.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250039"></xptr>Court. Let the other witnesses go out. How long have you known Tyrrell? - About twelve months.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - He did live in Moorfields when I knew him, he used to use the same house that I frequented much at times, I only knew him as using the house, I have drank many a pint of beer with him, I have been in his company very often.</p>
               <p>What is his business? - He is in the <rs id="t17861025-16-deflabel91" type="occupation">horse-dealing line</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17861025-16-defend256 t17861025-16-deflabel91"></join>, I used to see him exercising horses about Moorfields; I do not know where he lived when he was taken up. On the 1st of October my coach was in the rank at Moorfields, and somebody called coach about half after six; I was in a house and this Tyrrell was there, we had a pint of beer together at the Swan and Hoop at Moorgate, as soon as I drank my pint of beer I got off with a gentleman to the horns in Gutter-lane, Cheapside, and the prisoner Tyrrell went on the box with me, and the gentleman at the Horns in Gutter-lane paid me, and we had a glass of brandy a-piece; I believe the man who keeps the Horns in Gutter-lane is here, we had half a pint of brandy between some of us, the man at the Horns paid me, and I went away, and we parted; this was Sunday night the 1st of October.</p>
               <p>How came this man to ride on the box with you? - I asked him to have a ride with me.</p>
               <p>Why, by your account he was only a common acquaintance? - Only his being in the rank and using this public house.</p>
               <p>You say he was in the horse way? - Yes, I have seen him in the horse line, I have seen him exercising his horses.</p>
               <p>Is it a common thing for you to take people up on your box when you carry a fare? - Why it is common and it is not common; it was a little before six.</p>
               <p>Do you know who it was you carried to the Horns? - The gentleman that keeps the Horns knows because he paid me; it was half past six in the evening when I went off with the coach.</p>
               <p>Did you drink the pint of beer in the house or at the door? - In the house, in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Where was your coach during this time? - My coach was watering the horses at the door at the time.</p>
               <p>You carried one man only? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you get off your box at the Horns? - Oh, yes, we had some brandy there.</p>
               <p>What room did you go to there? - The public room, the tap-room?</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - Seven or eight minutes.</p>
               <p>What became of the prisoner? - When we had drank our brandy I bade him good night there, I left him at the door, he went about his business, and I went about mine.</p>
               <p>When you asked him to have a ride, did you tell him where you were going to? - He heard the man that was in the coach tell me where I was going to.</p>
               <p>Had he any business that way? - I cannot say, I did not ask him.</p>
               <p>Did you promise him any liquor when you came to the Horns? - No, the gentleman treated us that I carried there; the gentleman is either a cook or a waiter or something at the London Tavern in Cheapside, he is a servant I know, but the gentleman that keeps the Horns can tell you; I was not at the Justice's the first hearing, but the second I was sent for, but they did not let me in; it was Sunday the 1st of October.</p>

               <p>When was it? - The first of this month.</p>
               <p>What day of the week? - On a Sunday evening between seven and eight, the clerk, I believe he is, to the New London Tavern was set down at my house at that time, he was intoxicated, he desired me to pay them, he desired me to give them half a guinea, there were four of them with the coachman; I thought half-a guinea too much, as the young man was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250040"></xptr> intoxicated; I gave the young men three shillings, and a glass of brandy a piece, and I paid the coachman his fare, which was eighteen-pence.</p>
               <p>What was the three shillings for? - For seeing home the young man that was intoxicated; there were five in all.</p>
               <p>What was the three shillings given for? - - For their care I understood, my Lord; he desired me to give them half a guinea; he did not know what he said, and I thought it was too much; they seemed satisfied with three shillings; I called the coachman, and he said his fare was eighteen-pence.</p>
               <p>Do you know the coachman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is that the coachman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know any of the other people? - No, I know none, but the gentleman that was brought home in the coach.</p>
               <p>Did you go out when the coach arrived? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they all in the coach, or upon the box, or behind, or where? - I cannot speak to that indeed.</p>
               <p>Who took the three shillings; did they divide it amongst them.</p>
               <p>I do not know, I gave one man the three shillings, and the coachman eighteen-pence, and a glass of brandy a piece.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. How is this, you told me it was a single man? - I did not think it signified saying any thing of it; it was a quarrel, and I took my fare; this gentleman gave the men a shilling a piece.</p>

               <p>I am a publican, I keep the old White Horse in Chiswell-street, Moor-fields; I have known Tyrrell four years; he is in the stable way as groom.</p>
               <p>Has he been in any regular employ? - I have known him in two or three places; he was out of place when he was taken up.</p>
               <p>How long had he been out of place? - I cannot say rightly, I suppose a month or two.</p>
               <p>Or three? - I will not say rightly.</p>
               <p>Or four? - I will not say rightly.</p>
               <p>Six months? - I should suppose not so much as that.</p>
               <p>It seems as if by a month or two, you meant more than a month or two? - It may be more than a couple of months, I cannot say it is six months, nor I cannot say rightly how long, but I believe it may be a month or two, to the best of my knowledge; when out of place he lodged with me, and I always found him honest; he lodged with me constantly.</p>
               <p>Then you can tell pretty well how long he has been out of place? - No, I cannot upon my oath say within a month or so; when out of place, he used to be employed by the people; I knew a Mr. Hull, in Chiswell-street, used to employ him to take horses to the country; I believe Tyrrell is a very honest lad, I never found any thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>What age is he? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Goodall. Did you know these people that you speak of, only from the circumstance of their having been three times at you house? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You had never seen them but these three times? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Now as to Tyrrell, look at him, are you quite sure he is the man? - I believe them to be the men that were at our house.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about them? - I cannot say I can swear to them, because they did not come in doors.</p>
               <p>Did they speak to you? - No, I received their money once.</p>
               <p>Then perhaps you spoke to them? - I cannot say I did; they only drank at the door two pints of beer, and had a slice of bread and butter.</p>
               <p>Then you are not quite positive? - No, but I believe them to be the men.</p>

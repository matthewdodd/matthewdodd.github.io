                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Jordan, of Bury-court, Gray's inn-lane. The prisoner took a furnished room at our house, about a fortnight before Christmas—she left three weeks ago last Monday without giving notice—after she was gone I missed from her room two blankets, two sheets, and two saucepans, which I had seen safe in her room eight or nine weeks before she left—she left the room once and came back again the week after—I did not see the room after she had taken it the second time</p>

               <p>till she left—no one went to the room, but her and her acquaintance—she had the key of the room—I gave her into custody.</p>

Q.</hi> I took the room two months before Christmas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it was so long as that—I did not say I did not care how often you pawned the things if you got them out again—I never gave any one leave to pawn the things—Mrs. Winter is a lodger of mine—I never allowed her to pawn things—I know she has pawned things, bat I never gave her leave to do so.</p>

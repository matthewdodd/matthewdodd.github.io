            </rs>, his property.</p>
               <p>JOHN COLEMAN. On the 20th of April, after dinner, I went to Blackwall, and got intoxicated. The prisoners were drinking in a house at Stepney, and joined me. I waited there about an hour, and came away after ten o'clock. I gave the prisoners my property to take care of; they were going to see me home. I did not give them the money, but gave them the other things.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When did you see the prisoners last - A.Not since their second examination. I did not tell the magistrate, that I gave them the property. The officers told me that I must come forward. I am a letter-carrier in the Post-Office. I signed my examination before the magistrate, but did not read it first.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. On the 20th of April, I was out with Partridge. I saw the prisoners in Stepneyfields, at eight o'clock, and at ten o'clock, we saw them standing at the door of the George, at Cock-hill, with the prosecutor; there was another man with them; the prosecutor was in liquor - They went up Schoolhouse-lane with him, and felt him about; he said he wanted to go to the Borough; they were taking him the wrong way; they hustled him about in the lane, and threw him down; a man came by, and disturbed them - They returned again with him near the back of the Bristol Arms, threw him down there, and brought him into Glasshouse-fields. I was just by them - He asked them if they wanted to rob him. I run into the Bristol Arms, and called Barber to my assistance - I sent him round by the glass-house. I sprung down to them, and saw Manning rifle his pockets. I seized him. Spelman ran away. Manning said he had not robbed him, and had got nothing belonging to him. I found the articles stated in the indictment on him. Coleman had a mark on his head, and his hand was cut; he was very much in liquor - He claimed the things, and charged them with robbing him; the next morning I took Spelman - He said he had nothing to do with it. The morning after Manning told the Magistrate, that Coleman gave them the things - He did not say so before.</p>
               <p>JOHN COLEMAN. My hands were not cut. I had not got a blemish about me.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>GEORGE PARTRIDGE. I am an officer, and was with Brown. I saw the prisoners, at ten o'clock at night, with Coleman. I followed Brown, but lost him. I saw Coleman at the Bristol Arms; one of his knuckles bled, and I saw something under his eye. I was with Brown when he took Spelman; he at first denied being there, and afterwards said, that he had nothing to do with the robbery, but was there.</p>

               <p>JEREMIAH BARBER. Brown fetched me out of the Bristol Arms. I went round into the fields. Brown called out, that he had got one; he had Manning (Coleman laid on the ground quite motionless); I saw him searched, and the articles found on him. When Manning came into the house, he said, that Coleman gave them to him-this was in Brown's presence - He must have heard it. One of Coleman's hands bled, and his face likewise.</p>

               <p>JOHN BROWN. I did not hear Manning say they were given to him till he was before the magistrate.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210026"></xptr>MANNING'S Defence. He said he would treat us if we would see him home - He gave us the things to take care of for him; he fell down. I was picking him up, and Brown came and took me.</p>
               <p>SPELMAN'S Defence. I lost Manning and the prosecutor, and went home.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH BARBER. When I went out, I only saw one man-if there had been another man, he might have got away before I saw him.</p>

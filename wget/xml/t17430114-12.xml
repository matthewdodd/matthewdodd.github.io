             . On the 27th of December, between four and five o'Clock, after the Candles were put out, I was standing at the Choir Door, waiting for Mr Fido; the Prisoner wanted to come by me; seeing something in her Apron that looked like a Book, I asked her what she had got in her Apron; she said, nothing belonging to me: Said I, let me see what you have; she was unwilling I should, so I took this Book out of her Apron. I believe she was in real Want, for she said, she came out of the Workhouse but a very little before. <rs id="t17430114-12-verdict64" type="verdictDescription">

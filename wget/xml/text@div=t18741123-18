                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker and jeweller, of 24, Bishops gate Street, which is at the corner of a passage—it is a very small shop—there is what is called a counter case—the legs are on castors, for the Purpose of putting it near the safe, to put things away at night and the reverse in the morning—it would be against the wall when the shop was being arranged—on 23rd September, in the afternoon, two men and a woman came in—I believe the prisoner to be one of the men, but his moustache has been shaved off since—they purchased a pair of earrings for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they were about five minutes in the shop—on the 24th I heard that a gold watch and six rings had been taken from the stock when I was not there—on 3rd October I picked the prisoner out at Bishopsgate Station from eighteen others from his general appearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My porter was present when the earrings were bought—it was about 1.30 and broad day light—nothing was stolen then—after the theft I described the woman as well dressed and the men as one shorter than the. other—they were perfect strangers to me—I have taken the things from the window and put them in the safe a number of times, it takes about forty minutes—it is the practice to put them on the counter before putting them in the window in the morning—they are not taken direct from the safe to the window, the majority of them are put on the counter first—I saw the gold watch on the 23rd when my assistant was clearing the stock from the window in the evening at 7.30 or 7.40—I did not see the whole of the things put into the safe—the rings had not then been removed—my assistant, Mr. Forbes, told me on 3rd October that he had identified the man who was there on the 22nd, but that he should not like to swear to him unless I went down and if I identified the same man as he had he should have no hesitation to swear to him—he did not add that if 1 had</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant to the prosecutor—on 24th September at 9.30, I 1as removing the goods into the window, the counter being very nearly close to the safe—a gold watch and six rings were in the safe among other things—two men came into the shop and I identify the prisoner as one of them—they both spoke and said that they had been there with a lady two days before and bought some earrings—they said "You are not the gentleman I have seen before"—I asked them to describe the earrings—they did so and asked for some exactly like them as the lady had made a present of them—I went to the window to get some earrings, and while I was reaching them my back was to the safe—they would have no occasion to lean over the counter—I showed them a pair of earrings something like them—they said that they were not exactly the same—I offered to send to another shop for some like those which they originally had, and asked them to call again—they said they would call in half an hour—one of them said "We cannot call in half an hour, make it 11 o'clock"—I said "That will suit me better," and they left—in three minutes after that I missed a gold watch out of the safe and after that some rings—they never came back—on 3rd October I identified the prisoner at Bishopsgate Station from about fifteen other men—he is one of the men who was in the shop—I first saw him sitting down and said that he looked very much like the man, but his moustache was shaved off, which altered him very much, and then I asked him to speak to me—I was rather agitated over it, but when I saw him at the Police Court the second time I was quite clear about it.</p>

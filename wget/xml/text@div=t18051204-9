             sworn. I am an officer belonging to Hatton Garden. I was sent for by Mr. Page, to take the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the prosecutor? - A. The prisoner confessed at last where he lived; I went to see whether he was right; I found that he worked for Mr. Willey, in the Strand; Mr. Willey had been to his house, and found some other boot legs, and I found one pair more of shoes, which Mr. Willey has sworn to be his property, and nine lasts and some pieces of leather; he lodged at No. 16 Exeter-street in the Strand.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had he worked for you? - A. He has been with me since the month of April last.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he behave himself? - A. Very well; he was a sober industrious man; his wife was very ill at the time that this was committed; I have no doubt but this is the first offence; I have made every enquiry concerning his former conduct; I found nothing in his former conduct that makes in the least against him.</p>

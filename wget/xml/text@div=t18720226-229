I now live at West Croydon—in September, 1870, I was living at 2, Mantua Street, Battersea—from that house I could see quite well into the back part of 4, Orchard Place—I know the prisoner by sight quite well—I have frequently seen him at No. 4, in all parts of the house—I have seen him in the back parlour—I have seen him there with a ladle on the fire, melting something in it, and pouring it out into what I have since found to be a plaster of Paris mould, and I have seen it turned out of that and put into a kind of basin—by the sound I could not. see what it was—I have seen this several times—at all times—at no time in particular—there were other persons in the room at the time, sometimes</p>

               <p>I never saw the prisoner till she came to our house to offer this silk and twist: I am sure this is the woman, she had it in her apron, she said, she had some twist if I would buy it, I told her to shew it me, and when I saw it, I said, it was the same twist I had information of, I sent to Mr. Walker, the prisoner said, she came honestly by it, that she had kept a shop and sold these things, and this was what she had left; when she came within the door, she said, a person had lodged with her, and that she took this in part of payment.</p>
               <p>(The Twist deposed to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave her a very good character, and one of them said, she had kept a shop about two years ago.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Is it possible to swear to twist? - Yes, when I have the pattern card, there is no particular new colour among it.</p>
               <p>Court. Then why might not other shopkeepers have it? - The woman has since confessed where she got it.</p>
               <p>There is nobody here to prove that? - Nobody but myself, she had it not from me.</p>

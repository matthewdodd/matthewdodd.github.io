                  </hi>. I am master of the ship "Boreas"—on the morning of 13th February I was walking along Lower Thames-street—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner on my left side, he pushed against me twice, the second time I felt a tug at my watch-chain—there were a great many people about me at that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186502270013"></xptr>
               <p>time—there was no one near enough to make a tug at my waistcoat, except the prisoner—I put my band there and found my watch was gone—I caught hold of the prisoner's collar, he said, 'What do you want?"—I said, "You have got my watch"—while I was talking to him, some one touched me on the back and said, 'If you have lost anything he has passed it, you have got the right man"—I did not see anybody go away—there was great confusion there at that time—there were people near enough for him to pass it to—the prisoner had a cloak on his arm; that was close to me over my waist-coat-pocket—his coat was against me, I had to move it away before I could get to my pocket—he tried to slip out of his coat when I took him, and I had to collar him round his neckhandkerchief—I am confident no one could have made the tug but him—it was a valuable watch, worth twenty guineas.</p>

            , I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 21st of February, about half-past nine o'clock, I stopped the prisoner in Capel-street, St. George's in the East, with a bag on his shoulder. I untied it, and found two loaves of sugar. I asked him where he got it - he said he kept a shop, and I should find it all right. He equivocated, and I took him to the watch-house. He said he had it from Macdougal, in Charlotte-street, Whitechapel. Gooding went and enquired - he returned, and told the prisoner Macdougal denied his buying any sugar of him. After some conversation, he said he found it in Thornhaugh-street - there was a brown paper on the sugar - the direction on it led me to Mr. Capel's. There was also 7 lbs. of salt.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You are sure you saw the paper at your house, in Russell-square - A. I have doubt of it. I think I can positively identify the sugar. I bought a considerable quantity of it in July, 1819, and have several loaves of it - they are each numbered 78 at the bottom. I had forty-one or forty-two loaves of it, and missed some, but did not know how they went.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You keep no sugar at your country-house - A. None at all.</p>

            . I am footman to the prosecutor. On the 21st of February I saw the prisoner at my master's house, in Russell-square - his brother is in my master's service. I saw this paper that day - it contained pork.</p>

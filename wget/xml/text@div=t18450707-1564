                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Guy's Hospital—Boxall was brought there about two o'clock and complained of violent pain in the lower part of the abdomen, and inability to pass his urine—I had him taken to bed—Mr. Cooper happened to be in the ward at the same time, and attended to him—a small quantity of water was passed off—he bad great pain and inflammation of the stomach—leeches and fomentations were ap<lb></lb>plied—he died on the following Saturday, about ten minutes to eleven o'clock—I opened the body after death—there was a rupture or fissure of about half an inch in the bladder—that was the cause of death—only ft violent blow or some external violence would produce that—blows with the head or fists upon the abdomen would possibly produce it, if the bladder was distended at the time—I do not think struggling would cause it—a rapture is not of frequent occurrence except from external violence and sudden injury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might it not be produced by retention of the urine alone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not without the bladder was diseased—I think from its appearance it was not diseased—I never knew an instance of rupture of the bladder from retention of urine, without the bladder having been pre<lb></lb>viously diseased—the urethra is sometimes ruptured—if a person had been drinking all night and the bladder were distended with urine a sudden fall might, perhaps, produce a rupture—he lived three or four days after the rupture—that is not unusual—some live seven or eight days—it is gene<lb></lb>rally so—I examined his person—I found no blows about him—the lower part of the abdomen was not at all bruised—it is not a part that would dis<lb></lb>colour very quickly from a violent blow—it does not frequently discolour from external violence.</p>

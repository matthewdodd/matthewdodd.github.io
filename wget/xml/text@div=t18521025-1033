                  </hi>. I live at 4, Holborn-buildings, and am a painter. On Friday, 24th Sept., about half past 11 o'clock, I was coming home, and saw the prisoner in Holborn-buildings—he does not live there—he was standing close to my door, and I said to him, "You did not get me locked-up last night, as you tried to do"—he said, "No;" drew a stick from under his coat, and struck me over the head—I fell down, my head bled, and there was a wound—I got up, and pursued the prisoner—I had had no quarrel with him, and given him no provocation, except what I have said—I did not hit him at all—I knew him very well—I was taken to the Hospital, and re<lb></lb>mained there a week—I lost a good deal of blood, and was very ill some time.</p>

               <p>for some beer, and saw the prisoner under the lamp post—I went to him and said, "Mr. Holland, you bad better take my advice and go home, and have no further bother this evening;" and while I was saying so, Hands turned the corner—I touched Holland, and felt a stick; I asked him what he had got there—he hit my hand off him, and said what he had got there he intended to make use of—Hands then turned the corner, and said to the prisoner, "Mr. Holland, how do you do?"—he said, "Very well, thank you"—Hands said, "Well, you did not lock me up as you thought for last night"—Holland made use of a very improper word, and said, "Take that!" and took the stick from under his coat and struck at the back part of his head—Hands fell down, saying, "I am a done man;" and the prisoner ran towards Holborn with the stick, and came back again without it—I ran after him, and he was stopped by a constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital. I examined Hands on 25th Sept., and found a deep scalp wound on the under part of the left side of his head, dividing all the soft parts—it was about three inches in length, and extended down to the bone—it was then bleeding—in my opinion a stick, if used with force, would cause such a wound—simple wounds of the scalp generally heal readily, but in this case acute pains in the head come on on the fourth day—he was in the Hospital seven days; he is better now—it was a bad wound.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner in his defence stated, that when he met Hands in the court, he, Hands, was about to take off his coat, and he, the prisoner, was frightened, as whenever the prosecutor got anybody down he injured them, and struck him in the breast with his fist; that he did not do it with any intention of injuring him, that he did not use a stick, and was not aware of it till he was taken into custody.</hi>)</p>

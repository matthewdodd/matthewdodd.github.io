            . I am a patrol of Hackney. On Saturday night, the 27th of May, I and Payne were on duty, and about twenty minutes past one o'clock in the morning, I came up with the prisoner, who was riding on a mare, which Jordan claims - the other mare was following quite close to it; he was endeavouring to cross a brook, quite close to the common; I went towards him, and he got off the mare and ran away; the mares ran back to the common; the prisoner followed after them towards the common; Payne and I, at last, apprehended him. I heard him say "It is a bl - y hard thing that a fellow should swing for it;" he had got the mares two or three hundred yards from the common, in the highway leading to Clapton; I was only walking towards him - he got off and ran away before I spoke to him.</p>

            . I am a watch-house-keeper. The prisoner was brought in on Sunday morning; he said his name was Waller, and that he lived at Tottenham or Edmonton - I asked which of the two - he said his mother lived at Edmonton, and afterwards said he lived at Hoxton; I said "Now tell me where you do live;" he said"Well then, I lodge at Dalston;" I asked where there - he could not tell me where - he said, but he lodged with Wood's carter. I found 12s. 3d. on him.</p>

            . I was on duty, and attempted to stop the horses - they were running from the common - the patrols were close behind, trying to stop them; I knew them to be the prosecutors' horses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was drinking at the Weaver's Arms public-house, about half-past 12 o'clock - I was rather intoxicated, and, when on the common, these men took me and swore I jumped off the horses; I never saw the horses - I had no stick nor any thing to drive them. I live at Dalston; I asked for a lodging at the Weaver's Arms, but could not get one.</p>
               <p>JURY to PILTON. Q. Could he escape without running towards the common? A. Yes, he could have gone to Clapton, but then he would have met me; he ran from me - there was no bridle or halter on the horse - he did not appear intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Two Witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

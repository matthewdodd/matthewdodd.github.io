                  </hi>. I am a draper's porter at 191, High Street, Dept<lb></lb>ford, two doors from Mr. Bennett's shop—I was standing at the door on 80th August about 8 o'clock, and saw Lott coming from the direction of Mr. Bennett's shop carrying a carpet on his shoulder—ne went round High Street towards Windmill Lane—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the same carpet; the pattern was outside.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi>). On 2nd inst. I went to Bateman's house—Lott was there, and this carpet was on the floor—I looked at it, and Lott said, "You need not look at that; I can warrant they have had this four years"—in consequence of that I did not remove it, but from what I heard afterwards I returned on the following day, and the carpet had gone—I then found Lott at 8, Southwark Part Road, and the carpet rolled up in a back kitchen—Lott was in the same room—I said, "What rooms do you occupy?"—he said, "This is the only one"—I said, "How do you account for this carpet being here?"—he made no answer—I said, "I shall take you in custody for being concerned with Bateman in stealing this"—he said, "I did not steal it; I only helped to carry it"—I then took him to the station.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The day the detective came to take the carpet, I went down to Windmill Lane to see Bateman, as I did not go to work because I was queer; and when I got there I saw the detective, and he said he was coming down for the carpet. I told him where it was, and that the room was let to Mrs. Bateman before he went into it. He asked me to carry the carpet to the station, and I did so, and was placed in a cell, and did not know what I was charged with.</p>

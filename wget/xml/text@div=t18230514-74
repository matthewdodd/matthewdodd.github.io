            . The prisoner has been in our service sixteen or seventeen years; he formerly lived in the house. On the morning of the 9th of May, Gray, the officer called on me. In consequence of what he said, Price was apprehended, and while the three were under examination at the office, the articles stated in the indictment were produced. I cannot swear to the powder and shots, but to the best of my belief the ten flasks are ours; they have no mark on them - they are made purposely for us. We took Price at his apartments - Gray found the flasks and escutcheons there. He said if I would forgive him he would serve me all his life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. I suppose you sell thousands of these flasks - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The escutcheons are frequently sold - A. No; they are in an unfinished state. We put them upon guns, but do not sell them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stoker of 18, River Street, York Road—I know the three prisoners by sight only—on 28th December between 10 and 11 o'clock at night, I came out of a public-house in Pentonville Road; I did not see the prisoners till Smith struck me on the left side of my face, I then saw the other two prisoners—I said to Smith "What is that for?" and then Clark struck me on the right side of my face with his fist; Smith then struck me again, and I fell, and he knelt on me, and bit me on my face, and Clark kicked me on my side—I did nor feel anyone stab me, but when I got up I found I was stabbed just below my elbow—there were four stabs on my arm, and five cuts in my coat—I did not see Evans do any<lb></lb>thing, she was close by while I was on the ground, but 1 do not know whether she interfered—I had never seen her before—I was taken to the hospital in a cab—the blade of the knife was broken in my arm.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, South Street, Pentonville Road—on the 20th December I met Evans and' another woman in Pentonville Road, outside the Builders' Arms—Evans stood outside the door with some<lb></lb>thing in her hand, I could not see what; she uttered an oath that she would do for that <hi rend="italic">sod</hi> to-night, looking in at the public-house door—I turned and looked, and saw the prosecutor and the other prisoner come out fighting—Clark and the prosecutor were striking, and one or two were fighting with them—both the male prisoners struck the prosecutor, but I did not see him strike anyone—I saw the whole of them fall down, but cannot say who was undermost—while Lodge was down Evans deliberately came up and said "Take that, you <hi rend="italic">sod,"</hi> and made a motion of stabbing three or four times; she had something in her hand—Lodge got up and dropped his arm, and blood ran down his coat-sleeve—the three prisoners all walked away together—as I passed the door I saw something dark in Evans' hand, but I cannot say whether it was a key or a knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 99, Euston Street, and am a baker—I was opposite the Builders' Arms, and saw Lodge and the male prisoners come out together; they were striking Lodge, and he was defending himself, as well as I could see—he was knocked down on the pavement—Smith was on top of him and Clark was alongside of him and kicked him on his side while he was down—Evans then got down on her knees and put something into him; I could not see whether she had a knife because it was a dark night, but she said "Take that" repeatedly—when he got up the blood rushed down his arm, and he staggered and fell on his back; I thought he was dead—the three prisoners went away together, and I followed them across the under<lb></lb>ground railway, got a policeman, explained the case to him, and he went with me; they went through the underground railway station, which is a thoroughfare, and into Gray's Inn Road, when the male prisoners went, I think it was through Dudley-Street, and Evans branched off to the left—the policeman and I brought Smith and Clark back, and Evans came back of her own accord; they said that they had done nothing—I told them they would be obliged to come back with the policeman and me to find out what was done—the police saw the pavement covered with blood, and of course they took them to the station.</p>

I am house surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital—Lodge was brought there suffering from loss of blood; he had three cuts near his elbow-joint, and in one stab inside his arm I found this knife blade (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) broken close to the level of the skin, and the point was in the bone; it took a great deal of force to take it out; he had to be put under chloroform, and I had to cut an artery and tie it—the wound was of a dangerous character, he might have had erysipelas or secondary hæmorrhage; it was more dan<lb></lb>gerous than an ordinary wound—he is under my care still—I should say that it is the blade of a pocket-knife.</p>

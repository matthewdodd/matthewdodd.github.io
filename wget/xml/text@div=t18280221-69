               <p>JOHN MARTIN. I am the father of the deceased. My son, John, would be twelve years old in March - he lived with me, and was taken ill on the 26th of December, he kept getting worse till the 23d of January, when he died; he had a doctor, and was admitted into the Northern Dispensary, New-road; the prisoner and him were play-fellows - they had not quarrelled - seven or eight days before his death, he said, "Oh! mother, that turnpike-boy! what he has given me will kill me;" I have no doubt he thought himself in a dying state; he said he had given him some kind of black stuff, in some tea; he did not say how he came to take it; whether it was of his own will, or by persuasion; the prisoner is older than him.</p>

            . I am the deceased's mother. Seven or eight days before his death he said, "Oh! mother, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210074"></xptr>turnpike-boy gave me some black stuff in my tea, and it was so bitter!" he used often, in his agony, to call out about the boy - he would take it willingly, no doubt, as the boy often gave him tea; I said, "John, what did you take it for?" he said he made him take it; that was when he was extremely ill; he did not say whether it was in lark, or what; he said his hands were tied, but whether he meant at that time, I cannot say; he was so very insensible, we could hardly get any thing out of him; he said the turnpike-boy tied his hands.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Fitzroy-square. I was sent for to attend the deceased on the 18th of January; he was received into the Infirmary, at St. Pancras; he was labouring under the effects of mercury - his mouth was much ulcerated and swollen; I have no doubt he had taken mercury; he said he got something in some tea, from the turnpike-boy, the day after Christmas-day - he considered himself in great danger then - I opened his body after death; the stomach was slightly inflamed; the large intestines were inflamed all over, and there were small ulcers - that might arise from other causes than taking mercury; I attribute his death partly to that and the mouth being slutted.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say his death necessarily arose from taking mercury? A. Decidedly not; the same appearances might arise from other causes; he had taken mercury, no doubt, but I cannot say that occasioned his death.</p>

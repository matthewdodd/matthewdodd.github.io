                  </hi>. I am clerk and cashier to Messrs. Knight, in Aldermanbury—on 1st July," about mid-day, I was in the counting house—I heard a noise and went out to the landing and saw the prisoner descending with a roll of cloth on his shoulder—I asked him who he was—he said he had been instructed by a gentleman round the corner to fetch a bale of cloth, which he would find on the stairs, and he was just taking it to him—I asked him who the gentleman was—he said he did not know, that he had a cart and could not leave and he had sent him for the cloth—I wanted of course to know something about the gentleman, and he said that he would go and fetch him—he lowered the cloth on to the stairs—I followed him into the street when he quickened his pace—I pursued him and caught him in Fountain Court—I brought him back to the warehouse and a policeman was sent for—this bale was certainly not on the stairs before I saw the prisoner with it—it is worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>

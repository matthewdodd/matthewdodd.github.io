                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman F</hi> 117.) On Sunday morning the 1st of August, I was going down Chancery-lane about twenty minutes before five o'clock, and heard a noise at No. 39—I went to the side-door in Cursitor-street, pushed it, and it went open—I got in and saw the prisoner—he had this coat under his arm—these candlesticks were wrapped up in the coat—this ring was in the pocket—this hat was on the prisoner's head—he had exchanged this old one for it, which was left behind; it exactly fits him—I alarmed the house, locked the street door, put the key in my pocket, and said to the prisoner, "I shall search you and see what there is about you"—he pulled out this file, a knife, and a small bag of matches, and said the property was given him by a person to hold till he came back—I said, "If that is the case I shall lock the door and let him knock"—no one knocked—I looked about the premises and found a pane of glass had been broken in a glass door in the lobby—I found the swing window of the water-closet was also broken—the house had been entered by the back kitchen from the area—a person must have dropped from the wall into the</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, and live at No. 39, Chancery-lane, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn—on Saturday night, the 31st of July, I went to bed at a quarter before eleven o'clock—the house was then secure, and the kitchen door was shut—it opens to a small area—I was alarmed about five o'clock in the morning by the ringing of the bell; the front door was open, and the kitchen door which leads out on the area had some panes of glass broken, the bolt had been violently wrenched off; the door was open—these are my can<lb></lb>dlesticks, they were just inside the front door when I came down; they had been on the table in the drawing-room the night before—this ring is mine; it was in the pocket of this coat, which is mine—it was in a small room on the ground floor—this is my hat—the prisoner had it on his head; I found a hat which did not belong to me, but which fits the prisoner exactly, in a room up stairs—there is a door which opens on the leads, two panes of glass in that door had been broken, the bolts violently wrenched off, and there were im<lb></lb>pressions where this file had been used—the person had got in as far as where the hat was, and could not get any further on account of a door.</p>

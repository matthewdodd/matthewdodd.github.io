I had to go as a patient into Guy's Hospital, and I arranged with the prisoner to take care of the articles stated in this indict<lb></lb>ment—I left them in his charge—while I was in the hospital he came to me—he said he had been honest, but now he was an unprincipled man, and I should be sorry I had ever known him—I found the prisoner at a fancy dress<lb></lb>ball at the Jacob's Well—he told me he should go there—I got an officer, and took him—almost all he had on except his shirt was mine—I then went to my lodging in Well-street, Oxford-street, where I had left the prisoner to take care, and I found there eleyen duplicates—all my things were gone.</p>

At this time the prosecutor's daughter was in want of shoes; she applied to one of her father's fellow-sevants for money to buy them, but was refused; I then pledged the silver spoons that her father told me to pledge, and with part of the money I bought her a pair of shoes, and applied the remainder to my own use. When my prosecutor returned from Brighton I told him; he said I had done quite right, that he was very much obliged to me, and I might pay him when I was able, what I had made use of for myself. I went to see him at Guy's-hospital; on one occasion he gave me the keys of his chest and box, and said that I might take anything I wanted and pledge until I got into work; at this time he was indebted to me for the making of two suits of clothes for his son, and always when I went to see him at the hospital I took him money, tea, sugar, butter, &amp;c, besides paying washing, out of the money I got by pledging his property. I asked him for the loan of a suit of clothes and other articles; he said I might take anything I wanted; this suit of clothes, &amp;c, I had on when taken, and what I pledged was not with the least intention to rob or defraud him."</p>

            . On the 30th of November last I was robbed of the things laid in the indictment, (mentioning them by name.) They were taken out of the house. (I was not at home at the time.) About a fortnight after, a constable and a keeper of Bridewell came with Terrin the evidence, an accomplice, and asked me, if I had been robbed? I said, Yes. Then Joseph Terrin said, that he was concerned in it, and mentioned the things I had lost. I asked him how they got in? He said, they lifted up the latch of the door, and one pulled off his shoes and went in, and so conveyed my things out to the others. That there were four of them in company. I went with a search-warrant where he said the goods were carried, but could not find any of them.</p>
               <p>Jos. Terrin. I went out with the two prisoners, and

               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Terrin. We got there between seven and eight o'clock at night. Watkins went in, and took the two quilts, and brought them out first, and after that the rest. There was no body went into the house but him. He brought out two pillow cases, two shifts, a pair of stockings, a pair of sheets, and a wooden horse, which they call a screen.</p>

On the 11th of October, about nine o'clock in the morning, this waistcoat was pinned at the door. I went out, returned about a quarter before one, and it was gone. I found Barker in custody, Dixon was taken that evening. They were strangers to me. I have never found the waistcoat.</p>

            . I was left at home, and saw Barker unpin the waistcoat, and give it to Dixon. I am sure they are the persons; it was about a quarter before one o'clock, I was looking at them through the window; Dixon ran away with it, and Barker came into the shop. I should think he must have seen me. I sent for an officer, who took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he stay till the officer came - A. Yes, and said he would leave all his clothes until he got the waistcoat back, and that he did not know Dixon was going to run away with it. He did not attempt to get from me. I saw Dixon at Guildhall next day, and am sure he was the person.</p>

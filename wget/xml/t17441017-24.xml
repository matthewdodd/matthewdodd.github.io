               <p>Q. Upon what occassion was this warrant served?</p>
               <p>Tiller. Upon a frivolous occassion, a quarrel, it was about 8 o'clock at night, the deceased was just going to bed, his shoes and stockings were off, and he denied leave to put them on. Mrs. Page desired to know whether she was obliged to go at that time o'night, and they gave her leave to stay, as they had her husband. He was carried to Mr. Townley's house. There was another assistant in the barbarity, who it was I don't know.</p>

We went to the Ale-house about nine o'clock, Mr. Townley went out to serve a warrant upon another person, and did not return till about 11 o'clock, and he was pretty much in liquor. Page wanted to go before the Justice to have the thing decided that night, and Townley said it was too late, and I said I believed it was not. Townley refused to take his word for his appearance in the morning, though he said he would leave 20 Guineas in his hand if he would take toward . Page went to the back door to make water , Long went to the door and caught hold of him by the coat, called him rascal, and son of a bitch, and said, What are you a going to make your escape ? Page said, I am no son of a bitch, I am an honest man, and have an honest wife, and several fine children . Upon that, Long shortened his cane and hit him several blows on the stomach and other parts; the deceased fell down upon the ground with these blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the blows given with violence?</p>
               <p>Tiller. They were given with great violence. Mr. Townley went to his bar and fetched out a short staff or truncheon, and gave him several blows upon the head?</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a Constable's staff?</p>
               <p>Tiller. It was a painted staff. Then the deceased begged for mercy, and said, for Christ's sake don't murder me. The widow and I fell down on our knees and begged for mercy. There was one

               <p>Q. Did she see her master do it?</p>
               <p>Tiller. She could not be off of seeing him do it, for she took the staff out of his hand. While she was trying to get the truncheon out of Mr. Townley's hand, Mr. Long, repeated a heavy blow upon the deceased's leg.</p>
               <p>Q. With what?</p>
               <p>Tiller . With a stick or a cane, I can't tell which - of a midling size.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he upon the ground all this time?</p>
               <p>Tiller. Yes, for he had not power to rise.</p>

               <p>Tiller. Upon the left leg, about the ankle bone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it done with violence?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174410170026"></xptr>Tiller . Really I think it was with a very good will that Mr. Long gave it, and in a few minutes after the blow was given, the deceased said Mr. Long had broke his leg.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened then?</p>
               <p>Tiller . Then Mr. Townley gave orders that the deceased should be carried to the Round-house. There were two men came to drag him out, and he said he could not go for his leg was broke; then they dragged him some doors from Mr. Townley's house, and

             said, Master his leg is broke, and then Mr. Townley came and blew out my candle.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did they carry him?</p>
               <p>Tiller. About seven or eight doors. Townley called me bitch, and bid me go home or he would do for me. Then the deceased's wife went to fetch her young child to lie there, for she was a Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get to the Round-house?</p>
               <p>Tiller. I can't tell, but I saw some men take him up to carry him there.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from the house where this was done, to the Round-house?</p>
               <p>Tiller. I believe it is twice the length of the Old-Bailey-Yard, but I am not a judge of yards in this case.</p>
               <p>Q. What other blows were there given?</p>
               <p>Tiller. Long gave him several blows upon the back.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the deceased's leg was broke in Townley's house, I ask you whether or no he complained that his leg was broke, before he was carried out of the house?</p>
               <p>Tiller. He did indeed, and they dragged him seven or eight doors, and I pursued them with a candle in my hand; and Townley beat the deceased with the truncheon, and said he would make him walk.</p>
               <p>Q. On what part were these blows given him?</p>
               <p>Tiller. I believe they were upon his back.</p>

               <p>Tiller. They ordered him to be locked up, and went away directly, they did not take any care at all of the Prisoner, and he was laid down upon the boards, and lay there for 3 or 4 hours.</p>

            . Mr. Townley and Mr. Long came and served a common warrant upon Mr. Page and his wife, they behaved very well at Page's house, they did not insist upon taking them out directly.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was this?</p>
               <p>Peate . I believe it was about ten o'clock when they took them out of the house to go to Mr. Townley's house; after they came to Mr. Townley's house, Townley went out and Mr. Page thought it long that he did not come in to do them justice; at last Mr. Townley came in and the deceased got up, Mr. Long took hold of the flap of his coat and said, D - n you you son of a bitch where are you going? With that the deceased called him son of a bitch again, and said he was going to make water. Long said, What are you going to make your escape? No, says he, I am only going to make water. Mr. Long took his cane and punched him several times upon the breast, and with his pushing him the deceased fell backward, and Long lays on very hard with his cane, (I don't know whether it was a stick or a cane, for some sticks are painted and look like canes ) then Mr. Townley went to the bar for his truncheon and laid on very hard, so, I believe it was very hard, but I did not feel the blows; I said to the maid servant, for God's sake, my dear, beg your master to have mercy , and the poor girl came out of the bar and said, for God's sake Master, don't commit murder; then she went into the bar and he struck him again; then the girl came out of the bar again and got the truncheon from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the blows fall?</p>
               <p>Peate. I believe they might happen upon his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he standing or lying?</p>
               <p>Peate. No, he was down all the time, for they would not give him time to get up, and he could not get up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner make any attempt to escape?</p>
               <p>Peate. No, he did not indeed.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to know that?</p>
               <p>Peate. I heard a crying out afterwards that his leg was broke.</p>

               <p>Peate. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she bring a warrant against Mrs. Thomas?</p>
               <p>Peate. I don't know that she did, there was a warrant brought, but I don't know what it was for - There was a talk of getting a warrant, and there was a warrant served upon Mrs. Thomas; I did not know it was for Mrs. Thomas till after Mrs. Page was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Thomas brought to Townley's house?</p>

               <p>Q. Did not the deceased say he would not go to the Round-House?</p>
               <p>Peate. He said he had his bail ready, and he would go to the Justice's, he did not say he would not go to the Round-House.</p>
               <p>Q. When Townley said he should go to the Round-House what were the words that he said?</p>
               <p>Peate. He said, Mr. Townley, I have my bail ready, they have been waiting a great while, and I'll go to the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he got up to go to the door, did he desire leave to go to make water?</p>

             . On the 28th of September I was at Mr. Townley's, Mr. Long and the deceased had a few words, I don't know what: Mr. Long called him rascal, and fell a beating him with a cane; there was a little staff which Mr. Townley had, and he struck him with it, and they repeated their blows very often. Mr. Long the Beadle broke the deceased's leg with his walking cane, and beat him as he lay upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the leg broke?</p>
               <p>Mussell . It was broke by the bar, and afterwards they dragged him to the fire side.</p>
               <p>Q. How long time was it between the beginning of this affair, and his leg being broke?</p>
               <p>Mussell. I believe about half an hour, or a quarter of an hour. - I can't tell how long, but I perfectly heard the bone snap.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased cry out that his leg was broke before Townley beat him, or after?</p>

            . I am an assistant to the Constable of the night, he sent me to see for Mr. Long, I went to Mr. Long's house, and they said he was at Mr. Townley's; I went there and the deceased was lying upon the floor bleeding, and Mr. Townley's maid was there (if she is the maid) and she said to Mr. Townley, What, will you have murder done in the house? and the Shoemaker, I don't know his name [Savage] was paying off the deceased as he was lying upon the ground, and he did not stir at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Savage strike Page?</p>
               <p>Gasson . Yes, a great many times, and I received several blows myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he strike him with?</p>
               <p>Gasson. With a cane or a stick, I can't tell which.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Page lying upon the floor then?</p>
               <p>Gasson. He was lying bleeding upon the floor, Mr. Townley pushed me on one side, and asked me what I struck his assistant for, for I really did strike his assistant on the head, and I said, Murder must not be committed in the house; I helped the deceased along as well as I could by the arm, and led him to the Round-House; when I had got him three or four doors from the house he complained that his leg was broke - I believe it was his left leg, I told Mr. Townley I believed his leg was broke: when he was in the Round-House Mr. Townley insisted that he should be put into the hold, and the Governor said he would not put him into the hold; and I went to one of the Overseers of the Poor to get a note to go to the Parish Surgeon to come to him; then Mr. Long came to the watch-house, and went to sleep, and Mr. Townley went to bed.</p>
               <p>Townley. Did you know any thing of the deceased before you came into my house?</p>

               <p>Q. When was it you made the discovery, had you got three doors or ten doors, or how many doors from the house?</p>
               <p>Gasson . It was about four doors from Mr. Townley's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him complain before he got out of the house?</p>

I went into Mr. Townley's for a halfpennyworth of tobacco, and saw the deceased<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174410170029"></xptr> lying upon the ground in the house, I had not been out of the house above a minute before I saw two men or more lugging him out of the house; they had not lugged him above two or three doors before he fell down and could not go any farther for his leg was broke. Mr.Townley came out and said, why don't you carry him along, and they said, Master, he says his leg is broke; Mr. Townley said, he shams it, I'll make him go, lift him up again, and punched him several times on the back with his short staff, and the man cried, don't murder me; then the men who had him under the arms pulled him a little more, then he fell down again, and the men lifted him up a second time: then Mr. Townley said again, he shams it, I'll make him go, and punched him again about his loins with his short staff.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it done with violence or gently?</p>
               <p>Caldwell. It was very hard to my knowledge, for I perfectly heard the sound of the blows; a woman who is one of the witnesses came by with a candle in her hand, and he called her bitch, and said I'll have you all by and by; then he fell down again, and one of the men who was lugging him along clapped his hand upon his leg and said his leg was broke. Then Townley said, take him upon one of your backs and carry him to the Round-House; when he was there a woman who had his head in her lap said to him, if you should do otherwise than well who do you lay your death to? He said to Mr. Townley and Mr. Long, and their assistant.</p>

            . May it please your Lordship and you Gentlemen of the Jury, on Wednesday the 19th of September the deceased was brought to St. Bartholomew's hospital, and on the 28th died; and I was in hopes there would have been a good care , for four days things went on well, but on Saturday about four o'clock the sister of the ward sent to my house to inform me that he was in convulsions; when I saw him I was surprized there should be such an alteration in two or three hours. She said somebody had been to see him, and had frightened him and put him into a disorder, by telling him his children were carried to the workhouse. I took all the care of him that I was capable of. He had a wound in his head, and for my satisfaction after his death I opened his skull, and there was no concussion or fracture which occasioned his death. As to the leg, the fracture was so oblique that it might be done by falling down, and not by the blow of a cane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe the wound on his head was the occassion of his death?</p>
               <p>Phillips. No, I do not think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the broken leg the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Phillips . I cannot say it was, for I was in hopes that no dangerous symptoms appearing, he would have done well.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a fever?</p>
               <p>Phillips. He had from Saturday a great fever upon him, great tremor, and was delirious.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his death owing to?</p>
               <p>Phillips. I believe it was owing to the fever.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not such usage as this produce a fever?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Yes, to be sure it might, but be pleased to take the other circumstances with it, that he lived four days, and had all the good symptoms that could be expected.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any fever for the first 4 days?</p>
               <p>Phillips. No more than he ought to have, for there must be always a proper heat allowed, in order for the cure.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not this usage, in your opinion, hasten his death?</p>
               <p>Phillips. I am ready to think, as he continued so long with good symptoms, that this fever arose from a second cause.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not a fright occasion this fever and convulsions?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Yes, I do really think a fright might throw him into those convulsions.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think this fright in other circumstances, would have occasioned such a fever?</p>
               <p>Phillips. I cannot assert that.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon the whole, whether in your opinion, this usage did, supposing it to be true, hasten his death or no?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Yes, I believe it did.</p>

               <p>Pris. Council. Where did he attempt to go?</p>
               <p>Winship . He attempted to go into the street, and then Mr. Long took hold of the skirt of his coat, and Mr. Page was very rustical, snatched Long's cane out of his hand, and struck my master with it; that was the first blow which was given on either side; then my master went to sit down again, and he resisted still.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he resist?</p>
               <p>Winship . He struggled, and my master struggled with him, and held him, and in came the watchman, Gasson ; then the deceased tumbled down, and fell a fighting with another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when he was carried out of the house, to the Round house?</p>
               <p>Winship . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any complaint before he went out of the door; of his leg being broke?</p>
               <p>Winship . - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he walk out, or was he carried out at the door?</p>
               <p>Winship . He walked out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What complaint did he make?</p>
               <p>Winship . I saw him as far as the door, and he made no complaint then.</p>
               <p>Pros. Council. Don't you remember the deceased's being bloody?</p>
               <p>Winship . Yes, but nothing but his head, his leg was not bloody. I took hold of my master's coat, and said, come away. My master had neither stick nor truncheon in his hand, till he went away with the deceased to the Round house.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Kinder. I went into Mr. Townley's for a pint of beer about nine o'clock, when Mr. Page first came in; Mrs. Page came in about half an hour after, and brought a warrant, and insisted upon it's being served, and it was served by Mr. Townley. He came in again about eleven o'clock, and said Mr. Page must go to the Round house. Mr. Page was very rustical, and would not go. Mr. Townley insisted upon it, and said it was too late to go to the Justice's; Page said he would go no where but to his own house; for he would be no body's Prisoner; then he was going to run away.</p>
               <p>Q. What way did he offer to go out?</p>
               <p>Kinder. Out at the back door next the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the back door go into the street?</p>
               <p>Kinder. Yes, Sir, he took Mr. Long's cane out of his hand, and beat Mr. Townley over the shoulders, and took him by the ears, and almost pulled his ears off, for I was the person who put some tallow to them. Page used Townley, Long, and Savage very ill - he walked from the fire-side to the door as well as I can go - I saw him no farther than out at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he carried out upon any body's shoulders?</p>
               <p>Kinder. He walked out as well as I can do out of this place - at the time they were going to carry him to the Round-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complain of his leg being broke?</p>
               <p>Kinder. He said his leg was broke; but his leg was not broke in the house - if any body gave the blow it was Mr. Gasson, for he came in and began to pay away, and then they all fell a fighting and quarrelling together.</p>

               <p>Q. What condition was he in for the first four days?</p>
               <p>Blowes. From the 19th of September, which was on the Wednesday, to the Saturday, he was in a fair way. On Saturday two men and the deceased's wife came and talked of an execution, and of some children going to the work-house, but whether they were her own or no I can't say. Towards candle-light, he began to be very delirious, and pulled his leg out of the box; upon this he had a sort of a shivering, his senses were taken away, and he was quite delirious; the bandages which were upon his leg were either rubbed off, or he had pulled them off, and I was obliged to get a person to put his leg into the box again, and it was obliged to be set a second time.</p>

            . I have known Mr. Townley about eight or nine years, and take him to be one of the most inoffensive men I ever knew, he is remarkably modest. There is another circumstances in his behalf, that at the election of officers, he was reckoned by all the persons present at the vestry, to be the most unexceptionable person to serve the office of constable. As to Mr. Long, he is a man that is very well regarded among the heads of the parish, but he is a little disregarded among the inferior sort of people, because he is by his office employed to remove nusances. I take him to be a very honest man, and incapable of doing such a thing to any body that is committed to his charge. My Lord, as to the place that these people come out of, it is the most infernal part of the Parish; I do not pretend to impeach the characters of the Evidence, but I am sure there is no good comes from thence.</p>

            . I have known Townley about 7 years, and Long about four years; Townley's character was always that of a quiet, peaceable man; and Long's is the same for what I know; he was my beadle last year, when I was Headborough, and always behaved in a civil manner; as to Bowl-yard, it is as bad as Drury-Lane, or Black-Boy-Alley .</p>
               <p>Mr. Harrison. I have known Long twenty years, I have had a great many hundreds of pounds of dealings with him in the Hackney-coach-way, and he always behaved as well as I desire any person to do - I don't think he would be guilty of such barbarity as he is charged with.</p>
               <p>- Hoddy. I have known Long 23 or 24 years, he has as good a character as any person in any parish whatsoever, and always behaved as well as any man whatever, and I believe he would not be guilty of any such thing as is laid to his charge - I don't know the witnesses for the Prosecutor, but Bowl-yard is a very wicked place.</p>
               <p>- Gibson . I have known Townley and Long many years, they are persons of very good characters.</p>
               <p>- Scot. I have known Townley between five and six years, he always bore the character of an honest man, a good husband, and an indulgent father; he was always very good natured, and used the Prisoners he had under his care with a great deal of humanity.</p>
               <p>- Gregory. I have known Townley seven years, he has the character of an honest, quiet, peaceable man. <rs id="t17441017-24-verdict151" type="verdictDescription">

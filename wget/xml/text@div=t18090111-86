               <p>Q. In the month of December was indigo in that warehouse - A. I rather presume there must have been; but there were valuable property there.</p>
               <p>- PEACOCK. Q. Were you a servant of Mr. Myers, a bricklayer, in Checquer yard - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of Friday the 16th of December, what time did you go to Checquer yard - A. Half past five o'clock. I saw three men loitering about in Checquer yard, I did not seem to take any notice of them at all, I passed close by them, I saw all three of the faces, they were altogether; at that time it was quite a light morning, I could see across a ten acre field. I went into the stable and cleaned the horse; I came out again to the dung hole, I unchained the dung hole and went in it, it is about four feet deep; I saw these three men again, I watched them, I saw them walk up to Mr. Gossett's warehouse door; I saw Taylor, the <rs id="t18090111-86-deflabel514" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

I was on the opposite side of the way where there is a wine vaults; I watched them, I saw Freeman and Taylor walk up to the door again, and when we walked down I saw Taylor at the door at work again; the others walked about, and just as I saw the watchman come I began to walk up the court; they saw the watchman, Freeman said, no nose; two of them ran up Bush lane, and Taylor came down towards Dowgate hill; the watchman took Taylor at the corner of the court; I came up immediately, saying, that was one of the men; Taylor struggled, he dropped an iron crow.</p>

               <p>- WAINWRIGHT. Q. On this morning were you called by this lad that has just been examined - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend any person - A. Yes; Taylor; I took him to the Falcon public house; I searched him, I found the fife upon him; he struggled when I took him; I saw a crow drop from him, and I heard it fall; my partner came up. This is the crow. I asked the prisoner Taylor what he was; he said a fifer in the Tower Hamlets; I took the fife from him; he said he bought it at Mr. Gerrard's in Bishopgate street; I went back to the warehouse, I saw there were two strong locks broke off, and the door very much forced. I left the prisoner at the Falcon; I was away about five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110064"></xptr>minutes; when I got back I found him there; I took him away and put him in the watchhouse, and locked him up; while I was away, he got away from a small window in the watchhouse that opens into a church yard; he made his escape over another wall.</p>

               <p>Q. Look round and see whether you know him - have you seen him since - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath, was the man that you saw at the Mansion house the man that you saw at the public house with Taylor - A. I should not know him again; I went with Taylor and the man to buy a fife at Mr Gerrard's; as we were going along I heard the word Jemmy mentioned; which of them spoke I cannot say; Taylor came into Mr. Gerrard's after we were in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have not you seen that man since - A. I cannot say; I do not know him if I was to see him.</p>

               <p>MR. GERRARD. Q. I believe you are a musical instrument maker in Bishopsgate street - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 16th of December, do you remember any person coming to buy a fife - A. Yes, three young men; the soldier I am sure of; the other prisoner, I believe he is the man, but I did not take particular notice of him; that is the fife I sold to the prisoner first; I sold that fife to Taylor three days before; there is a particular mark on it.</p>
               <p>Duncan. I beg your lordship's pardon, I think it is the man; he had a short jacket on at the time.</p>

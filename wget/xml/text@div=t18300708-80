               <p>RICHARD ELLIS. He never accounted to me for either of these sums - he paid me 12s. 6d. to the account of Rance, but that was not what she paid him; he has been making out bills to these people himself - he was detected by a Police-officer taking flour out, and selling it; I was sent for, and then I found this - I am deficient to the amount of these sums, and a great deal more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I booked my bread I forgot to pay this money - I went to work, took off my jacket, and found the money in my pocket, and took it to pay my master.</p>

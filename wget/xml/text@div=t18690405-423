                  </hi>. I am one of the surveyors of the Phonies Fire Insurance Company—in 1867 Sharman was insured for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on his furniture, and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on his stock-in-trade and utensils—on 6th January, 1868, the policy was endorsed in the ordinary form, making it effective for his property at 7, Lefevre Road—on 6th February a claim was made by him in reference to a fire, and he saw me at my office on the 12th—Spraggs after<lb></lb>wards came with him—Sharman said he had brought him that he might speak to me about the claim being correct—Spraggs said he had known Sharman twenty years, and had had opportunities of seeing his furniture and stock; that his property was kept on the first floor, and there was a room for stowage on the basement, which he kept looked: that he had several good prints in frames, mahogany chairs and south's, Chiffoniers, Leo tables, and other things, in fact his house was well furnished for a working-man, and that he (Spraggs) knew nothing of the fire until 3 o'clock in the morning, when Mrs. Sharman knocked him up—I read over some of the items in the claim and asked him if it was correct, and he said it was thoroughly true—I had told him that I was not satisfied with Sharman's statement—the trial at the Guildhall, when Sharman sued the company on the claim, lasted two days; the result being a verdict for the defendants—the claim has never been satisfied—in consequence of something which was told me I gave instructions as to the salvage debris of the fire, and I directed it to be sifted, and everything that was found to be carefully noted and pre<lb></lb>served—amongst other things were found thirty-six common beff-screws, four head screws, and a number of iron casters, some small hinges and locks, tools, clock-weights, &amp;c.—the metal produced could not have been reduced to its present condition by passing through such a fire as that at Sharman's—the casters do not look as if they had been screwed on furniture—they did not correspond with any articles of furniture mentioned in the claim—in my judgment they have been in a fire somewhere else, one other fire at least—there was nothing to indicate that anything like 120 work-boxes had been destroyed in the fire—there were no screws, or looks or hinges, to answer to such a number as that—if feather beds are burnt we usually find something in the <hi rend="italic">debris</hi>—it is difficult to destroy feathers; they clog together in lumps, and get crushed down by things falling upon them, and by the water; at all events, they get together by some chemical powers which I cannot explain—if there had been any carpets we should have ex<lb></lb>pected to find therein some portions of them left—in respect to books we generally find the covers, or the books themselves with only the edges burnt—we did not; find amongst the <hi rend="italic">debris</hi>, metals corresponding to anything like the articles mentioned in the claim.</p>

               <p>into pieces, and took it into the house—I had no more property in Lefevre Road than what I had in Windsor Street—I saw Spragge nearly every day before the fire—we went to a sale in Brick Lane, about three weeks pre<lb></lb>viously, and Spragge bought some bedsteads, and all kinds of things, a stove or two, and a bath, they came to about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether, and Spraggs gave me the money to pay for them—the next week we bought a lot more, a foot-bath, an old fiddle, and other things, amounting to about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—then they were taken to Spraggs' house, and afterwards removed to mine—the day before the fire Spraggs came and helped me to put my things into the room over the kitchen, so that they might not be destroyed—he said it would show there had been good things in the fire—Spragge brought some of the metal produced, the casters and bed-screws, to me, about the week before the fire—he said they could not tell at the office, and he could charge well for those sort of things; they would not know, when they were found after the fire, but that they had belonged to my furniture—they seemed to be in nearly the same condition then as now—he said they came out of <hi rend="italic">Tom White's</hi> fire, and that he had a whole lot of them, a man named Parrymore made a fuss about the fire, and most of them were sold—Spraggs placed these things in my house the night before the fire—my wife and lodger were at his house then, and Spraggs and I got everything ready, and when it was all right we went to his house and had supper—it was late, because the public-houses were closed—after supper I and my wife and lodger went home—the furniture which was not to be burnt, was placed in the lodger's room over the kitchen—the wood I had chopped up was taken into the back room—Spraggs said that we were to go to bed as usual, be<lb></lb>cause if the fire did not burn well, and the firemen came in, they could tell whether the bed was warm—he brought something in a paper parcel when he came the night before, and he said it would burn a church down—he told me about this after the fire—he said that by lighting a candle, and stand<lb></lb>ing it in the stuff it would burn down, and when it did so, the stuff would ditch, and then the fire would commence—the parcel was placed against the chopped-up pieces of wood—my wife and I went to bed about 1 o'clock—we undressed ourselves about 1.45—we smelt the fire, and I pulled my wife out of bed, and we went into the yard—I only had my frowners on—we did not make an alarm until the fire was well ablaze—Spraggs told us not to do so—I had the policy in my pocket—Spraggs said that he would manage the money—he gave me a book, sealed up, and said he had made a claim for 293<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and by his directions I posted it—he did not read over the articles for which he claimed—I asked him if he thought they would pay it, and he replied that they must—after the letter was received from Mr. Loveday, he told me that I should be questioned about my goods—he told me to say that they were purchased at a sale at Cambridge Heath—Mr. Loveday asked me if I could bring anybody to speak about my goods, and Spraggs went with me for the purpose—when he found that the company would not pay, he wrote a letter to Mr. Wood, solicitor, and the result was that we brought an action against the Phoenix Company—I never paid Mr. Wood a shilling.</p>

I am a marble mason, of College Street, Homerton—I have known Spraggs many years, and have worked for him—I have occasionally met Sharman there—previously to May, 1867, Spraggs told me that he had insured Sharman in the Phoenix Fire Office, and that Sharman owed him a sum of money—he said that Sharman was going to work for Mr. Scudder, at Old Ford—he had told me long before this about <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> White's fire—after Sharman's fire, he said that it had come off, and that he was in a fair way of getting the money that Sharman owed him, and he would take particular notice that he had it—I asked him where the fire was—he said a long way off—I saw the casters and bed-screws pro<lb></lb>duced, before Sharman's fire—I saw them at Spraggs' house, in Old Ford Street—he used to be in the habit of showing them to me, and speaking of the various fires he had had, and the success which had attended them—he used to keep these in a cupboard, in his bed-room; he said they had been through three fires, the last one being <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> White's, at Hackney Wick—before that <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> White was very badly off, and when I saw him the next time, was astonished to see how well he was dressed—Spraggs said that I was an old fool for not doing the same as <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> White did—I replied that perhaps I would—after Sharman's fire, I communicated with the fire-brigads men who were in charge of the premises, and then I saw the casters and things produced—when I next saw Spragge and Sharman, Spraggs called me bad names, and threatened to knock my head off for giving information; he called me an old villain and a scoundrel, and I told him I had done nothing more than my duty—Sharman said it was a pity there should be so much squabbling about it—I said if I saw a policeman I would give them both into custody.</p>

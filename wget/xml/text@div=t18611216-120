I am in the service of Joseph Hornby Baxen<lb></lb>dale, and others, of Haydon-square—the prisoner was a carman in their service—he was with his van at the platform where I was loading on 27th November, at the west side of the premises—he took an odd line from there—that means all the lines except the North Western—I checked his load, and took an account of the goods—there was no chest of tea there—I have a copy of the bills that were given to him—I took them in duplicate with a press.</p>

               <p>Messrs. Pickford's—on 27th November, about 4 o'clock, I was loading a truck for Huddlesfield—where I was loading was right round, you have to go right round, to get three or four hundred yards—the prisoner came on to my bank, and asked me if I had Birkenhead goods—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I do not mean Birkenhead, I mean Wigton"—I said, "No; that belongs to Old Marsh"—his van was round at the back—he left a minute or two afterwards, and I missed a chest of tea, within two minutes, which I had seen at the time he was on the bank—the number of it was 2,290—it was about a yard or a yard and a half from the place where he was—I saw no one with him—he had no business at all there—I communicated with Mr. Robinson.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I live at 28, Basinghall-street, and am foreman to Messrs. Pickford—about half-past 4 on this day, Metcalfe called my attention to a tea chest, in consequence of which I followed the prisoner's van to our establishment in White Swan-yard, Whitechapel, where he had to take the goods—when I got there I saw a chest of tea covered up in his van, with a sheet over it—I communicated to Mr. Lane that I thought there was some<lb></lb>thing wrong—the other goods were exposed—the chest was marked 2290—the prisoner had his bill with him—Mr. Lane asked him how the chest came there—he first said that he had loaded it at the Liverpool bank, where he had been to look for a delivery-book—I then left him in Mr. Lane's hands, and had no more to do with it—I had seen the van near the Liverpool platform a few minutes previous to the chest of tea being missed—to get by the van to where Metcalfe was loading, he had to go 300 or 400 yards round—the van was close alongside the Liverpool bank, where the chest of tea was missed from—he had no business there whatever—he afterwards, brought back a chest of tea by my direction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he not say that the tea must have been put there by mistake? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he said that he had stopped at the Liverpool bank to look for a book, that he must have pulled the tea in by mistake and</p>

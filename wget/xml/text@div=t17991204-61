             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a pawnbroker, servant to Mr. Spinks of Gracechurch-street; an umbrella was pledged with me on the 16th of November, by the prisoner at the bar in the name of

               <p>Mr. Kay. This is the umbrella that I borrowed of Miss Hammond, I am perfectly sure of it; Miss Hammond lives in East-street, Walworth, I know it by a black mark upon the handle, and from the general appearance of it, having frequently borrowed it before; I can swear most positively to the property.</p>

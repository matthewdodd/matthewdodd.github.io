                  </hi>. My husband keeps a milk shop in Stanley Street East—on 21st January, in the evening, I served the female prisoner with three new laid eggs, which came to 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>—she gave me a crown—I called to my husband in the parlour for change—he brought me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I gave her, and the rest out of the till—when she left, I went to the door; she crossed over and joined the male prisoner—I then handed the coin to my husband, who found it was bad—at the time I asked my husband for the change, another woman came in with a child—she afterwards left, and walked behind the prisoners.</p>

On 21st January, my wife called me into the shop to give change, and I saw the female prisoner there; after she left I bit the crowed, found it was bad, ran out, and saw the prisoners together, and a young girl with them—the prisoner Ellen then had a baby—I followed them to Shoreditch, where I informed an officer, and gave him the crown—I followed him into the White Horse and charged the prisoners.</p>

Mr. Shaw pointed out the prisoners to me in Shoreditch—<hi rend="italic">G R</hi> 13 followed them with me to the White Horse—I went in and told the woman she was charged with uttering a crown in Stanley Street—she had a child in her arms—other persons were there, but I cannot say whether she was with them—she said she knew nothing about it—I told the male prisoner, as he was in her company I should search him—he said, "You can do so"—in his breast pocket I found three new laid eggs, and in his trowsers pocket 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and two halfpence—I took him in custody—going to the station I had him by the right arm, I saw him shake his left arm, and saw something white go from it; a boy picked up two counterfeit crowns in white paper, and handed them to me; I showed them to him, and said, "I saw you throw something away"—he said, "It could not be me, you searched me in the house."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 48, Strand, in the house of Elisabeth Harris. On the 15th of January the prisoner came into my shop with a lad to look at a brooch—he pointed to one in a window where I had a drawer of brooches—I took out the drawer—he looked at one marked nine guineas—he said, "What is the price?"—I said, "Can't you see the figures? it is marked nine guineas"—he showed it to the boy alongside of him, and got fumbling over the drawer, and said, "Good God, are they diamonds?"—I said, "Yes, they are marked diamonds"—he said, "Oh, I don't want diamonds, I want something commoner"—I took the diamonds away, and showed him a cushion with common brooches in it—he selected one at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he fumbled about his pocket, and said, "I have only one shilling I will give you that as a deposit, put it away for me, I will call for it in the afternoon—my name is Jones"—I put his name on the paper, and put the brooch on it—they went away together—I had my doubts about them, and in the afternoon locked the drawer up in my iron chest with my other goods—next morning I got it out, and missed a diamond brooch worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was not the one the prisoner had examined, but another one—it was in the drawer when I took it out to show to him—I had not taken the drawer out between his being in the shop and my missing it, except to put it into the iron chest—nobody was in the shop but myself—it was about two o'clock that he came—he and the lad appeared acquainted—it was the prisoner that spoke and did every thing, and he selected the pin.</p>

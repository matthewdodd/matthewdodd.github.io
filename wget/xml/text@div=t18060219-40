               <p>Q. Do you keep the house - A. No, my partner Jane Rawson lives there; I live in Bevois Court, Basinghall street. On the 20th of January, a little before seven in the evening, my shopman informed me that all the remnants of lace in a basket were stolen from a broken pane; I looked and found they were gone. About half an hour afterwards I was requested by a neighbour to go into Mr. Dowling's, as a young man was taken there on suspicion; I went there and was shewn a piece of lace, which I knew to be mine; the prisoner denied ever having it in his possession.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know how this lace was taken out of this shop. - A. There was a piece of glass pushed out of the broken pane, it could not go any other way.</p>

             sworn. I am an apprentice to Mr. Ruffee, a tin plate worker, No. 6, Paternoster-row, Spital Fields; I was coming along Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it. - A. I cannot tell the day, I believe it was Monday; to the best of my knowledge it was between seven and eight o'clock; I saw this man at Mr. Dowling's window, and as he was standing there this piece of lace was flying with the wind by his side, I took hold of him and put him into Mr. Dowling's shop, where he put the lace on his left hand behind him on some flannels that were on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he lay hold of it from. - A. I cannot say, the lace was hanging out on one side of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it hanging from; from his pocket, his shoulder, his elbow, or where. - A. I cannot say whether it was from his waistcoat pocket or breeches pocket, it was somewhere thereabouts; Mr. Dowling sent for Mr. Cookson, he came and owned the lace.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw some lace flying. - A. Yes, he was standing at the window at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him standing in the shop, he was very near the counter; there was lace laying on the counter at that time. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear that there was no lace laying on the counter at that time. - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that you saw him. - A. Between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was not between six and seven o'clock. - A. No.</p>

             sworn. I am a constable, I produce the lace.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Is that your lace. - A. It is my lace, there is no mark on it, it is the pattern that I swear to, I know I had it in my shop, there is a yard and a half of it; I calculated that there was from five to eight pounds worth in the basket; they were all taken out of the window, and this is the only one found on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that. - A. Seven and six pence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I understand you know it by the pattern, and I take it for granted the pattern is not different to every other piece of lace in this large town, will you venture to swear that there may not be other lace of that pattern. - A. It is impossible that I should say that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was going by this place this young man catched hold of me and took me into Mrs. Dowling's shop, and said I had got some lace of hers; she said I have lost some tonight, I do not think that he took it, I think you took it; I was searched first, and after that Mr. Sapwell came in, he was not satisfied with that, he took all my things off but my shirt.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

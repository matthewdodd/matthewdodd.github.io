I was servant to Mr. Kitchen—on the evening of 24th February I was in Mrs. Kitchen's bedroom, sitting at needlework—someone opened the door and looked at me—I looked at him and said, "Who is that?"—he directly turned back and went into the spare room—there was a gas-light in the room where I was, and I had a fair view of his face—he locked himself in the spare room, and I locked myself in the bed-room and rang the bell very violently—the housemaid came up—we rang the bell again, and the under-nurse came down—I gave them instructions, and went across the road to a Mr. Beale—he came back with me—he then</p>

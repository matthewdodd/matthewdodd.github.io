               <p>Q. Were you in the room at the time this unfortunate circumstance happened. - A. Yes, it was on the 12th of May, I saw the prisoner come in, I was in the deceased's room, when the prisoner came in I was sitting on a chair, Mrs. Colley was sitting at the table cutting bread and butter at the time, and when the prisoner came into the house the first words that he repeated were, Here I come, it is my wedding day and I am come to make a murdering day of it; immediately as these words came out he plunged the knife into the bowels of the deceased, with that I arose up immediately off the chair and went towards the prisoner, I asked him if he had come to commit murder, and with that he made a pluage at me with the same knife which time the knife penetrated through my waistcoat and shirt and just grazed my skin, with that I waded it off with my hand, it did no further injury than just graze my skin, he made the second plunge at my breast, I struck him across the breast and he staggerd back into a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. You struck him into a chair. - A. Yes, when he made the second plunge at me I immediately secured his arms, got hold of the knife and took it from him, and when I wrenched the knife from him, I gave it to Mr. Elias, who came into aid and assist me, and for a few minutes I held him in the same state that I had him when I wrenched the knife out of his hands, after that I let go the prisoner, he arose up from the chair, he said I hope I have finished her and he was very sorry he had not finished me the same, I asked Mr. Elias to take charge of the prisoner and not to let him go out of the house, I went out of the house with the intention of going for an officer, instead of that, finding there was no doctor to assist the deceased I went and found a doctor, he came immediately and then I ran to look for an officer, I met an officer coming about three or four hundred yards from the house, I returned back with the officer to the deceased house, I gave charge of the prisoner, the officer took him away.</p>

He had not been in a minute before I heard the cry of murder, I went towards the house, I met the deceased coming out of the house bleeding, saying, I am stabbed, I left her and went into the deceased's house, I saw Ferguson having hold of the prisoner on a chair, the prisoner had a knife in his hand, I saw Ferguson take the knife out of his hand, Ferguson turned round to me and said, Mr. Elias you take the knife, I took the knife and put it into my side pocket. I told Ferguson to let him go and to go for an officer. I staid with the prisoner until the officer came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner attempt to get away. - A. No, when Mr. Lucas, the officer, came I gave him in charge and the knife also, the deceased died that evening.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHARDSON. I am a surgeon, I saw the deceased on the 12th of May, between five and six o'clock in the evening. I found her in a state of insensibility, I found a wound about three-quarters of an inch in length on the lower part of the left side of the abdomen.</p>
               <p>Q. With what instrument did it appear to you that the wound was inflicted. - A. It must be some sharp instrument, it was a smooth wound.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the consequence of that wound. - A. Whether she died of the wound or not it is impossible for me to say, whether that was the cause of her death, as I did not open her body, it is impossible for me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. You can tell me this, whether it appeared such a wound as might be the cause of her death. - A. It did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290042"></xptr>Q. When did she die. - A. I was called to her about ten o'clock in the evening and found her dead.</p>
               <p>Q. After you found her dead, did you examine the body. - A. Nothing farther.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot tell whether she died of that wound or not. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said this, that it was such a wound as might probably occasion her death. - A. It certainly was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else about her that was likely to occasion her death. - A. I saw nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Now be so kind as to tell us how often you saw her after you first saw her? - A. I was called in between five and six in the evening I dressed the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me how deep the wound was. - A. I cannot say how deep it was, it was about an half, or three-quarters of an inch in length. I ordered her to be put to bed, she revived a little, I then left her. About nine o'clock I sew her again, and found her quite insensible, I gave her some stimulating medicines, she recovered and was able to speak, she exclaimed, Oh my belly, oh my back. She was very restless, I left her then, it was about nine o'clock; about ten o'clock I was sent for again, when I arrived I found her dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray Sir, in your judgment, seeing all this and being sent for again and again, what, in your opinion, was the cause of her death. - A. In my opinion that wound was the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you what in your opinion as a medical man was the cause of her death. - A. In my opinion that wound was the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it. - A. I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the question I asked you before. - A. I did not understand your lordship, I could not swear that was the cause of her death, but I have no doubt about it. I wanted to open the body, but the father of the deceased would not admit it.</p>

I asked which was the man that stabbed the woman, he said, here I am; I asked the prisoner if he had stabbed the woman, he said yes, he had, I asked him if he had got any more weapons about him, he said no he had not, I searched him and found none, he got up, I told him I must confine him, he said I had no occasion to do that, he should go very quietly with me, I insisted upon tying his hands, he gave me a handkerchief himself to do it. Mr. Elias tied his hands while I held him. This is the knife that Elias gave me he said, that it was the knife with which he had stabbed the woman.</p>

I am troubled with fits, and being out of my mind at times by this man and this woman treating me as they have done for two or three years past, I might have done it, but one half what they say is false. This man cohabited with my wife, and when I came home, he turned me out of the house. On the Wednesday before I went to the house, and that very woman that has sworn against me, I trod upon her toes almost. She and my wife shut the window down, that women shut the door. I went to the hospital and sent for my wife, she sent me word that she would not come, she wished me better, I have a fracture on my skull, and sometimes I am out of my mind.</p>

On the evening he left St. Helena, in May, 1806, or the beginning of June, I had been in the carpenter's cabin, in company with the Carpenter and the captain's steward. I left there at ten o'clock, we retired to our separate beds; in a few minutes the carpenter sent to me for a light, which I sent him, and immediately followed myself; I found the carpenter and the captains steward breaking open the prisoners door, and when the door was opened, we found the prisoner laying on his cot, his throat cut in a most dreadful manner. We sent for Mr. Newberg the surgeon, he with a great deal of trouble sewed up the wound, the prisoner was very restless during the time, and attempting to tear it open. Upon examination, we found a razor under the bed, and the whole of the night he attempted to tear the wound open; the carpenter and I sat up with him the whole of the night, and we were obliged to have a man to be with him the next day. The whole of that night he appeared deranged, he fancied he saw a man with a bundle of ratans.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you an opportunity of knowing whether he had been at that time allowing his wife any maintenance. - A. His wife received his monthly money, due to him; if ever he took a drop of liquor it turned him into a state of derangement, he was refrained from liquor the whole passage out.</p>
               <p>COURT. When he was refrained from liquor he was in his perfect senses was he. - A. When he refrained from liquor he was.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BALE. Q. I understand you were a mess-mate with this man. - A. I sailed with him on board another ship, the Isabella, a West-Indiaman, in last July, he always seemed to be a man comical in his senses, and not like another man, he kept walking by himself fore and aft on the deck, and would not be sociable with any one. I was in St. Thomas's hospital with him a week before this happened, he there seemed strange and totally insensible. On Sunday about four o'clock in the day, the mischief was done, he left the hospital, he put up his crokery ware, knife and fork, and some other dirty things in a dirty shirt, and carried it with him, I saw no more of him afterwards until he was in custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. If he was out of his senses, how came you to let him go at large. - A. Nobody has any business to stop any person from going out, if I had known his business, I would have gone with him.</p>

            . I was nurse in the ward in St. Thomas' hospital where the prisoner was, I have observed him several times to be in a deranged state, he would get up in the night, and wander about, and talk to himself.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290043"></xptr>I have advised him to reconcile himself and content himself in bed, or I should be obliged to state it to the serjeant, he would try other means, to which I have had but a slight answer from him, he seemed to be in a melancholy state.</p>
               <p>GEORGE CHANBERLAIN. Q. I understand you were an officer on board the ship in which this man sailed, the Ceylon. You have heard that fact of the prisoner cutting his throat, do you know that fact. - A. Certainly, and his conduct was generally so strange, that those officers whom it was usual for him to mess with would not associate with him. And one instance besides, I now consider when the ship was in distress in the River Thames, and I expected from him, as boatswain, great assistance, he refused it, and took a boat and left the ship in that dangerous situation.</p>
               <p>COURT. When was it he cut his throat. - A. In some part of May, 1806.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you sail with him afterwards. A. I think it was between two and three months that we arrived in England.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send him to any hospital. - A. We had a surgeon on board the ship, he sewed up the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the surgeon treat him afterwards as an insane man. - A. He was not trusted with any command afterwards.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH GILLAM. I live in Worcester Street, St. George's in the East, I am a married woman and let out lodgings. On the 2nd of February the prisoner came to lodge at my house, he lodged there eight or nine days. He frequently at his meals would jump up and throw his knife and fork away, and walk backwards and forwards in the kitchen, and speak very incorrectly about some person, and by his discourse I suspected it to be his wife, he would get out of bed of a night, and walk backwards and forwards in the room, talking to himself. I did not think him in his right senses, he would frequently in his exclamations say, Oh God protect me. I have frequently observed him, when he has been in this way, to go into the yard and wash his head over to make it cool. About the 8th or 10th of February, he left me in the morning, he asked me for a little money, which I gave him; he told me he was going to be paid by the ship. I did not see him for four or five days, then he came and told me that his wife had arrested him, and seemed to be in great agitation of mind. After he paid me he left me, and I saw no more of the prisoner until I saw him in Newgate.</p>

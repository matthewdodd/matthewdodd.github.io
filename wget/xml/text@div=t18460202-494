                  </hi>. I was on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Tory</hi>, on her voyage from Hong Kong—she belonged to Liverpool—I went out in her from Liverpool, and was an apprentice—the prisoner was the captain—the crew consisted of about twenty-seven on an average—the outward voyage was conducted in the usual way—nothing unpleasant arose, more than might be on any vessel—we left Hong Kong in May, 1845, to return to England—Thomas Rason was an able seaman on board—he joined her at Sincapore—William Henry Rambert was</p>

               <p>the mate, and William Mars the second mate—we had a very valuable cargo, principally tea—we did not touch at the Cape, nor at St. Helena—the wind was favourable shortly after we passed the Cape—we missed St. Helena.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any reason given by the captain for that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He frequently told me he expected his chronometers were wrong, and he was out of his longitude—he asked the crew if they were agreeable to run into the island of Ascension, and they were agreeable—that would be a six days' run from where we were, on an average—our provisions and water were in a very low state indeed, when we missed St. Helena, and our allowance of water then was a quart a-day, (the usual allowance is from six pints to a gallon,) I was laid up ill, and did not hear the crew murmur about the short allowance, but I heard remarks made that the captain had some private reason for passing St. Helena—he did not succeed in making Ascension island, and he called the first and second mate down into the cabin, and consulted them whether it was best still to try to get to Ascension, or proceed on the voyage—it was agreed we should proceed—this was about the 19th or 20th of Sept.—(<hi rend="italic">look<lb></lb>ing at the log</hi>)—a day on board ship begins at noon—I occasionally acted as clerk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you at any time hear the crew state their inability to work on a quart of water a-day, without they had rest, watch and watch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not hear it then, I heard it afterwards—the allowance of water was further dimi<lb></lb>nished, and came to a pint a-day, and half a pound of bread, and I believe at last there was none on board—that was soon after the captain determined to make for home—I find by the log that we fell in with a French barque, about eight in the morning of Tuesday, 23rd of May—the stock of bread was gone about that time—I heard of the mate Rambert jumping over<lb></lb>board—we went on pretty comfortable from that time, till we made the island of Fayal—we arrived there, by the log, on the 22nd Oct.—the captain went on shore there—I went with him, also Rason, Johnson, Thompson, Yelverton, and Slack, two apprentices—I cannot exactly say who else—there was a boat's crew—the captain returned on board the same evening, with those that went on shore with him—at that time the harbour-master of Fayal was on board—we had met him as we were pro<lb></lb>ceeding ashore, and the captain gave the ship into his charge, and he went on board—we found him on board when we returned—when the captain returned on board, I should say he was perfectly capable, that is, he was in his senses—he appeared to have been drinking slightly, but was not at all intoxicated, in my opinion—I should not wish to form an opinion as to his state of drunkenness, as the way he acted in some cases was so different to what you would think—he always appeared moved after the death of Ram<lb></lb>bert—he was given more to drinking—he was rather in a little drink when he went on shore, and when he came back about the same state, or perhaps a little worse—I was with him all the time he was on shore, except for about an hour and half, when he was with the English consul—whether they drank any wine I cannot say—I did not hear him say anything about it then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the 24th Oct. had you occasion to go down into the cap<lb></lb>tain's cabin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot speak to the date, but on the day Rason died—I was in the cabin when Rason was called down into the captain's cabin—it was nearly midnight—the captain had desired me to step into the cabin—the beginning of it was this, a charge was brought against Rason, by a man named Joseph Morris, of having said he would have law when he came to England, or words to that effect—he told the cap<lb></lb>tain Rason had said so, and the captain desired Rason to be sent for—he appeared to act on that—he might have some private motive—I be<lb></lb>lieve somebody was sent to call Rason down—he came down—Yelver<lb></lb>ton</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020029"></xptr>
               <p>the apprentice, and Mr. Dunn, the cook, were also in the cabin, and, as far as I recollect, Julian Cordeviola—I should say the captain was more than half drunk—I had seen him drinking, in the course of the day, braiidy-and-water—I cannot say what quantity—to the best of my recollection, immedi<lb></lb>ately Rason name down, the captain took hold of him, and shook him on the sofa, or couch, where he desired him to sit, and struck him once with the bayonet on his side—with the point of the bayonet—I left before his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say anything to him on his first coming into the cabin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I recollect his speaking to him, but cannot say the words—I think he called him a d—d mutineer—Rason did not answer at the time, as far as I recollect—the captain did not do anything more to him while I was there—I cannot exactly say where the captain got the bayonet from—there were bayonets always about the cabin at that time—I recollect his taking it up after Rason was in the cabin—whether it was given to him, or he took it off the table, I cannot recollect—I asked the captain's permission to go to the water-closet, and left the cabin—there was a boy named Glover on board—some short time after I left Glover came and called me—in consequence of what he said I went down into the cabin again—the captain was there, and Dunn, the cook; I do not think anybody else was there, but there might be—Rason was laid down alongside the sofa—Dunn informed me, the moment I went in, that Rason was dead—I did not believe it, but ascertained that it was true by feeling his face, which was cold—the captain was there—I cannot recollect whether he made any observation—he looked as if he was more in possession of his senses than he was previous to my leaving the cabin—he appeared quite calm and unmoved—the body of Rason was carried out of the cabin afterwards, and buried the following morning—I read the funeral service—this entry in the log-book, dated 24th Oct, is in my writing—I cannot say when I made it—I generally filled up the log at noon—when any of these circumstances happened on board I never made "the entry till the captain came into a calm mood, till scenes of strife were over—I should say the entry was made the day after the death—it is signed by the captain—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Thomas Gair acknowledged to having come aft, armed with a handspike, by the direction of William Rambert. It was thought proper to put him with Thomas Mars and Lee, who appeared to have something further to do with the mutiny, in irons. Thomas Rason being ordered down to the captain in the presence of the un<lb></lb>dersigned, (who were all under arms at the time,) to answer for a further threat he had made, although about a few hours previous the captain had advised him to take care of himself, and not to attempt anything further; he appeared whilst under examination to be under a great state of excitement, which seemed highly suspicious, leaving us to judge that he had again been in the act of endeavouring to take the captain's life, if he should have the opportu<lb></lb>nity, and create a further mutiny; we the undersigned are sure, that if the captain's life was taken, that immediately afterwards they would take ours, and therefore used every precaution that we could. Thomas Rason, when leaving the cabin, after not being able to get any further evidence from him, took a fit; we endeavoured to restore animation by the usual means, but to no effect On Thomas Rason's entrance into the cabin the captain asked him what he was labouring under. Signed, <hi rend="smallCaps">G. JOHNSTON. A. G. SPENCE. ALEXANDER SINCLAIR. BARRY YELVERTON. R. FRENCH. HENRY SLACK. JAMES GLOVER. WILLIAM DUNN</hi>.") I made this entry at the captain's desire—when I came into the cabin, after being called by Glover, the captain told me Rason had died in a fit; and I heard Dunn, the cook, say so also—I think it was the day after the one Mars was committed to the deep, the captain desired me to say in the log-book that Rason had died in a fit, that he was taken in con<lb></lb> culsions</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020030"></xptr>
               <p>and died in a fit—I did not take on myself to believe it—I judged how he had died, but I entered in the log-book what the captain desired me—I think these six names were put to it the day after Mars was committed to the deep—I signed it a short time after I made the entry—I believe it was at the time—I generally signed at the same time as them—when any particular transaction took place the captain signed in the log-book, also the chief and second officer, nobody else before Rambert's death—after his death some of the crew were called to sign it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JARVIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you sailed with Captain John<lb></lb>ston before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—this was the first long voyage I made—in the outward voyage nothing particular occurred—the greater part of the men we took in at Hong Kong were new—Rambert, the chief mate, was new—I cannot say how many new hands there were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ascertain, or did the captain know, before Sept., that some of the hands had shipped under false names? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I heard nothing of some of them having left a vessel at Hong Kong on account of a mutiny—Rambert jumped overboard on the 25th or 26th of Sept.—I had not heard some days before that some of the crew told the captain there was to be a mutiny on board—I heard from Yelverton, when he was brought to the cap<lb></lb>tain, when near Ascension, that two of the crew had said before the morning the captain would be a dead man—I think that was more than two or three days before Rambert jumped overboard, I think not more—it might be four days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before that time had not the captain treated the whole crew with great kindness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was nothing very particular to complain of—Rambert, the mate, treated them unkindly, but the captain did not—before the state<lb></lb>ment of Yelverton to the captain he conducted himself quietly and tem<lb></lb>perately—he appeared to look after the interest of the owner and the interest of the ship as far as I saw, he was quiet and steady—the cargo was most valuable—the men grumbled about this time on account of the provisions—we were on short allowance—shortly after this communication from Yelverton I saw a difference in the captain's manner—he appeared very anxious, excitable, and nervous after that communication—he armed himself immediately after he heard that from Yelverton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it after that you first imagine he had taken to drinking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was drinking previous to that, but not in that excitable way—he drank spirits—as soon as he heard this communication he was in a much more excitable state than he was previously—I was not present when he chased one of the crew round the deck with a cutlass in his hand—I was ill—I had broken the cap of my knee at the time Rambert jumped overboard—I heard Richard French make a communication to the captain about the state of the crew about three hours after Yelverton's statement—it was before Rambert jumped overboard—he told the captain part of the crew had sharpened their knives with the intention of taking his life—I do not recollect that he mentioned any particular names—he accused Dunn, the cook, of a design on his life, but I do not recollect whether he said he had sharpened his knife—I should say this added to the captain's excitement—I did not hear French tell the captain the crew intended to seize him and take the ship to the continent—I heard it afterwards, but do not think it was French told him—I heard Cone tell the captain so—that was alter Rambert jumped overboard—I can<lb></lb>not say whether it was before or after Rason's death—I also heard Dunn tell the captain that French had sharpened his knife on both edges, and volunteered to be among the first to take the captain's life—this was half an hour or an hour after the statement given by French—I do not recollect hearing any</p>

               <p>other statement made to the captain-about the intention of the crew—as far as I recollect, I heard the captain ask Cordeviola when he called him down if he knew anything about Rason, and he said Morris knew something about it—that was shortly before Rason was called down—I recollect Cordeviola accusing an able seaman, named Gair, in the captain's presence, of having come to him and held a marlinspike to his breast, and say he would run that into him if he would not assist in taking the captain's life, which Gair admitted—he said he would run it into him or through him, or words to that effect—I frequently heard Yelverton mention to the captain about sharpening the knives, but the crew generally were making statements to the captain of the intention of others towards him, but I wish to state how that was—the captain sent for some one of the crew down into the cabin, held a sword over him, and threatened to cut or wound him if he did not state that he had heard some other person say something against him; and the person, to shield him<lb></lb>self, would do so, the captain having threatened to cut him if he did not state so and so about some of the crew having an intention towards him—the first com<lb></lb>munication I heard was made by Yelverton—his were all voluntary—French's communication against Dunn was voluntary, and Dunn's against French—it was after those three voluntary statements that the captain threatened to cut different people if they did not make communications against each other—I went with the captain into Fayal—I was on shore, and cannot say whether the crew made any complaint to the harbour-master when on board—I was only there just as he was leaving—the captain drank in my presence at Fayal, but not to excess—he was not drunk when he came on board—we only staid at Fayal one day—we did not come to anchor—before that the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Eglinton</hi>, an English vessel, had been on board for about an hour and a half—it was be<lb></lb>tween Rambert's death and our arrival off Fayal—he was about the vessel with the crew—this happened to Rason about three days after we left Fayal—between his death and our leaving Fayal Yelverton had not again made a communication to the captain about the crew, not to my recollection—French had made a voluntary statement—when Glover was sent for Rason, the captain was more than half drunk—I think he had been in a state of excitement the whole time—French had made a communication to him the day before—the day after we left Fayal—he was constantly excited, frightened of his life apparently—when Rason came down the captain shook him on the sofa—he struck him with the point of the bayonet—he stuck him about his thigh—at that time Yelverton was in the cabin, and I think Cordeviola—I did not remain in the cabin but a short time after the blow was given, it might be five or ten minutes, it was certainly five and might be ten—Rason still sat on the sofa after the blow was given—he did not say anything that I recollect—I was sitting in the cabin—Yelverton and Dunn were sitting down—they did not move that I saw—when I returned I saw Rason stretched below the sofa—I did not hear the captain call to him and ask him to speak to him—I looked at the captain—he appeared more calm—he said nothing to me about Rason being murdered—the captain was sitting on the sofa—Dunn was standing there—I did not hear any lint called for—I left again shortly after—I was not present when he afterwards stabbed the body with a sword—the body was sewn up in canvass when I performed the burial service—I do not know who did it—in any extraordinary case the mate usually signs the log with the captain—when I made the entry the chief mate was dead—I cannot say whether I made the entry before or after Mars' death—I signed it about the same time as the captain did—the captain always signed after every one else—every body signed this before him—they signed it a day or two after I made the entry—long before we got into the Downs—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020032"></xptr>
               <p>read it over to each of them—there might be two or three at a time—the captain, to the best of my recollection, was not present when they signed it—they signed it from time to time—two might sign at once—the captain called them in before the entry was made, and I told them they were to sign two entries I was going to make—I do not think he was present when they signed—the captain called me into the cabin, told me what I was to say, and directed me to write it in pencil on paper and bring it to him and he would correct it—I did so in this case—I wrote it in pencil, showed it to him, and then copied it in the log—I cannot say whether he corrected it in this par<lb></lb>ticular case, but he generally made some slight alteration—he would add some new matter and take out some—I cannot say what he did on this occasion—I heard the captain say Rason died in a fit—he said, "Did he not, cook?" and Dunn said, "Yes, he did"—that was at the time I returned to the cabin—I remember Nelson, one of the crew, being ill—the captain gave up the greater part of his water to him—the captain was on exactly the same allowance as the crew—he gave this to Nelson on two occasions—that was just before Yelverton made the communication to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You observed excitement about the captain from the time Yelverton made the first communication to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that was the day after we had fallen in with a French barque, and got wine and brandy and stores from her—the captain began to drink from that time—French was put in irons for a short time, but not Dunn, that I recollect—Yelverton's communication was made some days before we got to Fayal, and before Rambert's death—we fell in with the French barque on the 23rd Sept., at eight in the afternoon, and at six Ram<lb></lb>bert jumped overboard, on the 25th by the log—from that time we continued peaceably and orderly on board, till we got to Fayal on the 23rd Oct.—French made the communication to the captain on the 24th—it did not refer at all to Rason—the captain did not ask Rason on his entering the cabin what he was labouring under, that I heard—I was there—I wrote that in the log, as the captain desired me—may I state my reason for entering this in the log by the captain's direction, though I knew it to be false?—I saw how he was con<lb></lb>ducting himself, and if he got a refusal to do what he bid, I knew he was determined to put an end to any one's existence, in fact he told me so—I have heard him say so two or three times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say that in reference to the entries in the log? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he told me if he met with any refusal from me, I would not have long to live—that was after Rambert's case—I wrote the entry about that case, under the captain's direction, and was quite unconcerned what I wrote, resolving to tell the truth when I came before the proper authorities of the country—no grog was allowed by the ship's articles—the captain frequently gave the men grog all through the voyage—they generally had a glass of grog when they reefed the top sail—the <hi rend="italic">Eglinton</hi> was a merchant vessel.</p>

                  </hi>. I was an apprentice on board the <hi rend="italic">Tory</hi>—I shipped at Liverpool—on passing the Cape on the homeward voyage the provisions and water fell short—on the night we expected to make Ascension Island I was forward with Rason and some of the crew—we were on short allowance at the time (I think it was before we fell in with the French barque)—I asked Rason if he thought we should make the land before morning—he said he did not know, but if we did make the land, he would put a blue shirt on the fore yard-arm, so that some of the men-of-war's men might come on board, and he would let them know how they had been treated during the passage, and the captain would be no more captain of the <hi rend="italic">Tory</hi>—that was all I heard to the best of my recollection—some time after the captain sent on deck for me into the cabin—it was after we fell in with the French barque—I think it was the day after—he began to speak to me about how the mate had insulted him, and said he could judge by the mate's appearance that there had been something going on that was not right, and asked if I had heard anything about it—I said I did not hear anything at all—he took the cutlass in his hand, and said, "Tell me this instant, did not you hear any person</p>

               <p>threatening my life"—I told him I did not, and he sent on deck for French, and said, "French, were you not forward and heard Thomas Rason say, if we did not make the island of Ascension before morning, he would have my life?"—French said he did hear him say so, and that Yelverton heard the same—I told him what I had heard Rason say—French told him they had sharpened their knives on the grindstone to take his life—the captain began cursing me that I was a pretty apprentice in not coming to tell him before—he went on deck, and sent for me to come on deck about half an hour after—I went and found him there, and the two mates and carpenter—they were armed—I had no arms—the crew were all aft at the time—he asked the crew if he had not always acted upright to them, or something, and they said he did—Rason, Lee, and Cone were aft at the time, and in irons, and the captain was cursing at them, and cutting at them—they were still in irons—Rason was in one part of the vessel, and the others at the break of the poop—I saw the captain cut at each of them with the cutlass—he cut them on the head and face—I saw them all three bleeding—they remained in irons till the next afternoon—till Rambert jumped overboard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after Rason's death was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think the next night—he did not say anything more the same night that I recollect—he was rather intoxicated the next night—he drank a great deal more after falling in with the French barque than before—he was generally rather drunk when he used the expression about the battle of Boyne—before Rambert's death the captain slept alone in the cabin; afterwards somebody slept in the cabin with him—I signed the log-book at different times—this is my signature to the log—I think I signed it the day after Rason's death—I knew he did not die in a fit—what I said was read over to me several times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to sign that Rason died in a fit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The captain said, if we would not sign, he would cut our hearts out, and make us sign with our hearts' blood—I knew Rason did not die in a fit.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Crass-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you belong to the Isle of Man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I left there two years ago—I was not charged there with shooting a man—I left because I wished; that Was my only reason—I was never charged with shooting a man, and never did shoot at any man—it was after we fell in with the French barque I told the captain what the crew had said—nobody was present—Spence was not present that I am aware of—I might have made a communication in his presence.</p>

               <p>when the captain came on deck, there was nobody there—it was before Rambert's death that Rason, Lee, and Cone were in irons, for Rambert was there armed—I think he jumped overboard the next day, but am not certain—at the time the captain cut at them with the culass they were all three to<lb></lb>gether on the poop—Cone was near the half-hatch—they were all aft at the break of the poop, sitting on the deck, with their feet and hands ironed—he cut them about the head and face—I could see the blood running over their face—he cut them a good many times—I heard him strike Cone fifty times when he was on the mizen-top—he cut them a great many times when on deck, sometimes with the sharp edge of the sword, with the flat, and back—they bled—some of the crew were aft—the men were <hi rend="italic">singing</hi> out when they were cut—they were afterwards hawled up to the top, and when there he cut Cone I should say fifty times—he was about a quarter of an hour slashing at him, cutting him the whole time—he was still in irons—I think he had no anchor shackle on his neck, but the other two had—his hands and feet were ironed at the time to the best of my knowledge—they were taken down after Rambert jumped overboard—I think that was the next day—they were in the tops at the time he jumped overboard—when they were taken down they were taken into the cabin, and I believe the captain gave them each a glass of wine, but I was not there myself—they were sitting there with the captain about an hour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Between the time of leaving Fayal and the death of Rason, had you stated anything to the captain about what the crew had done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he had called the crew down several times, and I heard the greater part of the crew telling things of each other when he called them down—the first time Rason was called down that night I think Spence and French were present—I cannot recollect who else—he was cut a good deal on the first occasion on the head and face—when he came down the second time the blood was dried up—there were the marks of blood on his temples and head, more than one cut—Cordeviola and Spence were present on the second occasion, but Spence went out of the cabin when he was called—I cannot recollect Slack being there—I am not sure he was not there—I saw a boy called <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi> in and out—I cannot say whether he was there at the time of the blows—Dunn was there to the best of my knowledge when he came into the cabin—there was nobody there when he was stabbed but Cordeviola—when he came down the first time the captain had the cutlass in his hand—he might have said, "This is the arm that won the Boyne," &amp;c., while he held the cutlass—he did when he had the bayonet, and was saying it all night nearly—he struck him two or three times or so with the cutlass the second time he came down, on the head and body, <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> it against him—he did not stab him with the cutlass—he struck him with the blade of it once or twice—I am certain he struck him on the head with the cutlass more than once, and two or three times with the flat of it—I saw the blood running from him—I did not pay atten<lb></lb>tion whether he cut him more than once—he afterwards put it down, took up the bayonet and rushed at him with it—he took the bayonet off the table by his side—I do not recollect his calling anybody first—I did not see anybody come before he stabbed him—I saw him take up the bayonet—the cabin was light—he put down the cutlass and had the bayonet in his hand afterwards—I believe he took it up—I did not see it given to him—I do not suppose any<lb></lb>body could have come into the cabin and give it to him without my seeing it—to the best of my knowledge he took it up himself—I saw the bayonet on the table—I did not hear him call to anybody for it—he might have done it—he put the cutlass down and had the bayonet in his hand at the instant—he then pitched him backward and forward with his left hand for a few minutes—he raised him from the sofa and pitched him backward and forward—Cordeviola</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then he had not the cutlass and bayonet both in his hand together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he put the cutlass to the Haunch, and stamped his foot down and said, "You see what this fellow has brought on himself, and I will serve you out the same way"—he then <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the cutlass into his body—not more than once that I am aware of—that was about an hour or two after he was stabbed.</p>

               <p>told them to turn to, and they said they could not turn to on a quart of water a day—this was the day we were in the parallel of Ascension, the day we expected to make it—Rambert went down to the cabin, and the captain came on deck with him—the captain had nothing in his hand when he came on deck—he came up directly, went forward, and said if any man came aft the wind<lb></lb>lass he would shoot him—he and Rambert afterwards went on the poop—I was at the wheel at the time, and heard the captain say to Rambert that he would have them on a pint of water, and after that he would see them glad to take a wine glass, and after that he would see them hanging at the main-stay like porpoises, sucking each other's blood—when I was relieved from the wheel and went forward, I told the crew what I had heard the captain say—this was about four or five days before we fell in with the French barque—I remember the day before we fell in with the barque—there was a vessel in sight in the course of that day before dinner, but the <hi rend="italic">Tory</hi> had kept her course, and had not made for that vessel—about dinner time that day, French came into the forecastle with his knife sharpened at both edges—Rason was in the forecastle at that time, and most of the crew—French said if the captain touched him, he would have his guts out—I had said we had better go aft to the captain and ask him for some more stores, and if he was to offer to take any person's life, to confine him till we got to a British port—when French made use of the expression I have named, Rason said it could be done without murder—that was all that passed—next day we fell in with the French barque, and got provisions, water, wine, and brandy—I mentioned to the captain that evening, the 23rd of Sept., what I had heard said by some of the crew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to tell the captain on that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I had heard that French had told the captain that I was going to secure him in the lower forecastle and murder him—on that evening the captain, the two mates, the carpenter, and the two apprentices, came on deck together—they were not armed when we came on the poop—the captain said that Rason had forsworn his life away—Rason said he had not—the captain did not say anything to any of the other men—he then ordered us off the poop, Rason, Cone, Lee, and myself—we went—on that the captain took up his cutlass and cut Rason on the shoulder, as he was going off the poop—the three men were put in irons about half an hour afterwards—Rason was bleeding at the time—they remained in irons three days—they were first placed on the main hatch for two days, and the night before Rambert's death, Rason and Lee were put on the main-top, with shackles round their necks, and Cone was placed in the mizen-top—that was about seven o'clock in the evening—they remained there until after Rambert had gone overboard, which was about four o'clock next morning—they were then brought down and released—between that time and Rason's death, everything was quite quiet on board the ship—I remember, on the night of Rason's death, his being sent for to the cabin—I cannot say whether he was sent for more than once—that was about a quarter past twelve o'clock at night—I was in the pantry when he came into the cabin—I could see into the cabin from the pantry—the cabin door was left open, and I could hear what was said—there is a door to the cabin, and a passage between the cabin and pantry about three feet wide—there is a door to the pantry to shut it off from the cabin—both the doors were open—the first thing I saw when Rason came down was, the captain took him and <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> him about the cabin—I did not observe whether the captain had anything in his hand at that time—he said to Rason that he would have his life—Rason begged for mercy—the captain said he would have none on him—I did not see the captain do any<lb></lb>thing, but I heard a noise as if the captain was striking the bayonet into his</p>

               <p>head—I took it to be that—the boy Glover came and told me the captain had killed Rason—I went on deck and got some water, and then I went into the cabin—when I got into the cabin Rason was lying on the captain's couch—he was just breathing a little—the captain said, "Speak two words to me, Rason"—I saw at that time that he had received two wounds in his left breast—I did not observe any other—the captain had nothing in his hand when I went into the cabin—I did not take notice of anything in his hand before the death of Rason—there was a bayonet on the floor when I went in on Glover calling me—I told the captain he had better get some lint and put on the wound—the captain sent Glover for some—he brought some cotton, which the captain put on the wound—Rason then died—his body was taken out by the pantry door, just outside the cabin door—it remained there till about a quarter past four o'clock—I saw the captain place his cutlass on the stomach of the dead body, and he said to Mars, who was in the cabin, "See what you have brought this man to"—the body was afterwards taken to the top-gallant forecastle—I told David Johnson to wash it and put clean clothes on it—the captain ordered five men to take it to the top-gallant forecastle—I cannot say who the men were that carried it—I did not assist—I afterwards signed the log—I was aware that the log stated that Rason died in a fit—I had said nothing before that as to Rason having died in a fit—the captain said he would put down in the log-book that Rason had died of convulsions—I was in the cabin when French said some of the men would not sign it with pen and ink, and he said if they would not sign it with pen and ink, he would cut out their hearts, and make them sign it with their own heart's blood.</p>

               <p>he said to Mars, "See what you have brought the man to"—that was all he said—the occurrence between the captain and the mate, on the poop, was about four or five days before we spoke the French barque, the day we were off Ascension—I knew that the water and bread was very abort—we had as much as could properly be allowed us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you then to say you would go to the captain and ask for more stores? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because there were other things that might have been given, such as ginger and wine—I do not mean part of the cargo, but things in the cabin—ship's stores—I did not say if he did not give them, I would confine him—I said we would go and ask for stores, and if he offered to take anybody's life, we would confine him—it was not exactly on that that one of them said he would rip his guts out—it was only French I heard say that—Rason said they could do it without murder, and I said I would confine him—all the crew said it would be the best way to confine him, if he did offer to take any person's life—I do not know of the captain's having given up some of his own water to Nelson, who was sick—I heard of it afterwards, in the Channel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you had had some quarrel with the captain about a woman on board? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was a Mrs. Blewitt—a charge was made against me for living with that woman—it was not so—I did not live with her on board the ship—I do not live with her now—I did when I arrived in England—I went and lived in lodgings with her—I was not taken up for robbing her—I was never taken up on any charge before a Magistrate—I went down to the Thames police of my own accord, with her and a policeman—she made a charge against me at the station—I did not go before a Magistrate—I and Mrs. Blewitt, and a policeman, went together, before one of the officers at the Thames Police-office—I was taken there for taking 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of my own out of Mrs. Blewitt's box—she charged me with stealing it—the officer asked whether the money belonged to me—she said, "Yes," and I was dismissed.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you not go down into the cabin, and tell the captain that the mate wanted the crew to go aft to take his life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; oh, yes, I did—I was over the ship's side, painting—I was sent down, and told him what the mate had said when he went forward—the captain was cutting and hacking the men about—I did not tell him the mate wanted to take his life—I told him he wanted us to come aft and make the captain fast, or else he would murder all hands—I am certain I did not tell him the mate wanted us to go aft and take his life.</p>

               <p>murder all hands—I am sure I did not say it was to take his life—I cannot say what day it was—it was after Rambert jumped overboard, and a good bit before Rason's death.</p>

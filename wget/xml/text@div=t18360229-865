                  </hi>. I live with Alfred Simpson, a hat manufacturer, in Great Guildford-street, Borough. On Saturday evening, the 27th of February, about seven o'clock, I was making up the accounts of the men's work, and took it into the parlour to Mr. Simpson—during this time the prisoner was missing—he was a workman in the shop—I came back and paid the men—I called him three times, but he did not appear—I paid another man for him—he is a finisher off hats—all the men were paid off, ex<lb></lb>cept him—four hats were missing out of the warehouse, between six and nine o'clock that night and the Monday morning—I paid the men between half-past seven and eight o'clock—the policeman H 44 gave us information, and produced a hat—the prisoner had access to the warehouse, as the door was open.</p>

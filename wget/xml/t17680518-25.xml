            . This day fortnight, between one and two o'clock, the prisoner came to my house (the Carlisle public-house) in Shoreditch, and called for a pint of beer; she asked me where my little boy was, saying, she should be very glad to see him, that he was just like a little boy she had that died, and said she had something to give him; she asked where he went to school, I told her; after she had drank her beer; she went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176805180020"></xptr> to the school-mistress, who can inform the court farther.</p>

            . The little boy comes to school to me; the prisoner came to my house on the 5th of May, and asked if there was not a little boy came there, whose father lived at the Carlisle, and described his dress; I said, yes; she said, his father has sent me for him; she took him in her arms, and carried him out of the yard, I thought very tenderly; he then had a pair of silver buckles in his shoes, which had been his mother's that is dead.</p>

            . I lodge at Mr. Crowther's. On the 5th of May I saw the prisoner sitting drinking a pint of beer there; she asked for the child, saying she had a child died much like it; the child was called in; she gave him two or three crabs; the father told the child he must go to school, he went; the prisoner asked him where the child went to school; he told her; she said she wondered he let him go alone.</p>

            . I lodge at the school-mistress's. Between two and three in the afternoon that day, the prisoner came down the yard part of the way, and returned back again; then, she came again and asked for the child; she took and carried him out of the yard, that is all I saw of it.</p>
               <p>Crowthers. The child came home without his silver buckles in his shoes, or sleeve buttons in his shirt; he had them both on when he went out to school; I asked him where they were; he told me the woman that gave him the crabs had taken them.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is the child?</p>
               <p>Crowthers. He is five years and a half old; the prisoner has been at my house once or twice, but I never knew where she came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the buckles or buttons again?</p>
               <p>Crowthers. No, I never did.</p>

On the 2nd of September, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was coming home with two loaves of bread under my arm, and some butter on the top of them; I had had a little drop of beer, but could not say I was tipsy, nor very sober - I had had a heavy day's work; three of these chaps met me, and knocked me down - I did not know the other two; I had known the prisoner for twelve months, and have known his father and mother these fifteen years - I cannot say which of them knocked me down first, but he is the last man that knocked me down; they then took my money, and the bread and butter from me - I cannot say which of them it was, because they knocked me into the kennel; I had five shillings in my pocket - I am sure it was in my pocket when they knocked me down; I had seen it just as I left the public-house, not above two hundred perches from the spot - I had settled my wages there, and put the money into my waistcoat pocket; all the five shillings were taken - two of them went away; the prisoner stuck to me, and followed me; the Policeman saw him throw a stone at me - I had got up again, and was making my way home in gores of blood; the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080024"></xptr>followed me a second time, and knocked me down with a stone, which the officer, who took him, has got.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the stone strike you? A. I cannot say the exact spot, but my skull-bone was laid open; all the wounds now in my face were made that night by those persons - I have been in the London-hospital ever since, and have come from there now; I had nothing to lose when I was knocked down a second time; they must have knocked me down the first time with a stone, because I got two very heavy wounds in my chin; I had a half-crown and a shilling in my fob, they did not get that - I was sober enough to be certain of the prisoner.(The witness had two or three plasters on his face.)</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 2nd of September I was in King-street, and heard a cry of Police! I went and found the prosecutor laying on the ground - he got up and said he had been robbed and murdered; it was a dark night, and I could not see that he was hurt, but advised him to go home; he went along some distance before me - the prisoner came up to me, and wanted me to go and drink with him, which I refused; he said the prosecutor had given him twenty days just before, and asked me not to take notice of him if he shoved him down - I told him to go about his business, and presently I saw him shove him down in the gutter - he then stooped, as if to take up something; I heard a blow, and the old man fell down - I ran up to him; he was bleeding dreadfully - the prisoner was then gone; he came round the corner presently afterwards, and I took him - I found a large stone there, with blood on it -I took the prisoner, and found 3s. 51/2d. in money upon him, and a pocket-book.</p>

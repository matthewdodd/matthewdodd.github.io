On the 26th of April, between three and four o'clock, my daughter was cleaning the bed-room, which is on the ground floor; I was at the lower end of the passage, and saw the prisoner come out of the bed-room window (which opens into the passage) with something under his arm, but I could not tell what - the window was open to let the air in; I have known him six or seven years; I ran up as hard as I could, but he got out before me, and by the hospital wall I saw him running; I called, Stop thief! he pulled this box from under his arm, and threw it away - I took it up; I was within two yards of him, and am certain of his person - he got away, and was taken in three days; I have had the box in my possession ever since - it is mine; I had seen it on my bed-room drawers that morning, and taken some receipts out of it - it now contains several receipts, but the bond (which was in it) is gone; I had seen it in the box on Sunday - the box is generally in the drawers, but I took it out the day before; the drawer was not locked - the box had no lock; when he threw it down, the papers flew out, and I think the bond<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290022"></xptr>was lost in that way; I picked up all I saw - I cannot swear the bond was there when he took the box.</p>

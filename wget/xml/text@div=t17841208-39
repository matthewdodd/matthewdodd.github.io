               <p>On Wednesday the 24th of November, a little before five in the afternoon I was coming down stairs, and just before I got down, I heard a violent breaking of glass, I thought a porter had been coming by; I asked my daughter that was in the shop what was the matter, she said the glass was broke, and before I could get to the shop door there was an alarm of stop thief; several people came about the door, and in a few minutes somebody came, I cannot tell who, and said they had got the man, and he is coming over presently, the man was brought back within seven or eight minutes, he was brought into my shop; a gentleman immediately came in, and said here is your mug, the mug had my own private shop mark upon it; the prisoner said nothing, the mug stood in the shop window, the third pane high.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday afternoon about a quarter before five, the 24th of November, I was gathering my pots at the corner of Brook-street, I looked across the way, and saw two men at Mrs. Clarke's window, and one of them put both his arms through the window and took out a mug, and run across the way; I tried to lay hold of him, and he knocked me down, I am sure this is the man.</p>

               <p>As I was going up Holborn, about ten yards above Mrs. Clarke's door, nearly opposite Brook-street, I heard a sudden crash of glass, I turned about and saw nobody for a quarter of a minute, immediately I saw the prisoner cross opposite Brook-street, and run as fast as he could; I pursued him, and was close to him two or three times, but he rather gained ground of me, he was not above ten yards from me any time; I thought to have caught him, he turned round the corner of Gravel-street, which is a pretty short turning, I was in the middle of the street, he crossed over it; half way in Gravel-street there is a little passage and a man tripped him up, and he fell in the kennel, I took him by the collar and lifted him up, and walking two or three steps all of a sudden a person gave me this tankard into my hand, then we took him to the shop, that is all I know of the matter, I only know of taking him to the Compter.</p>

               <p>I was going down Holborn, and I saw the prisoner pass me, not a minute after I heard the break of a window, and I heard the voice of stop thief, I saw the prisoner cross with the tankard in his hand, I followed him, I never lost sight of him, I saw him drop the tankard, he is the same man, he dropped the tankard in Gravel-street; the person that picked up the tankard is not here, I saw it picked up, and it was given to me, and I gave it to Mr. Harper.</p>

The prisoner came to our warehouse, about one o'clock in the afternoon, and told me he wanted about 70l. worth of ribbon; and asked me, to show him a sample, which I did on the counter, and told him the prices. I said, that I had better give him a written list of them. I went to the desk to write it. During this time, he walked about near the counter where the goods lay. I gave him the list; he asked me, if we had got any figured satin ribbon. I went to another part of the warehouse to get them, and he went with me. I pulled open the drawer and shewed them to him, he asked me to look out some to the best of my judgment, as he wanted them for shipping and the colours must stand, as he had shipped some before, and they had flown. I observed him put his right hand into his breeches pocket more than once, and saw some ribbon in his hand at the time. He still continued talking about ribbons. After he had put his hand into his pocket several times, he said, he was in a hurry, and would thank me to let him out, and he would call again in a short time - He went out. Before I saw him in the warehouse, I had taken an inventory of the goods on the counter, the warehouse was on the first floor. I followed him down stairs immediately, he run down as fast as he could. When I caught sight of him in the street, he was still running. He had turned into Shovel-court, a little below our house, which was no thoroughfare, and I secured him just at the end of the court, and told him, I suspected that he had property which did not belong to him; he made no answer. I took him into the King's Head public-house, and gave him in custody to Fullbrook, who was there, and searched him in my presence, and found ten pieces of ribbon on him; the whole of them where Mr. Herbert's property, and part of those that I had been shewing him.</p>

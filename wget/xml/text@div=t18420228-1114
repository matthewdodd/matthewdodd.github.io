I have examined the cloth in the possession of the policeman—it belongs to him—I have examined the stock of this pattern, and find about 190 square yards deficient—I took stock on the 31st of December, and it was right then—the prisoner was in the prosecutor's employ as carman-the prosecutor has a large tilted dark-coloured cart, with his name and address on it—on Monday, the 7th of December last, the prisoner was sent out with six rolls of cloth, which were to go to Griffin's, and thirteen to Pick<lb></lb>ford's wagon-office—they were packed in mats—one piece was larger then the others—he left the premises between four and five o'clock—be ought to have returned after the delivery of the goods—I left between seven and eight—I-gave him no orders to go out the next morning—I went to the premises the next morning about nine—he was not there—I saw him come in with the cart, at a quarter past ten, and there were some small cuts of timber in it—he did not state why he brought it, nor give any account of the message he had had to execute on the Monday—I gave him money for the tolls on the Monday—I do not remember the amount—here is the cart-book which I gave him—it is in my writing.</p>

I am in Mr. Rolls' service, and act as foreman over the workmen—it was my duty to keep the keys of the gate, and let the pri<lb></lb>soner in and out with his cart—on Monday afternoon, the 7th of February, the cart was loaded at four o'clock, and it left the premises about half-past four—I left the factory that evening at eight—the prisoner had not returned—I locked up the gates, put the keys in a little box, and took the box to Mr. Rolls' house, in Marlborough-place—I came to the factory at seven the next morning, and found the prisoner's cart there—there is only one tilted cart belonging to the establishment—the cart was in its usual place standing shaft upwards—I passed close to it—I cannot say whether it was full or empty—I did not look into it—I went to breakfast about eight, and returned about half-past eight—the cart was then gone—the prisoner had had no orders to go—he returned about ten with the cart and horse, and some timber—I did not authorize him to take these 146 yards of cloth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Pickford, in Wood-street. About nine o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 8th of February, the prisoner brought thirteen packages of floor-cloth in the prosecutor's cart—I saw the name of Rolls on it—it was a tilted cart—I had seen it before—I gave him a receipt in his cart-book—this is it—he did not bring any<lb></lb>thing on Monday that I am aware of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In what part of the premises do you receive the goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the yard—I always go down and receive the goods—I am quite clear about that—I went down myself that morning—I had no con<lb></lb>versation with the prisoner—I bad known him before—Mr. Rolls' is a large heavy cart, drawn by one horse.</p>

On the 2d of July, about a quarter past five o'clock in the morning, I went to the house. I got in by knocking the cook up. I went and found somebody had taken the wire pannel out of the dairy door; anybody could then get through; it was safe the day before; there were prints of feet in the garden; they had got a chair off the lawn, and got over the wall into the yard, which brought them to the dairy. I found some tallow-grease in the yard, close by the dairy door; it was not there the day before; a candle had been lighted there. I missed the shoe brushes, two pair of boots, and two pair of shoes from the knife-house, which stands by itself, and is enclosed in the same yard with the dwelling-house; the dairy is under the same roof as the dwelling-house, but you must come out into the yard to get into the house; they had only entered the dairy and knife-house. Three baskets of linen were taken out of the dairy; one of the baskets was set in the yard, but the linen gone.</p>

On the 1st of July, I slept in the house, but was not alarmed. I fastened the house up; the cook and I were up last, and went to bed together - the last time I was in the dairy, was at dusk, the window was shut; when I got up in the morning, I found the wire pannel taken out, and missed three baskets of clothes. I have seen some of them since, part are my own and part my master's; there was grease outside the door, which was not there the day before; it appeared to be the droppings of a candle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Who had the management of the dairy - A. The cook; there is no casement, it is only the pannel of the door taken out, and secured by wire, to admit the air; it was secure the day before. It was dusk when the cook and I took the clothes into the dairy. I will not swear that she did not go there with a candle afterwards; it was dusk, between eight and nine o'clock; we went to bed between ten and eleven. I saw part of the linen at Worship-street, last Saturday week.</p>

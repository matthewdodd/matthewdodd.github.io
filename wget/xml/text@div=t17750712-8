Upon Monday the 26th of June, in the evening between four and five o'clock, the prisoner took the key out of the shop, to go up two pair of stairs. I went to the Bell-Savage-Inn; when I returned, he was not come down: my wife went up and found the key in the door, the prisoner was gone, and the money and pocket apron was missing.

            . On Monday night the 26th of June, I had some business to do at the Six Bells, I was sitting in a box with a friend, and the prisoner was in another box; there came in a lad, and said, he could not get him a lodging, but said he should go with him; but, says he, let us have a pint of beer; I thought he was going to decoy him away to get his money from him. I asked him where he came from, and where he was going; he said, he was going to Gloucestershire, he said he had served a Mr. Emery, a butcher in Newgate market; I told him the man wanted to get his money from him, and if he came honestly by the money, I was going to town, and would take care of him; he then said, he had told me a lie, that he never served a butcher, but found the money in Newgate market. I took him to the roundhouse for that night; I came to town, and enquired in Newgate market, but could not find Mr. Emery, but I heard there was such a man in Fleet market, I went and informed him of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live? - At Penn, in Buckinghamshire.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Coophan? - I suppose it may be eight or nine miles. I believe it was the 2d of April, it was the day before Good Friday; when I got into the road, I looked behind me, and I saw two men bringing three asses along, they were at a distance behind me; I stopped a little for them to come up; they did not come up while I stopped, they seemed to slacken their pace; I goes on into a little farm yard, there I stops till the prisoners came up opposite the yard gate; I then stepped to the gate and asked them where they were going to drive those asses? they said, home; I made answer and said, home! yes, home, they said, the other side of Wickham Heath. I followed them for about five or six hundred yards; I thought to myself I would go home, and take my horse and ride to Mr. Nash's, who had informed me that be had lost an ass the week before. I took a horse and went and informed Mr. Nash. We went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200044"></xptr>to a wood, and placed ourselves at a distance to see them come through the wood. Mr. Nash he gave me the signal that he had seen the asses; when I came up to him, says he, are those the asses that you see in possession of Brackley and Cogdal? I looked at a particular mare ass that seemed to be very big in soal, marked with a R. and F. Mr. Nash says, the prisoners are gone home and left the asses there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners live far from thence? - No, it may be a quarter of a mile, or half a mile, for what I know. I says to Mr. Nash, this is a very odd thing. I thought they would come in the evening to take the asses away; and Mr. Nash and I went in the evening, about seven o'clock. When we came to the place where we lost the asses, we could not find them there. I supposed they were strolled away at a distance, and it being dark, we could not find them. About nine o'clock, the two prisoners came to the place where they had left the asses; Mr. Nash being a little thick of hearing, he did not see them till they popped on them. As soon as they see him, they turned towards home.</p>
               <p>Q. To Turner. Was Fowler's ass in soal? - Yes; we looked for it to soal every day.</p>

               <p>On the 2d of April I see the two prisoners and three asses in Penwood; I see them going towards their home; I went a little way further, and saw three asses; they appeared to me to be very much in a sweat, and then at night I went to see who fetched these asses; and between seven and nine, I cannot exactly say what hour, these two men came up very near me, the prisoners. I asked one of them, if they had seen any thing of a grey horse, on the common, as they came along? they said, no. I said, somebody had left my gate open, and my horse had got out on the common.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the asses? - Yes; there was a black ass, R. F.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoners with these asses at all? - I see the prisoners, five minutes before I came up to the asses in the road. Then coming up to the asses, I asked Mr. Clarke if they were the asses that he had seen before in their possession? he said they were. In the evening I went to wait to see who came for them, with Mr. Clarke; and between the hours of seven and nine, both the prisoners came near me. I was very near where the asses were left, and seeing me and Mr. Clarke, they crossed away over the common. I went still in pursuit after the asses; in about quarter of an hour after they came across me again. John Brackley said, have you lost your horse Mr. Nash? Yes, said I, I have. He then said, he had turned four of his asses up on the common that day, and could not find them. I saw neither of them again, nor the asses, till the 14th of May; there I see it in the possession of Mr. Jordan, at Finchley; he had bought it. Hearing of

On the 22d of August, the prisoner came to my stables with one of my breaksmen on the box; he told me he was in want of two or three horses for one Mr. Fagg, of Holborn, and stated that his master, Mr. Abel, of the Borough, had no horses, and that he came from Mr. Fagg, wishing to see two or three of mine. I said I had only one which he might take and shew Mr. Fagg, to see if it would suit him, and to come to let me know what offer was made - he took the horse and never returned, nor brought it back. I value it at 20 l. - I did not know Mr. Fagg. On the 5th of September I received information that he was at the Bazaar stables, at the west end of the town, and found him there, and asked him where it was, he said he had sold it to Messrs. Dean and Dance of Hampstead, I went with him to them, and saw it there; it remains with them. I am sure it is the same horse the prisoner got from me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You asked me how trade was, and I asked you the same - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You then said you had a brown horse which was lame, and you could sell it for a little money - A. I did not - he said he was collecting for Mr. Abel of the Borough, and asked if I was inclined to sell the horse; I said Yes. He said Fagg was in want of horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not agree that if you got the horse or money, you would settle it - A. Never.</p>

             had brought a horse for sale, and asked me to look at him, and try him - I said it was too late to try him that night. The prisoner said it was of no consequence, the horse could be left, and I could try him in the morning, and he would come - he came next morning; I tried the horse and bought it. I cannot exactly say what we gave him for it; he asked 15 l. - I agreed with my partner to give him 12 l., and no more. My partner and he went away together to make the agreement, and I do not know exactly what was paid, as we have not settled our accounts. The prisoner left it in our stables, and I used it as ours until Lewis claimed it. I refused to give it up till I knew the law. We are coachmasters.</p>

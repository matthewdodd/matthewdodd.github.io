                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. George Groombridge, a linen-draper, in Ratcliff-highway. On the 1st of June the prisoner came in for a shirt—I took down one—he then said, "Never mind," and walked out of the shop—as he was going out my master spoke to roe—I went after the prisoner—he turned up the next turning, and I lost sight of him—I spoke to a policeman, and soon after the policeman brought him back—I found this new shirt on him, which I had missed from outside our house—when he got to the station he said he had bought it of a man in the Back road for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and had had it three weeks—it is perfectly new, and had never been put on before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the evening of the 1st of June, about seven o'clock, I met the prisoner going from the shop, with something under his jacket, which appeared like a shirt or a handkerchief—when I got <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the prosecutor's shop I was told something—I went after the prisoner, and met him coming out of a public-house, which I had seen him go into—he then had this new shirt on his back, and his own white one under his arm—I took him to the prosecutor, and asked him where be got the check-shirt from—be said he had had it four or five months—Searle identified it by the make and by the buttons—when the prisoner got to the station he said he bought it in the Back-road, of a sailor, who had several red ones and a blue one.</p>

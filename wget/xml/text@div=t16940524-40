            , who was then a Footman to the Doctor. Johnson swore that Mr. Bradshaw ordered him the time aforesaid <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16940524005"></xptr>to go and fetch the Key of the Doctor's Study that then lay on the Table in the Doctor's Chamber, and bring it down to him, and therewith the said Bradshaw unlockt the Study door, and took out the money, and gave him 7l. in Silver and two Guineas in Gold, and bid him be gone into his own Countrey, which he accordingly did. The Doctor swore that he was robb'd at the time aforesaid of the Sum of Two hundred Pound, but that it was done by the Prisoner, but said he always suspected him.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in his defence alledged, That Johnson immediately upon the committing the Robbery, fled, and that he was put into the Gazette by Dr. Littleton with a Reward of 20l. to any Person that should take him; and that he the said Bradshaw never remov'd from his Business, but took all possible care to have Johnson apprehended; and proved that he had caused 2000 Bills to be printed, described the said Johnson, and had distributed the same to all Watches, &amp;c. That he had also caused Hue and Cries to be be made, and sent to all parts of England, for taking the said Johnson, with the Reward aforesaid, by the said Doctor; and that afterwards Johnson was taken up for the Robbery. The Evidence for the Prisoner, who took the said Johnson for the Fact, did testify, That there had been by Johnson's confession, a Correspondence between the Doctor and the said Johnson, which the Doctor did not deny; and that he had received a Letter from the Doctor (whose Hand he said he knew very well) wherein the Doctor had promised a Pardon to the said Johnson in case he would swear against the Prisoner; and that Johnson declared it was the Doctor's whole Design to lay the matter upon the said Mr. Bradshaw, for that he was in a condition to pay the Sum he was robb'd of; but saith Johnson, this I cannot, nor will not do, for Mr. Bradshaw is innocent and I believe he is as honest a man as any one living; further Evidence for the Prisoner testify'd, that the said Johnson had been seen to have 100 or more Guineas at one time, and that since the Robbery he had paid several Debts, particularly  the King's Tax, that he run away with 12l. and that the said Johnson had built a House that cost 20l. or more. Further Evidence for the Prisoner testified, That the said Johnson had committed several Robberies by several Names, one of which was on Sir

The Prisoner, to take off the suspicion the Doctor had of him, proved by the Doctor's Confession in Court, that he had employed him in all, or most of his Affairs, since the time of the Fact being committed; and by his Letters, not only with his moneys, but with his Mistress also; which Letters were produced by the Prisoner and read in Court, the Prisoner lost 20l. of his own money.</p>
               <p>So upon the whole matter, the Court finding the said Johnson to be a notorious Rogue, for that he had sworn one thing to the Grand Jury, and another to the Court; the Grand Jury happening to hear it, desired leave of the Court to give them information of it, which they accordingly did, looking upon it to be a malicious Prosecution: And that Dr. Littleton's only using very reflecting Language, that was nothing to the purpose; and the Prisoner being a person of undoubted honesty and Reputation, of which the Court was well satisfied, and look upon the matter to be rather malice than fact; he was <rs id="t16940524-40-verdict156" type="verdictDescription">

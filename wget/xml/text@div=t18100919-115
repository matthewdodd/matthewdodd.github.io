               <p>Q. When was it that you lost this bank note - A. On the 7th of August last, between nine and ten in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190055"></xptr>the evening, I was going up <placeName id="t18100919-115-crimeloc659">Great Queen-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields</placeName>

The next morning, when I discovered that I had lost a ten pound note, I went to the bank and stopped the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the note - A. In my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner took it - A. No, I traced the note to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that she is the woman - A. No, I am not; I did not pay any attention at the time.</p>
               <p>MR. FOULKES. I am a linen-draper, No. 4, Little Russell-street, Covent-garden. The prisoner bought some goods of me to the amount of one pound fourteen shillings. I changed a ten pound note for her, on the 19th or 20th of August. That note was traced back to me the next day.</p>
               <p>Q.to Prosecutor. You do not know that woman attacked you - A. I do not; she said, that she had received this note four months ago. It had not come out of the bank at that time.</p>

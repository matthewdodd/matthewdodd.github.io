                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Ebenezer Howard, of Leaden<lb></lb>hall-market—upon the morning of 18th December, a man came there, and ordered game and poultry to the amount of 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or so—it was not the prisoner—in the evening the prisoner came and said he had called for the goods, which had been ordered by the gentleman in the morning, who, he said, was the principal clerk of Messrs. Brown and Sons, and that he had a horse and cart in Gracechurch-street waiting for the goods—there were no porters in the market, so two of our own men took them down to the cart—I asked him to give me Messrs. Brown and Sons address, and he said, "10, Princes-street, Cavendish-square," which I wrote on the back of a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he handed me—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. change—in the ordinary course of business, the cheque was paid into the bankers, and came back again, or was brought back—I have since been to 10, Princes-street, Cavendish-square,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186602260069"></xptr>
               <p>but could learn nothing there about the prisoner, or Brown and Sons—there were no such people there—there is another Princes-street in Hanover<lb></lb>square, to which I went, and I there found a firm of Brown and Sons, who denied all knowledge of the cheque.</p>

Bacon and Green kept an account for a short time with us, and there was, of course, a cheque-book issued to them—the two cheques now produced came out of that cheque-book—the account was only kept with us seven or eight months—no such persons as those represented by the signatures of "Brown" and "Fleet-wood," kept an account with us—I know nothing about them at all—the cheques were presented to us in the ordinary course, and returned by us in the usual way—we have had other cheques from the same book presented to us—perhaps twenty at different times during the last six or eight months—those were all forgeries.</p>

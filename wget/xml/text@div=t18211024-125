            . I am Mr. Ingram's housekeeper. I do not know the note. I have often gone for change - I have been to Spicer's a great many times for change. I do not know any person of the name of Thompson besides myself, that comes from Ingram's. Ingram keeps a public-house in Bedfordbury; Hunt was a poor man who came to the house, I have occasionally sent him with a glass of spirits and water into the parlour when I have been in the bar alone - he was not a waiter; he has taken it off<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240058"></xptr>the bar when I have put it there. Spicer always asked me what name he was to put on the notes - I do not remember this particular note.</p>
               <p>Q. How many notes do you think you have carried to Spicer's from the beginning of July - A. More than one, two, or three; I dare say I have carried more than one 10 l. note. I do not recollect, as I have carried so many. Whenever Ingram wanted change, he sent me there, and said, Get change for a 5 l. a 10 l. or whatever note it was, as I cannot read. When he received a note from the gentleman he called me to get it changed at Spicer's.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he received this note from a gentlemen - A. Yes. I should know the gentleman again if I saw him - I gave Ingram the pen and ink to write on it, but what he wrote, I do not know. There were three or four gentleman, they had their reckoning to pay - they had something to eat and drink; I think they came in the morning. I believe they had some cold meat - it was a long time back.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it a year ago - A. I cannot say. Handley and Cooper came to the house afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When were they there - A. I cannot tell. They fetched me before the Magistrate. I have taken many 10 l. and 5 l. notes to Spicer's.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you within a year, taken more than one - A. Three or four.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Ingram keeps the house - A. Yes. I saw him receive the note from the party; he has taken a wonderful deal of pains, to find them out. A great many notes pass through his hands. I told the Magistrate the same as I tell now.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell the Justice that you saw him receive the note - A. I told him as I told you. I cannot swear to the note; I have gone so repeatedly for change.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you persist in swearing that you gave the Magistrate the same account as you do now - A. I believe so - I will not be positive.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. I went to Ingram's house the beginning of September - I told him, I was come to make enquiry about a 10 l. note, which he had sent to be changed at Mr. Spicer's, and asked if he could tell of whom he received it - I said I must know, as the note was a stolen one; he said he did not know whether he could or not, without seeing it - I said he could see it at the Bank; he promised to go, and said he would send us an answer - I told him who I was. Three or four days, or a week elapsed; we went to him, and asked if he could give us any tidings about it - he said No, he could not, that he had been to the Bank, and they laughed at him, and said he came on a fool's errand, and that he had not had a proper account given him which office to go to; I said we gave him the same account as we gave other people who had seen it. I told him to fix a time, and we would go with him - he hesitated some time; I again asked him what day to fix on, he said he did not know what day to fix - I said "Will to-morrow do," he said, "Yes," and at last eleven o'clock was fixed. We went to his house next day, at eleven o'clock, and he was not to be found. Mrs. Thompson was in the bar, and said he was gone out on other business - we left, and told the Magistrate, who issued a summons for him; it was put off until another examination, which was on Saturday, the 20th of September. The depositions of the witnesses were taken in writing, but what the prisoners said was not. Previous to that day, we called on him at his house, and asked if he could give any account of the parties - he said No, he did not know who the parties were, but he had taken it of one Thompson in King-street, and pointed towards King-street, which is near his house. He attended at the office, and said he thought he could find the parties, and was to appear on Monday, the 24th of September, he attended, and the Magistrate asked if he could give any better account - he said No, he had been to No. 20, and 22, King-street, Westminster, and could find no such person as Thompson. The Magistrate committed him to Bridewell - we had a search-warrant, and found a pocket book with a flash note in it at his house.</p>

            . I was with Cooper, we were always there together - his account is correct. I asked Ingram, why he did not keep his appointment, he said he did not know why he was to interfere in it - it was no business of his. He said at the office, that the name of Thompson on the note, was his writing.</p>
               <p>INGRAM'S Defence. I took the note in business, and called Thompson for a pen and ink - the reckoning I think was four shillings, the man asked for change for a 10 l. note - I had not sufficient, and called Thompson; the gentleman gave me the name of "J. Thompson, No. 22, King-street, Westminster." I sent for change, and gave it him.</p>
               <p>HUNT'S Defence. About six or seven days before the Coronation, three genteel dressed men came into Ingram's, and called for brandy and water. Ingram was not at home, the bell rang, they asked if I knew who would go to Crossley's, at the bottom of Holborn, and buy a small Cheshire cheese, a gentleman said Hunt will do it - they gave me the note; I went and had a bill of the cheese, and gave them the note, and my name and address - I delivered the cheese to the gentlemen, at the Sun, public-house, which Ingram keeps, and in the afternoon a carrier came, and took the cheese. They gave me three shillings for my trouble.</p>

             sworn. - I am a lamp-lighter: In the morning of the 10th of March, between one and two o'clock, I was lighting the lamps just by Mr. Ashmore's house, and while I was standing upon my ladder, I heard some people talking, I could see by my light that there were three men; when I went to the next lamp, I saw two of them cross the way to Ironmonger-row, which was nearly lacing; the man that was behind, turned up a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180010"></xptr>court, that was the prisoner Ford, I saw him stoop down as though he was easing himself; I went on about my business, and as I came home again, I saw three men in Ironmonger-row, I saw that they were the same men, and then I observed that the prisoner, Reading, was another of them; the other I do not know any thing about. The next morning, between eight and nine, I informed Gass, the constable of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them go into any house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them do any thing to Ashmore's house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Gass.) In consequence of this information, did you make any search? - A. Yes; I went to that court, but it has no thoroughfare, there are a few houses in it, but they are mostly empty, it is called Well-and-bucket-court; there is a small gate-way going in that you can touch the ceiling with your hand, and there I saw two brass candlesticks sticking out from the lath and plaister, and behind the door of the first house in the court I found a copper tea-kettle; it was an empty house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the silver plate ever found? - A. No, not at all. I went with Peach to apprehend them, and when they were hand-cuffed together, one said to the other, "d-n you, don't split", that was Reading.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk to Mr. Knill, of Fresh wharf. On Saturday night, 25th Mar., I left my watch in the desk in the counting--house at his warehouse, near Fish-street-hill—the counting-house is at one corner of the warehouse—I left the warehouse, with everything safe, at twenty minutes after eight o'clock—my foreman locked the door, with two padlocks, and I examined it with the watchman—the back warehouse was also locked—the prisoner was fore<lb></lb>man of the porters—about half-past seven that evening he went into the counting-house and signed off—there are places there where a person may conceal himself—my attention was called to the warehouse again on Sunday morning at six—the window blinds had been put up, and drawn down to the bottom—they are not fixed; we put them up—they had not been drawn down for some time—a desk in one corner of the counting-house was brokes open—the iron safe, in which the money was, had been attempted to be broken open—the ironwork in front was turned on one side, and forced very much—one of the drawers of the desk was lying on the desk—the other drawer was open—I missed my silver watch from my desk, and some silver money, I do not know how much—the prisoner did not come to work on Monday morning—we examined the back warehouse, to see if any party was concealed, but found no one—a person could have been concealed there made parts—there were a vast number of goods—an attempt had been made to break out of the place—the carpenter's shop was broken open, and an attempt made to break out—the ironwork had been taken off, but there was woodwork to be cut away after that—that had been done from within, not from without—I saw a dog there, belonging to the prisoner's father, on the Saturday evening—I drove it out of the front warehouse a few minutes before I left.</p>

                  </hi> I live with my father, the superintendent to Mr. Knill. On Saturday night, 25th March, at a little after nine o'clock, my father sent me to the warehouse with the keys—some furniture was to be taken into the warehouse—I opened the door, and waited till my father came—only one person went into the warehouse till my father came—the prisoner did not go in—after the furniture was put in I locked up the warehouse, and took the keys home—I saw a dog in the warehouse a little after it was opened—my father drove it out.</p>

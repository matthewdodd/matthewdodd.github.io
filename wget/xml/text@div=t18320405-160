            , who was then dead - I appeared before the Magistrate on the 18th, and at his request, opened the body - there was a very considerable external wound on the cheek-bone; the bone was laid bare - on opening the head the temporal muscle was in a high state of inflammation, and an effusion of blood had taken place; the vessels of the brain were turgid - there were two wounds on the lower jaw, one several inches long, and a contusion on the upper part of the head, on the temple - it was clear she had come to her death by violence, which could not have been committed by herself; I ascribe the turgid state of the vessels to concussion - the blows must have been violent to produce such injury; it must have been done by some instrument, it could not be done by the fist - she had been dead some time when I first saw her; decomposition had taken place to a certain degree - she was a very old woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you think that forcing open a door to go into a room, could have produced these wounds? A. Certainly not all the wounds, nor could a fall do it - it must have been violence offered by somebody.</p>

I was not acquainted with the deceased, but was called in to see her on the 8th of February, about an hour before she died - she was in bed and insensible; I gave her some wine, which revived her, but she did not live an hour - the prisoner was not present; I did not observe any marks of violence on her, but when she was being laid out, they were pointed out to me, but not thinking it important, I did not notice them much - I thought she might have had a fall; the prisoner is her son; he is married, and lived with her; she was above seventy years old - the prisoner was not in the house when she died; I saw him that evening - he seemed much affected when he came home; I asked him how the marks on her face came, and said, "People seem to blame your wife" - he said, "She is not to blame indeed, for when I came home last Thursday night, I could not be admitted for some time; I knocked at the door a long while, and when I did get in, I thought it was my drunken wife behind the door, but it proved to be the old lady, and it was I done it" - he laid on the stairs and cried bitterly - when I saw the deceased she had a large cap on, and nobody could see any part of her face.</p>

At the request of Mr. Broackes, I examined the deceased, ten or eleven days after her death as to the nature of the wound on her right cheek bone, and another on the right jaw; he wished my opinion whether they were caused before or after death - I have no doubt the wound on the right cheek was inflicted before death; it was sufficient to cause death in a person of her age - the wound had been opened when I saw it, and I cannot say how it had been done; she was a very thin woman.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I examined the body on the day of the Inquest; the head had already been examined, and I could only from an opinion from external appearances; I found a large coat used wound on the outer angle of the right temple - it was severe and dangerous, also two lacerated wounds on the chin, with some appearance of a bruise on the left side - the wound on the chin seemed very probably the cause of death; it might be inflicted by any hard substance - if by a door pushed suddenly on her it must have been with great violence; a clenched fist would have done it, I think - the other wounds appeared not dangerous, and to have been made after death; only one wound appeared to have been made during life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written,) The prisoner most solemnly declares his innocence of the charge; his poor deceased mother was seventy-eight years of age - she had been very unwell for for several months: about nine o'clock on the evening of the 3rd of February, the prisoner returned home and knocked at his door two or three times before he could gain admittance - vexed with his wife for keeping him so long, and not suspecting but that it was his wife who was then letting him in, he flung the door back rather hastily and angrily - the edge of the door struck his poor mother on the cheek bone, who had come from her own bed, to which she was almost wholly confined, but was never aware that she had received this blow until after her death- somewhat in liqour, angry at having been kept waiting, (but extremely so on finding that his mother was obliged to leave her bed to open the door for him), on getting to his own room, he had words with his wife, and struck her, which induced her to call out murder; the cries were from his wife, and not from his mother - they proceeded from up stairs, and his mother slept below, on the ground floor, and it is presumed that it could hardly he possible for any of the witnesses to mistake the voice of a woman of fifty years of age for a poor old woman of seventy-eight, who had been for a long time ill, and whose voice was scarcely articulate; it has been asserted, although not attempted to be proved, that the prisoner had spent 5l. of his mother's money, and that he would derive an interest from her death - this is wholly unfounded; she had a small annuity of twelve guineas per annum, payable monthly, left her by the late Dr. Brown, of Islington, with whom she had lived as a servant, and which annuity died with her.</p>

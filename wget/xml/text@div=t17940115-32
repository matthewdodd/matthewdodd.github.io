               <p>I was not sensible that I had lost any thing, till I was called to the Elephant and Castle, Kentish Town, to see some iron that was stopped about seven o'clock at night; on the 20th of December, I was shewn the iron there by Mr. Croker, one of the police officers of Bow-street; some of the iron has been worked, and some unworked. I can say, I know this piece, it was got up for the side of a pair of forging tongs; I know it by the shape and manner in which it was got up. This one piece, I also know, from its being bent in a particular manner hastily, and not properly. I am a coach box and axle tree maker; I cannot be so particular about either of the other two pieces, but I know, they are the kind of iron that we make use of.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see them last before you went to the Elephant and Castle? - I cannot recollect exactly; I had seen one piece the day before, it was laying on the floor in the open smith's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it front the street? - It is within an inclosure, a little way off from the street. This other piece, I saw standing by the side of the forge, where the man worked that had used it; I think it was either one night, or two, before it was found; but I am not certain, I do not recollect the other two pieces. When<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150091"></xptr>I was she was the iron, Mr. Croker asked me, If I knew it? I told him, as I have told you; and I also knew the prisoner at the bar, had first left my shop before the usual time of leaving work; he worked for me; he made a practice of that, because he said, his home was a great way off.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you employed him? - About two months.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prisoner behave while he was in your service? - He always behaved well, except that I was surprised, that he left work before other people; but that was in some reason accounted for, because he lived in Westminster; he was a sober man, and a good workman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. At the time, you say, you know the piece of iron by the particular manner of workmanship of it; but you know that workmen use iron in that same way. With respect to this piece bent, other blacksmiths use pieces exactly in the same way that this is in? - Never use it in the condition it is now, it is in its second stage, unfinished. It is bent to put under axle-trees, that they may not get through the fire; and I never saw any man that did it, but this man that did this.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the third piece of iron, you don't recollect when you saw that before? - There is one little circumstance, it was a general rule in our shop, that nobody was to use a piece of iron that was bad.</p>
               <p>Q. You say one piece of iron was within an inclosure? - The whole is within a shop, which shop is within an inclosure.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner quitted his work sooner, because he lived at a great distance, and he always did it? - Not always, but very frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he live at Lambeth, and you work at Pancras? - Yes. I only with to say one thing, there was a dispute about his leaving work, and he had marked to leave off work at seven, but he had left off about a quarter or twenty minutes before; and it was just seven, when I received a message to go to the Elephant and Castle.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Harrison, with respect to the piece you know, there may be similar pieces made in other shops? - I can swear to my own work; there are very few workmen, but can swear to their own work.</p>

               <p>I am one of the conductors of the party of the partoles in Bow-street, and I go the Kentish Town road, and Hampstead road every night. On the 20th of last month, I was going with one man belonging to me towards Pan<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150092"></xptr>cras, just beyond the church; I saw something standing in the dark, in the field between the church and the Elephant and Castle, it appeared to me to be a man; I made towards it, it was near seven, it had not struck; I, and the person that was with me, made round towards him; I went up to him, and I said, halloo, who are you! I thought it was a man drunk; I put my stick down, and I heard the found of iron that was laying on the grass immediately before him. They laid close before him and he standing up, immediately I ordered Mackay, the man that is here, to bring him along to the Elephant and Castle, while I picked up the iron, and a stick laying with it; I asked him, who he was? he hesitated a little, and said, he lived a good way off; I then took him into the public house, to the Elephant and Castle, and the maid servant knew him; and then I had a suspicion that he had come from there, and I asked her, who he worked for? and she told me, and I ordered him to be secured while I went up to his master's house, and the maid servant went with me; and I brought down Mr. Keir, and he said, that the iron was his property. This stick was laying close to the iron, and it all laid before him; he told me, when he went into the public house, that he knew nothing of the iron, but he owned the stick.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counse. Crocker, you are sure, it was about seven? - I am positive, by the round that I had taken, it was just seven; I generally make remark of the time, but I did not this time; but whether it had struck or no, I cannot say, it was a minute or two, before I went up to Mr. Keir's.</p>
               <p>Q. This footpath through the field is in the direct way to Westminster? - It is the way from Pancras; that back footpath comes directly into Kentish Town; but he was in the field between that footpath and the public road.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took the prisoner, he did not discover any circumstances of sear of apprehension? - He seemed a little chagrined at being taken by a Police officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You never knew him before? - Never; but if I see a man lurking in the fields, I always go to him.</p>
               <p>Q. The maid servant of the house knew him? - She did, she called him by his name immediately.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. After I had done work I had to go to Lambeth; I left off a little before my time, because I had so far to go; I was going home, and just went out of the path way to case myself, and this here Mr. Crocker came up to me just as I was buttoning up my breeches, he asked me what I had got there? I told him that I did not know that I had got any thing there; he stooped and picked up this iron, and he said to me, you may as well go along with it, I suppose you only mean to make a pot of beer with it; I told him it was none of mine, and I would not have any thing to do with it.</p>

               <p>Q. How near was you? - I was within forty yards, just on the right of him, I was so near him that I saw him stand up before ever the gentlemen came up to him, and touched him, it was a darkish night, foggy, and I saw nothing that he had about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he standing when you came up to me? - He was standing up when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or they see him first? - I should suppose that they saw him first, because they were making over the foot path, and I was over right to them.</p>

O, says he, these gentlemen have taken me up, but I don't know what for. Croker says, what are you known in this public house? yes, says he, I am known here; O, then, says he, take up the iron and walk about your business, I suppose it is only to get you a pot of beer; they were both present when he said this.</p>
               <p>Court to Croker. Did you see that witness near? - Yes, he was, and he followed us into the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you stopped the prisoner did you see him then? - Yes, he was about five or six yards off, he was standing pretty near.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say? - I asked him who he was, and and where he was going? he said he had been easing himself; but I did not perceive any thing of that; but we went afterwards to see if there were any more iron, with a candle and lanthorn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing of this sort pass which the last witness has affected? - It strikes my recollection that something did pass, I recollect the circumstance now. When I brought it in and laid it on the table; they knowing him I might say, why should I have so much trouble, does it belong to you? he said it did not, it is not my property, nor I will not have it.</p>

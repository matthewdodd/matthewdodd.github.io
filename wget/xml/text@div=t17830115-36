            ; I know the prisoner, he lived with us: on the 4th of January there was a sum of money taken by several of the servants of the house, which was laid down on a small ledge, the amount of which was 3 l. 9 s. I speak of it with accuracy, by three different people talking of it, and privately putting it down: the prisoner had served a customer, and had taken some money, and was going up stairs with it to his mistress; I told him to take this money up with him; he asked me if there was any account of it, I told him, no;

             was with me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner offer to carry it up, or did you tell him to take it? - I told him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150058"></xptr>Did you count the sum? - Yes, I was the last that counted it.</p>
               <p>How long was is between the time that you counted that money, and the moment he took it away? - It was immediately.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that he took the whole sum that was there placed? - I saw it all in his hand.</p>
               <p>It is the custom of your house generally to give an account to your mistress of little sums as they are received? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What happened in your presence when the prisoner was present, and your master came home? - The prisoner was called up, and his master accused him of defrauding him of 6 s. 6 d. the prisoner said, he knew nothing of it; my master said, he certainly did, and had better not deny it, for he had more than one, two, or three people that could prove it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say why he had better not deny it? - He said, he had more than one, two, or three people that could prove it.</p>
               <p>That was all he said? - Yes; then Mr. Thwaites said he had been cheating him; he said, not to his knowledge, he repeated it again, he still made the same answer; he told him, that to his knowledge was nothing, for he could not do it without knowing it himself; the prisoner repeated the same answer; my master told him he was very sure he had, having sufficient proofs.</p>
               <p>Did your master make him any promise of any kind, if he should open any confession to him? - Not to my knowledge then, I am sure he did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he at any time afterwards? Not to my knowledge, they were by themselves after; when Mr. Thwaites threatened to send for an officer: this is nearly all that I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. If I understand you right, the prisoner was in the shop, and had taken some money of some customer? Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you reckon up that sum? - I was unacquainted with it; it was gold.</p>
               <p>Now the other money that was reckoned, you and your fellow servant had separately reveived: why did not you take it yourself? - Because we had strong suspiciouns</p>
               <p>Having strong suspicions, it was your business, and your duty to take up the money that you had received? - Yes, it was, but not that money.</p>
               <p>Then it was a plan laid by you and your fellow servants, to entrap this man if you could? - No, not to entrap him.</p>
               <p>Well, to find him out, make use of your own words? - To be sure if we were right.</p>
               <p>Did this man and you live on a good footing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you reckon the money to him, upon your oath? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he reckon it himself? - No.</p>
               <p>Then it was never reckoned by you, in his presence? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he want to reckon it? - I do not recollect that matter; I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Now do; because you can recollect some things so clearly? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Did not you say to him when he wanted to reckon the money, no, no, no; take it up as it is, it is all right? - I believe I did not say such words.</p>
               <p>Are you sure? - I cannot positively say to that matter.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner better wages than you? I do not know, we do not disclose our wages to one another.</p>
               <p>Council for the prosecution. Your master keeps a great many men? - A great many.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you are not positive, whether the prisoner did not offer to reckon it, and you said there was no occasion? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Have you any idea that such a thing might pass? - I have not, if I had, I would declare it.</p>
               <p>Then you do not recollect, one way or the other? - I do not.</p>

I called another of my fellow servants, and he counted it, and found it the same.</p>
               <p>How much? - Three pounds seven shillings: the prisoner took it from a little shelf on the counter: then,

             gave him 2 s. more.</p>
               <p>How long was it before, that you had reckoned it? - Just then; Capps and Eyre had counted it; the 2 s. was given him, as he was going up stairs with the 3 l. 7 s. I saw him give him the 2 s. Eyre is not here: the prisoner went up to his mistress: when my master came home, he told the prisoner what we laid to his charge, and the prisoner denied it: my master mentioned the sum of 6 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. This money was loose on the ledge? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You received it in small sums? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How much a time? - Different sums; sometimes half a crown, sometimes 5 s.</p>
               <p>Then it was all silver? - Not all.</p>
               <p>Some halfpence? - There was some gold that we gave change out of.</p>
               <p>It was your custom, and your duty, I understand, to take this up to your mistress? It was: we should have taken it up, but we had no time.</p>
               <p>This man was carrying up the money he had received? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he was doing what he ought to do, and you called him back to take up your money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which of you desired him? - Papps.</p>
               <p>Did he reckon it to him? - He did not reckon it, he took it himself from the shelf; he scraped it into his hand.</p>
               <p>Did he reckon it himself? - No.</p>
               <p>Who was nearest this ledge when he took it? - I cannot tell; I, and Capps were on each side, and the ledge was between us.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect his wanting to reckon it? - He did not count it.</p>
               <p>Did he offer to count it? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that now? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Nor did you reckon it? - No, we did not; we had a suspicion of him before.</p>
               <p>Then this plan was concerted by you? We agreed to count the money, and be particular.</p>
               <p>Mrs. THWAITES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am wife to Mr. Thwaites. The prisoner came to me in the afternoon of the 4th of January, between three and five, and brought me a bill with four guineas, and desired I would take the bill out of it, and give him change, he then told me that the money he had got besides, was money he had taken out of the shop, which he had no account of; I asked him the reason of that: I had a child in my lap, it was crying; I told him to let the man in the shop examine the bill, I only looked at the sum at the bottom, and gave him the right change; we keep no books in the retail trade, therefore we have no copies of the bills that we send out, and I do not know to whom that bill was sent. After I had given change for the four guineas, he then held out his hand to me with the other money, and said he took that up out of the shop, and that they had no account of that at all: I laid the money down on the opposite side of the table to where I had put the first money, and there was no other money near it; I asked him the reason why he did not bring me any account of that, he said, he did not know, there was no account<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150060"></xptr> count of it, only he had taken half a guinea in the shop, which went into that sum: Mr. Capps came up, and asked me, how much money I had received of Wilson, and if I had counted the money, I told him no; I counted it, and he counted it; I asked him how much I was to receive, he said three pounds nine shillings, there was only three pounds two shillings and sixpence; nobody else had been in at the time: three pounds two shillings and sixpence was the whole of the money that was delivered to me by the prisoner, exclusive of the bill.</p>
               <p>Court. When the prisoner brought up the money was it in his pocket or in his hand? - In his hand.</p>
               <p>Was the four guineas and that money in the same hand? - To the best of my knowledge he had the four guineas and the bill in his right hand, and the other money in his left.</p>
               <p>Did the stairs lead immediately up from the shop to the room where you was? - Yes, there is a door between the shop and the stair-case; I was in the one pair of stairs, and the stair-case comes immediately to that door.</p>

               <p>Court. No: ask him what passed when he and the prisoner were alone? - We were left alone, only Mrs. Thwaites; I said, Wilson, I am sorry for you, I had longknown you, I had a better opinion of you.</p>
               <p>Then you had a good opinion of him? - I had: I desired that as it was too plain and evident to me that he was guilty, that he would let me know the sum that he had robbed me of, as I was taking my stock, for I understood from what I was told, that it was very considerable; I wished him to declare to me himself.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him, that if he disclosed the sum he had robbed you of, you would be as favourable as you could? - I told him, if he would make a plain confession, I would be as favourable to him as lay in my power; I likewise said, that I would be favourable to him as far as it concerned myself, and that I would forgive the injury and offence as far as it concerned me.</p>
               <p>You speak very fairly, we cannot take any notice of that confession. - I never said I would let him go.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. Thwaites. You gave him change of the four guineas in silver? - </p>
               <p>Did you see what he did with that? - No, Sir, he carried the change back with him: I have a little draw, such as there are in desks, in bureaus for silver, and my purse for gold; I kept the table clear on purpose, as they desired I would be particular.</p>
               <p>Which did he give you first, the four guineas or the other money? - The four guineas.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that you gave no part of the money in change of the four guineas? I am very sure of it; I laid it down on the table and did not move it till Capps came into the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Was not you surprized that he should bring up the money of the other peoples? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>Is not every man accountable for the money he receives? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>That is no answer to my question, is not every servant to give you an account of the money he receives? - Yes, but they do not say for what.</p>
               <p>But do not they say I have taken 10 s. or 20 s. he could not give you an account of what money was there? - No.</p>
               <p>Might not he have given the change of that money below stairs? - Then he would not have had the change up stairs I suppose.</p>
               <p>Certainly, I know that as well as you do, suppose a customer comes in, do they run up to you for change of a guinea? - They mention it then particularly: there is a piece of paper lays on a board, one says 2 s. 6 d. another 3 s. 6 d. and the man that is at leisure brings up the money.</p>
               <p>Court to Capps. Was not there an account of this money as it was received in the shop that day put down on the paper as usual? - No, sir, that was seldom done, we frequently are so busy that we cannot do it, we put it all together, and count it without any distinction.</p>

               <p>Was there any paper that day on which the money was set down? - Three of us privately set it down.</p>
               <p>On what paper? - On the back of a bill, that paper we have not now.</p>
               <p>What became of it? - We carried it up to Mrs. Thwaites.</p>
               <p>You left it in her possession? - I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it would be material to produce, that paper as you was so particular? - I do not know what is become of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150063"></xptr>Court to Mrs. Thwaits. Do you know what became of it? - It laid on the table, it might be swept away.</p>
               <p>Was the door between the shop and the stair-case shut or open when the prisoner went up? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did he shut the door after him? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did he put the money in his pocket? - He did not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. There is a door between the shop, and the stair-case, is not there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Opens directly to the stair-case? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. When the prisoner carried the money out of the shop up to your mistress whether that door was shut or open? - I really cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Try? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Then you do not remember his shutting the door after him? - I do not.</p>
               <p>How long was it before Capps went up after the prisoner came down? - About two minutes.</p>
               <p>How long did the prisoner stay above with your mistress? - Not above two minutes, he went directly up.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. All but the 2 s. was set down on a piece of paper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is become of that paper? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was any search made to see if this money had fallen on the stairs? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Thwaits. Do you know? Our stairs are so very plain, that without any search it must have been seen.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.)</p>

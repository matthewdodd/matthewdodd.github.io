On the 26th of last June, Pugh and Underwood came into our shop, about ten in the morning, and asked to see some printed linens. We shewed them great variety, among which was a piece which I folded up, and laid on the counter. There was only one woman in the shop at the time, and I am positive she could not take it, for I saw it after she was gone. They were a long time in buying, and at last<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060054"></xptr> they did buy two yards of coloured linen. There was not a creature in the shop for half an hour after they were gone, but within ten minutes, after they were gone, I missed this piece, which I had folded up. I went out, but could see nothing of them. The same day I got handbills and distributed about, particularly in Field and Chick-lane. The neighbours described them, and desired me to come again in the evening. I went, but did not meet with them. The neighbours desired me to come again in the morning. I went, and then I saw them both go into the Magpye and Horseshoe, at Holborn-bridge. I got a constable on Snow-hill. I knew them extremely well, they having been in our shop twice before. When we went to them, they owned they bought two yards of linen of me, and seemed surprized I should suspect them. We took them to the Mansion house, and they were committed to the Poultry Compter, but were discharged after three days. During which time we advertised the cloth in all the papers, but could not hear any thing of it; then we gave up the search entirely. On the 17th of July Mr. Ramsden, a linen-draper at the corner of Field-lane, whom I had told of our loss, and described the pattern, sent to me. I came. He told me he thought he had got the linen. He shewed it me; they had cut the sag end off where we had put our name; but there was another mark which wholesale drapers would have known it by. The pattern, and the quality of the cloth and my mark was the same as we lost, with the length of yards. My mark was on the outside. (Produced in Court; he points to the mark he made.) I bought the piece myself, and I made this mark on it. It is the letter B, which I always make with red chalk. I know it to be Mr. Blackwell's property.</p>

I bid her open it, and see what it was. She did, and clapt her hands together and said, Lord, master, you will be transported, if this is found in your house. I got up, looked at it, and saw it was new linen. I took and carried it to Mr. Ramsden's, a linen-draper.</p>

            . On the 25th of June, I was up last at night, when I went to bed, the windows in front of the house were fast, and the shutters also; next morning I was called up between three and four o'clock, found the shutter open, and a pane of glass taken out, which would enable a person to put their hand in, and unfasten the window - I do not think any body could get in when it was opened-it is a casement window, there is no bar across. We missed the articles stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If they could not get in at the window, how could they get the property - A. The door had been unbolted inside, which I had left bolted the night before; they could not have got in any where else but at the window. It was daylight when I got up.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live opposite to the prosecutor's I can see his house from my window; on the morning in question, about three o'clock, it was daylight, I saw two men walking backwards and forwards, and looking over into the prosecutor's premises; I came down stairs, and saw the prisoner attempting to hide a bundle in the shrubbery he came in a direction from the prosecuter's house. I did not see him come out of the house - I am sure he is the man, he was not ten yards from me; there was light enough to distinguish him. He returned towards the prosecutor's. I asked him what o'clock it was? he said it had just gone three. I went into my house to fetch my victuals, and when I came out I met him again in the road, about twenty yards from the prosecutor's, going to the same place where I had before seen him carrying the bundle. As I passed the prosecu<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090053"></xptr>tor's house I heard a noise, as if they were breaking doors or locks; I went on further, met Butterfield, and asked his assistance, we went down to where the prisoner had put the bundle - I took it out. As we returned towards the prosecutor's house I saw a man coming in a direction from the house, it is a corner house, there is a lane runs down by the side of it; the man went towards the village, we went in pursuit of him, and found two others in his company-the man who came out of the house was putting his shoes on-as soon as they saw us they all ran away as fast as they possibly could; one of them threw away a bundle. We took the prisoner nearly a mile from the house, he was one of the men - We had been pursuing him all the while, and had them in sight all the way after they came together - We took him in the middle of a field; he struck at me with a stick, and called to the other two for help, but they did not come to his assistance - He struck at us once or twice, and hit me on my neck. We took him back, and gave him in charge. We told him he had got the bundle at Catchpole's. He said he was not the person, but that he had been at Waltham-cross to seek for work. I left the bundle that I found in the shrubbery, and the one they threw away, with Mrs. Catchpole, in the presence of Cresse.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I saw Main. As we passed the house I heard a noise as if somebody was breaking locks. We went to the shrubbery, took the bundle out, and returned towards the house; I saw a man come out of the door, turn to the right, and go towards Winchmore-hill - We pursued him - He saw us coming, and turned back, I saw an iron hook in his hand. As we ran in the pursuit we saw three men, the man who came out of the house was one of them - They ran as fast as they could; one of them threw a bundle away; I saw a man named Tootey pick it up. We followed the men about a mile, and then the prisoner was taken; he defended himself with a stick, and called to the other men by name to help him - They ran away, and one of them shook the iron hook at us. The bundle was delivered to Mrs. Catchpole in the presence of Cresse.</p>

            . I am constable of Edmonton. I know the prosecutor's house, it is in that parish. I produce the bundle which Mr. Catchpole delivered to me. When the prisoner was taken, he denied the charge, said he was a shoemaker, and was coming from the country to look for work.</p>
               <p>PARTHENIA CRESSE re-examined. I saw the bundles delivered to my mistress. Here are three shirts, we lost seven, a table-cloth, a poplin gown, five napkins, and a piece of silk, all of which I know to be my master's property. We lost thirteen table-cloths. There was a great deal more property in the bundles than what is now produced.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from the country, where I had been looking for work, and met two men, who offered me 2s. 6d. to carry the bundles (which were as large again as those produced), to town; they told me to put one in the shrubbery and return, which I did; as I returned I saw two men outside the prosecutor's gate. I went away, and afterwards met the men again at the door - I thought it was not right, and went away; shortly after they overtook me, and we walked together. I was afterwards taken.</p>

               <p>—Prior was foreman in the deer-skin warehouse—he had been six or seven years in my service—it was Bebell's business to see that the warehouse was secure after the others left—his father is locker of the warehouses for the Go<lb></lb>verment, and he introduced me to his son—some time before the 1st of Dec. I found one of the warehouses with the lock off—these skins (<hi rend="italic">looking at then</hi>) are marten-skins—they come from America, in casks, tightly headed up—I had casks of these in my warehouse previous to the 1st of Dec.—I had taken the last cask from the bonded warehouse on the Monday or Tuesday before, and opened it—the skins were counted out by me that evening—Bebell was with me alone—about five or six o'clock, on Thursday evening, the 1st of Dec., I was sent for to the station in Smithfield—I found the blue bag and skins there—I thought I could recognise them as what I had handled on the Tuesday before—this wrapper round them is precisely the same sort of paper which we put coney wool in, and when I first saw it there was a little lock of coney wool on it—I asked Bebell how he came in possession of the skins—he said Mr. Bresler left them at the warehouse, to take to his house, about a quarter before four o'clock—I afterwards saw Prior—he said Bebell gave him the skins to take up Thames-street, and said he would follow—he said Bebell had taken them out of his box or cupboard, or from under the cupboard, and given them to him—Bebell had a cupboard between two of the bonded ware-houses, of which he kept the key—I had forbidden Bebell some time ago to have skins at all about him, or to be seen with them, unless he was ordered by me—I was not aware that he had any in his cupboard—I never had access to it—after that I went with the policeman to Bresler's—the policeman found him—I waited outside—he was asked, in presence of Bebell, if he owned these skint, and if he had given them to Bebell—he said he had not—I pointed to Bresler, and asked Bebell if he was the man that gave him the skins—he said, "Yes"—Bresler said, "No"—to the best of my belief, these four skins, found in the cupboard, that are in the blue bag, are not part of my stock—I think they are so peculiar, that if they had passed through my hands, I should have remembered them—the next morning I went to look at the skins which had been taken out of the barrel by me and Bebell two or three days before—I found twenty-six skins that I thought had been substituted for mine, and three or four of which I was doubtful—on Thursday, the 1st of Dec., I was at the warehouse, at ten minutes to four o'clock—the lockers are in the habit of turning us off at four, and I looked at my watch to see the time—Bresler did not come that day, that I saw—Bebell, I think, was engaged in the room opposite to mine, down to ten minutes to four o'clock, with a man named Davis—I think he was waiting on him when I left—I have public sales it my warehouse—Bresler deals in skins—I think he bought some in March last from my broker—these skins are not part of those bought by him in March last—the twenty-six skins I found in the cask were very bad ones, worth about half-a-crown or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—the others were worth 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when I examined the cask I had some difficulty in getting the skins out—I tore one considerably, which is not here, but here is one I tore—I received this letter, and handed it over to my attorney.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When Sherwinski called on you had you some conversation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not very long—I think not a quarter of an hour—he called within two or three minutes of four o'clock—we spoke about the prisoners—Prior had a subordinate situation to Bebell—Bebell was between me and Prior—I was at the Compter, and in consequence of what Prior's wife said, I went to him—my object was to satisfy my mind, or rather to hear what he would say to it—I went for a good motive, at the instigation of his wife—if he had stated anything to me I should not have conceived I had a right to proceed against him.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he had given an account that was satisfactory to you, you would have given him the benefit of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—here is the torn skin here, and I speak generally to the appearance of them—I did not see these substituted skins in the cask when I looked it over—if there had been twenty-six of these comparatively worthless skins, I think I should have seen them—I have not the shadow of a doubt about the torn skin being mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dealer in skins, and live in Clifton-street. On the 1st of Dec. I lived in Bell-yard, Doctors' Commons—I have known Bebell about two years—I never saw Prior—I saw a few skins produced at the station-house—I cannot say whether these are the same or not—I had not delivered those skins to Bebell at a quarter before four o'clock on the 1st of Dec., to bring to my house that night—I did not give him any skins that day—I was not at Mr. Lampson's that day.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this your bag? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, sir—I cannot swear to it—there is no mark on it—it is not mine—I never had it in my possession—I cannot recollect if I was at Mr. Lampson's that day—I did not see Mr. Sherwinski that day—I have known him about twenty months—I wish I had never known him—he is an interpreter, and an <hi rend="italic">evidence and</hi> a cigar dealer—I have seen him with mustachios—he produced himself as a captain, and a Polish refugee, but be is not—I belong to the Society—he never was on the list—I never saw him act as an attorney's clerk—I have a man of the name of Longworth—I will not swear I was not in Queen-street-place with him that afternoon—I cannot bring it to my recollection.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did anybody come to search your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a man whom I found to be a policeman came in a private dress before the search, and then he came with Mr. Lampson—a man named Thursby is in my employ some<lb></lb>times—I think I never had this bag in my possession—I use blue bags in my trade—I do not furnish bags to persons I deal with—I saw the skins at the station—one or two were produced to me, but I could not swear to them—I think they had holes in the nose—here is one of these has a hole in the nose—I do not recollect that anybody asked me, after Mr. Lampson and the policeman had been, what was the meaning of all this, and that I said, "Do not ask me questions, I know what I do"—I do not think I said to anybody, "Wait and see; I must not be friendly with Sherwinski; business must be done clever; there is a reason for it"—or words to that effect—I am afraid to swear to any thing.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the service of Mr. Lampson about eight years—I was at work on his premises on the 1st of Dec, and Bebell was working with me till about four o'clock—I was working with him as late as four—I did not see Bresler come that day.</p>

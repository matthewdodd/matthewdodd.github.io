I asked her who the note belonged to—she said to her, and that she had had it by her twelve months, and was going to break into it and furnish a house, and get a living by furnished lodgings—I asked Mr. Davis whether he knew her—he said yes, for eight or ten years, and had never known anything wrong of her—that was in her presence—I ad<lb></lb>vanced 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the note up to 14th September, and charged 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on each advance—I know the note by the number, 62259—I have never advanced money on notes before; I do not know whether it is right, but we advance, money on money—they pawn money, and we charge interest on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Miller, who is at sea. I live at Woolwich. On the 8th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, I missed two pairs of shoes and a handkerchief—the prisoner had been at my place at six o'clock that evening—these are my boots and handkerchief—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are these ladies' boots? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, gentlemen's—my husband has been at sea four years—I draw his half-pay in the Dock-yard—the prisoner and I have drank gin together many times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What has become of the shawl that was found on your person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is to be found out another time—I did not come here on the shawl case—I have nothing to say about where it was said to be stolen from—it was not found on my shoulders—it was found in my possession, cer<lb></lb>tainly, and I bought it—I accused the prisoner of having stolen that shawl—I did not tell the Magistrate that I bought it of a respectable lady who is gone to Ireland, and I have a witness to certify I never said it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did any body accuse you of saying that the clerk made a mistake, and he took that down as if you said it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I came here on my own business, and I expect to be shown justice—I never said I bought the shawl of a respectable lady who is gone to Ireland—the mistake the clerk made is not my business—I never said I bought the shawl of a lady whose</p>

               <p>name I did not know—the clerk made a mistake something about Ireland, but it was a mistake—I said I got it from the prisoner—whether I went and drank with the prisoner that night has nothing to do with this—I go where I think proper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you ever accused of taking the soldiers' necessaries from them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I was fined, and paid two fines for it—the Magistrate fined me, and it is not your business to rebuke me for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever ask any money not to prosecute this case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Me ask money, Sir? did I ever say so? where is the witness? I never asked 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—not a fraction—not a farthing—I never called on the prisoner's hus<lb></lb>band since she has been sent to gaol—I saw him to-day—I did not ask 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of him—I will swear that twenty thousand times over—I did not go to his house on Thursday or Friday, or any other day since she has been com<lb></lb>mitted to prison.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go any day before she was committed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is my business—I never asked 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from her husband—I declare to G—I never did—not a fraction—I will tell you no more.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a shop at Woolwich for the sale of old clothes. The prisoner came to me with these boots to sell on the 8th of December—I did not buy them—she said she had a child very bad—I said I would not buy them that day, it being Sunday—she begged of me to let her have a trifle—I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and she said she would come on the Monday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About fourteen years—she has borne an honest character—I saw the pro<lb></lb>secutrix, and from what she said, I imagined this was all at an end—I said I would give up the goods to her, and she said I should never hear any more of it.</p>

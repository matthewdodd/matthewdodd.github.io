It was a pinchbeck watch, in a shagreen case, a steel chain and seal, set in gold. Then he went off, and I went on. It was moon-light, but I did not take particular notice of him.

               <p>Q. Why did you suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Barnet. I had seen him on horseback in a bye-lane two nights before. We rode after him, and enquired, and found he had not gone through the turnpike. Then we rode towards Little Chelsea, and between the Queen's Elm and Little Chelsea, we let him go past about two hundred yards. We had each a pistol, and rode to him, and said if he did not submit we would blow his brains out. He had a cane in his hand, and began playing away with it, and broke my fellow-servant's head very badly. It was a little cane, and I believe it had a bullet in the end of it. After a good deal of resistance we secured him. There came a hackney-coach, and we put him into that, and carried him before Sir

He shewed me a pistol and demanded my money. He was without boots and had white stockings on, cotton or thread. I delivered to him, I believe, between three and four pounds. I know there were six half guineas, a six-and nine-penny piece, and a five-and-three-pence in a silk purse. It was done very quick. He was not above a minute with me. I believe it was the prisoner, but I will not be positive; one man may be like another; he is very much like him, and had on the same kind of cloaths the prisoner has on now.

            . On Sunday the 19th of November, as I was returning in a post chariot with Mr. Elliot from Belfound, where I had been to see my wife and child, about a quarter of a mile on this side the thirteenth mile-stone, the glass of the chariot being up, there came by a person, who seemed to me to be the prisoner, mounted on a chesnut or sorrel horse. He had white stockings on. He turned round immediately, and the chariot stopped. I saw a pistol at the glass. The person swore very terribly to let the glass down directly. Mr. Elliot could not get it down. I assisted but could not. I pulled down the glass on the other side, and put my head out with my money to give it him. He said, if I did not take my head in, he would blow my brains out immediately. I don't positively swear the prisoner is the man. It was but a short time he was with us.</p>

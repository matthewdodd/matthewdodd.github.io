               <p>Q. Were you employed in the yard of Messrs. Perrys, Blackwall, on the 8th of July? - A. I was; I am store-keeper.</p>

               <p>Q. In the repairing of her, when bolts are pulled out, if they are found serviceable are they made use of again? - A. If they are fit to be drove in again they are used.</p>
               <p>Q. If they are unserviceable they are returned to Government - had any copper bolt been drove out of the ship for the purpose of repair? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner been for some time employed as a <rs id="t18050710-32-deflabel185" type="occupation">shipwright</rs>

               <p>Q. Was he employed on the Powerful? - A. He had been, but not at the time of this transaction.</p>

               <p>Q. On last Monday evening, in consequence of any information, did you watch the prisoner at the bar? - A. I did; a little after seven in the evening, I was walking round the Powerful of seventy-four guns, I observed his brother and him at the stern of the Powerful; I walked towards the head of the ship; soon after I saw the prisoner go on board the seventy-four.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any business to go on board of her? - A. None at all; I immediately went to the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the gate out of which the prisoner must go to get out of the yard? - A. Yes; I stoped at the gate to watch and to stop him; I stopped there a very few minutes; I saw the prisoner at the bar coming towards the gate, and as soon as he saw me, he ran back again; I made towards him, and ordered him to be stopped; immediately he pulled out a bolt from his breast and put it down a cellar window; he kept on; I desired the other people to stop him, he being still in the dock-yard, he was stopped; I saw Mr. Willis pick up the bolt, and I immediately returned and took the bolt from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that the bolt you saw Mr. Willis pick up was the bolt that the prisoner threw down? - A. Yes; I took the prisoner before Mr. Wells; he asked him, what he was going to do with the bolt; he answered, that the people had not paid him his wages for the last month and he had taken this bolt to make up his money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. His Majesty's ship the Powerful is under repair in Mr. Welis's yard - What is the name of the firm? -

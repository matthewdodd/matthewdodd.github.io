I live at Cold-blow-lane, in the parish of Deptford, and am a guard in the service of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway—on 2d April, I attached a truck to a train that was going to Horsham—the truck was placed at the entrance to the Commercial Dock—it was near the points of the Thames Junction Railway—at the time I attached it to the train, the doors were shut, and the pins properly placed in the fastenings—the truck was sent on to Horsham by the train that evening—I did not go with it beyond New-cross—I did not see what it contained—I did not see the truck brought up to the points—I have heard since where the prisoners live—I should think the truck was placed on the line about 60 yards from the garden of the house occupied by the prisoners—it might be more than that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of police, atttached to the Brighton Railway—on the morning of 3d April last, I received a telegraphic message from the witness Capelin; in consequence of which, I went to Deptford Wharf, where Mr. Capelin pointed out to me the place where the truck had stood—close by there, I saw that wheat had been scattered on the ground, and eight or ten yards from there, I found some more had been scattered on the ground; and also some footsteps of a man; at least a large footmark—and from there, I traced it across the yard to a garden wall, immediately at the back of where the prisoners live—that wall is about six feet high from the garden side, but it is level with the top of the company's yard—you have to get down six feet into the garden—there was some wheat scattered inside the garden, and also some footsteps there of a man—from further inquiry I was led to go to the lodging of the prisoners, which is in the top room of the house, No. 10, Grove-street, Deptford—the garden wall is at the back of a row of houses, but a little at right-angles from the prisoner's house itself; but the footsteps went in that direction—it does not belong to the house itself, but there is an opening from that house into the garden—I saw the female prisoner Fling there—I asked her what had become of the wheat that she had had—she said, "I have had no wheat; I know nothing about any wheat"—on looking round the room, in a corner I saw a clothes' basket, and on pulling some things from the top, I found this dish full of wheat in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186105050073"></xptr>
               <p>the basket—I then said to her, "Where did you get this from?"—she said, The little boy brought it"—I said, What little boy?"—she said, "My little boy"—I then made a further search of a bed that was in the room on the floor, not a bedstead—I lifted up the bottom part of the bed, and under it found this bag of wheat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is about a bushel as near as possible—I then removed the bedclothes; and in the bed I found this bundle of wheat, which is about another peck, tied up in an apron in the bed, covered over with the bedclothes—I asked Fling if it was her apron—she said it was—I asked her how she accounted for the wheat being there—she said the little boy had brought it in—at this time the prisoner Brian came into the room—I asked him if he lived there—he said he did—I told him that I was a police-officer, and that some wheat had been stolen from a truck on the railway last night, and that I had found it here, and asked him what account he could give of it, or wished to give of it—he said, "Last night I came home from work, and was having my tea about half-past 6, when the little boy brought it in"—I did not see the little boy on the premises at that time—I said it was impossible that a little boy could bring this in—he said, "He brought some last night, and some this morning"—I said, "It is also utterly impossible that a little boy could bring it over that wall, as the wall is over six feet high; a little boy could not get up;" if he went more than once, he would have to get up again—the woman then said that the little boy had found it honestly on the line, and had brought it home—I then left them in custody of a police-constable of the M division, and went downstairs, and in the passage adjoining the house, I found the boy—I asked him what his name was, he told me it was Kilty—I then took him upstairs to where the other two prisoners were, and showed him the wheat, and told him what the other two prisoners had said; that he had brought the wheat—he said that a man had told him to bring it home—I asked him how he brought it home, and he said, "A little at a time"—I have compared the wheat found in all these places, and also that in the sack that it was taken from, and that on the ground, and I find that all of it corresponds—there are two peculiar sorts of black seeds among it in each sample, in the bag, the dish, the original sack, that in the basket, and the apron; and I found the same on the ground, and in the original sack—no person is permitted to go on the line except those employed—there are caution boards up—it is utterly impossible that a boy of Kilty's size could get down with anything like the quantity of wheat that was there, or without help it would be next to impossible for him to get up to the truck door, it would be quite six feet high—the whole quantity of wheat here, is, I suppose, a bushel and half a peek; and that littered on the ground, would account foe the remaining portion missing from the sack—two bushels were left in the sack—the proper amount in a full sack is four bushels.</p>

I am superintendent on the Brighton Railway, at the Deptford wharf near Grove-street—on 2d April, I gave directions to Watson for the loading of a box-truck—I saw the truck when it was drawn out from the dock, and I saw it when it was attached to the train ready to go away—it was brought from the docks about half-past 4—it was placed at the points of the Commercial Dock, close to the junction; that might be</p>

When I came home I asked him where he got it; he said that a man told him to take it, and that the man took some himself; I told him to take it away, I could do no good with it, and he ran away from me. I told my neighbours about it, and said I should chuck it away; but they told me to leave it there. This man saw nothing of it; the boy put it under the bed; he kept away from school, and slept out three nights because I beat him for going on the railroad.

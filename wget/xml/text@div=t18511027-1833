Glyn's, and received six 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, and some gold and silver, I took the number of the first note—here is my memorandum of it, "No. 24769, July 9th"—the other notes were consecu<lb></lb>tive numbers, so I did not take them down—I went home in the same <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> I had gone in, and locked them up in my trunk—I saw the prisoner in the coffee-room next day (Saturday)—on that morning, about 8 o'clock, I took the notes out, and enclosed them in a large envelope—I found them in the same state as I had left them—in the evening I was at the Argyle-rooms, from 9 till half-past 11—I met the prisoner there soon after I went—he came up and said he believed we lived in the same hotel together—he said he was a native of Baden, in the military service—he did not tell me his name—I said I thought the hotel must be very full, as they had at first given me a room very high up in the house—he said he had been in the same way; he had his second room now, and asked me what the number was of my room—</p>

               <p>I told him it was No. 17—he said we were very close together, he had No 14, and he would come up to my room next morning about 6, because I had been telling him he got up very late in the morning, as I saw him about 2 in the day taking his breakfast and coffee—I said it would be of no use to come to my room at 6, for he would not find me there at that time—I do not recol<lb></lb>lect that I told him I was not going home that night—I think I saw him there when I left—I got to the hotel next morning between 6 and 7, and went to my trunk to get a book, to lay down a few hours to read—the trunk was disturbed—I could not find the book which I had put on top of my trunk; it was locked, but I found some difficulty in opening it, which I had not noticed before—I was lying down reading—I got up between 9 and 10—I then went again to my trunk to get the notes, and take the numbers of all of them—I missed three 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, but can only tell the numbers of two, which were 24773 and 24774—those were two of the six I got from Glyn's bank, the other four were all right—I bad other notes there—I remained in my room some time—at 10 o'clock I sent for Mrs. Quartermaine, she came to my room at once—it might have been between 11 and 12 when I went down-stairs—I met the prisoner coming up-stairs; I only bid him good morning—he said he had been to an apothecary's shop, and got some medicine for his leg—I saw him again on Monday morning in the coffee-room—I was afterwards obliged to go to Germany, and have been fetched from Germany as a witness—a sergeant of police was sent to insist on ray coming.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant</hi>). I took the prisoner at Do<lb></lb>bourgh's Hotel, Haymarket, on Wednesday, 8th Oct., in consequence of in<lb></lb>formation I received—it was about 7 o'clock in the evening when he came in—I had been waiting at the hotel for him since 2—I called the interpreter, and told him what I was taking him for—he knew me, because he had seen me before—I found on him a purse, five or six keys, one or two of them broken, and a little instrument which would open almost any small trinket-lock, and this other article, which appears to be a small button-book straightened—the prisoner made no intelligible reply to the charge—I had seen him before the note was traced, on Tuesday morning, Sept. 30th, at the York Hotel—I remember his leaving that morning, there was a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> brought, which he ordered to drive to the Dover Railway.</p>

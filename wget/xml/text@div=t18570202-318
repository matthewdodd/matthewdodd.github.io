                  </hi>. I am the resident medical officer at the London Hospital. On Monday afternoon, 5th Jan., the prisoner was brought to the hospital—she was in a state of approaching coma, or insensibility, from the effects of laudanum—I gave her an emetic—I examined the discharge from the stomach; there was no question as to its character—when she was somewhat recovered from the effects of the poison, I asked her what led her to do it—she said that she was anxious to go to heaven, and that she had also given her child some, in order to take it to its father who was in heaven—I sent for the child; I found it suffering from, the symptoms of poison by opium—it was nearly five years of age—I cannot at this moment remember its name—it was a male child—she Raid it was her child—about 8 o'clock the same evening she said that she had been to Yarmouth to bury her father; that on her return she found that her husband had committed suicide; that she had been endeavouring to support her child and herself by needlework, and being unable to obtain a subsistence by that employ<lb></lb>ment, she had bought about 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of laudanum, at different chemists, part of which she had taken herself, and the rest she had given to her child—I did not take any means of ascertaining what quantity the child had taken—I gave it an emetic, but owing to the carelessness of the nurse, what it threw up was thrown on one side—the child was fast lapsing into a state of coma—I should say it had taken sufficient to be dangerous to life, but, fortunately, there was a large amount of food on the stomach, which ren<lb></lb>dered the absorption of the poison less liable to prove fatal to the child.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Williams, and live at No. 14, Bedford-street, Stepney. The prisoner lodged with me, with her child—its name was William Jukes—on Monday afternoon, 0th Jan., she asked me for a cup of tea—I did not observe anything about her at that time, but shortly afterwards she was raving, and in a great way about her husband, and I thought she was ill—I happened to look round the room, and on the washing stand I found a phial, marked "laudanum," and a mug by the side of it—I sent for a doctor—she was taken to the London Hos<lb></lb>pital, and the child about an hour afterwards—the child seemed very ill at first, but afterwards it seemed much livelier.</p>

I saw this property safe about eight o'clock in the evening of the 9th of May, when I left the house; some was locked up in different places, and some in boxes, and on shelves. I was called up about seven o'clock in the morning, and went to Mrs. Clare's, and missed the articles mentioned in the indictment, from my shop; I saw part of them next day at Guildhall, and part on the ground floor of the prisoner's house, Angel-court, Grub-street, where he lived with his father.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Does any servant of your's sleep at this house? A. No; Mrs. Clare lives there and takes care of the premises for me - she pays me rent for the upper part of the house - I pay the rent and taxes of the whole house - I pay her no salary - she merely attends to my business if I am out. The prisoner had left my service a few days before - his father is now in my employ, and has given me information to get part of the property back.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Whose dwelling-house is it? A. Mrs. Clare pays me rent - we both enter at the same door.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH CLARE. I rent part of this house of Mr. Wilby at 30 l. a-year; he occupies the shop and counting house; the street door leads into the shop. On the 9th of May I went to bed at half-past twelve o'clock; I was not disturbed in the night; about half-past six o'clock in the morning my servant called me up - I found Mr. Wilby's counting-house and shop strewed all over with goods - the bolts and bars were undone, but there was no appearance of force; the persons must have got in at a small opening leading to the cellar; it was just wide enough for a person to get in - he must then force the cellar door, which fastens with a small button - I cannot say whether it was buttoned or not - it opens into the passage - the counting-house was not locked - two drawers in the counting-house were broken open - I lost some spoons from the kitchen, which is on the same floor as the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you pay a less rent in consideration of your minding the shop occasionally? A. No; I merely assist as his family are friends of mine; the shop and work-shop was for his exclusive use - the cellar door could be easily opened, as the top part was quite loose; I found a chisel on Mr. Wilby's desk; which did not belong to him.</p>

            . I am a City patrol. On the 10th of May, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, Mr. Wilby sent for me; I examined his premises - three locks were broken - I got a search warrant and went to No. 5, Angel-court, Grub-street; the prisoner was at home there with his mother; his father came in while I was searching - I found nothing in the lower part of the house and went away; his father fetched me between six and seven o'clock the same evening - the prisoner was then in the Compter - his mother delivered me some of Mr. Wilby's property, and four of Mrs. Clare's spoons. The chisel exactly fits the marks on the locks which were forced.</p>

            . I am a refiner and live in Little Britain. After the prisoner was committed I saw him in Newgate, and said I thought he had better give me information about it; he had lived with me, and I felt an interest in his behalf; he told me that Ferris was the man who planned it, and that the things left at the coffee-shop was his share of the plunder - Ferris lived with Mr. Wilby at the time - I believe he has mislead the prisoner.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM TURNER sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at work in the house, up in the two pair of stairs room; he came up and laid, he wanted a job; I said, they were gone to beer, and he went down stairs, and I saw him go into the front parlour; I followed him out, and got to the street-door, and he met Forsdick there, and he asked him if he would give him a job, and he said no; I took him by the collar, and said, before you go, let us see if you have any thing that does not belong to you; and I found a saw concealed under his coat, (the saw produced in Court,) I went to a public-house and got a constable.</p>
               <p>Forsdick. This is my saw; I know it by two teeth being broke out, that I had punched out about two months ago, I have had the saw these three years; I had left it upon a bench in the front parlour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought that saw of Mr. Howell, in Coelsea; if it is mine, there is a tooth broke out near the handle, and another within two inches of the bottom; I was going to look for a job; I have been so long out work, that if I could not have got a job, I should have been obliged to fell it.</p>
               <p>Forsdick. The Magistrates were not sitting, and we went to a public-house, and there he saw the saw, and the mark upon it, as it lay upon the table, there is Mr. Howell's name upon it; I am sure it is my saw, I have had it three years.</p>

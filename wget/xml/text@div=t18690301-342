I live at 5, Abbey Street, Bethnal Green—on the morning of 8th February, about 2.30, I was coming round the corner of Abbey Street into Cheshire Street—I saw the two prisoners at the window of Mr. Temple's shop—Baker was taking the shoes out, and handing them to Wilkinson—they ran away, and I ran after them—Wilkinson ran down a court, and Baker ran down the road—I followed Baker first, because Wilkinson could not get down the court, as there was no thoroughfare—I nearly got hold of Baker, when he turned round and threw the shoes at me when I was close to him—I could not catch him then, and I went back to the court and stood in the road—I called "Police?"—Wilkinson came down the court, came towards me, and said, "What is all this about?"—I said, "I think someone has been breaking in over there, and one has gone down there"—he walked across the road, and I followed him—he stooped down and said, "Holloa, he has got him"—I caught hold of him and said, "I have got you, there were two of you, and you were one of them"—a policeman came up with Baker—I went down the court with the officer and found some shoes at the bottom, seme in a dust-bin, and some outside—they were taken across to Mr. Temple's shop.</p>

I had occasion to leave town - Mrs. Paterson and the family left on the 7th of October; I followed in a few days, and occasionally came backwards and forwards - I had known the prisoner from his birth, and his father and mother before him; I had a most excellent opinion of him, and on leaving town I left the house under his special care - he recommended me a person to be in the house, but I explained to him that I relied on him himself for the safe custody of every thing there; I remained out of town till December - I occasionally came back, and then went to Cadogan-place; the bed-rooms were kept in order for me - I returned to town a few days before Mrs. Paterson, and on her coming to town I discovered a new key in her wardrobe, in the lock of the drawer - it was a strange key; I know the gold chains were missed, but I had not put them away myself.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070019"></xptr>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Were there workmen employed about your house? A. A good many painters were employed - there were perhaps half a dozen; I do not exactly know the number - they were there some weeks; they had access to the rooms they were to paint - the wardrobe was in the bed-room, which was painted and papered; I cannot say how many were employed in that room, I left that to the master - I have called on the prisoner since he has been in prison; I told him I did not make any proposals to him - I went to induce him to give up my property; I held out no inducement to him - I represented to him his ingratitude in robbing me when he had been born in my father's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say nothing of this kind to him, that if the things had been taken by him, if they were conveyed to you secretly, so that by any direction you might not be presumed to know from whence they came, you would do him all the good you could? A. I did not say any thing in those terms, I will tell you what I said - he asked me how he might convey them; I told him I would not tell him how to convey things to my house without it being known from whom they came, but I had no doubt he was cunning enough to know.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Then the conversation arose from his asking you how he was to convey property to you? A. Certainly, and not from me.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not request that your interview with the prisoner should be in secret? A. I did not, at least I do not know that I request it - the governor immediately told one of his men to show me into a private room; I do not know that he said</p>
               <p>"private," but there was no third person present - in fact I had previously asked the Magistrate if I should do wrong in going there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state to the prisoner or his wife, that it would be better for him to assign over any property he possessed to you? A. No - she offered it; I only went to the prisoner once in prison - I had only one interview with him on the subject, in the prison or elsewhere; his wife called on me twice - I have never received any property from the prisoner, nor seen any but what will be produced; I have received none from him, nor any body connected with him - I was absent from the 7th of October till the 12th of December.</p>

            's absence till December; I had no key in my personal care, except the key of the street door, and that I could not lock outside - Mr. Broach had the keys of the several doors of the house, except the street door; he was there frequently doing upholsterer's work and other things - I remember Captain Paterson coming home in December, and I went to find the prisoner, as Captain Paterson wanted him; I searched for him for some time, and called for him, but received no answer to my call - I then went down stairs; I came up again, went to the drawing-room door, and heard a door unlocked - I then went up stairs, and saw the prisoner at the bed-room door, locking the bed-room door: he was coming from Captain Paterson's bed-room, and had a hammer and screw-driver in his hand - I told him I had been calling for him several times; he made no answer to that - while I was looking for him, I had tried the door of Captain Paterson's bed-room to see if he was there, and could not open it - there was a press which used to stand in the nursery bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any morning soon after the day you have spoken of seeing the press in the nursery bed-room? A. Yes - I went in again in the course of that day, and saw the press had been removed about an inch and a half or two inches, and I saw a small piece of calico laying there which had not been there before; I do not know whether the street door has a spring lock - the prisoner could go out without being let out, and used to do so; he could not come in again without knocking - he kept the key of Captain 
               <persName id="t18310407-12-person261">Paterson</persName>
            's bed-room; it was only in my possession when the Captain was in town - when I wanted to make the bed the door was unlocked for me; on all other occasions the prisoner kept the key, and I never had it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. About how many persons were employed about the house? A. I cannot exactly say the number - there might be seven painters, or there might be more; the painters only had one assistant.</p>
               <p>Q. You called at the door of the bed-room on a particular occasion, is there any small chamber off that bed-room where he might be, not choosing to answer exactly at that moment? A.There is a closet near the bed-room where might be.</p>

            . I am shopman to Bilborough and Co. pawnbrokers, in South Audley-street. I merely produce two duplicates of pledges; on the 16th of October the prisoner pawned a pair of bracelets for 7l.; I am quite sure of his person; I looked at the article carefully before I advanced the money - five or six rows of gold chains composed the bracelets, and it had a snap set with turquoise; each chain was separated from the rest - on the same day I took in from him two gold chains and a pair of ear-rings, for 5l.; on the 22nd of December he redeemed the two gold chains and one pair of ear-rings - I am the person who delivered them out to him, as well as received them, and on the 24th he redeemed the bracelets - (looking at a case of jewellery produced by the prosecutrix) these are so much like the articles, that I should have said they really were the same; that observation applies as well to the bracelets as to the chain - there were two chains.</p>
               <p>MRS. PATERSON. These are the three volumes of Gibbon's Rome, which I left behind, and here is the first volume, which I did not lock up - the articles of jewellery which I have produced are an accurate representation of the bracelets and chain which I lost from my wardrobe; I have procured these from a friend - there is no perceptible difference between them; I could not have distinguished them from my own - I knew my friend had such ornaments, and having lost mine, I applied to her to lend me these.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know where your friend bought them? A. They came from India, and so did mine - I never saw any of them but my own and this set- I call the bracelets produced one pair; mine were not under any lock except the lock of the wardrobe in which they were deposited - the property might have been taken part at a time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Besides the articles produced, did you iniss some table-cloths? A. I did; also twenty-three napkins, two gowns, and a shawl - I think the two pairs of bracelets were worth at least 15l.; the two gold chains were given to me and I suppose them to be worth more than 5l.; I consider one pair of bracelets to be worth 10l. and this gold chain I should think a jeweller would charge ten guineas for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Unfortunate as I am in being placed here to answer a very serious charge, I hope I shall not be more unfortunate in having to encounter a prejudice against me, from having been described as a wholesale robber, and my case having been six months on the town, as it is said - I hope you will feel for me; you may consider what is my case to-day may be yours hereafter. My connexion with the prosecutor has been very ancient; my father and mother lived with his father and mother - when my father and mother came to town, they settled in business, and his house was a home for these young gentlemen to come to; they used to come to our house, and stop there waiting for ships to India, though their father and mine were in different situations in life, such is the affection of Scotchmen for each other; when about twelve years old, I went with the captain as midshipman - I was accustomed to see his property in my father's possession, and was accustomed to make free with it for my own use, and I certainly did not consider I was doing wrong in taking the books, which I declare I only took to read, having no copy of my own; on going home I met a person, with whom I stopped; I laid these books down behind my back in the parlour where I sat, and taking the books up, I went home, without noticing the number, and when I got home I found only three volumes; I looked about in the Captain's house to see if I had left one volume there; not finding it, I took them to Taylor to make up the other volume - I never took them to him to sell; it was a rule with him and me that I never left books for sale; I called on him two or three times to know if he had made up the books, as I was anxious the Captain should have his books back perfect. Another fact I apprehend you will notice, I took no money on the books, therefore there was no selling; as for the other things, I know nothing whatever of them. I remember in October a lady who lodged in my house, and who came from India, had run into arrears with my wife, who had expressed her displesure at not having her money; she was separated from her husband; she told me she was short of money, brought out a jewel-case, and asked me to raise her money on it; I took the case - I did not know the contents; she asked me to get about 15l., and I got 12l.; at Queen-square the pawnbroker's man had Woodbery at his elbow, talking to him about the five chains, and all those minute descriptions, and then he could describe accurately about the turquoise, as he had had the description given him; he said, after a little hesitation, he should not like to swear to them if he saw them, and when he was called up, the prosecutor was sitting by the Magistrate, and I believe if it had not been from some secret hint he received, he would have sworn they were the identical things pawned by me; the only thing I remember among them was, there was some chain like a guard chain, from which the lady took a locket, and let me take the chain; but as far as I remember, they were as much like those things as I am like that door; when he was checked, as I believe, for swearing to them, he said he thought the case was not so fiesh; "No, (said the prosecutor,) it was an old case, a semicircular one;" "Yes,(said the witness) with the corners taken off;" but they were juggling, and determined to make the thing pass if they could. I am perfectly innocent. I admit taking the books under the circumstance stated; it is for you to say whether I took them feloniously or not. I left them with a man I was well known to, and did not go out of the way to dispose of them. I knew they were exposed in his shop. I was not afraid of them; and with the things I pawned I gave my own name and address. I am as perfectly innocent of the robbery as any individual Court. As for myself, the result is of little conse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070021"></xptr>quence to me; I am bankrupt in every thing. I have lost my character, and am down. I certainly have a wife, with whom I have lived on very good terms, and it is for her sake, and not my own, that it is of any consequence to me.</p>

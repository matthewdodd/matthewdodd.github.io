               <p>I am thirteen.</p>
               <p>Do you know the nature of an oath? - My mother told me if I should tell an untruth I should go to the bad place.</p>
               <p>And do you know that you are liable to be punished by law, and be sent to gaol? - Yes. - I was sent out with a basket of things on a Saturday night, a good while ago.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - A good bit ago.</p>
               <p>Was it three weeks or a month, or how long? - I believe it was, my mother is a washerwoman, I was going to carry some things to Mr. Cart, No. 33, Norfolk-street in the Strand, and some things belonging to his footman; I was sent about half after six, I had knocked at the door, and somebody came and snatched the basket out of my hand; my mother gave me a particular caution before I went out, and I held them very fast all the way, but when they snatched it I was obliged to let it go; I do not know rightly the person, he was dressed in blue, I took hold of him, and held him, he had the basket, so he fell down off the curb-stone, and I fell down too, so he got up again, and took hold of the basket, and ran round the corner, and gave it to a man that stood there; they ran different ways, and I followed him that had the clothes, I cried stop thief, and a footman stopped him, so he threw down the basket and ran away; I picked up the basket and the clothes; he was not taken at that time, I took the clothes home to Norfolk-street, and by that time they had taken the man.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the men they took were the same men? - No, Sir, I did not see his face.</p>

               <p>Where did you first see him? - In Norfolk-street;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190074"></xptr> I saw him run from the gentleman's door with the basket in his hand, I think it was near the gentleman's door, and the same man had the basket all the time.</p>

               <p>Court to M. Dalley. Was the man in light coloured clothes in sight of the door when the man snatched the basket? - I should think he could not, the first man that took the basket got away.</p>

               <p>Do you know any thing of this prisoner Tranter? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>What do you come here for? - I was taken up upon suspicion of this robbery.</p>
               <p>Who do you come to give evidence about? - Nobody; I was greatly terrified, the man that took me told me to make a confession, and they told me if I did not I should be hanged, and if I did I should go to gaol for a few days, and be admitted as an evidence, and have good victuals and drink, and a bed, and a shilling each day, and part of a great reward; after I made this confession they desired me to sign it, which I did.</p>
               <p>Who was it told you this? - The man that took me, Sears I believe his name is.</p>
               <p>Was Atkins present? - Not at the time this man told me this.</p>
               <p>How came you to confess you had been a party in the robbery? - I did not confess any further than they told me to say, they told me that if I did not I should be hanged, if I did I should receive victuals and drink, a bed, and a shilling a day, and part of a great reward; Atkins told me that this Adamson was taken, and if I did not swear to him I should be hanged; the next time they asked me if I had any money, and Atkins gave me eighteen-pence, and told me to stick to what I had said; my friends told me to tell truth, and said what a sad thing it was to tell lies, this is the truth I tell now upon oath.</p>
               <p>Court. You know you have taken an oath, you know the consequence if you speak falsly? - This is the truth, I positively swear it.</p>
               <p>Court. Let Williams be remanded to Newgate, till this matter is further enquired into.</p>
               <p>Atkins. My Lord, the other man that attended is here on purpose to explain this matter, we were not bound over.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall desire Mr. Hodgson, the short-hand writer, to make out a copy of this evidence, and give it to Mr. Shelton, that it may be sent to Sir Sampson Wright.</p>
               <p>Court to M. Dalley. I think you say that Tranter was not the man that took the basket from you? - No, it was another man.</p>
               <p>And that the man that received the basket was round the corner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. In strictness of law in this case, I think both the prisoners ought to be acquitted on this indictment, without putting them on their defence, there is no evidence whatever against Adamson, and Tranter appears to be the receiver; a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190075"></xptr> man must be actually present, aiding and abetting to constitute him a principal.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Dock Constable</hi>). On Sunday morning, 13th January, at 6 o'clock, I was on duty and had to pass the office of the docks every half-hour—the premises were safe at 8 o'clock—I then went to breakfast, and at 9 o'clock Wilton and I started again to go our rounds—I went to the back of the dock office and heard a noise as if a ledger had fallen from a desk—Wilton went to the back and I went to the front and found a square of glass broken near the window catch—I tried the front doors and then heard somebody in the office, and looking in I saw the prisoner and a man who has escaped—they came out at the middle door—I gave chase and caught the prisoner, who struck me three violent blows in the eye, which was closed for three days afterwards; he threw me to the ground and my collar bone was put out—I got up and he held me by my whiskers and pulled the flesh off behind my whiskers—I threw him down again—I searched him at the gate and found a sovereign in his trousers pocket, and two half-sovereigns and a quantity of silver in his trousers pocket, among which was this counterfeit florin, which has two pieces cut out of it—in his side pocket I found this bag with more silver in it, this penknife, and some postage and receipt stamps.</p>

                  </hi>. I stood at the back of the office, and in two or three minutes heard a cry of "Police," and saw the constable struggling with the prisoner—I helped to secure him and saw these things taken from him.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I met a man who I had known for a day or two, and outside the dock I received some money, tobacco, and a knife from him. He was with another man, and they both went in together. Sullivan said "Stand here," and they went on, and afterwards he came and handed me this bag of silver. The policeman then got hold of me and got my finger into his mouth. <hi rend="smallCaps">

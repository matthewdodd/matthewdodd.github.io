I live at Grove House, Old Farthing Lane, Wands<lb></lb>worth—on the evening of 12th November last, about 9.30, I was coming up Old Farthing Lane and saw four men standing at the corner of a street—I passed them and went a good way up the street till very near my own gate—they passed me and stopped till I came up to them, when one of them came round to me, put his face under my umbrella, which I had in</p>

What good would it do to you after you have robbed me?"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my purse and umbrella, and this is one of the penknives—after they had done what they possibly could and got what they could from me they ran off and left me lying in the street with my head bleeding from eight wounds—I recovered myself a little and tried to get up, but was not able at first—the second time I was able and I got into my own house, and sent for the doctor, who came and dressed my wounds, and has attended me ever since—I was unable to attend the Court for some time—I cannot swear to the prisoners, but I thoroughly believe they are the men.</p>

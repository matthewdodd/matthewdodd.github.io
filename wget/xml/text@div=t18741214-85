(<hi rend="italic">This was dated from Newton Abbott, requesting 'Mr. Wullman to let him know whether the cheques were all right, as he feared that during his illness there might not be money to meet them.</hi>) The cheques were presented three times.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the West of England and South Wales Bank, Plymouth—the prisoner had an account there, but it was overdrawn 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 13th October these two cheques were presented and dis<lb></lb>honoured—on 21st July I sent the prisoner his pass-book; he was then debtor 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw him in August, and he gave me two bills which he wished to have discounted—I told him I could not do so, as I could not obtain sufficient information about the acceptors, but I would hold them till they were paid—he said "I am expecting a remittance every day, and will come in and pay the balance"—I told him I should pay no more cheques—the first letter I wrote to him in reference to his account was on 28th June, 1874—this is a copy of it (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He opened his account in August, 1871, and an average of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year passed through the bank—he paid in 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. during the last six months—I paid a cheque for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. next day, after giving him notice that he had overdrawn—it is not unusual for persons to overdraw, if they give security—we now hold this bill for 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it is not due till next April—credit for 126<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was actually given to the prisoner on 23rd October—if a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had come in next morning I should not have paid it; I should have asked them to present it again—he wrote to me on 9th November, and said "I am compelled to stop here; by to-morrow or the following day a large sum shall be paid in to my account. Will you then be good enough not to return my cheques if any be presented in the interval? I beg this as a particular favour"—a gentleman has, told me that he was about to advance him 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if it had not been for his arrest.</p>

            . I live in Plumtree-street, Bloomsbury, and am a basket-maker. I have a slight knowledge of the prisoner; he came to my father's house in Quaker-street on the 20th of May: I was there, and he asked me if I would purchase two bundles of rods - I asked where they were; he said if I could go with him, he would show me - he took me to a court near my father's, where I saw Keetch and these two bundles of rods; I asked what they wanted for them; they both said 8s.: I did not particularly examine them, as I had no suspicion - I offered them 6s., which they agreed to take; I gave them 1s. deposit: they then asked if I would buy six more - I then had some suspicion and said I did not want them, but, as they pressed it, I said I would see, and told them to bring these two bundles to my father's in the course of the day - the prisoner said he would take them with me, and he and the other brought them to my father's door directly; I asked the prisoner his name; he said Ingram or Ingham, and that he had the rods of his father in the Borough: I looked at them, then went to the officer, and gave him information - I then went to the prisoner, and again asked about them; he said, "It is all right, I will fetch them back again:" but I said that would not do for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you pay the 1s. to the prisoner? A. I believe it was to Keetch, but I cannot exactly say which; they both held out their hands, and as it was rather a dark place I cannot be certain, but I have no doubt it was to Keetch - when I knew the prisoner he lived at the corner of the court, about two hundred yards from where I purchased the rods; I did not know the other.</p>

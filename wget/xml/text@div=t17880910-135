               <p>Who was his driver? - Howard, I believe.</p>
               <p>Who does Phillips buy for? - He buys for Mr. Young.</p>
               <p>Did Howard put any mark upon them? - Yes, he marked them in the face with either a V. or U. with oker; they were fastened in the pens; it is the custom of the market for them to stand till the drover either comes or sends his man for them; this was very near nine in the morning; about eleven, the drover came for them, I went to the pen where they had been left and they were gone.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see them again? - No; then I found out Bagot.</p>

               <p>He gave you some information about them? - Yes, I know nothing but what Bagot told me.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes, I have seen him in Smithfield several times; I believe he used to pen a few sheep, but I do not know his employment;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100155"></xptr>I saw him this day, the 18th of August, that was before I had sold the sheep, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, prisoner's counsel. There were more sheep than those nine in the market that day I suppose? - Yes, a great many pens drove away by different drovers.</p>
               <p>You are a salesman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And when you have sold them, that is all you have to do? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you first miss these sheep? - Much about eleven.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to this man? - No, not that day.</p>
               <p>When did you first speak to him about it? - A fortnight after, I never heard till a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>The prisoner is a drover, is not he? - Yes, I believe he is.</p>
               <p>Why, you know he is? - He may be a drover, I cannot tell, but I know he pens a few things; we do not call the pen-men drovers.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoner after you had lost your sheep? - I saw him that day fortnight after.</p>
               <p>In the market? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Doing his business? - I did not see he was doing any business, he stood there towards the calf-pens.</p>
               <p>That was his place? - Yes, he might be there if he liked. I said nothing to him then; I followed him and told him Mr. Dallinger wanted to speak to him, and he said he would come and speak to him after dinner.</p>
               <p>Did he come? - No; we took two constables and took him; he went to dinner, I watched him in, I met him coming out of the door with a bit of plumb pudding in his hand; we brought him to Mr. Dallinger's.</p>
               <p>Do not you know of a little dispute between him and your friend Bagot? - I do not know of any.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear Bagot say there was a little bit of a law suit? - No, sir, he did not tell him in my presence; I never heard him, however.</p>
               <p>These sheep were marked S.? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why, that is a common mark, I used to mark my sheep with an S.? - Very likely.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My friend has no sheep now, he breeds nothing but calves.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Have not you charged somebody else with these sheep? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>Has not some man brought an action against you? - No.</p>
               <p>In whose name was the letter wrote? - He said I had slandered him; I imagine I have read the letter, I do not know the contents, I do not know that there was any thing of an action mentioned; I do not know the lawyer's name.</p>
               <p>- PHILLIPS sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 18th of August last, I bought nine weather sheep of Mr. Skinner; I ordered the man to mark them; I did not see them marked; the man is here; I ordered Howard to put a Y. on the forehead and across the loins.</p>
               <p>The sheep did not come home to you? - No, I bought them for Mr. Young, that was the meaning of that mark; I had seen the prisoner about the market, but did not know his name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. When you buy for Mr. Thompson you put a T.? - No, sir, all sorts of marks, it is not common to put the letter of the name.</p>

               <p>What are you? - A butcher.</p>

               <p>I am drover to Mr. Young; I remember, on the 18th of August last, Mr. Phillips purchasing nine weather sheep for Mr. Young, of Mr. Skinner; I marked them, I did not observe what marks they had before I marked them, I marked them with a Y. over the face and a ruddle across over the lions; I left them in the pen by themselves where I marked them; I went about half after ten or near upon eleven for them, I did not find them; I applied to Mr. Skinner for them, and could not get them; I never saw them afterwards; I have seen the prisoner in Smithfield, I cannot say I saw him that day.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100156"></xptr>THOMAS BAGOT sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a drover.</p>
               <p>Was you in Smithfield-market on the first day of August? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you and the prisoner had any quarrel of any sort? - No, sir, I never changed a word with him in my life.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any words or any action brought against you, or any thing? - No, sir, I would nat say so if it was not true.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner there on the 18th of August? - Yes, I saw him about the value of seven or eight minutes, it might be ten, walking about Mr. Skinner's pens, where these sheep of Mr. Skinner's then stood, and after that ten minutes I saw the prisoner cut the hurdle down, tied with a piece of rope-yard, and he let down the hurdle and went in and drove out nine sheep, they were weather sheep according to my looking at the sheep.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any marks upon them? - Yes, as they were coming out of the pen the faces of them were right fronting me, they were marked with a Y. in the face, they were marked down the back with oker, the Y. was made with oker, they were marked across the loins with oker, they were marked down the back and across the loins; there was another mark in them, they were marked with an S. brand on the near side on the hip in a circle; the prisoner drove those sheep up Giltspur-street, that comes down to the Old-bailey, he went on a little way and I followed him.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - Yes, I knew him in the market a good while; I followed him till I came to the sugar-baker's in Giltspur-street, there I stood with my back, and I saw the sheep turn where they are building the Compter, I saw the prisoner go up there and turn the sheep back, and the sheep when they were coming down made to come back into the market, and the prisoner ran and turned them along Giltspur-street towards the Old-bailey, after they turned up this place, and then away he drove them, and I never saw any more of them; I might be about half an hour or twenty minutes observing the whole; he was about seven minutes loitering about the pens before he opened them, the pens stood in the path-way, the very corner of Giltspur-street, by the hospital, right against the toy-shop door; I have known the prisoner ever since I was about ten years old, and I am quite sure he was the man; I took such particular observation about all this, because I knew the man to have a bad character before; I came back and told Mr. Skinner's man immediately what I had seen; I did not tell him the man's name that drove them away; I told him if he had lost nine sheep to come to me and I would tell him the man; I understood Mr. Skinner was gone home, he lives in Leicestershire; he comes to town once a fortnight; he came in a fortnight, and then I described what I have said to the jury, and the prisoner was taken that very day; Mr. Skinner was not in town, that I know of, from that day the sheep were lost till that day fortnight; I never had any ill will to this man at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Counsel. Was you intimate with him? - Yes, drinking with him.</p>
               <p>You are a drover, and he is a drover? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you was well acquainted with him before this? - Yes, I have spoke with him; I knew the prisoner perfectly well; never had any words with him at all.</p>
               <p>He never before accused you of any thing? - Never, nothing at all, no further than he came to me the Friday before Mr. Skinner came to town, as I was standing by my master's beasts, and says he, pray how came you to go and tell as how that I had taken nine sheep out of Mr. Skinner's pens; says I, fetch me the man that told you, and if he can say so to my face I will tell him he is a liar.</p>
               <p>He threatened to bring an action against you, did not he? - No, sir, he never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Then he and you had a few words? - No, no more than that he wanted to get the marks of the sheep out of me, to know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100157"></xptr>if I know them, then he would have been off.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner hold any conversation about the marks with you? - He came and told me, that I knew the marks of the sheep that were taken out of Mr. Skinner's pens; I would not tell him the marks, nor I would not tell any body till Mr. Skinner came to town again; I saw him again the next market day.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you can tell us a little more where the sheep went?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My friend wants to know whether you stole them? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You suspected those sheep to be stolen, it was in the public market day? - I do not know that there was any body about me at all; there was nobody but Mr. Skinner's men and me.</p>
               <p>Why did not you call to somebody? - Because I did not know he had stole the sheep; I thought he might be going to take them away for some butcher.</p>
               <p>Just now you told us, that suspecting the sheep to be stolen made you watch them? - He had been stopped before with sheep, and I made an apprehension that he had found these sheep, or taken them away in mistake; I had no business to stop the man; the property did not belong to me; I had great reason to take such particular notice of the marks; I have paid a good many pounds for lost sheep in Smithfield; I can take as much particular notice of the marks in two minutes, as them that brought them out of the country; there are different ruddle marks.</p>
               <p>Did you either alarm any body or give any notice? - I had no right to tell any body but Mr. Skinner and his drover, any further than I told the people the man could do nothing with it till his master came up.</p>
               <p>You did not go with these sheep any further than Giltspur-street? - No, I am sure I did not; I parted, and the prisoner went on with them.</p>
               <p>Nobody else saw this but you? - Nobody else.</p>
               <p>This man and you are brother drovers? - I cannot help that.</p>
               <p>Drank liquor together often? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Always been good friends? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Never any quarrel; you know there is a bit of a reward? - No, gentlemen, I do not want any reward.</p>
               <p>Do not you know it? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to say, you did not want it? - I did not know it; I never took any body up before.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, that you did not know it? - I do, I mean to say, that I do not know there is now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I will ask you, had you any thing upon earth to do with the stealing these sheep, except the watching the man who did steal them? - No, nothing else; I immediately went back to the man and told him; if I had stopped this man, he would have said, he drove them out by mistake.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, to Mr. Skinner. Since I examined you before, have you said any thing to any body? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>Then shew me the mark that was made in the forehead of the sheep with a pen? - (Makes a mark on a paper like a V) I can read, but not write; I might be twelve or thirteen yards off.</p>

               <p>I have nothing to say, gentlemen, but one word to contradict Mr. Bagot; I have known him these twenty years; he knows it; there he is; on that day he says I never had any words with him, I threatened to serve him with a copy of a writ.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who all gave him a very good character.</p>

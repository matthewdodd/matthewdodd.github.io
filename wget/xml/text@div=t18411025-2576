                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Wilkinson; I keep a grocer's shop in Hawkhurst-street, Lisson-grove, St. Marylebone. On Friday. the 15th of October, I went to bed at half-past ten o'clock—I have some children, and a servant-girl—I was awoke in the night by a noise on the stairs—I lay and listened, and saw some person's head looking in at my room-door three times—I had a light in my room—I did not know the person first, but the second and third time he looked in I identified the prisoner, who lives at No. 7, next door to me—I got out of bed the third time, took my light, and went to the staircase—he ran down stairs—he had neither hat nor shoes on—I stood on the landing, and saw the stair-case window wide open, which he must have come in at—he ran down stairs, and went into the shop—I distinctly heard him unfasten two bolts of the shop-door, and go out into the street—I went to the bottom of the stairs, but could not see any body—I then went into the shop</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. I was in Exeter-street, Lisson-grove, on the morning in question, about a quarter to two o'clock, and saw the prisoner running down the street, without shoes or hat—I stopped him, and asked where he was going—he said he was going to the Burns' Arms public-house, to get something to drink—I said, "What have you here?"—I felt his pocket, and found a box of lucifer<lb></lb>matches, and in the other pocket a lot of loose tobacco—I took him to the station, and found 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper and a bit of candle on him—I sent for the policemen—they did not know him, and I let him go—next night I heard of this robbery, and apprehended him at a public-house—the prosecutrix identified him—he said he bought the tobacco in Oxford-street, and he had the candle in his pocket to light him when he got home, that the candlestick was at his house—I asked where he lived—he told me, and it is next door to the prosecutrix—I found a person, by getting on the, wall, could easily get to the prosecutrix's staircase-window—when I apprehended him, I said, "You recollect my having you last night for that tobacco?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Well, you are charged with breaking into Mrs. Wilkinson's house, in Hawkhurst-street"—he said, "Who charges me?"—I said, "Mrs. Wil<lb></lb>kinson; and she says you put your head three times into her bed-room door"—he said, "Does she, by G—? then I have nothing more to say."</p>

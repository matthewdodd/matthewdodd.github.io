               <p>Q. How old is she?</p>
               <p>Haxby. She told me she was 17 or 18 years old; she was used to carry out beer and fetch in pots, she absconded about eight in the evening the 13th of March. I had been up in my room for change, to change half a guinea for a gentleman about a quarter before eight: I locked the drawer, also the closet door in which the drawer stood, and the chamber door. I believe the two inward keys<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175205140028"></xptr> were left in the locks. I brought the room-door key down, and hung it up in the bar, after I missed the girl I could not find the key. I went up stairs and found the key in the chamber-door and the door open, and the other two locks undone, and my money gone, seven guineas, and some silver.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your money last?</p>
               <p>Haxby. I am sure it was there in a linnen bag, when I was there for change.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body else been there after you?</p>
               <p>Haxby. I don't know that any body had, except the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner afterwards?</p>

I asked her where she went that night, she said to a neighbour's house, and lay there all night, and that the money was taken away out of the sleeve of her gown; and that the woman gave her two shillings, and bid her go to the other end of the town, that she might not be found, so accordingly she went to Shoreditch.

Just as the prisoner was brought to the prosecutor's house I went in: I said, are not you a pretty creature for your master to take in out of the streets, and you to serve him as you have done?

            . I lodge at the prosecutor's house; I met this girl in Long-lane the 27th of April, and taxed her with the robbery; she confess'd that she took seven guineas and three shillings out of the drawers of her master. I asked her why she did so? she said she was persuaded so to do by somebody. This I heard her confess several times, and said she took it out of a bag.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did she say what sort of a bag she took it out of?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, she did not, only she took it out of the bag.</p>

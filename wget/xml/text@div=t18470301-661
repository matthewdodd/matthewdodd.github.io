On the 27th of Jan., about three o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Green-street, Bethnal-green, and met the prisoner, about thirty-five yards from the prosecutor's house, with six live tame rabbits in a bag—I had shortly before seen him in com<lb></lb>pany with another boy—I stopped him—he said he had brought the rabbits from Mr. Cutler, of Bow—I asked where he was going to take them—he said, to Smithfield-market, to his master—I took him to the station with them—I found nobody of the name of Cutler at Bow—the prosecutor claimed the rabbits.</p>

The rabbits that are here are mine—I kept them in the kitchen, in three hutches—on the 26th of Jan., at ten o'clock at night, I saw them safe in the hutches—I left the house fastened up safe—I got up next morning at half-past five, and missed a linnet and a cage from the back parlour, and a tea-caddy and pair of spectacles off the mantelpiece—I went into the back kitchen, and missed the rabbits—the back kitchen window-sash had been moved, and was partly open—it had been fastened with a thumb-screw the night before—a pane of glass was broken to get at the screw—I traced footsteps of two people in the next</p>

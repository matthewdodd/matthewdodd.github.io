                  </hi>. I am a carman in the employ of the Great Northern Railway—the prisoner is also one of their carmen—James Fowler was guard of one of the company's vans—on 13th August, between twelve and one, I drove my van into the archway leading to Bull and Mouth Street, and the prisoner drew up hois van in an opposite direction and blocked my van—I said, "Now then, let us out"—he said, "Not me"—I said, "Don't make a guy of yourself, but let me out"—he took no notice, but walked across the yard with some bread and meat in one hand and a knife in the other—Fowler, whose van was standing there, said to the prisoner, "<hi rend="italic">Piggy</hi>, you are a b—guy"—the prisoner said, "Go away"—Fowler repeated the same words three times, and then the prisoner thiew the knife at him; Fowler seeemed to turn to run away, and the knife stuck into his back—I believe it fell out of itself—he had his coat and waistcoat on—the prisoner ran to Fowler, put him in his van, and took him to the hospital, and I followed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The prisoner had the knife in his hand when he got off his van—I believe he bad just borrowed it of another carman—Fowler had nothing to do with the dispute—he was two or three yards from the prisoner when the knife was thrown.</p>

               <p>—I was with my van in Bull and Mouth Yard—Bartlett was there with his van, and asked the prisoner to move his van, which was in the archway—I did not hear the prisoner make any reply, hut Bartlett called him a guy, and I also said, "<hi rend="italic">Piggy</hi>, you are a guy"—I did not say "a b—guy"—he said something, and I called him a guy again—he said, "Go away", but I did not—I did not call him a guy a third time—he was sitting on a bale, and my face was towards him—I turned my back to go to my van, and did not see the knife coming—I only went half a yard, when I felt numb, and found blood coming down my back—the prisoner then came towards me and said he was very sorry—he put me in a van, not his own, and I told my mate to take me to the hospital—the prisoner went there with me—there was no bad feeling between us.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—I examined Fowler, and found his clothes saturated with blood, and blood flowing from a punctured wound in his back, an inch and a half deep, and long enough to admit my little finger—this knife would inflict it—it was dangerous at that time from hæmorrhage, but not afterwards—he was in the hospital a fortnight, and is not in such good health yet as be was before, but that will not be permanent.</p>

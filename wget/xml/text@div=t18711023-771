                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman T</hi> 80). On Sunday evening, 16th October, I received information, in consequence of which I went to the Hope and Anchor, at Sutton, and saw a mare in a stable—the prisoner came in in about ten minutes and gave his name "John Penn"—I asked him where he brought the horse from—he said "From Maidenhead, from my father, who is a farmer, and I am going to take her to Mr. Abbott"—I said "Which way did you come?"—he said "By the Staines Road"—I asked him a few more questions, and he ran away—I ran after him, and took him in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Hope and Anchor—about 8 o'clock on Sunday, the 15th, the prisoner brought a bay mare to my house; he called her <hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi>—I asked where he came from—he said "From Maidenhead"—I asked him where he was going to take the horse; I did not then know whether it was a horse or a mare—he said "I am going to Mr. Abbott, at Sipston"—I said "You have come four miles beyond there"—he engaged a bed, and said that if he was not there that night he would be there next morning—I put the mare in a shed, and informed the police—next morning, between 11 o'clock and 11.30, the prisoner returned—he said "Good morning"—I said "I thought I had got a horse and no owner"—he said "Why did you think so?"—I said "You said you would be here in the morning, and country people do not call 11 o'clock the morning; I thought the horse was stolen"—he said "I should not think it an easy matter to steal a horse"—he had some bread and cheese, and then went out—the policeman brought him back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I found the horse on the road, and took it to a public-house, thinking there would be a reward given for it—I do not know anything about horses—I have been a gentleman's servant, and have a good character—I lived at Mr. Myers', 9, Chester Terrace, Regent's Park, three years ago, for two years, as footman—I gave my name different, in order that my friends should not know it—I had been down to Ascot to Lady Lefevres, who had applied to a lady for my character.</p>

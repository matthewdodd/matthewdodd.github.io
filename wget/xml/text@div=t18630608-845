On 5th June, about 3 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Cross-street, Woolwich, and saw the three prisoners—Bird and Smith immediately ran away, and I took Jackson into custody—I asked him what he had, and he put this jug on the pavement, and took these glasses from his pocket—I asked him where he got the things, and he said he found them—I then took him to the station—I saw the other two prisoners again at half-past 5, near the Arsenal gate, and took them into custody—I afterwards went to Mr. Graham's garden, to the refreshment-room, and found it had been opened and the property stolen—I saw some footprints in the garden, and afterwards took the boots of the three prisoners and compared them with the marks—Bird's and Jackson's corresponded exactly—there were marks of three or four persons, I think; but I could only identify the boots of Jackson and Bird.</p>

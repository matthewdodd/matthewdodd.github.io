             and I went out on Friday night, the 12th of January, with a cart and horse, on purpose to steal fowls or hogs, or anything we could find. We drank at a public-house, at Westborn-Green; these two young men, Smith and Sexton, were sitting there. From thence we went to Mr. Watson's; we went into a field, and went round the back way, where the hay was; he handed the fowls to me, and I pulled their necks; there was a middle sized-dog, who kept barking all the time. We heard somebody coughing in the house; the prisoner bid me stop till they had done coughing, which I did; we counted the fowls; there were eighteen of them. Then he bid me drive the geese up; I went; there were some rails across a little pond; the geese went under the rails, and escaped. Then I told him, there were some hogs; he went directly and turned them out, and he desired me to take the fowls. There was a large fat sow, and a large barrow pig; they appeared to me, in the night, to be quite white; we drove them away towards home, and then up a lane, out of the road, in order to run them down, and tie their legs; after we had so done, and tied their legs, the prisoner got a large stick out of the hedge, clapped under them, and put them into the cart.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300007"></xptr> Coming along, we met the same two men upon the road; we bid them good night; one went by the side of the cart, and tried to look in, to see what was in it; I do not know whether he could or not see what it was, because we threw some light straws, and I think a sack or two, over the hogs. When we came to Paddington-turnpike, they strove to stop us; the turnpike-man would not stop us, but opened the gates. Porter desired me to lay hold of the head of the horse; he said, Come to Covent-Garden, I will not go to Smithfield this morning; which was to make the men believe he dealt at Covent-Garden. After we got through that gate, we jumped over into the fields, and ran home as hard as we could; I had not been home above five minutes before Porter came to me; I believe he desired me to get away directly; we went away for about a fortnight, I believe, and were in Westminster; my wife lay in at the time.</p>

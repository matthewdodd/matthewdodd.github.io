Please receive for me one bag of wool, C. Schlurmock."—I told them to take it to the station, I was not satisfied with their statement—Alger said, "For God's sake, Barker, don't take me, if you do I am a ruined man "—I desired them to take the truck to the station—Alger made off towards Cheapside—I called to Roberts to go after him, and bring him back—he did so—we got to the station—I asked the prisoners where they brought it from—Scott answered he brought it from Brown's warehouse, in Upper Thames-street—I took Scott to Brown's warehouse to see if it was a true story—when I got to the warehouse it was locked up—Scott then said, "Oh, I did not have it out of the warehouse, it was lying in the road by the side of this post," pointing to an iron post—I asked him who delivered it up to him—he said, "Two men "—I asked him who they were—he said he did not know, one was tall, and the other short—I took him back to the station—when I got back I searched him, and found this key in his pocket.</p>

               <p>and from there to this stair-case—if a part of this partition were removed from the top it would enable a person to scramble over, and get to my premises—I found two bales of wool gone—I had had them upwards of six years—they were remnants from a public sale—these two covers have Nos. "236 and 237" on them, and "I M A "—they are the covers of the two bales I had there—I saw the wool at the station—it divided itself into two complete bales—I saw them put into these covers, and they fitted exactly—I saw the wool weighed—it corresponded with the weight of these two bales that I have in my books—one, No. 236, weighed 1cwt. 3qrs. 17lbs.; the other, No. 237, 1cwt. 3qrs. 2lbs.—I found a wrapper round the wool as the policeman found it—I cannot swear to it—I have 100 such about my premises—that wool has not been repacked—it had been on public sale, consequently one end has been pulled out—they pull out an immense mass of it at the end which has been on show—it had been sold, but I think they must have escaped the recol<lb></lb>lection of the party, as they have never been fetched away—Alger had been in my service seven or eight years—he left my service on the 10th of Dec.—I have heard that he and Scott are brothers-in-law—I have no means of know<lb></lb>ing that they are so—the wool is worth about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my clerks hire labourers—I have heard that Scott has been employed occasionally.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wool-broker, and carry on business in Coleman-street. I know Mr. Cooper—I have seen these two covers in his warehouse to the best of my recollection—they were full—it is many years since—I have no difficulty about knowing the packages, because they all come in one kind of tare, and the marks are distinct, and they are known better than any goods in the market—they came from John M'Arthur—I am perfectly aware that there was some such wool at Mr. Cooper's some time since, but it was not till I heard of these being lost that I found we were two bags short—they were part of what we had sold—they had been forgotten altogether, but we should certainly require these two bags at Mr. Cooper's warehouse—I went, and recognized these two bags of wool.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were not aware of Mr. Cooper being in posses<lb></lb>sion of these? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We were not, it bad escaped our recollection—this wool was sold in Sept. 1836—the wool was imported to us by Colonel M'Arthur, and we sold them as brokers, and accounted to him for the proceeds—Mr. Cooper is a public warehouse keeper—he held this wool originally for Col. M'Arthur—all that I know about these beyond the original knowledge has been derived from our books, which are not here—I believe one of my part<lb></lb>ners made the entry in the books—I do not think the books or my partner could have shown more of this transaction than I can—we should none of us have known without our books—I know the marks by our books—Mr. M'Ar<lb></lb>thur sends to nobody but us—he sends every year, and we know the marks from our books—from looking at our books and seeing what is on these covers, I can recognise them—if I had not seen our books at all I could not have sworn these to be our property, but I would swear these to be the covers of M'Arthur's wool—I know these were paid for at the time, and from reference to my books I find it so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon seeing these two sacks, do you remember that you had wool of this description? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can swear that if these contained what they originally did, they contained wool, and Mr. Cooper was answerable to us for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined. Q.</hi> This quantity of wool would be Mr. M'Ar<lb></lb>thur's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—I have known these marks these twenty years, or longer—there was a public sale, and these were part of what were sold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What do you know about the public sales? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I lay these bales out, and prepare them for public sale—I was not present at any sale—I heard the prisoners examined before the Lord Mayor—I have no recollection of hearing Scott make a statement.</p>

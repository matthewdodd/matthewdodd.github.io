The prisoner had been in my service three years and a half - he received money for me; it was his duty to bring it to me directly he came in. On Friday, the 6th of June, I sent him with twelve chairs to Mr. Lingard - the price was 2l.; he returned about half-past one o'clock, and said he was to go at five for the money - I sent him at half-past four o'clock, and he did not return for a fortnight; I then asked how he came to leave me - he said he did not know; I asked him about the money - he said he did not know what he had done with it, and that he had been to Bristol; he behaved very well before - I would take him again.</p>

               <p>Q. You are sure he is the person - A. Yes, I never lost sight of him, he dropped the handkerchief, and I picked it up.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS. I am a porter at the stand at Fleet market. On the 18th of April, about three o'clock, I observed the prisoner advancing towards me, I saw him drop a red handkerchief, I stopped him, and held him him till he was delivered to the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been over the bridge, and coming home there was a coach stopped, a cry of stop thief was holloaed out, that gentleman catched hold of me directly, I never had the handkerchief in my hand, nor never saw it.</p>

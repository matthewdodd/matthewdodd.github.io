            . I am a clerk to Messrs. Hall and Co., brewers. On the 16th of October, about six o'clock in the evening I was with their dray at the Red-Hart, <placeName id="t18241028-64-crimeloc342">Shoe-lane</placeName>

I told him repeatedly that there was not room, but he drove on until the waggon got entangled with our dray, and drew it backwards till it came near to a post at the <placeName id="t18241028-64-crimeloc343">corner of Stonecutter-street</placeName>

I had seen the deceased standing against that post just before; I stepped forward to take him out of the way, but before I could reach him the dray forced him against the post, and he fell backwards with his head towards Stonecutter-street - he was not in the road; I think it was impossible for the prisoner to have seen him before he was hurt - an alarm was given, and he stopped directly.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was your dray close to the curb - A. I cannot say; we cannot sometimes let beer down if it is - I told him he should pass in five minutes, as the barrel was then hanging by the rope.</p>

            . I am one of the draymen. We had two casks to deliver - I cannot say whether the dray was close to the pavement; I said I would make room as soon as I had put the beer down - but the prisoner drove on; there was hardly room, and his wheels caught the dray - he stopped, and did not know what to do; the waggon pushed the dray along about five or six yards. I did not see the man knocked down it was quite dark. I heard him complain of his being hurt, but had not seen him by the post.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you move to give him room - A. No; he could not see the man at the post.</p>

            . I am shopman to an oilman who lives in Shoe-lane. I saw the prisoner driving the waggon - he asked them to let him pass; he waited two or three minutes, then went on, and got entangled with the front of the dray - some one called out that there was not room; he drew on to about the centre of the dray and got entangled more, and pulled the dray back about thirty feet - a man stood at the post behind the dray, which struck him against the post and broke his ribs - he fell on his back, and was picked up: he said he was not hurt so much as I might think. I saw him after his death, and knew him to be the man; Mr. Ray saw him. I think the prisoner must have seen that there was not room - after the dray was pulled about thirty feet, the street is about three feet wider. He could not see the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are not used to drive - A. No. As soon as the man fell he came back, but understanding that he was not much hurt he went on.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. On the 16th I saw the deceased in bed, and found his side much injured, and several ribs broken; he lived till Monday evening. I opened him, and found several ribs broken, which caused his death.</p>

               <p>- LACY. I am an engine turner. I was in Shoe-lane, and saw the dray; it was about nine inches from the curb; if it had been close there would have been room to pass, for the fore wheels did get by, but the hind ones caught. I heard some one say,</p>
               <p>"You can pass," or</p>
               <p>"there is room now," and I thought that there was room. I believe it was pure accident; he did not appear at all in an ill-humour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear persons say there was not room - A. Yes; but I thought the dray was moved a little for him to pass.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Shears, whom the prisoner drives for. I was passing Stonecutter-street at this time; he seemed drawing his horses on carefully to avoid the dray - the man fell and he stopped directly, and said he was extremely sorry - that the drayman would not move, and he was anxious to get on, and thought there was room. He had not whipped his horses - I saw him passing, and if I had thought there was danger I should have called to him.</p>

             left him behind, there was no persuading Smith but that his Letter was the Occasion of it. He grew very much elevated, and valued himself mightily upon his Ingenuity and Management; so that soon after he was resolved to try if he could not procure a sum of Money by the same Means. He consulted with me about a proper Person, and or last we pitched upon Baron Suosso-Accordingly, on the 27th of January, he sends for me to the Sum Alehouse in King's-Court, where, when I came, he agreed to write a Letter to the said Baron, demanding 27 l. to be paid to me; called for Pen, Ink and Paper, and began to write; but when he had wrote three or four Words, he did not like the Ink, for it was very yellow. Whereupon I steps home to my Landlord, and brought some that was blacker, with which he finish'd the Letter. He read it over to me, and I remember that in it he desired the Baron to pay 27 l. to one of my Lodgers. or else he swore he'd be the Death of him, or burn his Country Seat, and concluded with some such Words as these; I never shamm'd it with any body, and my Name is John Brown; and he directed it as he told me, To my Lord Baron Suass in the Old-Jury. He sealed it up, and gave it me to carry to the Penny Post Office. I accordingly carry'd it to Mr. Tenant's, a Distiller's Shop, the Corner of Bridges-Street, in Russel-street. Since which, he enquired of me several time if I had received no Answer; and I told him that I had heard nothing. But not long after, a Man came about Noon to enquire for me at the Alehouse, while I was there. I being a little in Debt, was afraid that it was a Balliff, and so slipt out and went home. The Man came again at Night, met with me, and told me that he came from John Brown; and that he should be glad to meet me next day about Three in the Afternoon at the Kings's-Arms Tavern in Covent-Garden, for he had some Money to pay me on the Account of John Brown. I went thither, was apprehended, and committed to Newgate. While I was there, the Prisoner came to me and bid me fear nothing; for, says he, There's no Langer; and if you can but 1keep your own Counsel, you'll come off well enough. The Letter was produced in Court; and this Evidence deposed, that he verily believed it to be the same Part of the first Line, being wrote with a yellow luk, very different from the rest.

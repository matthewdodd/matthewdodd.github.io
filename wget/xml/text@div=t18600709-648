                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Robertson, M'Clean and Robertson, of Falcon-wharf, Blackfriars, lead and glass mer<lb></lb>chants—the prisoner has been our traveller since 1852—when he first came he had 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and at last he had 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., besides his travelling expenses, which were 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day; and at the end of each day he used to charge a sum for incidental expenses, which varied in amount from 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was his duty to take orders for customers, to receive the amount due to us, and to remit to us during the journey from time to time, and to hand me in a statement, at the end of the journey, of the sums received—he had authority to allow the customers discount at his discretion—wa allow a large discount to persons who pay cash—he kept a cash-book in which he entered any accounts he received on the journey, and which he was supposed to remit to me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cash-book—it is in his writing—he enters the names of the persons from whom he receives the money, and the amounts—on his return home he hands the book in, and has a statement of the money he has received—he never showed me any other book—I took his statement as he gave it to me from the cash-book—I attend to the cash part of the business; the book-keeping—on 21st December, 1859, the prisoner was at Oxford, and also on the 23d—on the 27th here is an entry at Newport Pagnell—I had a customer at Wolverton named Aveling, and another at Oxford named Taylor—there is no entry in the prisoner's book of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from Mr. Taylor at that time, or at any time since—Mr. Taylor was indebted to us in that sum—the prisoner has never accounted for it or paid it—he has not accounted to me for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received on the 17th December, from Mr. Charles Aveling of Wolverton, nor is there any entry of it in this cash-book—we have a customer at Faversham named Mayton—I find no entry in the prisoner's cash-book, on 27th January, 1860, of 132<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from Mrs. Mayton—this receipt is in the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">This was signed by the prisoner and was a receipt for</hi> 142<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)—on that day he accounts for 132<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he adds 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the discount—the discount was 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he has not acccounted to me in any way for this balance of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he applied for money when he wanted it, and had it—at the time of his apprehension 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due to him which he had not applied for—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in his writing—I never saw it till his apprehen<lb></lb>sion—I had no knowledge of such a book being kept by him—I find an entry in it, "17th December, C.

I apprehended the prisoner on 30th April at Northampton; I told him the charge, and showed him my warrant—he said that he was quite innocent, but it was possible he had made a mistake under the peculiar circumstances, as he had done before; that it was not more than two months since he made a mistake and sent 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than he ought, and it was possible he had made a mistake, but he could account for every halfpenny—he offered the books to me; he produced them voluntarily—he gave up everything—he said, "If I am a prisoner, I suppose you will require my books," and gave up these private books immediately, and the little books too—I handed them to Mr. Robertson on the following morning at the police-court—I got them back soon after I had been before the Magistrate—I got this diary of 1830 back.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). I gave all the books to Mr. Robertson—I have never received the diary for 1860 back—I am quite sure there were two, and I received back one, which I marked—I spoke to Mr. Robertson about the diary which the other defendant came to see me about—he said he could not find it, or that I had had all that he had; that he did not know anything about auother diary—the prisoner did not call again after that—I did not tell him Mr. Robertson had said he would not produce it till after the trial, or that Mr. Robertson had lost it—Mr. Robertson said that I had the whole he had got except the books that belonged to him, and his own cash-books—I made memorandums of what I took from the prisoner, and gave them up to Hunter, I think his name is, one of Mr. Robertson's clerks, in a small leather case—Mr. Robertson was not present at the police-court—I am quite certain that I gave up two, and that I have only received one since—Mr. M'Clean did not go down with me to Thrapston; he came in in the afternoon—he was not there when I apprehended the prisoner—he had some dinner, and drank his wine—he had his dinner in the commercial room where we were—he and the prisoner both had a glass of wine—I don't think it was sherry, I do not know what it was—Mr. Robertson said at the police-court that he was not aware of anything about going into partnership with the prisoner, or that he knew it had been proposed—I remember that gentleman (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Lewis</hi>) asking him a question—I do not remember Mr. Robertson saying that he was not sure of it, but that he had heard that it was to be so; I think he said that he was not aware of it.</p>

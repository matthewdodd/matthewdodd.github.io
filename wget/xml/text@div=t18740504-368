                  </hi>. I am a seaman in the Royal Navy—on the evening of last Good Friday I was in the Prince of Orange public-house with my brother between 7 and 8 o'clock—while we were there the prisoner came in and pushed past me, and as his shoulder got past me I felt a tug at my chain—I put up my hand and received the chain across my right wrist—the pri<lb></lb>soner made for the door; I caught hold of him, and we went out of the door—my brother said, "What is the matter?" and I accused the prisoner of stealing my watch—the prisoner asked me if I would speak to him quietly, and I walked him to the Railway Station, where we found a constable, and I gave him in charge—the watch was taken from his pocket in my presence.</p>

On the evening of Good Friday, 3rd April, I saw the two witnesses holding the prisoner—the prosecutor, told me the prisoner had stolen his watch, and he had seen him put it in his pocket, and as it was only two or three yards to the railway station gate, I dragged the prisoner inside the gate and searched him—I found this watch in his left hand pocket behind, and the prosecutor said it was his watch—I took the prisoner to the station—he said he was not aware the watch was in his pocket and that if it was there some one must have put it there.</p>

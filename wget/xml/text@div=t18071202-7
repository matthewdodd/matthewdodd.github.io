On Thursday evening the 24th I went down in the kitchen to have our supper, and left the prisoner up in our sitting room; no one was there but her; but soon after I went into the kitchen I wanted the girl, I called her several times, no one answered; I went up into the room to see for her, she was not there; I missed the key from the nail in the bed room where it hung.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in the habit of knowing where it hung. A. Yes. I wanting the girl, I went to the bed room to see for the girl; when I come there I found my key in the outside of the door; I went into the room, but no one was there; directly I missed a box that contained part of my wearing apparel, I thought some one had taken it; I looked in a portmanteau for some plate, it was in a pillow case, just as I brought it from the country; when I looked for the plate I missed it, I went down stairs, the girl could not be found any where in he house; we applied to Bow-street office, and found her soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the girl afterwards. - A. I did, in about two hours afterwards. I then said to her, Peggy, what have you been doing to take these things, she kneeled down and said pray ma'am forgive me, I never did such a thing before. I saw the property at Bow-street that night, Mr. Adkins produced it; I did not miss any one thing; the whole was found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lived with you. - A. From the Monday to the Thursday: she was hired from a public office, we had a character with her from a little public house.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer. - A. Yes Mr. Scott came to me at the office a little after eleven o'clock at night, he told me had been robbed. From what information I got from him I went into St. Giles, I went into several houses where I saw light; the last house I went into I went into the garret, and the prisoner at the bar was sitting on the floor in an empty room, with the pillow by the side of her, a great part of the plate was out of the pillow case; she was looking it over.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, I was not.</p>

               <p>Adkins. I found a box near to her, with a quantity of wearing apparel in it; I charged her with the robbery of her master; I asked her if there was any body with her, she said there was a young man with her when she committed the robbery, she would not tell me his name; I saw no young man, she was alone in the room. I took her into custody, and brought her away, and the plate and box, with the wearing apparel. I sent for Mr. Scott and Mrs. Scott also, they both came and said it was their property, and that was the girl that had lived servant with them. I produce the property.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Look at the milk jug, is that your property. - A. Yes, it is marked JMS, it is worth fourteen or fifteen shillings, and the six table spoons are mine; they are worth thirty shillings; the six salts are mine, they are worth thirty shillings; they are all mine. The gown is worth ten shillings, the salt spoons and tea spoons they are worth a shilling a piece; the sugar tongs are worth six shillings; the punch ladle is worth two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen them before the prisoner went away out of the house. - A. On the same day I had been to the portmanteau, and I had seen them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went up stairs for two towels to hem, and when I was returning out of the room, a young man met me at my elbow, I asked him what he wanted, he said what is that to you; he went and looked about the place, I was greatly surprized; he said if I made any noise he would kill me; he took a knife out of his bosom and said, if I went to make any alarm, he would cut my throat; he went to the portmanteau and took the things out, and he took the box; there was a man in the street took the box of him; they dragged me along till they came to this room; the man that took the property went down to get some bread and cheese; he was not gone five minutes before he called William. The other man then went down stairs; the man was not out of the room two minutes before the officer came up.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury - The prisoner is charged with stealing in a dwelling house; by law stealing in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020009"></xptr>the dwelling house of another to the value of forty shillings, is a capital offence, and the law is made upon good and sound principles. It is not very probable that any thing of the sort that she pretends did happen; because, in that case, most likely she would have alarmed her mistress, and she would have alarmed the neighbourhood: then that which she pretended did happen would not have happened. She is found afterwards in this room with this property close by her, and nobody is found with her, and it is not very probable that they would leave left her alone with this property in the room, if her story is true.</p>

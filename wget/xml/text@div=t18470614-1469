                  </hi>. I am the wife of Philip M'Avoy, a milkman of Rosemary-lane, Whitechapel. The prisoner was in our service to carry cat milk and receive the money for it, and pay it me when she came home, or account for it—she never accounted to my husband to my knowledge—she might have paid him if he had been in the way; if she had he would have taken it—he never comes to the business himself—I never knew that the prisoner had Mr. Driscoll for a customer—she never told me anything about Mr. Driscoll paying her.</p>

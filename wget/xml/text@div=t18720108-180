I live at 49, Ash Street, New Kent Road—I was mar<lb></lb>ried to Charles Thomas, a house decorator—I lived with the deceased man for about twelve months before he died—on 26th November, the prisoner came to my house about 10.30 at night—Collett was not at home—the prisoner asked if <hi rend="italic">Shandon</hi> was at home; he meant Collett—that is a name he went by—he also went by the name of Welsh, which was his brother-in-law's</p>

               <p>name—I told the prisoner he was not at home—he said 'Give me a seat, I shall wait till he does come home;" and he sat down—a man named John Turner was with him—the prisoner asked me if I was going to treat him, and I said "No, I have no money"—he said "Will you fetch a pot of ale?" and he put 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the table—I fetched some drink, and we had another pot after that—the beer was drunk, and Collett came in near upon 12 o'clock—he said to Roberts "Halloa, old boy, how are you?" and he put a parcel on the table, which contained a leg of mutton—I went out to get a shovel of coals, and when I came back, the meat was missing, and Collett was standing at the street door—I entered the room with Collett and he said "Where is the meat?"—I said "I did not know," and Roberts said he had thrown it on the ground to the dog—I looked and found it under the bed, and put it on the table—Roberts gave me some money, and I fetched another pot of ale—I afterwards fetched another pot—Collett had been smoking a cigar, and had put it on the mantelpiece—Roberts took it up, and was going to smoke it, but I took it away from him—Collett and Roberts then had a few words, but nothing to speak of—they did not seem angry—Collett was drunk when he came in—Roberts called me bad names, and Collett turned round to take up the poker—he could not find the poker, as it was down in the fender—Roberts said "If you mean that I will have this," and he took an old sword down which was hanging up against the wall—Collett made a snatch at it, the sword came out of the sheath—Collett got the sword and Roberts had the sheath—I pushed Roberts into the passage, and looked the door—Turner asked me to let him out, he said he would not stay in the room if violence was going on—I let him out, and then Roberts got in—a young woman, named Elizabeth Kelly came in and she took the sword out of Collett's hand—Roberts was not in the room then, he was outside; as soon as the door was opened Roberts came in, and hit Collett on the head—the sword was on the ground at the time—Collett was standing by the fire-place—Roberts struck him on the head directly he came in—it was a heavy blow, I think—Collett put his hand to his head, and went out into the yard, and put his head under the tap—the sword was still on the floor—I think Collett had struck at Roberts with the sword before, but he did not hit him, and then Roberts hit him on the head—I and Kelly called out, and the police came—Collett did not wish Roberts to be given into custody—he said "Don't take him, I shall be all right when the blood is washed away"—he went into the yard, and washed his head—there was a good deal of blood—Roberts was not taken—the police went away without him, and Kelly and the deceased went off in a cab—he was twenty-seven years old.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner and Collett were old friends and very intimate—I believe they have known one another from the time they were boys—Roberts was constantly in the habit of coming to see him at my house, and as far as I know there was no ill-feeling of any sort between them—I don't think Roberts was sober—he had been drinking ale and he had a drop of gin at my place—he and Turner had been at my house about an hour and a half before Collett came in—only we three were there toge<lb></lb>ther—one of the young lady lodgers came into the room for a minute or two—the sword had been hanging up for five weeks or more—Collett was a very violent man when he was the worse for liquor—he used to get very excited—I believe that he had on a former occasion used the sword to a billiard-marker, but I believe they were larking, there was something of</p>

               <p>the sort—I did not see it—when I came back after I got the coals there was some talking, more chaffing than anything else—I complained to Roberts about his coming down and interfering with us on Saturday night—I don't think it was Collett who took the sword down—they were sparring in fun—it is correct if Mr. Turner says Collett got up and looked about the fire-place as if looking for something, but not if he says that Collett took the sword down and the prisoner ran out of the room—Turner caught hold of Collett and he said "Lot mo go; I will cut the b—head off"—Roberts was in the passage, and the door was shut at that time—it was after that that I let Turner out and Roberts came in again—Collett had not got both the sword and scabbard in his hand at that time—if Mr. Tur<lb></lb>ner says so it is not correct—before any blow was struck by Roberts, Collett made a hit at him with the sword—I don't remember him run<lb></lb>ing into the street after Roberts—the prisoner and Collett were out together on the following Friday—I don't think I said before the Magistrate that it was eight days after—Collett came home that night, about 12.30—he was a hard drinker—he was out two or three nights before he came to this injury—I asked him what he had been drinking, and he said "Cold sherry."</p>

                  </hi>, I am a general dealer, at 4, Eltham Street, Walworth—I went with Roberts to Collett's house, about 10.30—we found Mrs. Thomas there—Roberts paid for some gin, and we all sat down in the room together—we chatted for an hour or so, and then Collett came in—he had half a leg of mutton with him—Roberts and the deceased got chaffing each other, and then they got sparring together—the deceased hit Roberts two or three times in the face—Mrs. Thomas said she wished Roberts would not come there on a Saturday night, and kick up a row—the deceased and Roberts had a scuffle, and the deceased fell on the ground—he got up and went to the fire-place, as if looking for something—he did not pick up anything, but he ran to where the sword was hanging up, and pulled it down, and Roberts ran out of the room—Mrs. Thomas put her back to the room door—I caught hold of the deceased, and said "For God's sake, don't use that you will do some injury"—he said "Let me go; I will cut the b—'s head off"—Roberts burst the door open and came in—the de<lb></lb>ceased struggled hard to get away from me, and he ran at Roberts, and went to strike him with the sword, but Roberts caught the sword on his arm, and struggled to get the sword away—it was in the scabbard then—as they were struggling the scabbard came off in Roberts' hand—the deceased had the sword—he made a cut at Roberts with the naked sword, but Roberts knocked it away, flashed it about two or three times, and ran into the street, followed by the deceased—I went out after a few seconds, and saw the deceased coming in rather quick towards the door—Roberts was walking towards the door as well—the police came up, and I heard one of them say "Hallao, Mr. Roberts, what is the matter?"—I did not notice anything the matter with either of them at that time—I went away and went home then—I did not see any blood or any wounds—the deceased came in as if he was half doubled up as he ran to the door—he came in rather sharp—he was drunk.</p>

I live at 17, Elizabeth Place, Waterloo Road—I went to Ash Street, on this Saturday night, at 12 o'clock—I saw Collett turn round to look for the poker; he could not find it, and he took down the sword which hung against the wall—Roberts went to try and get it away from him—he said "What, would you use such a thing as that?" and he tried to get it away from him; the sheath came off in his hand—I said "For God's sake, don't be doing that, you will be killing one another!" and I pushed Roberts out of the door—the deceased wanted to go out after him—the door came open, and the deceased said "There he is, I will cut his head open"—I believe he said that in anger, but they were both in liquor—the deceased went to try and hit him, and it came across my back and Roberts' arm—I was trying to part them—I got a blow on my face, and fell on the bed—they were knocking one another about, and Roberts hit the deceased on the head with the sheath—I saw his head was cut—he still wanted to get at Roberts, and I said "Why don't you be quiet; I should think you have got a cut now," and I seized his arm, and got the sword out of his hand—he did not bleed much—I went with him to the hospital, and saw Mr. Jones, the house-surgeon.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital last November—on 26th, the last witness came there with the deceased, about 2.30 in the morning—I found a wound on the right upper portion of the head, running towards the top—it was a clean cut, down to the bone, about three inches long—it had been bleeding a good deal—it was dressed—I did not do it myself, but I was there at the time—I saw him afterwards, as he was passing through the surgery, but I did not examine him there—on 12th December, about 3.30 in the morning, I saw him lying on a stretcher, in the surgery—he was insensible—I looked at his head—the original wound had healed up, but at the side there was a large collection of matter—I let the matter out, put a poultice on his head, gave him some brandy, and left him—he died about two hours after—I made <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was blood-poisoning, resulting from the original injury to the head—the bone was yellow, there was a large quantity of pus in the cavity, and the brain was inflamed—the wound was such as would be inflicted by this sheath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I had first seen the man I allowed him to go home—all scalp wounds are serious to a certain extent, not directly serious—it would not be desirable for him to be out till 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning—excessive drinking would not produce the blood poisoning—there was a slight enlargement of the spleen—that is not a sign of indulgence in spirituous liquors—there was no enlargement of the liver, and that is the first indication of hard drinking—the primary cause of blood poisoning was the wound on the scalp.</p>

When I had got about sixty yards, they stopped me, and demanded my money, and took my silk handkerchief off my neck, Arnold untied it; I was quite sober, one held me on one side by the collar, and the other the other, and Deason cut off the corner of my waistcoat pocket; there was five shillings and six-pence in it, he ran away, and I cried out murder! Arnold ran after me, and swore he would kill me, I did not see any weapon that he had at all. Mr. Brown where I lodge, next door to the King's-head, came to my assistance as the prisoners threatened to kill me, if they could lay hold of me. Brown opened the door, and I went in and Brown too.

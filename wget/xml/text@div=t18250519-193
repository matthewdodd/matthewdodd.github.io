            . On the 22d of April I was in the service of Mrs. Mary Scholes; the prisoner came into her shop, purchased a hat, and went away - in consequence of information I followed him to a public-house, and found him with the hat he had purchased and another, which I knew to be Mrs. Scholes; he had two in a bag, and the one he had stolen in his hand; he gave it to me, and told me to put it in its place, and take no notice of it.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mrs. Scholes. I saw the prisoner purchase the hat; the leather wanted tacking, and he sent Thomas into the back room to get it done - he then placed this other hat near the end of the case; he then took it and the one he had bought away: I told Wix of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been in the habit of buying hats; I wanted a damaged one, and they wished me to take a good one - I said, "I don't know whether the person will give the price of it, but I shall see him at the next house," and asked if they would give me leave to take it to the public-house, for about a quarter of an hour - he said I might if I would take care not to soil it. I went to leave it at the public-house while I went for the man, and I was taken.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WIX re-examined. Q. Is this true? A. Upon my oath it is not; he had bought one that morning<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190063"></xptr>before, and one at the time he stole the hat; he has bought upon an average one every day for six months.</p>

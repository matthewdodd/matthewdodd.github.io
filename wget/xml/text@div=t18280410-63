            . I am the wife of the last witness. On the 9th of April, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening I left the room; I locked the door, and left all this property safe. I went to my husband, and we came home together; we have two rooms - one opens into another: the room which opens into the passage was locked; on returning we found the room door broken open by violence - part of the door was cut away, and the lock forced; when I got in I missed the articles stated in the indictment, all of which I had left safe - some of them were airing at the fire. The prisoner was taken that evening, and the property was found outside his sister's door, by Richardson. I had seen the prisoner about seven o'clock that evening, and told him I was going out, and desired him not to fasten the street door; he lived in the house, and was at home when I went away.</p>

            . I keep this house; I am twenty years old; I rent the house myself. Pulleston and his wife lodge with me; I am a smith; the prisoner was in my service, and lived in the house; I sent him out but he came home about half-past eight o'clock. I was out at my sister's, and as I returned I saw the prisoner with a bundle under his arm; I asked where he was going, and what he did out at that time; he said he had been at his sister's, and was going again; I told him he ought not to leave my premises while I was out. The officer afterwards brought the bundle back; the prisoner came back of his own accord. I went to bed, not knowing the prosecutor was out - but when they came home an alarm was given; I got up and found their door broken open. The prisoner lived two months with me, and behaved well; I should give him a good character.</p>

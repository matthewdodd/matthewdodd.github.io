                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 159). On Friday, 10th Jan., at half-past five o'clock in the morning I was on duty at Hatcham-park, heard an alarm, and saw the prisoner and two others in Mr. Walters' garden, who was prosecutor in the last case—the prisoner was coming through the garden fence—I took him into custody, and asked him what he was there for—he said he had been sleeping over the bridge—there is a bridge about fifty yards off, but there is no shelter there—he had his stockings on, but no shoes or cap—I took him to the station, searched him, and found this skeleton-key, this <hi rend="italic">pick-lock,</hi> 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a quantity of lucifers, and a tobacco-box: and these two keys I found at Mr. Walters' house (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw some shoes found by White tried on the prisoner, and they fitted very well—a cap also was tried and fitted him, he went to the police-court in it—he did not own them—his stockings were quite dean when I took him—Mr. Walters' house had apparently been broken open.</p>

                  </hi>. My house is about 100 yards from Mr. Walters'—a person coming through the fence would have access to the front of my house, and the back of Mr. Walters, on this Friday morning, I got up at half-past seven o'clock—I was the first person up, and found the area railing torn up, and lying on a bed in the garden, and a saucepan, bason, and cullender which had been removed from under the inside of the kitchen window—the kitchen window under the railing was wide open—I missed from a cupboard up-stairs a loaf, a table-cloth, a jar of mince meat, a set of blacking brushes, and a rolling-pin—these brushes and rolling<lb></lb>pin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine—they were safe at one the previous evening, and I then saw the windows safe—my house is in the parish of St. Giles, Camberwell.</p>

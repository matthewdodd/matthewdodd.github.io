                  </hi>. I am a wholesale druggist, and live in Fenehurch-street. About nine o'clock in the evening of the 18th of June I was in Lombard-street—I missed my handkerchief, turned round, and saw a per<lb></lb>son near me, and the prisoner a little behind him—I said nothing—I allowed the person near me to walk away, and kept my eye on the pri<lb></lb>soner—he passed me, and looked into a perfumer's shop—he seemed not to know whether to run or what to do—a person came up and looked in at the same window—he asked that person where Abchurch-lane was—he said, "This way"—he then ran—I followed him—he looked at several doors in Abchurch-lane—I kept pretty near to him, and when at the bottom of Abchurch-lane, near King William-street, I saw a police<lb></lb>man—I then taxed the prisoner with having my handkerchief—he imme<lb></lb>diately produced it, either from his waistcoat or coat, and said, "Why did you not say it was yours when you saw me pick it up?"—I had not drop<lb></lb>ped it that I am aware of—I am sure the handkerchief he produced was mine—this now produced is it.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody—he took from his waistcoat this handker<lb></lb>chief—I afterwards found two others—one was round his neck, but it is a pocket-handkerchief—they have no marks on them—they did not appear to have been long in his possession, as they smelt of perfume.</p>

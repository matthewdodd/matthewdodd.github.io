William Glassborow was a waiter there, and had access to the plate; I have lately missed a large quantity of silver forks, spoons, and ladles; I saw some spoons and forks on the 4th of December, at Page and Son's, and Ashman's, in Longacre - I do not know the prisoner; I saw him at Marlborough-street on the 8th or 9th of December, and asked if he was not aware that Glassborow could not have come honestly by the spoons and forks; he replied that he knew they were stolen - they were produced, and a letter was produced as having been found on Glassborow, and he acknowledged being the writer of it; this was not during the examination - (read).</p>
               <p>To Mr. Glassborow, Crawford's hotel, St. James', 8th Dec.</p>
               <p>Mr. G., I cannot now address you as a friend, after what you and your wife has been saying, that we imposed upon you, that you had bought this and that; now I should like to know what you bought, but that is not the question - last night Mrs. Glasscock gave the landlord warning that we should leave to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050031"></xptr>morrow, and the answer was we must pay a week's rent, and I conceive you should pay half as well as me; you know how I am situated with the landlord - was he not one of my bail when I got into trouble for you? and could I, as a man of feeling, to him, my wife, or myself, fly in his face - you care not who suffers, who wants, or swims; but to be candid with you, unless you pay half I will clear myself, and give information of you to your master and to Mr. Gardner, the Bow-street officer, about what has passed; you know what for - why should I suffer for one who cares not for me; you know what I mean without speaking plainer - unless you send me 15s. on Friday morning, at half-past eleven o'clock, I shall come and ask you for it, and if not, have satisfaction, I want; I shall ask for your master, and relate the whole - I wish to be your friend, but your had principles will not let me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you in partnership with your father? A. No, he is the sole proprietor - Ward was the waiter who had the care of the plate; I do not recollect whether he was there in November - I think he was there in October; the prisoner made this statement in the presence of Bates, the officer - I used no threat or promise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he had reason now to suppose it was stolen, but not at the time? A. No, I am sure he did not.</p>

            . I am inspector of the Police of St. James' division - Glassborow was taken into custody on the 8th of December; I found on him the letter which has been read - I went to the prisoner's lodgings in Greek-street, Soho, and asked if his name was Glasscock; he said it was - I asked if he had seen Glassborow that day; he said he had, and that he had written him a letter - he said, shortly after, "I know what you want, you have come about that business of Crockford's;" he said that Glassborow had been going on a queer game for a long time, and that he had pawned two spoons and two forks which he received from him, and would show me where; he pointed out Page's - I asked if he had pawned any more, which he denied; and said he had written the letter to Glassborow that day, and sent it to him at Crockford's; I asked if he knew whether Glassborow was the person who had stolen the plate from Crockford's - he said he knew he had stolen the whole of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say "I now have reason to believe it?" A. No; he did not say he did not at the time know they were stolen - he knew me well before.</p>

            . I know the prisoner. About the 11th or 12th of December last I had a conversation with him about Glassborow; it was two or three nights previous to his being taken - he told me he was in a difficulty, and that Glassborow was acquainted with that, and unless he let him have 15s. by ten o'clock that night, or the next morning, he should go to Mr. Crockford's, and report him respecting the plate that he had pledged- he said William knew he was in trouble, that his brother-in-law and landlord were bail for his appearance, that he had pawned plate before, and was taken in the shop by an officer, and he thought it a hard case to suffer, through William not letting him have money to procure a counsel, as he expected to have his hearing last Session; the 15s. was to pay part of his rent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you lodge at this house? A. No; I knew him and Glassborow - I have had sufficient left me to live on; I was never in trouble - I was once taken about a handkerchief, which Gilby, a coachman, lost - I have pawned things for Glassborow, eight or nine times, in my own name.</p>
               <p>MR. CROCKFORD. I believe these to be my father's property - we have no mark on them; I might have a difficulty in swearing to them, had it not been for his confession, but here are three patterns of the kind we lost - there is a small a, b, and c, on them, and the letter n; they were produced when I had the conversation with the prisoner; one spoon is a pattern very rarely to be met with - Glassborow was in our employ, exclusively, for twelve months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Glassborow had told me he had stolen them about a fortnight before I was in custody, and that is what I told Mr. Crockford.</p>
               <p>MR. CROCKFORD. The statement made by the prisoner was after Glassborow was in custody.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Moseley says I told him this on the 13th - I was in custody before that; I had never seen Glassborow till the Friday before I pawned the two forks - he met my wife, and said he wished to see me; I went to him at Crockford's, and on the Monday morning, he asked me to pawn the forks for him, and said he had bought them of a distressed waiter at White's hotel, for 30s. - I pawned them at Page's, where I was known, in my mother's maiden name, and gave my right address - I had no idea of their being stolen, and received no benefit from them - on Thursday he asked me to pawn the spoons which he had bought of the distressed waiter; he told me afterwards that the waiter who had the care of the plate was discharged, and he was sorry for it, because he had stolen it.</p>

I gave information,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140030"></xptr>and on the 11th of August, two shoulders of gold beaters' skin were produced. I went to the prisoner's house, Providence-place, St. Luke's, and found him there at last, in January. When we went on the 11th of August we found two crucibles with a portion of gold in one - it appeared to have melted about the quantity of gold I had lost.</p>

            . I am an officer, and accompanied Mr. Tyrer to the prisoner's lodgings on the 11th of August - I found a key on the stairs, which opened the door, and found two crucibles there. I have been looking for him ever since, but did not go to his house.</p>

            . I am a gold and silver flatter. On Sunday morning, the 10th of August, the prisoner gave me these skins to sell for him. I offered them next day to Mr. Dunford, who asked me if I had not heard of Tyrer's robbery. I recollected myself, and said Yes; and I would have nothing more to do with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you - A. I work at a flatting-mill. Mr. Tyrer has had goods flattened at our mill, and had told me of the robbery a few days after it happened. I heard that he lived in Bridgewater-gardens, but did not exactly know the number of the house - I did not know what he had lost. I told Dunford I knew who I had them from - I did not mention his name. He said they were worth nothing. The prisoner said, as I knew the gold-beaters, I could sell them - that they were left at his house, and he did not know what to do with them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you known him - A. About ten years; he jobs about as a wheelwright.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. After you were apprehended did not you go to his house and tell his wife, that what you did was to serve yourself - A. No; she came to me, and begged me not appear against him.</p>
               <p>MR. DUNFORD. I told this witness they were worth nothing; and said I knew where to find him. He said he knew who he got them from.</p>
               <p>MR. TYRER. I received the shoulders from Tillott, and can swear to them - my private mark is on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Tillott was taken up himself - A. Yes, five or six days after the robbery; he was committed for a week, and his master gave his word for his appearance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about it. I have been at home ever since, and about the neighbourhood. On the Friday before Tillott was apprehended, he brought a piece of gold and silver to my house, and sent me to sell it; I received 1 l. 6 s. 9 d. for it. He gave me 2 s. for going.</p>

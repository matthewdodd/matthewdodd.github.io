                  </hi>. I am a wholesale warehouseman. On Wednesday last, the 20th of September, at three o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the warehouse of Margetson and Co., Gutter-lane, and purchased a dozen of skins there—the prisoner served me—there was no one there but him—as Italian boy came to the door with images for sale—I asked the boy in a joke if he could give change for a sovereign, as I thought I had not sufficient change to pay him 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for an image which I bought—I then offered the boy 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and asked him to change it—he said he would put down his basket and go and get change, but I had 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I borrowed a halfpenny of the prisoner, and said I would pay him when he sent the invoice of the goods—I took my leather home, and at seven o'clock in the evening I missed my canvas bag, containing 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, two half-crowns, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—I cannot recollect taking my purse out when I was in the warehouse, but I know the money was in it at the warehouse—I felt confident I must have left the purse at the warehouse, though I did not recollect having it in my hands—I went back directly, and saw one of the partners, or the warehouseman, Mr. Chapman—I told him what had passed—the prisoner was not there then—I called at nine o'clock the next morning, and saw him—I looked him hard in the face and said, "I left my bag here yesterday, with some gold in it"—he replied," Did you? I have not seen anything of it"—I said, "I must have left it here, for I have been nowhere else where I had occasion to pay money, in the course of the day"—he told me he would go down stairs with me to the lower ware house, and see if we could see anything of it—he turned some skins over, and said he did not think I could have left it there, or he must have seen it—in the course of the afternoon I met the Italian boy, and in consequence of information went to Guildhall—we both went to the house again and saw the prisoner—I said, "That is the young man"—Foster stated to him I was confident I had left my purse there, and we had evidence to prove he had been seen with it immediately after I left—the prisoner said, "The boy is quite wrong, for I only found it a quarter of an hour since, and I was going to bring it to you directly master came home"—he said he found it among a parcel of skins—he put his hand to the bottom of his watch fob and had to work it up before he could get it out—he gave me the purse—I turned the gold out—there was only 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—all the silver was gone and about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Leather-lane, and sell images. I remember seeing the gentleman in the warehouse, where I went with the images—I sold one figure to him—I saw the prisoner there—the gentleman asked me to change a sovereign—I said, "No"—he said, "Go and get change for a shilling"—I said I would—he said, "Stop, I have got threepence halfpenny"—the prisoner lent him a halfpenny, and he gave me fourpence, on which the gentleman put his purse on the counter—that is the purse—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—the gentleman went away, and the prisoner took the purse—I said, "What have you got inside?"—he said, "A sovereign," and I saw him put it into his pocket—the gentleman was gone away then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Thomas John Bolton, a con<lb></lb>tractor for post riding-horses, in Brunswick-street, Stamford-street. The prisoner has been a post riding-boy—on Tuesday, the 21st of Jan., the wit<lb></lb>ness Gibbs brought the prisoner to me at the Post-office, with a mare</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300253"></xptr>
               <p>—I knew it to be Mr. Bolton's mare—Gibbs said, in the prisoner's presence, that he had brought it to him, and sold it him for a sovereign, and asked me if the prisoner was authorized to sell it—I said, certainly not, he must take him over the water to master's premises—he said a boy named George Morgan stole it, and said if he would sell it he would give him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general dealer. On the 31st of Jan., the pri<lb></lb>soner was coming down Cow-cross, on the mare, which was very lame indeed—I asked him whether it was for sale—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Who does it belong to?"—he said, "My master"—he told me who his master was—I asked him where his master lived—he said, up by Sadler's Wells—he was a green-grocer—I asked him the price—he said be wanted 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "Is that the lowest?"—he said, "No, master says I may take 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I said, "I will go along with you, and see whether it is all correct"—I gave him the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and went with him towards Sadler's Wells, to see if his master lived there—before we got there, he ran away from me—I ran, caught him, and asked what made him run away—he said he was going to leave bis master, and did not wish to give him the money—I asked him for the money back—he gave it to me, and told me he had stolen it, and who he brought it from—I took him to the Post-office—the mare has been left in Sharp's-alley, in care of my wife.</p>

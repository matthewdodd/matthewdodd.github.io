                  </hi>, I am salesman to John Aaron, a pawn<lb></lb>broker, in Whitechapel. On the 17th of May, about eleven o'clock, I missed a pair of half-boots, which had been suspended at the door for sale—I gave information to the neighbouring pawnbrokers, and a little after twelve o'clock, I received information that they were stopped at a pawn<lb></lb>broker's—I went there, and found the prisoner in the box—he said he had bought them at a respectable shop in Petticoat-lane—he requested I would go there—I said I should not without a policeman—he said he would not be detained by me, if I would not let him go, he would kick me—I kept him till the officer took him—these are the half-boots—I saw them safe after ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I did not say I bought them at a respectable shopkeeper's—I said I had borrowed 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of a respectable shopkeeper, Mrs. Lloyd. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No—he said he had bought them at a respectable shop, and asked me to go with him—he did not tell me where the shop was—I did not say if he would give up the boots I would say no more about it—I said, "If you take me down Petticoat-lane you might get away."</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Sowerby, of Brick-lane, Whitechapel. The prisoner brought these boots to the shop—our fore<lb></lb>man took them, and gave them to me—I put them down and ran to the prosecutor's—I then got the officer—the prisoner was asked how he came by them, and I understood him, that he had bought them at a shop in Petti<lb></lb>coat-lane—I certainly heard him say he had borrowed 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of Mrs. Lloyd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I gave the man 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the boots, and then went and pledged them to pay Mrs. Lloyd's 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—at the time I came into the shop, was any body in the box? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Yes—there was a person</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 25, Essex-street, Whitechapel. On the morning, of the robbery the prisoner was not out of my house from eleven o'clock till a quarter before twelve o'clock—he is a French-polisher—he has lodged with me seven or eight months—it was on a Tuesday, three weeks ago, I think, I cannot tell exactly—his wife came down, and asked me if I would let her put her kettle on my fire, and I told her to go into the parlour and put it on—I looked at the clock, expecting my little ones from school, and that was the time—I know the prisoner was taken that day—I can safely swear he was not out of my house till a quarter before twelve o'clock—I have no other thoroughfare but through the shop—I have other lodgers on the second floor, but the prisoner lived in the first floor—two of my children were at school, and two sons were with my husband in the shed—Mrs. Lloyd keeps a chandler's shop next door to me—I went to her, and she went to the office, but was not examined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I took the man to Mrs. Lloyd's door, and borrowed 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—he had asked me 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

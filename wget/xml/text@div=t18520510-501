                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, of Tottenham. The pri<lb></lb>soner was in my employ ten or eleven weeks up to 19th April, as potman and ostler—it was part of his business to take out beer and receive the money for it, in this case weekly; but the casual beer he answered for himself; if h e received money he ought to book it, and bring it to me directly he came home—I had a regular customer named Clark; he did not account to me for anything received from her on 19th March; he brought me no money—I asked him about it several times, for I have received nothing from Mrs. Clark from 16th Feb.—he said it was not convenient to Mrs. Clark; but she had got some money to be paid, and she would then pay it.</p>

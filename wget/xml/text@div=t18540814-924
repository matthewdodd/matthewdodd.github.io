                  </hi>. I am a cigar merchant, and live at No. 194, Fleet-street. The prisoner was my shopman—in consequence of missing some<lb></lb>thing when I took stock on 1st July, I said to the prisoner, "There are 13 lbs. of Martina Regalias missing"—I asked whether he had sold them; he said, "No"—I said they were stolen—they were not the cigars which are now charged—the prisoner's brother was taken into custody, and in consequence of what transpired then, the prisoner's boxes were searched in my presence, and twenty-nine cigars were found, and a case full—they were foreign cigars, not English—these are them—they were wrapped up in my papers, and of course they are mine—they are the same character of cigars—the prisoner was not present when they were found; he was in custody—I was sent for by the inspector on the following Monday, and I went.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-sergeant</hi>). The prisoner was in custody in Fleet-street station—he sent for me, and said he wished to see his master—I told him any message he wished to have conveyed to him should be con<lb></lb>veyed—he said, "I should like to see him personally"—on that I sent for Mr. Silberberg, and he came—I told the prisoner whatever he said to him must he said in my presence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a carver, of Fleet-street, Bethnal-green. I sleep in the workshop—on 19th Nov. the prisoner came there a little before five o'clock—he asked for a job (he had before worked for Mr. Wingate, my master)—he had no work for him, and I gave him some work of mine—I had a silver watch in the room, which I placed between the bedclothes—the prisoner saw me do it—I followed Mr. Wingate down stairs to get my tea, leaving the prisoner in the shop—I heard him come down, and I said to him,</p>

               <p>"Mind you come back, and finish your work"—he said, "Yes"—when I went to bed at night my watch was gone—it has not been found—I did not see the prisoner again till I met him, and gave him into custody—I could not earn more than 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour, and told him I could give him but 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and told him he could earn only 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour—he said, "Never mind that."</p>

Castle was in my employ—the prisoner came to my shop on 19th Nov., about three o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon—Castle gave him some of his work to do—he was in the shop till five—I was not out of the shop till I went down to tea—I was absent twenty minutes—after I came back I was in the shop again till half-past nine at night—no one but him had been in the house, and no one had an oppor<lb></lb>tunity of getting this watch but the prisoner—no one could have gone up while I was at tea—I did not take it.</p>

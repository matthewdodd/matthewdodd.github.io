On the 16th of August the prisoner brought me a house note from the India House, and asked me if I would buy his wages; he informed me that he came home in the Nottingham, East Indiaman. I saw the note and asked him if he would let me take it to the India House to see if it was for a man that had come home, he informed me that his name was Gwillam Anthony; I went and enquired, they said there was a man of that description; I then got the bill of sale for the prisoner to execute; I got two men to be witnesses; I read the bill of sale over to him twice, and asked him if it was right.</p>
               <p>Q. What amount in money did you understand his wages to come to - A. Sixteen pound nineteen shillings and two-pence; I gave him fourteen pound and two-pence; I deducted one shilling, in the pound poundage, and fifteen shillings for the bill of sale.</p>
               <p>Q. When are these wages paid - A. Sometimes three months after, and sometimes sooner. No further passed than I gave him the money, he signed his name Gwillam Anthony.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he sign it - A. He made his mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober - A. Yes; this was on the 16th of August, as nigh as I can recollect. In November I went to the India House to receive the money, it was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. How was this executed - A. In my parlour, before him and the witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q. Who wrote the name, Gwillam Anthony - A. I did, and read it over to him, and asked him if it was right; he said, yes; I asked him to sign it, he made his mark here; I asked him if that was his right name, he said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did this without any man to advise him what he was about; he is a foreigner - was there any attorney present - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You wrote the name of Gwillam Anthony to the deed, and to the receipt - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. What are you? - I am clerk of the first fruits office; this is an indenture of apprenticeship; it was presented at the office, either by Mrs. Jones, or Mr. Palmer; they came together sometime the last day of June, or the beginning of July, I cannot tell the time of the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060115"></xptr>Did you see them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they apply to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was their business? - To present these indentures, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Did they present these indentures? - They did, I know nothing further, this is at the back of the indenture as I received it, I do not know whether they received the money.</p>
               <p>Do not you know who received it? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do not you know what was done in consequence of that? - I do not know, I only know that they presented it; after they are paid. Mr. Bacon takes them and gives a draft on his banker.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether that was done in this case? - It certainly was done but I cannot say to whom.</p>

               <p>Do they leave it without the money? - Sometimes they do, and sometimes they do not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they come together always? - They generally did, they came two or three times, I cannot say the day they came.</p>
               <p>Look at that draft, perhaps you can tell whether that draft was given, when that was brought? - No, I cannot, it is Mr. Bacon's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Court. What was their business at the office? - Mrs. Jones came first alone with a petition, she represented her case to Mr. Bacon in my hearing, to obtain one of the stewards signatures, for a certain sum of money for an apprentice, Mr. Bacon immediately from the recommendation of Dr. Hand, whose signature is on the petition, recommended her to Admiral Hood; I believe he wrote a note to the Admiral, for the purpose of obtaining the petition.</p>
               <p>Did she represent that she wanted it for a child of her own or any other child? - For a child of her own.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did you see Palmer? - He did not come till after the petition was signed, I believe they came together, and got a blank indenture.</p>
               <p>How long was it before they presented the indenture in the state it now is? - It was but a very little time, they have been together two or three times; I believe in consequence of Mr. Bacon's recommendation, there was a petition signed by Admiral Hood, but I cannot speak to his hand writing; the petition had the name of Admiral Hood to it.</p>
               <p>What was Mr. Bacon at that time? - He was Sub-treasurer to the Lord Mayor, Alderman Newnham, he is always secretary; these are the papers.</p>
               <p>Mr. SHEPHERD sworn.</p>
               <p>Is this Admiral Hood's hand writing? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Put in the indenture.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. No, not the indenture, as this is laid in the indictment to be a forged indenture, I submit to your Lordship, that they have no right to produce this indenture as evidence, till they have proved it to be a forged indenture.</p>
               <p>Court. They have intitled themselves to read it, as soon as they have proved that it was produced by the prisoners; as an act from the prisoners, it certainly is to be read in evidence against them, if it does not come out as one of the circumstances of the charge, it will go for nothing.</p>
               <p>(The indenture read and examined by the Court.)</p>
               <p>(Dated 23d of June, 1783.)</p>

               <p>When was that? - It might be about August was a twelvemonth, or September, 1783, I took no note of it.</p>
               <p>Was it the day that that bore date, Sir, do you recollect was it the 23d of June? - I believe so, upon my word, it was not filled up in my presence, it was brought to me ready filled up, I believe the name of Buckeley was subscribed to it; I did not see him sign it, but I know Mr. Buckeley very well, he was of Poole, and he was formerly of Montgomery.</p>

               <p>Look at the back of that indenture? - This is my signing to the receipt, I know Mrs. Jones had a son of the name of

               <p>Mr. Fielding. This is all leading to another business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What do you know of this sum of money, which was to be received under this indenture which you witnessed? - I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>What connection had that story with this transaction? - None at all, only that I thought you asked me about Mr. Rowland's money.</p>

               <p>Then you of your own knowledge do not know, whether any thing was received upon that indenture or not? - No, Sir, indeed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. You are now talking of business that you suppose passed in 1783? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say you suppose you signed this indenture about August or September? - I suppose so.</p>
               <p>The only reason you have to suppose that you signed this indenture or any indenture at this time, was that you see the date, now you have no other recollection of it? - No, only it must be at that time, I was at the house of the prisoner for two or three months.</p>
               <p>Did not you know a Mr. Morgan at that time? - No, not by the name of Morgan.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Where did you witness that indenture? - In your office.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I think so.</p>
               <p>Think so! but are you sure of it? - Sure, no, I would not say, but to the best of my knowledge I witnessed it there.</p>
               <p>Court. What way of life have you been in? - I was a Captain in the Montgomery militia.</p>
               <p>What was you bred to? - To the law.</p>
               <p>Did you practise? - No, Sir, I only happened to be two or three years, I did not know enough of it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I went there occasionally in the counting-house, and he was behind the counter, he never saw me write, he has seen my writing in books.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles to Shrigley. You have heard the names of those gentlemen that are mentioned, as stewards of the feast of the Sons of the Clergy? - I have.</p>
               <p>Is any part of this money, part of their own fortune? - No.</p>
               <p>This money then I understand to be raised by voluntary contributions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Under what circumstances are the officers authorised to distribute that money? - There is a secretary appointed, Mr. Bacon is the secretary, he divides the whole sum equally among the stewards, each steward has his portion, and I believe it is well known they have a right to give to whom they please, I always understood that it is a sufficient sanction for the payment of the money.</p>
               <p>You do not conceive that any of these gentlemen, who have a share of the sum collected, have a right to apply it to their own personal necessities or pleasures? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. My Lord, I conceive, admitting every fact on this case, that this amounts to no more than a fraud, and that it cannot reach that accumulation of guilt which we call forgery: to support this objection, my reasons are these: that the legislature has from time to time, found it necessary to guard the property of men from those tricks they cannot very well in common prudence foresee; but I believe from the language, that the legislature he shewn in the preamble to those acts, which they have given us as the rules of our conduct, it will always be understood, that this fraud is to be committed on some person in his own personal individual property, and not to be extended to that fraud which should induce him to part with the money of others; for which he was not in point of law to account: great is the difference to society, whether a charity is barely misapplied, or whether a person in possession of an ample fortune is to be totally deprived of that in an instant, by the wicked artifices of any man whatever: the extreme caution that government has taken to prevent frauds of this kind, certainly arises from the great facility with which these things are done, and the very ample mischief which they occasion; but surely my Lord, the mere misapplication of a charity is not that mischief; the very first statue of the 5th of Elizabeth, Chap. 14th which made the forging of a deed, upon second conviction, a capital offence, in the preamble, says,</p>
               <p>"it is to the great injury, wrong, hurt, disherison, and utter damage;" So that unless some statute is produced to me, that makes the legislature alter its language, I have a right to say that these prisoners are not the guilty persons, against whom the law meant to wreak its vengeance: another statute was made, which is the 2d of

             the Second, Chap 25. and there the preamble says, that</p>
               <p>"this evil ought to be checked by further punishment (namely, by making forgery capital in the first instance) because it conveys such infinite prejudice to trade and credit;" surely these are not words sufficiently explicit in an act by which men are to square their conduct; suresly the legislature did did not mean to hold out death, as the penalty of getting by trick, that money which was intended to be given to more worthy objects.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060119"></xptr>Mr. Fielding. The legislature has guarded the property of corporations.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. My Lord, I think upon these grounds, and the observation of my learned friend, that the legislature has guarded the property of corporations, that if they chuse so to shelter themselves against such kind of frauds from all people, they may by applying to the legislature, receive that additional security, which if they are aggrieved, will make the punishment to be the lives of the offenders: but, certainly where these persons are not answerable over to those who have given them the money, as is the case here, no ruin, no prejudice can possibly accrue to them: for those reasons added to this, that it has been the interest of the wisest of all constitutions, and ought to be the interest of every one, that those acts of their's, which are to affect the lives and liberties of their subjects, should be as plain as possible; therefore, surely, this will not be extended to those who might have received further security, this will not be extended to those who have neglected receiving that further security, and are not in their own persons any ways damaged or prejudiced.</p>
               <p>Court. The objection has been very ingeniously put, but I do not think it proper to give so much countenance to it, as to call on the other side to answer it. God forbid that funds for public charities should not have the same security that every man's private purse has; they are the absolute owners of this money, it is their property, it is put into their hands upon a trust, as between the subscribers and them, and the subscribers might call upon them if they were to sink the money in their pockets, if it were possible they could act so mean a part; but, as against all the world except the subscribers, it is unquestionably their money, and there is no difference between this case and the case of a corporation, but that where there is a corporation, the money then becomes, the money of that corporation; where there is no corporation, it is the property of those individuals, which, if it had been incorporated would have composed that corporation: the statutes that have been quoted, recites the mischiefs that have arisen in some cases to their disherison, and that it has a tendency to prejudice trade and credit; but that was never meant to confine the operation of the offence to case where judgment of actual disherison was the consequence; or that it should be absolutely necessary, that it should be a case where trade is affected, or where general credit is affected; enough to satisfy the preamble is the definition of forgery; that is the thing we are to go by; and that is the false making an instrument which purports upon the face of it to be good and valid, for the purposes for which it was created, with a design to defraud any person; for it is not possible in this case, but there was a design to defraud these trustees, the individual trustee, the sub-treasurer, who if he paid it, would be answerable; this signature of

            , would be no sanction to Mr. Bacon to pay this money on a false deed; I am clearly certain in point of law he would be answerable: this is therefore plainly a case, in which this forgery has been made to defraud every person that are parties in the transaction, and I conclude as I began, God forbid, that the immense funds that are raised in such a country as this for public charities, should not in the hands of those that have the care of then, receive the same protection that the private purse of every individual has!</p>

               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you, gentlemen of the Jury, the indenture in question came to me signed with the name of Bulkeley; previous to that indenture being signed, I had seen the petition signed by very respectable characters, unquestionable characters; I could have no doubt that there was any thing amiss in the indenture, nor is it yet proved I presume, because that there was a man of the name of Bulkeley I well knew; I knew a gentleman of that name that came frequently to visit Mrs. Jones; I understood from him that he was to take her son apprentice; I remarked one day, that after the name Bulkeley was signed, that the indenture lacked the necessary appendages of witnesses; accordingly Mr. Lloyd one of the subscribing witnesses who knew the signature (as he said) being there, I did ask him to sign it; it is very usual, I appeal to the Jury, for bills to come frequently from the country without necessary indorsements; any indifferent clerk or other person may put an indorsement on that bill, yet though it is an absolute forgery, it is not with intent to defraud; and I did not think myself any ways culpable or criminal in asking a person to sign an indenture, who had acknowledged that he well knew the name of Buckley. As to having uttered the indenture, I deny that; I never did, and I am pretty positive that Mrs. Jones never did: I wish to ask Mr. Shrigley, whether at the distance of two years back he can identify my person, or that of Mrs. Jones's; or what particularly struck him that he should recollect our persons after two years.</p>

               <p>Court to Shrigley. The prisoners desire to know what reason you have to take notice of them? - There was a leading circumstance that led me to it, and which in fact led me to a discovery of the forgery: upon a subsequent forgery in the name of Rowland, there was a great deal of stir, and in seeking about it we found that Mr. Palmer was a principal mediator, and I recollected him to be the same man that came on that business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones. You did not see me with Mr. Palmer? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Palmer. Do you withdraw yourself entirely from all concern with it; or was you yourself imposed on? - I say, I was myself imposed on; I will appeal to the gentlemen of the Jury, whether any of the gentlemen would not have done the same as I did: I did not utter that indenture.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you shew by witnesses in what manner, and by what way, that indenture was brought to you? - What I did was merely out of friendship and humanity to Mrs. Jones; at her desire I did assist her in going to Mr. Bacon's office, Mr. Bacon did send it back to Mr. Hood; it was recommended by Dr. Hand, of Cripplegate, and signed by the two church-wardens: I do acknowledge that I did fill up the indenture; and likewise, that I saw it with the name of Bulkeley to it, at Vauxhall; that was where Mr. Lloyd witnessed it.</p>
               <p>Court. You bring yourself a good way into it by acknowledging so much; do you give the Jury any account of who that Bulkeley was? - I only knew Mr. Bulkeley as I did Mr. Lloyd, though Mrs. Jones.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. My Lord, Mr. Palmer kept an office of Universal intelligence, and in procuring of servants, which was within that line.</p>

            . Now what have you to say for yourself? - I know no more but there was a man of the name of Buckley.</p>
               <p>Court. But you know you have taken upon yourself to produce an indenture, by which your son was bound to a man of the name of Bulkley, living at Poole, in Montgomeryshire? - He certainly was there at that time when he was bound.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, I submit on the part of Mrs. Jones, that no witness through this whole evidence affects her, as having any concern with this instrument.</p>
               <p>Court. She uttered it, whether she knew it is another thing.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Jones. I understand this application for the apprentice fee was for your own son; you ought to have known<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060123"></xptr> whether you had bound him apprentice to anybody, and whom? - I did not know he was obliged to reside constantly in Poole.</p>
               <p>Can you prove that the transaction was a real one, that there was a master for your son, and that your son was really intended to be bound apprentice, and that this is not all a fiction? - The woman has proved that there was such a man.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses for her? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>The Jury withdrew for a short time, and returned with a verdict.</p>

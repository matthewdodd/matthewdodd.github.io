            . On the 29th of December I was asleep, I cannot tell where, and my silver buckles were in my shoes, and the other in my bricks when I went to sleep, and when I awaked they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in a house?</p>
               <p>Koren. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any bedfellow?</p>
               <p>Koren. A girl met me, and we went into a house, and went to-bed together; I put my bricks under the pillow, and when I awaked, they were lying by the fire-side; I did not find my buckles, so I go away.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your bedfellow?</p>
               <p>Koren. She was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Koren. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you for charging the prisoner?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever get your buckles again?</p>
               <p>Koren. The constable has them; his name is Brown.</p>

            . I took the prisoner in custody by virtue of a warrant from Justice Berry. The buckles were delivered to me. The prosecutor told me he delivered the watch to her to keep for him [The buckles produced in court, and deposed to.] She had sold the buckles to a silversmith, and the prosecutor's landlady went and redeemed them again; her name is Mayfield.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mayfield. The prosecutor had been about a week from Norway, he told me he lost his way coming home, and he gave his watch to a woman to keep for him; and he had been lying with a girl; and when he came home, he had no buckles in his shoes and breeches, this was on the 30th of December. He lodged at my house at the Black Boy and Star, New Gravel Lane. I went and found the prisoner (she had delivered him his watch again). I taxed her with taking his buckles. She said she did not take them, but she could go and fetch them. I went with her to the silversmith, where she had sold them for 13 s. and I gave him 15 s. for them again; he lives at the corner of Tower-hill; then I delivered them to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the prisoner live?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mayfield. She lives in Church-lane; I do not think she is the owner of the house, neither do I believe she took the buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. Why?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mayfield. Because there were many bad people in the house when I went in; and she said she was sent by one

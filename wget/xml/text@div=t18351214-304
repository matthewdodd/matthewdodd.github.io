                  </hi>. I am a coach-maker, and live in Aslyum-buildings, Westminster-road. On the 15th of November, I missed four sets of springs and four axletrees, in eight halves, from a loft over my smith's shop—I had been there on Friday, the 13th—on the 8th of De<lb></lb>cember, I saw them at a pawnbroker's, named Clark, in old-street-road—they are worth 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Snelling worked for me all last summer, up to two or three months previous to the robbery.</p>

In consequence of information I searched the prisoner Atkins's house, in Baker-street, on Monday even<lb></lb>ing, the 7th of December—I found him in bed—I found no goods on the premises—I told him I wanted him for felony—he asked me what felony—I told him the springs and axletrees, which were lost from Mr. Herring's—he said at first that he knew nothing about them—he afterwards told me he was hired by a person to take them over the water to a pawnbroker's, but he did not know they were stolen—he said he took them to a pawnbroker's in Old-street—Vickers went next morning and found them.</p>

I bought the mare of the lad at the bar last Friday was three weeks, being the 28th of November; I gave 2 l. 18 s. 3 d. for her; I bought her at the Black Horse in Bartholomew-close; the prisoner is a very young lad; I knew him before; he lived with a dealer a year or two before; I sent her into the market again immediately; we were bid 4 l. for her; we would not take it. On the Saturday she was sold for 4 l. 10 s. and put up at the Griffin, in Long-lane, there she stood at livery; there were three of us concerned; we took the lad's name, and his master's name; he said he sold her for one Parrot; we paid the lad for her; we found her advertised on the Monday following, and on the Wednesday we examined her by the advertisement, and we went and gave an account of her to Mr. Dowson in Moorfields; when he came to see her, he said it was the same mare; she is there now; we paid the money back again, and delivered her up to the gentleman.</p>

On Wednesday, the 13th of December, I went to bed about one o'clock in the morning - I fastened the front door with a bolt inside and a slip lock; the area was covered over with an iron grating, which is very heavy - the kitchen door, which communicates with the area, was always left open, as sheep are left to run in there; I do not know whether the inner door of the kitchen was fastened: when I got up in the morning I found a cupboard door in the little back parlour was broken open - the door of that parlour had been shut the night before, but not locked - a liquor frame and three decanters were taken out of the cupboard, and a plated cruet-frame, three plated spoons, and about 10s. worth of copper; four books were taken off a shelf in the same parlour, and a brush was taken off a shelf - a pair of boots were taken off the floor; I missed these things about seven o'clock in the morning: my man, John Wright, was up before me, but he had not been in the room - I cannot judge which way the persons had got in; the front door was found ajar in the morning - I saw my property the same day at Hatton-garden - it was safe the night before; my partner's name is Hulbert - all the property belongs to us both, except two books and the boots, which were mine.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Tavistock-square on the morning of the 13th of December, and saw the prisoner about half-past two o'clock, with a bundle; I asked what he had got - he made no answer; I followed him, and then he turned back - I asked what was in the bundle; he said a pair of boots - I asked where he got them - he said from his master's, in Holborn; I found some books there also - he said they were his own; I asked where he got them, and he could not tell me; he resisted being taken to the station-house, but I at last got Payne's assistance, and took him there - he was searched, and a pair of boots, four books, a brush, and a decanter were found on him, and another broken decanter was in his pocket, and he had three spoons.</p>
               <p>MR. MOORE. These boots have my name in them, and this Prayer-book and Bible; it is part of the property I lost; and these other things I know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was drinking in company with two young men till twelve o'clock, and from there I went to Oxford-street, to get something to drink; I heard a young man say he had got some things at his master's house, and as his master and him had had a few words, he did not like to fetch them in the day time - I waited in Little Coram-street, and went to sleep in a doorway; in about half an hour they came to me, roused me up, and gave me the articles - I said I thought they had been doing wrong - they called me a fool, and told me to go along; one of them gave me two keys, telling me it would be too late to go home, and to go with them, and have some breakfast.</p>
               <p>Four witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

                  </hi> I picked up this second heap of tobacco from the scale where the prisoner was at work, on the following day—this appears to be the same quality as this first produced, but this being on the ground, and trod upon, it disfigures it rather; but I should say, with that exception, it appears to be the same quality.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hammond. I found him as he was taking it out, at took him at the same time: I saw him cast on his hand with a quick motion to another boy, to whom I presume he then delivered it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his hand as he took it out of your pocket?</p>

               <p>Hammond. He was, but we did not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your handkerchief afterwards ?</p>

               <p>Hammond. I said, I did not know what I had to till I felt and missed my handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Hammond. I laid it in the indictment at 2 s. but itis worth more than that.</p>

            . As I was passing through St. Pis church-yard, I saw the prisoner's hand in the prosecutor's pocket, and saw him pull out a handkerchief; I thought he put it in his bosom, but it went I believe to a confederate, for there was one on each side of him. I laid hold on the prisoner, and said to the prosecutor, that is your chap; I believe he has got your handkerchief; he felt, and said, he had lost his; so we secured the prisoner.</p>

            . On Sunday morning, about eleven o'clock, he applied to me about this cart, saying, a friend of his had a horse and cart to dispose of. I asked him if he knew the horse and cart; he said, yes. He appointed to bring the horse and cart on Monday, at eleven o'clock, for me to look at it. Both the prisoners came with the horse and cart as near that time as possible. I never saw Judah before, nor did I know his name until he signed the receipt for the sale. I walked the horse about; it was lame. I said I did not want such a horse as that; it was a cripple. Judah drove the horse. He asked fourteen pounds for it; I offered nine pounds; we at last agreed for ten pounds. I paid him part of the money on the same day, and on the second day two pounds eight shillings, and the third day one pound nine shillings, and three shillings was stopped by agreement. I bought it outright I asked Davis how long Judah had it; he said, about eight or nine months. Judah said the same, and he kept it to let out.</p>

            . On Monday I was at the bargain of this horse and cart between Clifford and the prisoners; the account that he is given is correct. Judah and Davis sold the horse and cart. Davis said, Judah had the horse and cart nine months. Judah said the same. I was by when it was paid for. It was paid for as the other witness has stated.</p>
               <p>Judah's Defence. My employer, Mr. Olden, sent me to Mr. Althan's to borrow a horse and cart on the Monday to go to Deptford; I went down to Deptford; I got very much in liquor, and after I got in liquor I do not know what occurred.</p>
               <p>Davis's Defence. I had been to Bermondsey; I met Judah in a cart; he was intoxicated; he asked me to take a ride with him. I went with him, and when we came to the Marsh-gate, Clifford asked me how I did. We stopped at the Spanish Patriots public-house, and had something to drink. We had several pots of hot. I went to the hair-dressers to be shaved, and when I came back I saw Judah with some notes in his hand. He told Judah he would give him any money for the horse and cart for a friend of his He told Hodgkins to take a ride in the cart to his father's. It was then a little after twelve o'clock; about half after two o'clock Judah called for his horse and cart; he did not get it.</p>

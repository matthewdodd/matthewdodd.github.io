                  </hi>. On 12th November I lodged at 97, Red Cross Street, and about 11.30 p.m. I heard a disturbance, which induced me to go to the room below, where my child was sleeping—I found the prisoner at the bedroom door with a knife in her hand, and said "I hope you have</p>

I am deputy at this lodging-house—I was called to a disturbance; Mrs. Davis came down, and said to the prisoner "I hope you have not hurt my child"—the prisoner said "I will hurt you, you cow," and struck her with a knife—they both fell, and there was then a struggle on the floor—Mr. Davis had not said anything to her, or struck her—the prisoner was in drink, but not so drunk as not to know what she was doing.</p>

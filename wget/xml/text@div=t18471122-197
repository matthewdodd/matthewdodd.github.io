               <p>known the defendant about two years—when I first knew him he was clerk to Mr. Pellem, a solicitor, in Piccadilly—he came to me about three months ago, and said he had left Mr. Pellem, and was living with Mr. George, a solicitor, and that he himself recovered debts in the New County Courts, and Mr. George had granted him letters to enable him to sue persons in the County Courts, for unless a clerk had a lawyer's letter, he could not appear there—I employed him to get some debts for me—he was to take out a summons against Mr. Purvis, who owed me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to take out the summons in the Bloomsburry Court—I saw him a few days afterwards—he told me he had taken that summons out, and it would be heard on 29th Sept.—on 1st Oct. I received this letter from him by post—I know it to be his hand-writing—I saw him next evening, he told me the cause came on on the 29th, that he had attended, that the cause was un<lb></lb>defended, and the Court granted Mr. Purvis six weeks to pay the debt in—he said the money was to be paid into Court, and he had paid the ex<lb></lb>penses of the hearing himself, which was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he asked me if I would pay him that, or give him some money—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account—I gave him that 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the faith that the cause had been heard, and that he had paid the money out of his pocket—this was on 2nd Oct.—I have never received the money from Mr. Purvis, or the prisoner—I saw the prisoner again about three weeks afterwards, at the latter end of Oct., in Albary-street, and gave him into custody—he said he did not think I should have been so hard with him. that I should give him time—he said he was coming into some money, and he would pay it.</p>

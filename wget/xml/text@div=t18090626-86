On the 22nd of May last, I lost a pair of sheets and a white gown from off the bed; I went to make enquiry at the pawnbrokers, and as I was going to Mr. Burton's the pawnbroker, I met this woman coming out. This was on the 22nd. The prisoner lived in my neighbourhood, and used my house; I said to her have you been pawning, she said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not suspect her, did you - A. No; I went home. My daughter went up stairs and come down to me, and said mother, the sheets are gone off the other bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up and see that the sheets were gone - A. Yes. It then struck me that this woman had taken them, she was drinking a pot of beer in the house at the said time, I asked her what she had been pawning at the time I saw her coming out of Mr. Burton's shop; she said it was a shirt belonging to Mr. Dyson; that is a man that lives in the neighbourhood. I sent to Mr. Dyson to know if he had sent her on such an errant; he said no. Then she said it was for

The sheets were there with my own marks upon them; she had pawned them for five shillings; I lost a pair of sheets on the 22nd, and a pair on the 23rd.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go to Mr. Burton's on the 22nd - A. I did; I had not missed the other pair then, not till I returned from the pawnbroker's.</p>

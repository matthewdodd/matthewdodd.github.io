                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor of this case, by order of the Lord Chief Baron.

I have laid out a large sum of the cash I got on the bond, and Mr. King's expenses were very heavy, and cost more than he gave me any idea of; therefore, to prevent any disappointment to you, I have enclosed two bills, as you will see, at six months' date, instead of the others. I thought you would have no objection to accept them; and if you destroyed these yourself, and if you do this it will enable me to meet the others without having recourse to the Thompsons, as it will be my strict endeavour to avoid them in future.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What I understand from you is, that you deny that in the letter you wrote the amount of 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was mentioned? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly; I deny that upon my oath—no portion of these bills are in my handwriting, not even the name, across the signature—I know Hearder's Hotel, at Torquay—I have very seldom been in the habit of going there; I have gone there sometimes to get postage stamps—I do not live at Torquay; I am staying there at present—I swear, beyond all question, that I was not there on 17th April—I threw nothing into the fire there on that day—I never threw any-thing into the fire there, certainly not; nor did I say, "D—n the things, let them go!"

Madam,—I have just received the enclosed bill from Mr. Thompson, and forward it to you by his desire: you must sign it, 'C. Pickford.' It is drawn at two months, which is, I am sorry to say, very inconvenient to me, as having, as you know, to provide for a very large bill by 1st Jan. I am extremely doubtful about being able to meet this one in the same month; but as you said you would provide for a portion of that bill due 11th Jan., I trust, if I can meet the whole of that, you will do your utmost endeavours to meet this when it is due on 18th Jan., as it is not in my power to meet all those large sums. I cannot understand how the mistake has occurred; as I most certainly thought I had paid every bill that was due until Jan. When the bill is taken up due this month, be so good as to send it to me; but do not write until then, and merely direct, 'Torquay, Devonshire,' as the letters directed to the post office are not kept there until I call for them, but sent by the letter carrier. I am glad to bear you are better. P. S.—It would be better if you would get Mr. Thompson to alter the two months to three months, which would make it more convenient; and I perceive the stamp is equally good for three as for two months. I shall write to Mr. T. by this post on the subject. ") That was written after 1851, when I knew she went by the name of Pickford.</p>

Now I must roost plainly tell you that I really will not accept any more bills, as what I have already done is very much more than 1 can afford to do; and I trust if you succeed in your business, you will repay me some portion of what I have advanced you, and I trust what I have now done will prove advantageous. I must request that my name may not appear in the business in any way. Be so good as to sign your name to the bill Ch., and not your Christian name at full length.") <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You see there you desire she should sign merely with the initials of her Christian name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I did not mean her regular name—I really cannot say any particular reason why that was; I thought it might be better; it was "C.," and it might be considered either to be "Charles" or "Charlotte," either a man or a woman.</p>

I did not return in time to answer it by yesterday's post I am most particularly desirous you should not attempt to come down to see me here, as it might, I can assure you, be productive of serious consequences. If, however, you should persist in your determination to come, you had better assume some other name; and when you arrive, go to the Swan hotel, in High-street. If you do this, you must write from London, by to-morrow's post. Say what time you shall be here, and also in what name; and I will endeavour to see you as soon after as I can. But direct to me, 'Post office, to be left till called for,' or the letter may not reach me. I must, however, for many reasons, earnestly request you will not come; and as I have, at very great inconvenience to myself, rendered you very considerable assistance, I really think I have some right to expect you will acquiesce in my wishes—it is not improbable but that I may be in London ere long, and would inform you if I am. I beg you will burn this after reading it.") This letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is also my writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Madam, I have just received your letter.

On no account let any one see my letters to you.")—I think this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at another</hi>) is mine—I have no recollection of what the latter part means—I should not say it was forged; the greater part of it is certainly genuine, if not the whole; I cannot account for the latter sentence of it, for I have no recollection of it at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did not you say about the clerk then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps being in a hurry I did not think of all those little things; I said I had refreshed my memory by the books, that was relative to the luncheon—the books are here, the clerk has them—the entries in them are not made by me, he books it from what I tell him—I left the hotel in May—I left of my own pleasure, the situation did not suit me, it was not exactly lucrative enough for me; and I left and went to Manchester, and am there now—Mrs. Hamblett came by the 12 o'clock omnibus, and left by the half past 3, or quarter to 4 omnibus, for the station—I do not know what distance Torquay is from Cheltenham; you cannot get there in half an hour—it is not likely if she was at our place at a quarter to 4 that she was at Cheltenham at 4, the train does not start till after 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You told us something you heard Mrs. Hamblett say, looking up at Mr. Price, "I did not think you would have served me so;" did you say that before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I answered all the questions put to me by the counsel, and I spoke and told what Mr. Price had said—I cannot say why</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185304040094"></xptr>
               <p>I did not tell what Mrs. Hamblett had said; I told the clerk who the luncheon was for, and he knew her; it was not entered by her name—the had been at the house twice before—entries had been made before—her name had been entered once out of twice—it is entered in Feb., but not in Jan.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know why the name was entered in Feb. and not in Jan? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Jan. we did not know her name, and in Feb. we learnt her name—she was there about three hours in Feb.—I am at the Clarence Hotel, Manchester, now, and am getting better wages; it is one of the largest hotels there—I am head waiter—I had not known the prisoner before Jan.—I had no conversation with her except just transacting my both ness—I sent a note to Mr. Price in Jan., and be came and met her, and again. in Feb., and again in April; and in Feb. I received a letter from her to tell Mr. Price she would not be there till next day—I have not received 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from her the whole three times—on the day this occurred I mentioned it to Lawless.</p>

                  </hi>. I am book-keeper, at Hoarder's Hotel, Torquay. I remember going out for a holiday in April, I was away for a week—I left about the 9th or 10th, and returned on the 16th—I recollect my attention being called to the room No. 8 on the following day by the waiter—I was coming from the desk to the passage, and the waiter called my attention to loud words in No. 8 room—I did not hear those loud words, but he told me something about high words passing between Mr. Price and the prisoner—I had seen the prisoner that day—I had seen her twice previous to that—she arrived by the mid-day train, and went to No. 3 room, which she had occupied formerly—I did not see Mr. Price—I booked a luncheon to the prisoner; this is my book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here is an entry, "No. 3. 17th April, sandwiches, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; bottle of soda water, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.")—I made that entry by the directions of the last witness, the waiter; and there can be no mistake about the date, you will see that I returned on the 16th by the difference in the handwriting.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By whose directions did you make these entries? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the waiter's; he told me it was for Mrs. Hamblett; I did not enter that—you will find by the book that we do not always put the names; the numbers of the rooms are sometimes put, and sometimes the names—sometimes we do not put the name if we know the people, but we put the room—I have made entries to Mrs. Hamblett before; I think I can show you three; twice I have put her name down, and once not—the last occasion was after the waiter had left—I cannot tell what time of day the entry was, but towards the afternoon—my attention was first drawn to this when I was summoned to the Court in Feb. last—I did not, after receiving the subpoena. examine the books; not until Mr. Kitson, the solicitor of Torquay, came down—I believe he received another letter after that, to search the books—(he sent his clerk to subpoena me)—he resides at Torquay, and came from his house to our place, and saw me on the subject—the first time was in Feb.—I had the books with me the first time I came to London—I first examined the books when I received the first subpoena. it was at Torquay, before I came to London—I brought them up with me, having found the entry about the sandwiches and soda water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you point out any former entry where Mrs. Hamblett's name is? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on 30th Jan., and on Feb. 2nd; it is No. 3—No. 3 is once without the name, and once with (<hi rend="italic">handing the book to Mr. Ribton</hi>)—there is no name to this entry, "Half a pint brandy, sandwiches, and bottle of stout"—on that occasion a party came with Mrs. Hamblett from Bristol, and she sent a message by the railway guard at the station that she could not attend that day.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, I find another entry on Feb. 2nd to Mrs. Hamblett; what is the use of potting her name here and No. 3 as well? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very often we know parties, and we book the name for the purpose of putting it into the small directory, which you will find—there is another entry in June, it is in the book you had first, it is about June 27th, I think; you will find it is No. 7 room there—I have been looking to find the number of times I have entered her name, and have turned the leaf down, so that I should not have the trouble after I came into Court—that entry of June 27th is the only time she occupied an up-stairs room—I hare two entries with her name to them, and two without; she has been there four times altogether—I believe she left by the afternoon train on 17th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you been in the employment at that hotel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Six years, keeping the books all the time—the attorney on the other side has been to me, and I gave him an opportunity of examining the books on Sunday morning—I pointed out the entries—I have no doubt that it was on the day that I have got it entered here, and on that day I saw Mrs. Hamblett come out of the omnibus and go into No. 3 room.</p>

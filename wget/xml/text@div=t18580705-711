On 30th Oct., I went to bed about 11 o'clock—I was the last person up—the premises were secure—I got up next morning at a little before 6 o'clock, and as I unlocked the shop door, it flew open; the lock was broken—I went into the shop and missed an immense quantity of goods, 100 pairs of boots and shoes, the shop was nearly stripped—I gave information, and found all the property at the station—I identify every pair.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab driver, of No. 10, Upper Cleveland Street. On 30th Oct., between 10 and 11 o'clock at night, I was on the stand in Tottenham Court Road, and saw the prisoner, who said that he had got a job for me, if I liked to wait—I went off with another fare, and came back about half past 12 or quarter to 1 o'clock, and saw him again with two others, who were tried in Nov.—they all got into my cab, and told me to drive down George Street; I did so as far as Charlotte Court—I stopped at the corner, and they all three got out, and went up the court, telling me to wait; in a short time they came back, and Moore and Johnson each had a bag—the third man who came back was very like the prisoner, but I could not see his features—I have known the prisoner, I should say, two years—Moore and Johnson told me to drive on, I asked them where, and they said, "Where you please"—the third man was not there, he went away—I ulti<lb></lb>mately drove them to my house, and kept the bag there, and they were to come and <hi rend="italic">liquidate</hi> it—they remained till 7 o'clock in the morning—I did not give the bag to any one, for Moore and Johnson, to my surprise, got into my house before I was up—I gave information to the police, and they took the bag.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, D</hi> 68). On the morning of 31st Oct., I was called to the prosecutor's shop, and found the inside door broken open, two locks forced, and the window cleared of all the boots and shoes—in conse<lb></lb>quence of something that was told me, I went to No. 10, Cleveland Street, and saw two bags of boots on the kitchen floor—I stayed there till a man named Johnson came—Moore also was taken, and was tried and convicted—on 28th June, in consequence of information I received, I apprehended the prisoner—I told him the charge, and he said, "I expected there was some-thing up."</p>

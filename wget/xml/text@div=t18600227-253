I am a corn chandler at 150, Houndsditch—the prisoner called on me about 17th January—I can't swear exactly to the date—he laid a book open on my counter and said, "Will you join your neighbours in subscribing towards the Consumption hospital in Victoria Park?"—I said I had not anything to spare, but would give him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he stood talking some time and induced me to give 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more, as he said I should have the privilege of sending two patients to the hospital, and likewise a book published by the society—a little time afterwards I met him coming out of a public-house; that raised my suspicions that it was not altogether correct, and I wrote to the secretary—in consequence of the answer I got, I met with him again, and gave him in custody—I should certainly not have given him the money unless I had believed he was an authorised collector for the hospital—he shewed me a book with various names and a seal attached, authorising him to Collect.</p>

               <p>rather strange for an institution of that sort to send out collectors without; con<lb></lb>sequently I would not give it to him unless I saw some of my neighbours that had subscribed—I don't know that I said anything about authority—he then said that pretty well all Bishopsgate-street subscribed—I said, "I know Bishopsgate-street pretty well, show me some of their names,"—he then said that he was not allowed to collect in the main streets but in the back streets—I said, "Well, I shall not give you my half-crown; there are many persons going about unauthorised, therefore I shall not give it to you unless you tell me some one you know that I know"—he named several persons, amongst others Mr. Moore, in our street, whom I know well—I said, "I know him well, and if Mr. Moore knows you I will give you my half-crown"—I went with him to Mr. Moore—Mr. Moore said that he knew him, and knew his name to be Elstob—I went back again home with him, gave him my half-crown, and caused him to give me a receipt on a piece of paper which I tendered to him—the officer has it—he told me he was very much obliged to me for speaking about the receipt, and he would speak to the secretary and I have a receipt—I believed him to be an authorised collector—I would not have given him the half-crown unless I had believed it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 54). I took the prisoner into custody; I found that book on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> This is entirely a misunderstanding on the part of these witnesses; there has never been any book different from that, as is evident from the fact that I was collecting at the very time I was given in charge, and that book was with me. There was another book that Mr. Wallis, a friend of mine, had, similar to that: this book was given to these parties at every shop I went into; there are only three here, but there are hundreds of others who can come forward; they had every opportunity of reading it, and it is not likely I should ask any persons to put their names to a thing without they had every opportunity of seeing what it was. I have written and published a work, and I was collecting the publishing expenses by subscription, and intended to give the proceeds of the work between the two Consumptive hospitals. I had a reason for giving it to them, and I will just read this over to you, "For the benefit of the Consumptive hospitals in Victoria Park and Brompton; "that was all they read, and they ran away with the idea that they had subscribed to the Brompton hospital; whereas if they had read the whole they would have seen what they had subscribed to. It says what it was for: "Towards the defraying the expenses of printing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186002270004"></xptr>
               <p>and publishing a work written by Dryden Elstob, for the benefit of these hospitals; to be published by Mr. Cockerell, of Leadenhall-street." He has the manuscript of the work now. "Subscriptions earnestly requested, the profits of which are to be equally divided between the above institutions. "The work is entitled, "John Wolsey's Confessions on the day of the National Humiliation;" a copy free to each subscriber. Thomas Wallis is the only person authorised by me to receive subscriptions, and persons subscribing 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and upwards, may have a copy. The above institutions have no en<lb></lb>dowment, and the object of the donor is to benefit them—Dryden Elstob, author, and donor." The questions they put to me I answered with respect to my own work. "Are you a collector?" "Yes." They had only read the top line; I meant, "a collector for my work." All the questions they put to me were in relation to my book: it is not likely I should have walked into a person's shop and asked them to enter their name down for anything. It is not likely I should tell them it was something quite different from what was actually before their eyes. There are lots of gentlemen's names in that book that have subscribed pounds; they knew very well what it was for; it was all through their not reading and knowing what they were putting their names down for. The fact is they have subscribed to this work; they might put their name to a bill of exchange in the very same sort of way, and then away afterwards that they did not know they had done it.</p>

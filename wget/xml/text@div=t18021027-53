             sworn. - On the 18th of September the prisoner was brought to the watch-house on suspicion of stealing the tea-spoons; she was detained till Monday, and taken before the Magistrate, where she confessed she had pledged the spoons; the Magistrate gave a summons to Mr. Morritt, where she said she had pawned them; I went to the pawnbroker's with a duplicate for a tea-spoon and a shift, and found the tea-spoon; next morning the prisoner gave me two spoons herself. - (Produces the duplicate and tea-spoon.)</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner, at No. 2, Webb-street, on the 18th of September, at night, upon suspicion of stealing a pair of ear-rings, and the spoons; she said, the ear-rings were given her, and as to the spoons, she knew nothing of them; I took her to the watch-house, where I left her. (The spoons were produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The prosecutrix lent me spoons at different times, and I pledged many things for her at different times, but I was not to pledge them in her name, least her husband should find it out; she used to get tipsey, and make me so, that I did not know what I did.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character. <rs id="t18021027-53-verdict292" type="verdictDescription">

            . I lost the sheep mentioned in the indictment, from out of a meadow facing my house. I enquired next morning of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050010"></xptr> turnpike-man in the road to London; he told me a man on horseback and a boy went through the turnpike about twelve o'clock with some sheep. I found the sheep at Islington, in Mr. Stanton's the salesman's custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How were your sheep marked?</p>
               <p>Ware. They were marked with a W and an O on the near side, and a dot of tar upon the near hip. The prisoner told me at the Compter that he stole them out of a meadow opposite my house.</p>

            . I am a salesman. About seven o'clock on Friday morning I went to my pens in Smithfield. The prisoner had put the sheep into my pens. I told him he must take them out. He asked me what he must do with them. I asked him whose sheep they were; he said he brought them from Chatham, or somewhere in the Kentish road. I asked him if he had any letter from the owner, or any body's name that was to sell them; he said, You shall sell them. I asked whose they were; he said a man he met with on the road bid him drive them there: and when they were sold, a woman would come and take the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the name of the person.</p>
               <p>Stanton. No; he stood at the pens. I went and asked some other salesman if they knew any thing of the sheep; they did not. The prisoner stood there near three quarters of an hour. The prisoner slipt away towards Porter's Block. A person I had desired to watch him, secured him, and brought him to me. I suspected from the first that they were stolen. He was in several different stories; first, that he had a father; then, that he had none; that his mother lived at Camberwell. The prisoner escaped from the person I left him in the care of. We found him by St. George's Church, and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think such a boy as this could steal so many sheep himself?</p>
               <p>Stanton. No; it is plain he did not.</p>

            . I was sent for on the the twenty-third of last month to the Three Tuns in Smithfield, to take charge of the prisoner. He said he brought the sheep from the nineteenth mile-stone near Gravesend. I asked him if any body was concerned with him, he said, Yes; a man he had never seen in his life before, who was to give him a shilling for driving them to town. He said he wished he could see his mother, for then it would be make up in a quarter of an hour. I asked him if she had been in Smithfield; he said, Yes; we walked twice round Smithfield, but could not find her. He said the man came with him as far as St. George's Church, and then gave him a groat or eight-pence to hire another lad to help him to drive them to Smithfield. He said the person that employed him lived at Camberwell. Sometimes he said it was his father, sometimes not. We enquired at Camberwell, and found there was such a person as he had described, who was a smuggler, but he had absconded.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>A woman at the Three Crowns at Chatham sent a letter to my mother that I could get employment there to draw beer. I went down in the Gravesend boat, and went to Chatham. I thought the place was too grand, and I too little to do; so I went to Gravesend again, I was sick a-going down, so I thought I would walk up. About a mile from Gravesend I met this man. He asked me how far I was going. I told him to London. He said he would gave me a shilling to drive some sheep for him. He gave me some gin; then he went down a little road. He was on horseback. He went down in a field, and told me, if I saw any body a-coming, to come down and meet him; if not, I was to turn the sheep to London. When he came to the turnpikes, the men asked him how many he had got; he said, sixty-three. He parted from me in Kent-street. He gave me my shilling, and four-pence to hire a boy to help me to drive them to Smithfield. He told me to give them to any salesman to sell, and meet him at one o'clock on London bridge.</p>

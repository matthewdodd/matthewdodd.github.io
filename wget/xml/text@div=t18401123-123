                  </hi>. I am a silversmith, and live in Judd-street. I have seen Clarke at my shop about three times—he brought a tea-spoon to sell about three months ago—he said he worked fur Mr. Cubitt, the builder, and he had found it in the drain—he said he lived in Cromer-street—I bought it of him. About a month after he brought either a spoon or a fork, which I bought, believing his first statement. He came a third time, on a Saturday, about five weeks ago, with two or three spoons, which I bought—I had not seen him then for six weeks or two months—he described that they were what he and the other had found in the drain—I paid him about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for all the things I bought—there certainly was not any thing rubbed off the first spoon that I made so much inquiry about, or I must have seen it—I was busy at the time he brought the last articles, and quite alone in the shop—when the officer came and inquired whether</p>

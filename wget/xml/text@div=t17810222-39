On the 29th of January, two looking-glasses stood upon a mahogany bureau in our shop, near a bulk; I lost one of them; that caused me to set a watch. The next night towards the evening the prisoner came on the outside of the shop windows, which were open; he reached over the bulk and took the glass off the bureau. I gave a great scream. He carried it about six yards, and then set it down. I ran about four doors after him; other people pursued him.</p>

               <p>I am fifteen years old; I am servant to Mr. Thompson. I stood behind the shop-door in the dark, and saw the prisoner take the glass off the bureau. My mistress stood behind some bedsteads. She screamed out and presently after cried out stop thief! I ran out immediately; the prisoner laid the glass down gently at a door about six yards distance, and ran on. I pursued him; he was never out of my sight but when he turned the corner to the place where he was taken. I can swear to his face; it was not a dark night, and I stood in a dark corner, therefore I could see him who stood in the light.</p>

At the end of the street there is a broad turning that goes into a garden; there is a gate to the garden; there I took him. The boy came up and said this is the man who took the glass. The prisoner said, I will go with you, do not let the boys make a noise. And he walked back quietly.</p>

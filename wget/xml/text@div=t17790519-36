             sworn.</p>
               <p>Was you the driver of the waggon? - Yes; I was coming along with the waggon. I was in the waggon between Sunday night and Monday morning. Between the 17th and 18th of April, at about twelve at night, when I was about a mile on this side of Acton, I saw a man take a flat of butter up.</p>
               <p>When you say a man do you mean to say the prisoner? - The prisoner is the man; he had his hair on then. It had fallen out of the waggon. The waggon went over it, and I saw him pick it up after the wheel had gone over it.</p>
               <p>You did not see him take it out of the waggon? - No; I did not see it till I saw him take it up. He went across the road with it.</p>
               <p>Did you see him take any thing else? - No; nothing else.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the man before? - I never saw him till the moment I saw him pick the flat of butter up.</p>
               <p>You do not know how the flat got out of the waggon? - The tilt cloth of the waggon, and the rope that tied the butter on, were cut, and it was got out of the side, the butter must fall out, or be pulled out.</p>
               <p>How long before this happened had you observed the tilt and rope tight? - I did not observe any thing of it till I saw him take up the flat of butter and run away.</p>
               <p>If the rope had been cut before would the butter have fallen out? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Could the waggon have travelled a quarter of an hour after it was cut without its falling out? - I do not know when the hole was cut; it might have gone some way after it was cut. As soon as I saw him take the flat of butter, I pursued him; he kicked the flat of butter into a ditch, and ran across the road into the foot path; I got on my horse and rode back to meet two other waggoners, to ask them to assist me; he ran on till I got before him; then the prisoner turned back, and jumped through a gap in the hedge; my horse jumped almost from under me and threw me in the foot-path; I pursued him through the gap and knocked him down with my whip; he got up and I struck at him again; I heard a rusling in the hedge; I thought he had somebody with him that might do me a mischief; he ran over some wheat fields and hid himself in a furrow; just at that time the Buckingham waggoner came up, and we went after him, and took him.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the box that had the watches in it? - I did not know what was in one flat more than another, but when the wheel went over the flat it crushed the box of watches in the flat; the watches were in the flat with the butter, it was directed to our book-keeper.</p>
               <p>Did you ever loose sight of the man after he took the butter up? - He was never out of sight till I came up with him; I passed him just before I met the waggons; I called to the waggoners to help me, upon which he turned back and jumped through the hedge.</p>
               <p>Did you see the flat of butter in the waggon? - I saw it in the waggon; I put it in myself at Bicester.</p>

             halloo'd out for assistance; he said somebody had robbed the waggon; I was on horseback; he said he was gone over into the fields; we followed him and took him, and tied him, and then we went and found the flat of butter on the near side, about two poles farther in the ditch; I found another; he said he had lost three; I went farther and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190050"></xptr> found another on the foot-path; we took him to Acton-Bottom to the house of one Mr. Whitehead, who said he knew him, and that he went from his house at six o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>To Hawkins. How large are these flats of butter? - I do not know how big they were.</p>
               <p>Atkins. There was about six dozen of butter in a flat.</p>
               <p>How far was he gone after he took up the butter before you pursued him? - About eight yards.</p>

               <p>I was at Mr. Whitehead's; I got a little beer, and was rather disturbed in my head; I went into the fields and lay down; these men came into the field and struck me over my head, and cut my head all to pieces. I know nothing of it; I am as innocent as the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Jury to Hawkins. Did you take him with the butter on his back? - No, he threw it into the ditch, and ran across the road into the foot-path; he was never out of my sight till I took him; he is the man I saw pick it up, and run across the road.</p>

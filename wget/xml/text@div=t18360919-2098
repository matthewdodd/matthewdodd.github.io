                  </hi>. I live at Hoxton. On Wednesday, the 31st of August I was in the tap room of the Rosemary Branch, at Islington, and saw the prisoner sitting in the tap-room drinking—he went form the tap-room to where they clean the pots, and returned in two or three minutes with a quart pot under his arm—it was wrapped up in something—I told Williamson and he went after him and brought a quart pot back, and placed it on the tap-room table—he went a second time and brought two pints and one quart back with him, and put them in the place where they clean the pots. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

                  </hi> I was the Rosemary Branch—in consequence of what Medcalf said I went after the prisoner, and found him on the bridge, about 100 yards off, with a parcel under his arm—I asked him what he had got there—he said he had nothing at first, but afterwards gave me a pot, and began to cry—I said it was very foolish to do any thing of the kind, and he had better go home—I took the pot from him, took it back into the tap-room, and put it on the table—in consequence of what was said to me I went after him again in about two minutes, and found him in Branch-place, by the side of the canal—he had two pint pots in his hand, and one quart he gave me out of his pocket—I felt about him clothes and found nothing—the quart pot was bruised and flattened which he had in his pocket—I brought them back to the Rosemary Branch, took them through the tap-room, and put them on the table in the pot<lb></lb>shed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined Q.</hi> Did anything more take place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes. I pressed him to go home when I took the three pots from him, but he went to jump in the canal—I took hold of his coat and pulled him back—he was crying about his daughter, who had been drowned about a week before—he said he had lost his only child, that he loved, and did not seem to know hardly what he was about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable.

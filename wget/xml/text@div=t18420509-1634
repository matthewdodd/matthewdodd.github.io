                  </hi>. I am a constable employed in the East and West India Docks, which is within the port of London. On the morning of the 5th of May, about half-past nine, I saw the prisoner coming out of the export entrance of the East India Dock—I asked him what he had about him as I thought he looked rather bulky—he said, "Nothing"—I searched him, and found a new pair of shoes, one on each side of him, between his skin and his shirt, also a blue frock, and a flannel shirt—he had three shirts on, and it was a very hot day indeed—I asked him about the shoes—he said a person on board the <hi rend="italic">Bucephalus</hi> gave them to him—I took him on board the ship—I saw a person on deck who said in the prisoner's presence they believed there was a person crying out below that they had lost a pair of shoes—he said nothing to that.</p>

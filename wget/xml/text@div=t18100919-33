            . Q. In the month of August last, were you in possession of a mare - A. Yes. On the 22d of August, I saw the prisoner at Mr. Hammond's house, in <placeName id="t18100919-33-crimeloc183">Worship-street</placeName>

The landlord introduced Mr. Shorter to me, and then Shorter said, I will buy your mare; I asked for the mare, cart, chaise, and harness, sixty five pound; he said, that he had not got the money, but I was going into the baking business again in the city, and coals would be as useful to me as the money. It was perfectly understood, that I was to have the goods before he had the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what was said - A. He said, I was to have the coals the next day, that he had bought them of Horn and Devey. I was not to deliver the mare until I had the value.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time where was your mare - A. In Mr. Cowell's stables, the mare was that night, that was the 22d of 
               <persName id="t18100919-33-person312">August. Early</persName>
             the next morning Mr. Cowell came to me, he gave me some information, and before I got to the stable the mare was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he gave you any intimation of his coming to take away the mare - A. No, nor had I given him any permission to do it. I met the prisoner, after having been seeking for him in Worship-street, between two and three of the same day. I said, Shorter, you have taken away my mare; he said, d - n your eyes I do not know what you mean, I have sold her, he said it was his mare. I sent for an officer, and he was taken to the office.</p>

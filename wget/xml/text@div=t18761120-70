               <p>—we were quartered, on 11th October, at Fort Burgoyne, Dover—on that evening I was returning from town up by Doriston Place—I had been to several public-houses; the Saracen's Head, Beacon Street, was the last one; I saw several soldiers there, two of them were the prisoners; I left about nine o'clock; the two prisoners and others left at the same time; they went up the Old Castle Hill; I turned into an entry or passage to make water-while there I heard a shout towards the hill, I saw several soldiers round the prosecutor—the passage is about 30 yards from the lamp—the soldiers were beyond the lamp, going up the hill—I ran up to assist him and I saw something like a watch glitter on the prosecutor's waistcoat—I indentify the prisoners as two of the soldiers—I saw Prendergast struggling with the prosecutor—the men then ran down the hill towards me; I tried to stop them; they struck me against the wall and ran on towards the town—the prosecutor came running down and seized me; he said "I have been robbed, you are one of them and must come up to Fort Burgoyne "—I explained that I was not one of them, but was in the passage and tried to stop the men as they ran down the hill; I said if he would come with me to Fort Burgoyne I would give him the names of the prisoners—I have not the least doubt of their identity—one belongs to "F "and the other to "G "com<lb></lb>pany; I belong to "J "company—at Fort Burgoyne I was brought face to face with the prisoners in the guardroom—I was detained there till the prisoners were brought in—the officer asked me if I could identify the men; I identified both of them, and Prendergast then made a kick at my thigh, and if one of the guards had not kept him off it would have hurt me seriously.</p>

Prendergast says: "</hi> I was going home about 9.20 last night, when I saw that gentleman and several soldiers; there was a woman in his company, and when I got to him he was lying on the ground. He was drunk and could not stand at all, and I saw the watch on the ground close to him, and I picked it up and put it in my pocket. I then went up to the Fort, and the sergeant of my com<lb></lb>pany ordered two men to take me to the guard-room, and while I was going I threw the watch away." <hi rend="italic">Jennings says:</hi>"Last night I was coming home to Fort Burgoyne, about 9.15; I had been in company with Prender<lb></lb>gast. We were coming home and had got as far as the Plough. I asked if he would have anything to drink. He said * No.' I then went in and had something myself. Prendergast went in and I overtook him where this scuffle was, that gentleman was drunk with his hat on the back of his Bead shouting. There was a lot of more soldiers pushing him about. I said to rendergast' Come on home; it's no use staying here.' We started a few paces and came up the hill. I heard him shout 'Help! picket!' There were some few more men of ours coming up the hill, and when they heard the gentleman shout they cried 'Holloa! what's the matter here Pren-' dergast ran away and I followed him, and I heard that gentleman say 'I have lost a 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. watch.' As soon as I heard that I went round to Fort Burgoyne. I got to bed and the sergeant of the guard and an escort, after I had been in bed a quarter of an hour, came and said 'Get up and dress.' I asked him what for. He said * I don't know. The adjutant has ordered you to be confined." When I got to the guard-room I saw Prendergast there. The adjutant and officer were talking to a gentleman like the prosecutor. I said to the sergeant 'Do you mind letting me speak to the officer to know what I have been confined for.' He said 'No, you will have to stop in the guard-room.' He took me into the cells and locked me up. At 12 o'clock, a policeman came and opened the door and said he should have to take me in custody with some more for robbing a man. I said 'I know nothing about it.' He locked me up."</p>

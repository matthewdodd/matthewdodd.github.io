On Wednesday evening, 13th Sept, the prisoner came to our shop for half—an—ounce of tobacco—I served him; he gave me half a crown—I kept it in my hand, gave him the change, and then went round the counter and saw him running up the street—I ran to the back door, and gave the half crown to my mother—on Saturday, 16th Sept., the prisoner came again for half an ounce of tobacco, and offered me half a crown—I found that it was bad, and said, "You came here on Wednesday night, and gave me another"—he said "No," and that if I would allow him to go he would pay for the tobacco—I said, "No," and screamed out—the next door neighbour, Henry Rogers, came, and I gave him the half crown—the prisoner was there only about two minutes the first time, but I recognised him when he came on the Saturday, and that made me look at the half crown.</p>

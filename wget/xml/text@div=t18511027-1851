                  </hi>. I keep the Globe beer-shop, Macclesfield-street, City-road. On Thursday, 2nd Oct., I received a counterfeit shilling—I do not know from whom—the person said he did not know it was bad; that be got it for holding a horse—I had given him change—I said if he did not give it me back I would send for a policeman—he gave me back the change—I gave the shilling to the officer.</p>

On 2nd Oct I received information from Mr. Miller; in consequence of that I went in pursuit of a person—Burgin pointed out the person who had uttered the shilling, but that person I did not succeed in taking; he made his escape—he had been in company with the prisoner and another—the prisoner ran away when he saw me—I pursued, and saw him stopped; he was given over to me—I took him to the station—he asked what he had done—I told him he would know when he got to the station—I found on him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good silver, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 51/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, a half-pint mug, a little brush, a little sticking-plaster, and a street-door key—I produce this shilling—I got it from Mr. Miller.</p>

I saw Mills in pursuit of the pri<lb></lb>soner—I saw the prisoner as he ran let this piece of rag fall, with four bad shillings in it—he stooped, and dropped it down a flat area, or grating, that goes over the foot-path—I did not go down the area, but the lady of the house saw me across the window, and gave me this rag up—I am sure what she gave me up was what the prisoner put down—it was given up to me in the state it was put down—I found in it four bad shillings, done up singly.</p>

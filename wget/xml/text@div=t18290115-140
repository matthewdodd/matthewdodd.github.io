            . I am a modeller. I was going from my dinner, and saw the prisoner with the boots; Mrs. Morgan came to the door, and cried Thief! and desired me to go after him; I lost sight of him for about a minute, and as I lost sight of him he threw them into an area; I am sure I saw him take them from the door of the shop: I saw them taken out of the area about a minute afterwards - I took him directly, and gave him into custody; the boots were then brought up: he went down Davis-street, Robert-street, and was taken in Thomas-street.</p>

            . Q. When did you see the boy first? A. I was coming down Oxford-street, and I saw him coming down the step of Mr. Morgan's door, with the boots in his hand, putting them under his jacket; Mrs. Morgan came to the door, and cried Stop thief! and she desired me to stop him - I went after him, and am positive of his person - he was two or three doors from the area when I took him.</p>

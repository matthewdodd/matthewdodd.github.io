On the 29th of April, about a quarter past one o'clock in the morning, I and my wife were a bed; she alarmed me, I got out, listened, and heard somebody in the house. I knocked at the door, and called my man. I then heard a noise, as if some person was making his way out of the house. I went and looked through my back-room window, and saw the prisoner go over the wall. I went to the front window, and told the watchman some person had been in the house, and was coming out of the next passage. He was at last stopped by another watchman, brought back, and taken to the watch-house. My property was not found on him. I am sure he is the man - I remember him particularly; he had a red waistcoat. I noticed his handkerchief and face as he got over the wall; he would then come into the yard of another house, which is let out in lodgings, and the passage door is open continually - that yard belongs to two houses. He came out of the second house; both of them are lodging-houses - it was moon-light; I saw no one else. When the watchman came back I found he had entered at the back door, which I saw Godfrey fasten when I went to bed (he is not here). It was fastened with two bolts, one of which was broken off and laid on the ground, the other was wrenched off and hung on a nail; there were marks of a crow-bar on the door. I lost a watch, which hung on the mantle-piece in the kitchen - I wound it up at half-past ten o'clock at night; I have not seen it since. Next day I saw the watchman compare the marks with a crow-bar which Passoway had.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I know Eustace's house is in St. Andrew's, Holborn, Middlesex. I heard him call out that somebody was at his back door. I ran under his window, and heard him call out,</p>
               <p>"Tom! Tom! somebody has broken into the house!" I immediately heard some person jump apparently off the wall - I also heard tiles rattle and glass break. Eustace called out of the first-floor window, and said</p>
               <p>"Watch! watch! somebody is getting over the wall, go into the next-yard!" I ran immediately to the next door to the prosecutor's, thinking he would come out there, but instead of that the prisoner came out of the next door. I struck at him with my stick, and saw him with the crow-bar in his hand. I pursued as fast as I could, and called out,</p>
               <p>"Clark, stop him!" He ran towards Fleet-market on the right-hand; Clark came out of his box and the prisoner knocked him down. He turned down White's-yard, and down a court, I immediately followed him; he ran into a house, and I found him in the passage up two pair of stairs in White's-yard - he could not get into any room - I saw him run in at the door; I secured him. He said,</p>
               <p>"What the b - dy h - ll do you want of me?" I said I would let him know, and brought him away. I sent Karl up stairs, he brought the crow-bar down. I took him to the watch-house. He was searched in my presence, and a dark lanthorn, a phosphorus box, and a candle were found on him I did not compare the crow-bar with the marks on the door-way - Nailor, the constable of the night, took care of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Eustace first called out to you for help - A. Yes. I heard his wife call to him three or four times. He said at the watch-house he was certain of the prisoner being the man, by his waistcoat, and that he saw the side of his face and his handkerchief. The house is in the liberty of Saffron-hill, in the parish of St. Andrew Holborn.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 29th of April I heard an alarm, and saw somebody running towards me into White's-yard, which is no thoroughfare. I pursued - Passoway was on before me; he ran up the staircase, and I saw him brought down. I went up immediately afterwards, and found the crow-bar on the top step of the stairs, where he stood. It was two pair of stairs high. I was not near enough to say he was the person I saw running. I delivered the crow-bar to Boyce.</p>

             re-examined. It is the crow-bar that was compared - I think Passoway compared it. It was at the time they called for me to go and appear against the prisoner. I observed that it fitted the marks - I saw Barnley and Nailor fit it to the marks; they are not here. The purchase is about a quarter of an inch.

               <p>"Run out, there is something the matter!" The watchman made a blow at me as I ran. I remained in White's-yard ten minutes before he took me.</p>

            . I am a vellum-binder. I work for Mr. Thomas, in Cornhill - my sister Elizabeth married the prisoner in 1809, at St. Olave, Southwark - I was present and saw them married; I signed the register - he was then a shoemaker - my sister had been in service and left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060105"></xptr>her place to marry him; he lived with her about six months, when she was so ill-treated that she left him and went to service, because he would not support her; she died at the end of last July.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not your sister change her name? A. Yes; while she was in service she took the name of Groves: Mr. Groves was a tailor- he is dead I believe; they lived together as man and wife about seven years.</p>

            . The prisoner married me on the 20th of October, 1823, at St. Matthew's, Bethnalgreen. I had been in service, and left it to marry him - I had known him from the July before; I had no fortune; he behaved very far from well to me - I was never happy - we had no children; no one told me to bring forward this case, but I heard he had another wife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your mother here? A. Yes; I recollect the prisoner going to the police-office with my mother - it was to inquire whether his wife was dead; he said he had not seen her for nine years; I had no suspicion that he was married when I married him.</p>

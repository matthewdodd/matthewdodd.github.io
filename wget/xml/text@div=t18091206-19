               <p>Q. Had you your money loose in your pocket. - A. My money was wrapped up in a bit of linen in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you saw the prisoner how much money had you. - A. I had sixteen half Joes, fourteen guineas, fifteen shillings, and a one pound bank note in my pocket book, that was all the money I had, and when the prisoner was gone, I had two half joes remaining. I lost all my money but two half Joes. The landlord went for a constable; I got some of my money again.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH CHRISTOPHER. I am a publican.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in your house where these people were drinking - A. Yes. On the 16th of November Westwell was in my house, in the evening. I remember seeing the prisoner, he was sitting near Westwell. The prosecutor told me he treated the prisoner with three half quarterns of gin. He told me he was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner by at that time - A. He was in the house, but not by at the time. I wrote a note, and gave it to the prosecutor to go to Lambeth-street office and bring an officer with him. When he came back he told me he could not find the office, and he had lost the note; he was a good deal in liquor. I then sent for a constable, and described the person of the prisoner to him, the prisoner was then gone. The constable returned and told me he could not find him. My wife came in about a quarter of an hour after the constable was gone. I left my wife in the bar, and went with the constable to the Bee-hive public house, and found him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this be after the prosecutor had told you that that the prisoner had robbed him - A. An hour and a half. We found him there in company with another man. We took them in custody, and searched them at the watch-house. On the prisoner we found in his jacket one half joe; it is the value of 1 l. 16 s. We continued searching him; he said, so help his God he had no more. I observed his shoe being off (he had only one shoe, he is a cripple). I was going to take his shoe up, the prisoner picked up his shoe himself, he turned the shoe topsy turvy; I laid hold of his hand, as also did the constable, and found twelve half joes in his hand that had held the shoe. The watch-house keeper took his protection box out of his pocket, and found a one pound bank note and a sixpence was found on him.</p>

            . Q. You are the constable that had the prisoner in charge - A. Yes; I took him to the watch-house, we searched his pocket and found one half joe. While I was searching him I saw him slip his shoe off, he took it up and turned the twelve half joes in his hand, then he let the shoe fall; I saw he had twelve half joes in his hand. The watch-house keeper found a one pound note in his protection box; afterwards we found a six-pence. The other man was locked up, he had three hearings, he had this man's watch, we found nothing else on him.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WEBB. Q. You keep the watch-house, do you - A. Yes; I was present on this search. I found the protection box on the place where we take the charges. It was put there by Mr. Cooper or the other man when they took the money from the prisoner. I found a one pound note in the protection box. The box was not on the table before they came in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was my own property. I went into this public house, this man came and knocked up against my foot, I pushed him off, and he struck me; then four Portuguese struck him; after that he came to me, he said I know I am in the wrong; Westwell put his hand in his pocket and gave me some money. I never looked at it, but put it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never gave him any money.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the man that you laid hold of when you awoke - A. Yes, and the rest of people pushed me about; they said I should not impose upon a cripple.</p>

She slipped her hand to my pocket, and took out my watch, and ran away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all the conversation you had with her ?</p>
               <p>Forsholm. I had no more conversation with her; she ran away into another alley, and I lost sight of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any weapon in her hand?</p>
               <p>Forsholm. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you put in fear?</p>
               <p>Forsholm. I was afraid somebody else might be thereabouts; so I went to the Lion in Piccadilly, and staid there till morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she demand your Watch or any thing besides of you?</p>
               <p>Forsholm. No, she did not; but took it slily away.</p>

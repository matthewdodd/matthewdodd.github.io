                  </hi>. I am a linendraper, in Holborn. On the evening of 9th March, I locked up the shop secure in every way from 10 to half past 10 o'clock; I live in the house—on going down in the morning, I found that the shop had been broken open by the glass being removed from a skylight at the back; I found a quantity of, shawls, handkerchiefs, and hosiery taken away, worth nearly 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a rope had been fastened to a bar in the skylight, and the party committing the robbery had let himself down by the rope into the shop; none of the articles have been recovered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in service, at No. 174, High Holborn, nearly opposite Mr. Maddox's house. On the morning of 10th March, about 6 o'clock I was opening the parlour shutters on the first floor, and saw two young women walking from Museum-street down Holborn—I saw the prisoner open the door of Mr. Maddox's shop and look up and down the street, the two females then walked by him, and each of them took a bundle from him—he handed one bundle to one, and one to the other as they walked by the shop door, and they walked on; he then came out with a third bundle under his arm, and walked after them—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person—I had never seen him before—I thought nothing of this till about an hour afterwards, when I heard of the robbery.</p>

In consequence of information I apprehended the prisoner on 12th March, and took him to the station—there were several other men there with him—the witness, Palmer, was brought into the place, and I asked her to look round and see if she could point out the man who she saw come out of the shop door, and she pointed to the prisoner out of eight persons; she did not do so directly—she looked round for about a minute or perhaps two minutes, and then pointed him out.</p>

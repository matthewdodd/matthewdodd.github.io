                  </hi>. The prisoner is my father—he lives at No. 4, George-row, Bunhill-row. On a Tuesday I was out, and my father found me and beat me home—he kicked me about my legs, and when I got home he cut me with a great whip which went right round me—it cut me in the eye, and gave me a black eye—he then chained me down—he drove a staple behind the door, and put the chain in the staple, and chained my legs with two padlocks—this was on Tuesday night, and I was left chained down for twenty-four hours naked—the tightness of the chains hurt my ankles very much—the blood was ready to start—the policeman found me there and took me to the station—I had bread and water while I as confined.</p>

                  </hi>. I was playing, and a little boy came and told Mr. Bishop that he could not find her Billy—that he had left him in Golden-lane—Mr. Bishop went out and found him, and began to tick him in a most dreadful manner—the constable came up and took him a little way, and then let him go, and Mr. Bishop struck him and gave him a cut with the whip.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of Police. I went and found the boy with the chain twisted twice round each leg, and his arms pinioned behind him, and two padlocks on the chain—I asked his father how he came to do such a thing—he said he could do nothing with the boy—his legs were excoriated and the blood starting from them—he was naked all but his shirt—his father said he had left the key up stairs with the landlord, that his wife might not let the boy go.</p>

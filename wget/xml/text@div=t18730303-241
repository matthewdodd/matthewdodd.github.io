                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman T</hi> 190). On the night of 25th January I was at Heston, at a few minutes before 11 o'clock—as I was coming up Church Lane I heard a female's voice scream out—I could not understand what it was—I came a-top of the lane, and saw the prisoner and Beckett dragging a woman along—each had an arm, her head was leaning forward, and each of them had her by the arm, under the arm-pits—she was helplessly drunk; she had no use in her legs at all—it was very dark; I turned my light on them, and asked where they were going to take her to—the prisoner said "To New Heston, at the back of the Queen's Head"—I Baid "Don't drag the woman along like that; here are two of you, carry her home"—that was opposite Mr. Spooner's, the clergyman's—they then picked her up, to carry her—the prisoner said "You b----, I will pay you for getting like this in the morning"—she muttered out something about the New Cut, or some street in London, but I could not understand what she said, she seemed so drunk—she was very quiet; I never heard a bad word come out of her mouth—she did not say more than that—I did not know who she was—I thought, after those threats, he might ill-use her on the road, so I followed at a distance behind them—I followed them to the cottage where the prisoner lived, which was up a yard, at the end house—there are four or five houses in the yard—from the time I spoke to them the prisoner and Beckett carried her along, but the prisoner carried her on his back some little distance—that was before they approached the house—they were both carrying her as they approached the house—they carried her up to the door—I can't say what took place at the door; I did not go up to the door; everything seemed quiet, and I went about 50 yards on—I did not hear anything—I was there about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I did not see the door opened before I went away; I saw them up against the door—they saw me—I had my lantern, and followed down close behind them—they knew I was following them—I did not hear anything at the door—the prisoner was sober; he did not appear to have had liquor, he seemed sober and quiet—he never offered to ill-use the woman—Beckett was the worse for drink; he was <hi rend="italic">staggery</hi> drunk; he could not walk straight—he assisted in carrying the woman—I did not see anything take place at the door—I heard the prisoner and Beckett wish one another good night, and Beckett went on towards Heston Church, to go home—I was about 50 yards off.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> After giving them the advice, I followed close behind them; at times I was about a yard from them, and sometimes a little further—I did not see any rough handling—the prisoner took her on his back, <hi rend="italic">pic-a-back</hi>, with her arms over his neck—he carried her in that way very near to the Queen's Head; that would be within 15 or 20 yards of his house—he carried her about 100 yards in that way—he handled her tenderly—I did not say before the Magistrate that the prisoner had been drinking; he did not seem to be the worse for drink at all—I could not tell whether</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, residing at Langton—on 25th January last, at eight o'clock, I went to the Old George—I stopped till half-past 10—I saw Mrs. Westwood there when I came out of the tap-room at half-past 10—I did not know her before—she was standing leaning against the bar—I did not leave till the house closed, which was about 11 o'clock—she went out first—when I got outside the prisoner bad got hold of her round the shoulders, holding her up, he said she was helpless, she could mot stand, and asked me to assist her—I did not see anything happen to her outside the public-house—I assisted him to carry her—we did not carry her at first; one had hold of one arm and one the other; he was on her left side and I on the right; we took her along in that way as well as we could—she seemed quite helpless; she could not stand on her legs—after we had gone some distance I saw the policeman Thompson; we had not done anything to hurt her before Thompson came up—we never hurt her in the least—Thompson wished us to catch hold of her and carry her bodily up—we attempted to do that, and we did carry her some distance—I did not hear the prisoner say anything to her about paying her out, or anything to that effect; if he did say so I did not notice it—I had hold of her shoulders and the prisoner had hold of her legs, and we carried her part of the way like that; after that the prisoner carried her on his back—when we approached his house we were both carrying her—when we got to the door the prisoner and I together stood her up by the side of the wall close to the door, because the door was not open—he called out—Whitebread, the lodger, came down and opened the door—I let go of her and left her to her husband, and stepped back a little way—as soon as the door was unfastened the prisoner reached out to push the door back, and he let go of her, and I was not close enough to stop her, and she fell—I saw her fall; she fell on her back in the court—the court is paved a little way along in front of the houses with bricks, and some of them are rather rough, some of them are rather larger than others, and some worn down more; there are varieties in the surface—she fell on the part that is paved with bricks—as soon as the door was opened the prisoner picked her up—I did not assist; I was going to do so, but he said he would pick her up; I was close to him—he carried her indoors before him, turned himself round and pulled her a little way up the floor, and laid her down on her back on the floor, and then he put the couch ready, and he catched hold of her two shoulders and pulled her up on the couch—she might lie on the floor a minute, it was a very short time—as soon as he got the couch ready he put her on—Whitebread caught hold of her legs as the prisoner lifted her up on the couch by her head and shoulders—she cried out once opposite the parson's house—I could not understand much that she said, it was something about Blackfriars' Road; and the prisoner said to her "Don't make a noise, we are opposite to the parson's house, you will disturb them"—I did not hear her speak while the prisoner and Whitebread were putting her on the couch—there was a light</p>

               <p>in the house, Whitebread brought one down when he came—I did not go iu-doors, only just a step over the sill of the door—I saw no blood—there was nothing done to hurt her all the time I was there, no more than the fall—when I left her Whitebread was there—she was not hurt in the least except by the fall on her back—she was placed rather sideways against the wall, and the prisoner had his arm round her under her arms, on her shoulders, like, and she fell right backwards; she was standing, and he had his arm round her, but in reaching to open the door he let go of her, and she slipped out of his hand, and fell right backwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was a dead fall; her head went direct back <hi rend="italic">bosh</hi> upon the pavement—I did not know them at all, only by sight—I had never been in their company much; I have seen them, but not to know anything of them—some of the bricks are rough, some are worn down more than others; they are bricks and bats, having projecting edges.</p>

I am a labourer—at the time in question I lodged with my wife at the prisoner's cottage, and had done so about three months—the prisoner and his wife lived there the whole of that time—he used to go to work in London during the week, and come home on Satur-days—on Saturday night, 25th January, I was at home, after 11 o'clock; the prisoner called me down—I had not gone to bed—I came down to the door; I did not bring a light with me—when I opened the door, the pri-soner stood at the door with his hand on the latch, his wife was leaning up against the wall, and as I got the door open I saw her fall right back on the pavement in front of the door—I told him to stop while I got a light; I got one and put it on the table, and the prisoner went outside and brought his wife in, and laid her on the floor of the front-room, down stairs; that is a sitting-room; it has a wooden floor—he laid her down there while he got the couch ready to put her on; he pulled it out from underneath the window—Beckett was there—the prisoner asked me to help him lift her on the couch, and I caught hold of her legs and he caught hold of her round the shoulders—she was dressed—I did not notice what she had on her head—(<hi rend="italic">Beckett.</hi> She had a bonnet on when we were carrying her; a very thin one)—After we had put her on the couch, I noticed a little blood on the floor; the prisoner asked me to wipe it up; I did so—he asked me if I knew where it came from; I said I thought it came from her mouth—I saw a little blood on her mouth—after we got her on the couch, she called out for my wife to come down—she said "Come down; yes, darling, come down, darling, dear"—my wife came down—she did not say anything to her; she did not speak; she appeared then as if she was going off to sleep, and my wife and I went up stairs, and went to bed—Beckett was then outside; the prisoner went out and showed him the way out of the gate, as he was going home—the prisoner and his wife used to sleep in the front room down stairs; the same room where the couch was; there was a bed there—our room is up stairs—nothing attracted ray attention during the night—about 6.30 on the Sunday morning, the prisoner came up and knocked at our door, and asked if he could come in—I said "Yes, open the door"—he did so, and came in—we were in bed—he said "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, what shall I do, for I think my wife is a <hi rend="italic">croaker?</hi>"—I thought he meant that she was very ill, or dead—I did not know what to think—my wife told him to send for some brandy to give her to keep her warm—she did not think she was dead—I did not exactly understand what he meant by a <hi rend="italic">croaker</hi>, but I thought what it meant, and I put on my trousers</p>

At 8 o'clock on the morning of the 26th of January I went to the prisoner's house—I saw the body of his wife lying on a couch in the front room dressed—the mouth and eyes were closed—I noticed some blood about the mouth and cheek, which appeared to have been wiped—she had a bonnet on—I noticed a few blood-stains on the floor, and a patch where blood had been wiped up—outside there was a patch of blood about six inches long—that was about 5 1/2 feet from the door—there were spots and a streak—I measured it—there were a few drops, apparently from the streak, leading into the house up to the couch—I have the bonnet here—I did not notice any blood on it at the time; there is blood on the left side—I cannot say whether the bonnet was on in the right way—I saw the prisoner there and asked him what was the matter—he said, "I brought my wife home, with the assistance of a man named Beckett, about 11 o'clock last night; she was very drunk; she fell down; I stood her against the wall, between the door and the window, while Whitebread opened the door; I let go of my wife, and put my hand to the latch of the door; she then turned round, apparently to go in at the door, and she fell backwards; with the assistance of Whitebread we carried her indoors and laid heron the couch"—he said he wished her to be undressed to go to bed; she said she would rather lie on the couch; he then laid down on an old bed in the corner of the room and went to sleep; he awoke about 6.30 in the morning and called his wife, and as there was no answer he went to her and found she was dead—he afterwards said he had sent for the doctor, and also for the coroner's officer to give notice, and he had called the constable Gurr in—he also, in conversation, talked about the funeral of his wife—I remained there till about 11.30 when the doctor arrived; he made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination about 3 in the afternoon—I searched the house—I produce a cloth which I found in a small place at the back of the front room, a kind of wash-house or scullery—in the afternoon I took the prisoner into custody, after the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I charged him on suspicion of having caused the death of his wife—he said "I am innocent"—I had not seen Beckett at that time—I had spoken to Whitebread about it, and also about the blood being wiped up, but not to get full particulars—he told me that he had wiped the blood up in the morning—after the doctor left, the prisoner</p>

               <p>said he should like to go to Hounslow to inform his friends that his wife was dead—I let him go—he came back at 3 o'clock, the time I had told him—that was before I had taken him into custody—he returned at 3—about half-past 3 the doctor made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and the prisoner was taken into custody about 5.</p>

                  </hi>. I am, constable of the parish of Heston—on the Sunday night, when the prisoner was in custody, I went with him towards Houns-low—I had not charge of him; the sergeant had, but I was walking by his side—he said his wife had been a deal of trouble to him, that she had been drinking for six or seven years, that she had pawned all he had, that he might have said what the policeman said, and what he had done he <hi rend="italic">done</hi> in the heat of passion—after he said that to me I told him not to say anything to me, and he said nothing further. I did not ask him any question—he was not exactly sober at the time, and he was not drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine, a member of the Royal College of Physicians and of the Royal College of Surgeons—I practise at Hounslow—on Sunday morning, 26th January, about 10. 30, I went to the prisoner's cottage—I found the woman lying on the sofa, quite dead and cold—I should say she had been dead about eight hours—her head was flexed forward on the left breast, slightly resting on the sofa, upon which was a mark of blood corresponding to the injury at the back part of the head—I found marks of blood on the mouth, which appeared to have been wiped—at this period I asked the prisoner how he accounted for the blood on the face of the woman—he said that she fell the night before on her face—I then made further examination, and found a slight quantity of blood oozing from the back part of the head—I asked the prisoner how he accounted for that wound at the back part of the head—he said she did not fall on her face, but she fell on her back—I asked him where she fell, and he took me outside his door, and placed himself in the position which he stated she was in when she fell—I could not possibly see how she could have fallen in that position—I don't think I said so to him—in my opinion she could not possibly have fallen in the manner in which he stated she had done to have caused the wound at the back part of the head—a small quantity of blood, which he pointed out to me as the spot where she fell, was in the middle of the brick path outside the door—that is not altogether my reason; it is part of it—I noticed several spots of blood about the room, and one large one in the middle of the room, on the floor;. that appeared to have been wiped—I asked the prisoner how he accounted for this blood—He said he put his wife on the floor when he brought her in, and when he went to Whitebread the following morning at 6.30 he had asked Whitebread to come down and wipe it up—the police-officer was present when I put these questions to him—he had not been taken into custody at that time—I then left—I don't think I took the deceased's bonnet off then—I did not at that time take a precise account of the nature of the injury at the back of the head—I returned at 3.30 in the afternoon—she appeared to be in the same position as when I left her—I then carefully examined the mouth, and found an abrasion on the right cheek, internally—I took off the bonnet—it was tied so tightly that I was obliged to cut it; the strings seemed to be tied in knots; it seemed very tight indeed under the chin—I looked at the bonnet when I took it off—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187303030032"></xptr>
               <p>I noticed that, although the wound was on the right side, the blood on the bonnet was on the extreme left, and there was no track of blood from one side to the other—I believe this is the bonnet—I did not notice any mark or indentation upon it—the wound at the back of the head was a jagged wound, about an inch and a quarter or an inch and a half in extent; a clean wound, not a contused wound—it was right to the bone of the skull, dividing the pereostum; it had not fractured the skull—I had the body moved, and made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the couch was stained a little with blood on the upper part, but not to such an extent as to go right through to the lining; there were no clots of any kind—my opinion was that the woman had not died on the couch; if she had, in the first place, from the extensive wound on the back part of the head, there must have been a large quantity of clotted blood immediately in connection with it surrounding the wound, or we should have it at the bottom of the sofa, having run down from the same; secondly, her head would have been reclining backwards, or at one side or the other, and resting on the sofa, whereas it just barely touched the sofa, and was flexed forwards on the chest—I should imagine that she died on the floor—in all probability some-thing might have been under her head on the floor, and then, on account of being stiff and cold, when she was put on the sofa she would be in the same position; and there is another point, her bonnet was on when I saw her, but it was impossible for the wound to have been caused at the time she had it on, because the blood must have percolated through the bonnet before it got on to the stones outside—I should have expected to find a large quantity of blood on the right side, and there was not any—there was one place on the floor where a large quantity appeared to have been wiped, quite as much as I should have expected to find on the sofa—when I cut the bonnet off, I noticed that it covered the wound, because I felt the wound through the bonnet—on removing the skull I found a rupture of a blood vessel on the right side of the lesser brain, and which was on the same side as the external injury to the head—from that rupture she died—the blood had not got on to the membranes of the brain, it was at the back part of the head entirely; the brain was very much congested, but the blood had only got to the lower portion—I am satisfied that death was caused by the rupture of the vessel—the skull was not actually fractured—I should imagine death would take place perhaps in a couple of hours after the rupture, perhaps in an hour; it is impossible to say exactly—a blow of this kind on the head sometimes does not produce insensibility at the time, but it comes on afterwards—there were no bruises about the wound—she was not a particularly heavy woman; she was about 5 ft. 4 in., but not a very large woman—I should say that if she slipped from the wall, and fell backwards on her head on the brick pavement, it would not produce the wound I found, because I should expect to have had a contused wound, whereas this was a clean cut; I should have expected a contused wound in all probability, unless the head was well protected—I looked at the pavement, I saw no projections that would account for it—in my judgment a violent blow with a thick stick would have caused it, or a kick with a heavy boot; it need not have been a sharp cutting instrument; the reverse, a blunt one—I could not account for the blood on the mouth unless she fell on her mouth; a fall against the door or anything in coming out of the public-house might have produced it—all the organs of the body were perfectly healthy, the stomach was quite empty.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A violent kick would not produce a contused wound, not if done with the corner of the boot; it would have just such an appear-ance as this wound presented; there need not be any contusion—what hospital I was educated at has nothing to do with the case; I am a registered medical practitioner—I was at an hospital, where I took the first prize for surgery, Westminster—I did not tell you at first because I thought it a very irrelevant question to ask—I have been in the accident ward there some thousands of times—in the medical profession we often have things that perplex us; as a rule we can form a very fair estimate of how wounds are caused, at least those who know their profession can—I have very rarely, indeed, been surprised at wounds—another surgeon was called in in this case, Dr. Glengall—he came to the same conclusion that I did; he is not here—bleeding would cease the moment death occurred, or in a very short time—there is very rarely any convulsion before death sets in in a case of this kind; it may occur where there is irritation of the brain.</p>

               <p>123, Strand—on Tuesday, 30th January, the prisoner came in for a half-quartern of gin, which was 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a florin—I had my doubts about it, but I gave him the change, and he drank his gin and left—I then showed the florin to the barman, and afterwards I tried it with my teeth, and found it was bad—I put it in the fire, and it melted at once.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the White Hart, Catherine Street, Strand, which is kept by Mr. Wilks—the prisoner came there between 6 and 7 o'clock, on the 1st February, with another man—he called for two glasses of ale, and gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I looked at it and gave it to a man named George Barwood, who was there—he went out and whilst he was gone I gave the prisoner the change, and he left with the other man—I went to see where they had gone, and I saw them both running—Barwood was then coming back with the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and I found it was a bad one—the prisoner was stopped and given into custody, and I gave the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece to the policeman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I hurry you for the change? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that is why I gave it you before Barwood come back—the entrance to the theatre is next door to our house, and there were a good many persons about, going to the theatres—I had not got a tester, but I had my doubts about it, and I sent it by the man to see if it was good—he was gone about a quarter of an hour—he went to the Two Spies just opposite to us.</p>

I am a carpenter, and was at the White Hart, on this occasion—I saw the prisoner come in with another man—what the barmaid has, said is correct—she gave me the crown and asked me if I would go to Hollyman's with it—I eventually found it was bad and brought it back—I was detained there some time—this is the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—I went back with the barman and met the barmaid in the road—she pointed out the prisoner—he was running—I ran after him and stopped him—there was another man with him, but he got away down a court—the prisoner was sober, but he feigned to be drunk after I took him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You say I was running. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Yes, you were about 100 yards from the public-house when I took you, and I held you till a policeman came up—I gave the crown to the policeman—I had given it to the barman, Mr. Holly man, and he returned it to me—he tested it, it has the marks now, and it was afterwards marked by the inspector at Bow Street.</p>

On 6th June, about 4 o'clock, I saw Crouch go into a marine store dealer's shop, in St. Mary-at-hill, kept by a man named Daley, who is the husband of the woman at the bar—Cronch had a white apron on with a parcel in it, and a pitcher on his shoulder—he remained in there a few minutes and then came out with the pitcher in his hand, but without the parcel—I followed him to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Great Tower-street, where Mr. Pugh, his master, lives—going along I made a communication to Sergeant Funnell—I then returned with Crouch to St. Mary-at-hill—when we reached there I waited outside with him while Sergeant Fuunell went in—I was called in very soon afterwards, and went in with the boy—the prisoner Daley was there—she said as I went up stairs that the children were dressing in the front room where Mrs. Daley was—I saw some spilt coffee on the carpet—I then went up stairs—I saw one girl at the bed, putting some parcels between the bed and the bedclothes; pulling the clothes down—I looked there and found a large apron with raw coffee in it, and also currants, and sugar—I found some cochineal and indigo in the place; some of it was under the sofa—I went to the window of the top floor front room, and in the gutter I found three parcels of sugar—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the sugar about which this charge is—I have seen Crouch go there eight times before—when I went in Funnell had some sugar in his hand—Daley did not say anything then—she said something to Funnell while I was searching the house; I could not say what it was—in going up the house I saw one little girl on a ladder placed just over the staircase; there is a kind of trap through the skylight—I went up and found four parcels between the ledge and the parapet—I saw a hole cut through the ceiling into the shop, so that a person if kneeling down could see into the shop—we found a great quantity of things in searching the house—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of them.</p>

On 5th June, about 4 o'clock, I went to Pugh's, at Great Tower-street—I saw Crouch having some money in his band—I did not see Daley then, I saw her about quarter of an hour afterwards—I took Crouch back to Tower-street—he had a pitcher in his hand—I followed him into the warehouse, and said, "I am an officer; give me that money which you have just put in your pocket"—he pulled it out and gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "What have you taken to Mrs. Daley's at St. Mary-at-hill, and sold?"—he said, "Sugar"—I said," Where did you get it from?"—he said, "From off the bench, and wrapped it up in some of that paper which lies in the corner"—I asked him how much he had taken; he said the woman told him 14lbs.—he pointed out some paper that lay in a corner of the warehouse on the bench where the sugar was taken from—he said the woman paid him the money—I said, "Now you must go back with me to St. Mary-at-hill;" that was to Mrs. Daley's—I left him in charge of Legg—we went down to Daley's; I left Legg outside—I went into Mrs. Daley's—I saw a woman in the shop, who I knew was not Mrs. Daley; Mrs. Daley was up stairs—the woman went up stairs to her, and then said that Mrs. Daley would come down in a few minutes—I heard a great noise overhead—I looked up and saw a square hole cut through the ceiling, and Mrs. Daley was kneeling down looking at me through it—there was a pane of glass that would move backwards and forwards, so that she could see any one that came into the shop—there was nothing over the pane of glass when I first saw it—I said to her, "now you must come down or else I shall come up there"—afterwards I found a piece of oil cloth that would cover over it—that was on the first floor—there is a table over it in the room to prevent any one tumbling through—Mrs. Daley came down, and I said, "Have you bought any sugar of any one to-day?"—she said, "No"—I said, "Are you sure: not of anybody?—she said, "No"—I said, "I have got the boy in custody that you bought some of just now, and he is outside the door"—I did not say what he had told me—she said, "Oh! come up here"—she went up stairs and I followed her—she pointed out those two parcels of sugar—they were lying on the drawers—I said, "How came you to tell me you had not bought any?"—she said, "The woman took it in"—I said, "Who paid for it?"—she said,"I did"—I said, "What did you give him?"—she said, "2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound"—I said, "You must come down stairs along with me"—I took the sugar down and called Legg and the boy in, and said to the boy, "Which of these two women paid you the money?"—the boy pointed to Mrs. Daley—I then told Legg to go and get another officer, which he did—as soon as the officer came he took charge of the boy and the sugar—we went up stairs—I told her she must consider herself in my custody—there is 15lbs. of sugar here, without the paper—I saw Legg find something in the room—he found some coffee in the bed—when I told Mrs. Daley that she must consider herself in my custody, she said, "Oh dear, I have been so careful about buying, for I was told that there were officers on the hill, watching our shop"—I made no answer to that—I enquired as to whose bed it was</p>

               <p>in which the coffee was found—Mrs. Daley told me it was the lodger's; a person named Williams—the husband came in as Legg was taking the plate out of the chest of drawers—Mrs. Daley was present—Daley said, "Are you going to take that away?"—I said, "Certainly"—he said, "I can tell you who that belongs to; it belongs to Mrs. Daley's friends"—I said, "Well, there are different crests on it, I shall take it away"—Mrs. Daley said that it belonged to them; that she had had it by her some time, and that they had pledged it two or three times—this Spanish liquorice was found in the shop, and also this gun-metal, spice, cochineal, and a bag of gutta percha—I saw a great quantity of old sacks and bags of all sorts, with different names on them—I took them to the station—Crouch did not say anything to me at the station or anything that I heard—he told me at the Mansion House that he had taken a great quantity at different times—he said he had been there about twelve or thirteen times with sugar—I asked him who bought it—he said, "Sometimes the woman, sometimes a boy; and the husband was present on one or two occasions."</p>

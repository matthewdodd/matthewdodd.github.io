               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270100"></xptr>
               <p>a cheque for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay various sums which were not strictly office business—it was a little out of the regular course—among other things there was one sum of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due to Mr. Nicholls, the printer, to be paid—I directed the prisoner to pay that 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Mr. Nicholls out of the cheque—I gave him five or six bills amounting to that sum, and that was one of them—some time after, the prisoner gave me several receipts, or vouchers, including a voucher for this 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is it—he presented me the bill with this receipt attached—it was then as it is now, except the words in brackets—it was without those words—after giving me this receipt the prisoner quitted my service—Mr. Nicholls then applied to me for the money, and I paid him—I subsequently found this receipt, and, observing that it was for the same sum I had paid, I sent to Mr. Nicholls for his explanation—when I sent it to Mr. Nicholls, it had not the words on it included in the brackets, but it bore them when it came back—in other respects it is in the same state in which it was when given to me by the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you got the other bills that you gave him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, all but one—they were all paid, with this one exception—I have got the five here—the prisoner did not give me the vouchen for a day or two after I gave him the cheque—I then asked for them—it was, probably, two or three days after—I do not think it was more than that—it was not much more—I will swear it was within a week—he gave me the receipts at my chambers, I believe, in the afternoon, among others—Mr. Nicholls sent to me about the period that I discharged the prisoner, which was in January.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you first made any charge against the prisoner, before you gave your evidence, did you mention this charge also? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I mentioned it between the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. charge and the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. charge—French left me in January, I think before the prisoner—they both left me in the same week—I am not sure whether French left before, or after, the prisoner—they both had notice together—I will not say positively whether the prisoner left first—I have frequently com<lb></lb>plained of irregularities in French's conduct—I cannot say positively that he was a defaulter when he left me, because his book was not made up—I believe that the monies paid to him exceeded the amount of his disbursements, and that the balance would be in my favour, but up to the time I discharged him I had no right to doubt his honesty—I did not know that he had been guilty of anything improper, or of any fraud—I do not know that he was a defaulter—he told me, on his accounts being made up, at the end of the year, that the balance would be in my favour—up to the time of his appearance before the Magistrate, I did not know that he was a defaulter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At this moment do you know as a fact or only conjecture, that be is a defaulter, that he has omitted to pay over to you monies due to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he has not, as far as my knowledge goes, omitted to pay over money due to me—it is merely that the amount received from me for the purpose of the disbursements of the office, exceeds the sum he has expended, and strictly speaking, he ought to pay it back to me, or he would have a balance in hand, which at the end of his employment he should return to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKOSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The prisoner kept no books did he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—French kept his disbursement book, but nobody ought to receive any monies as payments without handing them over to me—French received money from me to enable him to carry on the business by making payments—I have not been out of town for some time—I was out of town in Jan.—I do not recol<lb></lb>lect that I went out of town between Nov. and Jan., I do not think I was—my business occasionally takes me out of town—I have not been out of town for the last four or five months—I do not think I was out of town at the latter part of Nov.—I can only swear according to my recollection and belief, I do not recollect it—I will swear I was not out of town in the middle of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270101"></xptr>
               <p>Dec. for a week—I do not recollect it, nor was I in January last—I have not been out of town since Jan. twelve months, not for any length of time—I have not been out of town, and left French to manage my business—I was not out of town in Nov., Dec, or Jan., last—French was certainly not a de<lb></lb>faulter to my knowledge, more than once, or twice, or thrice, in my estab<lb></lb>lishment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A defaulter, that is, that he has received money for you, which be has not accounted for, not that he held a balance for you of your own money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot draw the distinction—in that view I do not know that he is a defaulter up to this moment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever discharge him before the last time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have given him notice once or twice—I did not discharge him—he did not leave my employment—it was a very short time before he left, that I gave him notice—I cannot speak to the precise period, but on the Saturday when be ought to have left me, I found he had conducted himself very well during the week, and I said out of regard to his family I would give him one more trial—he remained three days after that—I had once before talked of parting with him, more than a year ago—those were the only two occasions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, after giving him notice to leave your service, take him into your service again, and yourself retain out of his wages the amount of his defalcations from week to week? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> think I lent him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and told him to deduct so much out of his salary, to charge a lesser sum instead of a larger sum—I think at the end of the previous year there was a small balance, and he had a little more money given to him to set him right, and it was to meet that, according to my recollection, that the diminution of his salary was to take place; and I have done the same thing with the prisoner—I did not, after giving French notice to quit, take him on again, and make an ar<lb></lb>rangement with him that his deficiencies should be deducted out of his salary, week by week—there was a deduction made from his wages, not for a mal<lb></lb>appropriation—I think there was a balance in my favour, and to meet that balance, he was to charge a smaller salary—the disbursements did not equal the sum in his hands—it frequently happens that a person keeping books loses money, by omitting to put all the entries down—I know a person named Thomas David Lloyd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you ever any authority from a person named Owen, of New Bond-street, to bring an action against anybody for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> had an authority from a friend of Mr. Owen's to bring an action, and Mr. Owen has subsequently questioned that authority—it is the subject of inquiry at the Court of Chancery at present—I had no other authority than the supposed authority of his friend—I did not know Mr. Owen at that time—Mr. Muddi<lb></lb>man is the name of the friend—he was a client of mine, and Mr. Owen was his friend—my Lord, I am perfectly willing to answer these questions, but I apprehend there are other objects ulterior to these proceedings, therefore I crave your indulgence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that there is some inquiry pending in a supe<lb></lb>perior Court on this very subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is—there is a suit now pend<lb></lb>ing in Chancery—I see behind the learned counsel, gentlemen who have no<lb></lb>thing to do with these proceedings, but who have been opposed to me for years, and I know there are other objects in view.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270102"></xptr>
               <p>Owen on two occasions—I believe I called on him before I brought the action—I believe I called on him the same week, whether it was before or after the writ was issued I do not know—I did not see him—my belief is, that Mr. Owen was aware of my bringing this action immediately—he did not tell me to quit his house, and say I ought to be ashamed of myself for bringing an action without his authority—I did not know that Mr. Wynne Williams was Mr. Owen's attorney, till Mr. Owen told me so, a long time afterwards—Mr. Owen was served with a subpoena in Chancery, and I then called on him—that must have been two, three, or four months after I brought the action—I did not communicate to Mr. Owen that I had brought the action in his name, for four months after I had brought it—I saw his friend two or three times, and I called twice on Mr. Owen, and on neither occasion did I see him—I did not furnish him with any knowledge that I had brought this action in bis name, till he was served with a subpoena—my communi<lb></lb>cation had always been with Mr. Muddiman, except on the two calls that I made—I did not call on Mr. Owen, and ask him to permit me to appear for him to that subpoena—I will explain—after being served myself with a sub<lb></lb>pœna, I sent the prisoner to Mr. Owen—I saw Mr. Owen myself a week or some days afterwards, and Mr. Owen had then appeared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask Mr. Owen, on any occasion, to permit you to appear for him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might have offered to appear, but Mr. Owen said he had put the matter into the hands of Mr. Williams, his solicitor, and I wrote Mr. Williama's address down—Mr. Owen was annoyed at being served with a subpoena, but he never desired me to leave his house—he made some complaints about the action—I believe he did not say that I had been guilty of gross misconduct in making use of his name without his authority, and request me to leave the house—I cannot call it to my recollection—I swear it to the best of my recol<lb></lb>lection—I will swear he did not use that precise language to me—he might have complained of it—he did not complain of gross misconduct—he said he was not aware of the action—he was very much annoyed at it—Mr. Owen was a party to the suit, because he was the holder of the bill of exchange.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not know at the time you brought the action, that Mr. Owen had not the smallest interest in the bill, of any kind whatever? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I have shown that I have no unwillingness to answer questions properly; but the person in whose employ the prisoner is knew all the matters that were going forward—this is an inquiry which, I humbly submit, ought not to be made—I am not objecting to that particular question, but to the whole course of the examination—I will answer the question—I did not know that Mr. Owen was the holder of a bill of exchange, and up to a late period I believed there was a proper understanding between him and Mr. Muddiman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you or not a confidence in Mr. Muddiman that he was entitled to desire you to bring an action? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Unquestionably so—I knew him as a friend of Mr. Owen's—he had been a client of mine for some time—it is not true that Mr. Owen turned me out of doors, or desired me to go out—I am very sorry there has been any misapprehension on that subject—the bill in Chancery has been answered—this is the paper which the pri<lb></lb>soner put into my hands as an acquittance for the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Re<lb></lb>ceived of Mr. Columbine, the sum of 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for J.

               <p>—it would be difficult to say in what way—there is some resemblance of a 5, and yet it may be construed into an 8—the 6 has been converted into an 0, that I will swear—when this paper came from my hands, I am sure it was a receipt for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. only—I will not swear it was part of the same piece of paper as the bill—it has an appearance of paper like the bill, but I may be mis<lb></lb>taken—I know nothing of the writing in the bracket.</p>

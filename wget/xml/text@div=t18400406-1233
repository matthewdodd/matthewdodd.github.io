                  </hi>. I live in New Gravel-lane. On the 8th of April I was in company with the prosecutrix at the King William public-house—she sat by the side of a sailor who had been stopping with the prisoner some nights—I had seen him frequently with her—he treated the prosecutrix to some rum—the prisoner seeing that called her names not fit to mention—the prosecutrix got up in a few minutes, and went and wrung her nose as hard as she could—I tried to prevent her doing it, and fetched her up the room, away from the prisoner—the prisoner went out in about ten minutes, and returned in about ten minutes with a cotton gown on, having had a black silk one on before—the prosecutrix and I were coming up the room, and the prisoner struck her, knocked her down, and told her to come out and fight—I said she should not, for she was too drunk to fight—one of the waiters then came, and put the prisoner out—in about ten minutes Per<lb></lb>kins came and told me supper was ready—I said, "Very well, help me lead the prosecutrix out," which she did, and before we could get her off the second step of the door, the prisoner struck her with the key of the door, and never spoke to her—she was outside—she struck her on the nose the first blow—altogether she struck her two or three times—she never spoke at all—she struck her on the lip the second time, and I said, "Why, Mary, you have a key in your hand"—I either called her Mary or <hi rend="italic">Poll</hi>—I wrenched the key out of her hand—this is the key—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—she struck her with the ward part—I have every reason to believe she was waiting outside the door for her—she had been out of the house about ten minutes—the prosecutrix's face bled very fast indeed.</p>

               <p>there—the prisoner came down the room—the prosecutrix followed her, and said, "There is no law for pinching noses or kicking * * *"—the prisoner said, "Don't tear my clothes"—I took her bonnet, and she walked out of the long room—the prosecutrix left her beads and cap at the bar, followed her oat, and said, "Now, b—<hi rend="italic">Cumberland Poll,</hi> I am ready for you;" with that, Thomas said, "<hi rend="italic">Poll,</hi> don't fight with no keys"—the prisoner said, "I don't want to fight with keys, here is the key," and she gave it very freely up to Thomas—Thomas did not wrench it out of her hand—she did not use it—the prosecutrix then made a strike at the prisoner—the prisoner said she did not want to fight—she merely <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the prosecutrix, and she fell on the ground—she got up, and Thomas said, "You are bleeding"—she said, "A little blood won't hurt me, come on, b—<hi rend="italic">Poll,</hi> I am not afraid of you," with that she fell against my door, and that cut her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married.

I was at the King William public-house last Wednesday night, and saw the prosecutrix there—the prisoner came in very nicely dressed, and went down the long-room—the prosecutrix followed her and said, "I owe it you"—the prisoner said, "What for?"—she said, "There is no law for pulling noses or kicking * * *," and pulled her nose twice—the waiter said, "Don't fight here, if you want to fight go out"—with that the prisoner went out, the prosecutrix pulled off her cap and beads, left them at the bar, and followed her and said, "Now, b——<hi rend="italic">Poll,</hi> if you want any thing, I will give it you"—Thomas said, "Don't fight with that key"—she said, "I don't want to fight with the key," and gave it to Thomas—the prosecutrix said, "Now, come on, we will have it"—the prisoner said, "I don't want to fight you"—she pushed her, and she fell in the gutter, and her face went on the curb—she got up, and Thomas said, "Your face bleeds"—she said, "Never mind; I don't mind a little blood"—she was going to fight again, and the prisoner and her fell down in the passage—her nose bled, and Thomas took off the prisoner's apron and wiped her nose with it—somebody said it was the prisoner's apron—she said, "Never mind that, that will do; for I will make her pull out her <hi rend="italic">browns</hi> to-morrow."</p>

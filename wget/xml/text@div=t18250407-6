               <p>MARGARET DOUGLAS. I am a widow. On the 16th of February a trunk and a box of clothes were to come for me, from Harrow, to Mrs. Speed's house, No. 38, Rupert-street, in the parish of St. James. I had put the articles stated in the indictment into them (enumerating them); but I cannot say which were in each; I expected them to come on Wednesday, the 16th of February; I was living at Mrs. Field's then - they did not come at all: I waited till Friday, the 18th, then went to the Green Man and Still, Oxford-street, and from information I received there, I went to the house of Joshua Davidson, <placeName id="t18250407-6-crimeloc31">No. 33, Rupert-street</placeName>

            . I am the wife of Joshua Davidson - we live at No. 33, Rupert-street, in the parish of St. James, and rent the house; we have lived there about seven months. The prisoner took a first floor back room at our house, on the 15th of February, and was to sleep there that night, but did not. He brought a box that day, and then went away; I did not see him bring the box in. On Thursday, the 17th, he came again; I let him in, between four and five o'clock - before that two boxes had come to our house: I paid 1 s. 6 d. porterage for them. The box was corded, and the trunk was in a wrapper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how they were addressed? A. No. I did not take them in myself; I was present when they came: one was left in the parlour, and the other taken into the prisoner's room, as the porter, when he brought them, asked if a young man named Douglas was moving in, and we did not know the prisoner's name - he had not said that he expected any boxes. When the prisoner came on the 17th, I said two boxes had come from the Green Man and Still, and was it right; he said Yes: I said I had paid 1 s. 6 d. porterage, was that right; he said Yes, and he would settle with me by and by. He went up stairs, came down again in about a quarter of an hour, and went out with the trunk; he returned in about twenty minutes, without the trunk - he went up to his room for about ten minutes, and then went out with two bundles; he came back in a few minutes, and went up stairs again, came down with another bundle, and brought me the key of his room, and said if Henry came in he should be in about eight or nine o'clock, to bed. Henry Ball had recommended him to us; they were to sleep in the same room. I saw no more of him till he was in custody; he did not come home, and Ball did not come till next day; he had lived about three months at our house. Next day, Friday, Mrs. Douglas came to our house; I shewed her the box which was left behind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not ask if there was a letter left with the boxes, as I should like to know where they came from? A. He asked if there was a letter; I said No, and he said he said he supposed it was inside. He said nothing about liking to know where it came from.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on Wednesday, the 2d of March, at half-past eleven o'clock at night, and took him to St. Ann's watch-house, searched him, and found a pen-knife on him, which I have had ever since. When I first took him I asked if his name was Peter Carroll; he said No, it was George Day; I said I apprehended him for stealing a box and trunk from Rupert-street; he at first denied it, but afterwards said he took them to his mother's lodging, and sold them to a Jew, who he called out of the street, for 50 s., and that his right name was Peter Carroll. I found 20 s., on him, which he said was all he had left from the produce of the property; I found three silk handkerchiefs on him, two of which were in his hat; they do not belong to the prosecutrix.</p>

            . I was with Schofield when the prisoner said he had taken the things from Rupert-street, and sold them to a Jew, at his mother's place, in her absence; he said he sold the trunk, with its contents, altogether, to the Jew, for 50 s., and it was impossible to get any of them back, as he did not know the Jew, nor where he was likely to be found.</p>
               <p>MRS. DOUGLAS. I am quite sure this knife is mine; I have had it so many times in my hand: it was in the trunk or box when I packed them at Harrow. My goods were worth 20 l. to me. Banks is employed at the Green Man and Still; he referred me to No. 33, Rupert-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The box which was corded was not broken open; it appeared to have been forced with the weight of the clothes. If I had thought it was not for me I would not have sold them.</p>

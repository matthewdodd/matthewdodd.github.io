I lost this tea pot on the 14th of last December in the forenoon; the prisoner came to my house requesting me to let him have two silver teapots for the purpose of shewing them to some ladies who resided in Brunswick square.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. Yes; I have known him this four or five years; I let him have one to shew; he was to call the next day to let me know whether the customer had taken the pot or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he had liberty to sell it if he could - A. He had liberty to sell it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not expect to see it again - A. I expected to see the pot or the money. I did not see him the next day. The day following he called, he told me he had not been to shew the pot, he was then going out with it in his bag to shew it to the customer, and was to call the next day; from that time I saw no more of him or the pot till I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Because he did not pay you for the pot so you took him up for a felony - A. I took him up before I saw the pot in pledge; he had pledged the pot the day he had it of me, and he sold the duplicate.</p>

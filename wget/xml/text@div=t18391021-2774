                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Virginia-row, Bethnal-green. The prisoner lives with a man in the same house as me—I believe she is not married—on the 21st of September, about eleven o'clock at night, she was having some words with the man she lived with—I heard her mention my name, with very bad words attached to it, and I went up, intending to speak to her—she threw the contents of a vessel down stairs at me, but it escaped me—the man said to me, "Come up"—I went up, and she called me a b—rogue and a b—thief—I said, "You are b—w—for so saying"—she immediately thrust a knife at me towards my breast—I warded it off with my arm—a little scuffle en<lb></lb>sued, and I received the cut on my arm—she was in a great passion—I do not think she meant to do me serious bodily harm—I do not think she knew what she was about at the time—she was very kind to my wife and children formerly—I sent for an officer, and gave her in custody—this was Saturday night—I went to a surgeon on Monday—the Magistrate sent me.</p>

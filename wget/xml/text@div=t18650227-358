                  </hi>. I live with my son, who keeps the Dog and Stile public-house, Market-street, Southwark—I know Lovell—on the afternoon of the 9th February, between four and five, he came in with the female prisoner and another man—Fowler asked for three-halfpath of gin—I served her, she did not drink it, she gave it to Lovell—she gave me a two-shilling piece in payment, which I put in the till—there was no change there then—I after-wards took it out and found it was bad—Lovell remained there after he drank the gin—Fowler went away directly—I gave her the change out of the two-shilling piece—I lost sight of the other man—directly after Fowler left I went to the till, and the lad at the bar found the florin was bad; that is Henry Taylor—I gave it to him and he went after Fowler and brought her back—I told her she had given me a bad two-shilling piece—I don't know what answer she made—she gave the lad Taylor 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and then I let her go—directly after that Lovell asked me for half an ounce of tobacco, which was 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and gave me a two-shilling piece—I saw it was exactly like the other one—I told him it was bad and kept it, and be went out of the house—I took the tobacco away—I afterwards gave information to the police, and gave the florins to a constable.</p>

               <p>no other money there—I got the change out of a glass—they all three drank of the gin—after that I saw Mrs. Blyth serve Fowler with some gin, and she gave a florin—Mrs. Blyth put it in the till and gave Fowler change, that was the same till that I put mine into; it is all one box—the till had just been cleared I believe—there are three divisions in it—Lovell drank the gin that Mrs. Blyth served Fowler with—I believe Yarmouth and the woman then left—Mrs. Blyth afterwards called my attention to a florin, it was a bad one—I went after the woman, and found her standing at the corner opposite with Yarmouth—I brought her back and told her she had given my mother a bad florin—she made some reply, but I did not notice what it was—she gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and she was allowed to go—after that I went to the till and found another bad florin—I took it out, Lovell was there then, he called for half an ounce of tobacco, and paid a two-shilling piece—Mrs. Blyth immediately found it was bad, and he went away—a con<lb></lb>stable was then sent for, and I gave the florins to him—I found four altogether.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you find four florins in the till all at once? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; one was taken out before that, the fourth was taken out, my mother cleared the till—it was found amongst the other money that had been taken out of the till—Lovell drank the gin, I am certain of that.</p>

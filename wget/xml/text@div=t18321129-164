            . I am a printer; I work at No. 16, Chiswell-street. I was there between half-past six and seven o'clock on this evening; I saw the prosecutor's gig there, about a quarter of an hour before the robbery, and a boy in care of it; I left the office to get some bills which the prosecutor was waiting for, and as I returned, I saw the prisoner take the coats from the gig; I at first thought him to be the prosecutor, and I went up to him to give him the bills, but just as I was going to speak to him, he gave them to another man, who ran off with them - I swear the prisoner took them - he walked off; I left my bills at Mr. Hawkins's; I followed, and gave him into custody in Type-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not notice the coats at first? A. No - I first saw the prisoner about six yards from the gate; I only lost sight of him while I left the bills at the shop - I followed him a hundred yards or more - he made no attempt to escape, but expressed his surprise.</p>

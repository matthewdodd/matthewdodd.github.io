On Saturday the 14th of February, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I had four hides of leather, lying in my shop; I saw them safe then-one of them was folded in a smaller compass than the others, and laid across them; in about two minutes after, I returned and missed it, and enquired if my men had moved it. I sent my men to a currier's to enquire, if he had fetched it away for any purpose - He brought the prisoner back; it cost me 5l.; it was taken out of our shop, which is part of my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Giles's.</p>

            . I am a filecutter; I saw three men go by the shop where I work, two or three times-the prisoner was one of them; it was about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning. About two or three minutes after, I saw him come by with the leather under his arm. I immediately went out and followed the three; I took the prisoner in Whetston's park - I found nothing on him. As I returned another man dropped the leather, and ran away. I took the prisoner to Mr. George's. My master followed the man who dropped the leather, but lost sight of him. They passed the shop two or three times, as if they were watching; when the prisoner went by, I saw the leather under his arm - I am sure he is the man; the leather had been shifted to the other man, who dropped it-I picked it up.</p>

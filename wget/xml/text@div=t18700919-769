We have been married many jean, but are without family, and have determined upon bringing a little one up as our own. My constant care shall be for the child, and every<lb></lb>thing which will be for the child's comfort shall be strictly studied. Should you think more of this, and will write saying where and when I can see you and how I shall know you, we shall feel obliged. We have had several letters, so are anxious to decide which child we shall take. Yours respect<lb></lb>fully, M.

Willis, the same as the previous one—in consequence of that I went to the Brixton Railway Station, and saw the prisoner, Waters come by a train from the City—I had in my hand the letter I had" received that morning—I must have been in error when I said I tore it up on my way to the station—I tore it up after I met the prisoner—I addressed her as Mrs. Willis (I had previously spoken to the ticket collector)—she replied "Mr. Cowen"—we then sat down, and she said "I have had the letter," and I then told her the circumstances about my daughter, I told her that my daughter had been outraged, that she had left me early in the year on a visit, at sixteen years of age, that the child was not yet born, but that it would be in about a fortnight, and she was then at Mrs. Castle's, waiting to be confined—I said, "I mention these circum<lb></lb>stances so that you may not adopt an illegitimate child without knowing it"—she replied, "That will make no difference with me"—she then told we that her husband was a representative of a shipbuilding firm, that they</p>

               <p>had been married thirteen years, and were without family, and were extremely anxious to adopt a child as their own—she still refused to give me her address, but said she would do so after a short time—she said she should not like the child to be taken from them after they had learnt to love it, or words to that extract—she said that the name she hood signed in her letter was not her name, but the would also give me that when she gave me her address—I said as doom as the child was born I would communicate with her, at the same post-office in Camberwell—I gave her my name and address—she laughed, and said "How funny, I live within a stone's throw of you, and I can almost see your house from my windows"—we then separated at the station—my daughter was confined on the Saturday week following, the 14th May, of a male child, and on the Sunday or Monday I wrote by post to the name and address given in the advertisement announcing it (<hi rend="italic">The letter was called for bed not produced</hi>) it was merely to inform her of the birth of the child, and request<lb></lb>ing her to call at my residence—she did call on the Tuesday, the 7th, between 2 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I told her of the birth of the child—she asked when she could have it—I replied "When will it be convenient for you to take it?"—she said "To night," and an appointment was made for 9.30 that evening, at the Walworth Station, to receive the child—that same night I went to Mrs. Castle's, 164, Camberwell Road, with my land-lady, Mrs. Guerra, who brought out the baby, and I went with her in a cub to the Walworth Road Station—Waters had not arrived—we waited there forty minutes, she then came—she looked at the baby and admired it—she said it was a beautiful child, and she wrapped it up in a large shawl and took it away—she promised to call on me in two or three days—it was about 10.15 when she took charge of the baby—I believe there never was born a more healthy child, so I was told; I don't know, myself, I did not look at it—Waters did not give me any address at that time, she was to call on me—she did call two or three days afterwards—it was on the Tuesday she took the child, and she called I think on the Friday following; I saw her and asked how the child was—she said she was delighted with it, it was a beautiful baby, and that her husband was equally fond of it, "In fact," she said, "it is all a boy"—I then asked when she would bring it, when I could see it she said she was busy making nice clothes for it, naming certain articles, I forget what they were, a hood, a pelisse, and something—I said "Allow me to make it a present of those"—she said "No, I don't require it, I have bought the materials, and I am having them made up"—I then took two sovereigns from my purse and put them on the table before her—she pushed them back to me, and refused to take them, saying "I know you have taken at a great expense, and I won't take it"—she got up to go away and I forced the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon her, and as she left the room she returned with the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in her hand, offering it back to me—I refused it, and told her to spend it on the child, and when she brought me the child I would give her 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—she then left, and took the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with her—during the whole of the interview she was speaking in praise of the child—as she was going away she said "I pass nearly every day, and I suppose if I call with it you won't turn me away"—I said I should be glad to see her, and it, at any time she called—she did not call again I neither saw or heard of her afterwards—up to that time I did not know where she lived—on the Thursday in the following week, the 26th, toe officer Keef called upon mo—I told him the facts, and in consequence of</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 4, Langholme Villas—Mr. Cowen lodges at my house—I remember the prisoner Waters coming there in the early part of May; I can't tell whether it was the 17th, it was on a Tuesday—Mr. Cowen asked me to see her in his presence—when I went into the room she was there with him—he addressed her as Mrs. Willis, and she answered to that name—she said she wished very much for a child, that she had been married a great number of years, and had no family, told both her husband and her were very anxious to have one to adopt and bring up as their own, and they were both passionately fond of children—it ended in some arrangement being made that she was to take the child—that same evening I went with Mr. Cowen to Mrs. Castle's, and took the baby from Mrs. Castle's to the Walworth Road railway station—Mr. Cowen and I went together in a cab, and Waters met us there—Miss Cowen was confined on 14th May—I was present at her confinement, and saw the child; it was a very fine, healthy child indeed, and was so when I took it away—it was not expensively clothed; it had sufficient clothing, and there was a small parcel given with the child—when I handed the child to Waters, she looked at it, and said what a beautiful baby it was; she wit delighted with it, and said it should have every care and attention possible—she took it away with the small parcel of clothes—I saw her again on the following Thursday, the 19th, at my house, with Mr. Cowen—she said both her and her husband were very delighted with the child, it was a beautiful baby; that they were both very much attached to children, that she would do everything in her power for it, and she had been buying it a bassinet, a baby's basket, and a nursing chair—Mr. Cowen then offered her 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which she refused, and said that she did not require either money or clothes, all that she wanted was a baby that she could bring up as her own, that they were in a very good position—she eventually took the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she said she would come again in two or three days, and Mr. Cowen said she should then have the other 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she said it was not money she wished for at all, she did not wish for any money—she did not come again—I did not see her again till Saturday, 11th June, when I went to the house, 4 or 5, Frederick Terrace, with Sergeant Keif—I did not go up to the door with Relf, I waited some little distance off till he beckoned me; I then went in—Relf asked Ellis for Miss Cowen's baby—she said that her sister was not there, and she did not know anything of Miss Cowen's baby—Relf said he; should not leave the house till he saw it, he knew that she was there, and he insisted on the baby being brought forward—she then went to the top of the stairs, and called "Margaret, bring Miss Cowen's baby," and Mrs. Willis then came in with the baby in her arms—by Mrs. Willis I mean the prisoner Waters, the same person to whom I had given the child at the station—it was in a most emaciated condition—I said "Mrs. Willis, you must have been starving this child to death"—she said "Pray don't <hi rend="italic">say</hi> such a thing as that, for I have taken every possible core of the child; it</p>

               <p>has been very ill, suffering from diarrhoea;" she said that she had had a doctor attending it, and she had also spoken, the day before, for a wet-nurse for the child—I did not take much notice how the child was clothed at that time, I only noticed its appearance generally, it was so dreadfully emaci<lb></lb>ated and deplorable—I then 'went away, and returned to the house later in the day with some things for the child—on that occasion I went down to the lower room of the house, what they call a breakfast parlour, below the level of the earth; the front kitchen—the room I had been in before was the parlour—in that lower room I saw four or five infants—I think there were three on a couch, and two on chairs, on a bed made up for them—I saw four other children out in the back yard—they were older, I should say from two to three years old; one was four years old—they were merely running about, playing—I asked Waters, who went down with me, what on earth she could want with taking Miss Cowen's child, already having such a number there—she said that the others were children that were paid for weekly, and they were taken away from her after some time; but she wished Miss Cowen's child to be brought up entirely as her own—I knew, at that time, that the child had been removed from the house in the morning—she said she had done everything that was possible in her power for the child—this was about 4 o'clock in the day—I remained there about ten minutes—I saw a child in Ellis's arms; she said it was her own baby.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you give a description of Miss Cowen's child when you saw it just before it was taken away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It had scarcely a bit of flesh on its bones, and the only thing I should have known it by was the hair; it was not crying or making any noise, not any of them, that I heard; it appeared to be dying almost; it could not make any noise, it was much too weak, I think, to make the slightest sound; it was scarcely human, it looked more like a monkey than a child—when it was born it was a very fine fat baby, and when I saw it there it was a shadow, not a bit of flesh on its bones—it would be much lighter in weight.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>tried—I took it home with me to nurse and to take care of—I have been married twenty years—I had been confined seven weeks at this time—I have had four children, and have brought them up—I have never seen a child in a condition that I could not rouse it or wake it up in four or five hours; I never saw any child in that condition before—I gave it the breast every ten minutes or quarter of an hour—it would just rouse and take the breast—I first gave it the breast four or five hours after it was put into my hands; as soon as it could take it; as soon as it was sensible—the child improved for two or three days; it took the breast very eagerly, and got on well for three or four days, and then fell off—it kept gradually going off after the third or fourth day into the same state of stupor or insensibility—I did all I could for it—Dr. Puckle attended it every day whilst it was with me, and I followed his directions—the child died on 24th June—I had it the whole time, from the 11th to its death—it was under my care and the directions of Dr. Puckle all that time, and everything that could he was done for it.</p>

               <p>—she said "I can't do that; but I will tell you thus far, that it ie in the neighbourhood of Heron Hill;" but she said she did not like anyone to come and claim the child after she had got it—she said she had been married several years, and had had no family; that they wished particularly to get a child to bring up as their own; and if I entrusted my child to her care, it would have a mother's love; it would learn a good trade, and no doubt have her husband's business in time—I promised to bring the child and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the following night, between 9 and 10 o'clock, and asked where I should meet her with it—Mr. Cowen was in the neighbourhood it this time, so that he might see the woman—I then parted with her, and went into the railway station—this took place at the Camberwell New Road Railway Station—I was to bring the child to her between that station. and the railway arch, and she told me to bring as many clothes with it as I could get—after parting with her I turned and followed her; she turned the corner of the Camberwell New Road; and as I followed I met her returning again, at the corner of a public-house—I invited her to come in and take a glass of ale, and I had some conven<lb></lb>tion with her, and afterwards I traced her to her home, 4, Frederick Ter<lb></lb>race, Gordon Grove, Brixton—I saw her go indoors, about 9.30—I passed the house twice within about five minutes—I am not aware that anybody saw me—on the following morning I went to the house, accompanied by Mrs. Guerra and Mr. Cowen, but he remained outside—I went to the door and knocked; it was opened by Mrs. Ellis—the house was a very nice house outside, but there was hardly any furniture in it, and it smelt very offensively—there were six rooms, including the two kitchens, two room on a floor—the basement story consisted of a front and back kitchen—there was a front and back room on the ground floor, and two bed rooms on the floor above that, and a small ante-room—the basement floor was below the surface of the room; that was furnished, there was a sofa, and table, and chair—the house smelt badly; that applied more particularly to the base-ment story, and the bed-rooms—on the ground floor there was hardly a vestige of furniture—when Ellis opened the door, I said "Does Mrs. Willis live here?"—she said "No"—I said "Do you take children in here to adopt f—she said "No, what put that in your head—I said "Is Miss Cowen's child here?"—she said "No, but I know where it is; will you step in and wait?"—I said "No, I shall not leave you a second till Miss Cowen's child is produced"—she then took us into the front room on the ground floor, and called out "Margaret, bring up Miss Cowen's child," and a child was brought up by the prisoner Waters; it was very emaciated, and very dirty, in fact, filthy—it was wrapped up in some old clothes, and was a mere skeleton, mere skin and bone—it was quite quiet, and did not appear to have power to cry, or make any noise—Mrs. Guerra said "You have been starving this child to death"—Waters said the child had been ill, and had been attended by Dr. Harris; that it had plenty of milk, which her milk bills would show—I then asked her if she had got any more children in the house, and she said "A few"—I said "I should like to see them"—she said I could, and I went down stairs into the front kitchen; when I first went in I saw nothing, but I thought I could see something that looked like the shape of a head under some black clothes on a sofa—at last I removed some clothing from the sofa, and there laid five infants, all huddled up together—the clothing I removed was some old black stuff like an old shawl—three of the infant were lying on their sides along the sofa, all close</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187009190113"></xptr>
               <p>together; the other two laid on their backs, with their mouth open, at the lower end of the sofa—they were all together, only the three were more towards the head of the sofa, and the others lower down; all five lay in the same direction—they were all quiet, and all appeared to be asleep from some cause—they all had some clothing on, infant's clothes, and very dirty indeed, saturated with wet, and smelt very offensively—I did not see any ap<lb></lb>pearance of food about—two of the infants appeared to me to be dying, the two that were lying on their backs; they were in an emaciated condition—I did nothing towards awaking them at that time—I said "To whom do these children belong?"—Waters said she did not know who the parents were—I said "Are these some more by adoption?"—she said "Yes"—I then said, in the presence of Ellis, "Have you any more?"—she said "Yet, a few; there are some older ones in the yard"—I went into the back yard, and there found five more; they appeared in better condition, one boy was a very fine child—I said to Waters "These children look better, how do you account for that?"—she said "We have so much a week with these"—I then left the house, and fetched Dr. Puckle, the medical officer of the parish—I returned to the house in about two hours with Dr. Puckle, and Mr. Cowen—I believe we were again let in by Ellis, but I am not positive—little Cowen was brought into the room; it was not in the same condition in which I had seen it before; it was cleaned up, I mean it had got clean clothes on—I did not observe any difference in any part of its person—I noticed the child's head particularly, for I have children of my own, and it did not appear to me that its head had ever been washed—the child was very dirty, particularly about the head; it had a good crop of hair, but it looked like a shrivelled up monkey—it was in the same state as before, it did not appear more lively—Mr. Cowen said "Mrs. Willis, you have been murdering this child, "and he shed tears when he saw it—Waters said that the had not; the child had been ill, and she had had Dr. Harris to attend to it; and also that she was going to put it out to wet-nurse that day—I then went down stairs; I found the five infants still there—they had all got nice' clean clothes on then, and were laid in rows on the sofa, and feed-ing-bottles by their sides, and teats in their mouths—I believe three were on the sofa, and two in a little crib by the side of the sofa—they did not appear to be in any different state, except the clothes—they were all in this quiet state, apparently asleep; I mean they appeared to be all void of any feeling, in a state of torpor, unconscious, in a state of stupor—I did not see that they were using the bottles; they contained food—I observed this bottle (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) on the table, with the cork out and lying by it—this was in the kitchen where the infants were—I smelt it and thought it was laudanum—Dr. Puckle also smelt it; he marked the bottle and gave it to me, and it has been preserved—Dr. Puckle said the only way that might save Miss Cowen's child's life was by putting it out to wet-nurse, so that it could have its natural food—Waters said she was going to put it out to wet-nurse that day, and had sent for Mrs. Rowland—Mrs. Rowland was ultimately sent for again, and came, and Cowen's child was delivered over to her—one of the other five infants was the prisoner Ellis's, and that was in the same state as the others; she said it was her child—it was me of the five that laid on the sofa; it was quiet and asleep the same as the rest—Ellis took possession of it, and the other four remained there till Monday; I then came with the divisional surgeon, and had them removed to Lambeth Workhouse—asked Waters if she could tell me who the children belonged to—she said she</p>

               <p>could not, she did not know who the fathers or mothers were—I asked her if any of the children had got any names—she said "No"—I said "How long have you been in this business?"—she said "About four years"—I said "How many have you had in that time?"—she said "About forty"—Ellis said "Oh, more than forty"—Waters said "Oh no, say forty"—I asked whether she could tell me what had become of any of the other children—she said some had been sent away, and some took home—she did not tell me where any of them were at that time—I felt it to be my duty to consult my superior officers as to what course I was to pursue; and having done so, I returned to the house on Monday, in company with Tyers, 195, Dr. Pope, and Captain Baynes—the door was opened to us by Waters—I said to her "Mrs. Waters, I shall take you into custody for not providing proper food and nourishment for the illegitimate male child of Janet Tassie Cowen, whereby his life was endangered"—she said "Very well"—she also said that the children had been attended by the doctor, and repeated that they had plenty of milk, which her milk bills would show—at that time Ellis came up stairs—I told her that I should also take her into custody for being con<lb></lb>cerned with her sister in having four infants in their possession and not providing proper food and nourishment for the same, whereby their lives were endangered—at the station, after the charge was read over to the prisoners, Waters said "Believe me, what my sister has done has been entirely under my direction; I am the sinner, and I must suffer"—they were searched by a female, who handed me seventy-nine pawnbrokers' dupli<lb></lb>cates and a marriage certificate, a purse containing 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and another purse, found on Ellis, containing 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I sent the whole of the ten chil<lb></lb>dren to the Police Court, and nine of them were taken to Lambeth Work-house, Ellis's child remained with her—as the children had no names, they were numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9—after the prisoners were taken into custody I searched their house, and found there seventeen pawn<lb></lb>tickets, a receipt, and a medical certificate of attendance on 'Waters' husband—I took possession of a quantity of children's clothing and a milk bill, which I produce—I traced two persons who supplied milk to the house—I saw little Cowen constantly afterwards until 24th June, when he died; I saw it about three hours before it died—I saw the other nine children frequently at the workhouse—I did not get the articles out of pledge that the seventy-nine duplicates refer to; I have seen them in pledge, and there are some here—I produce a list of the articles found in the house, and the things are in Court—(<hi rend="italic">The lift consisted of a large quantity of articles of children's clothing</hi>)—They were all dirty—I saw the whole of the articles to which the seventy-nine duplicates related—a great number related to furniture—the best part of the articles are here—I have a list of such as relate to babies' clothing, extending from about January last year to May this year; they amount to about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I produce a detailed list of them; they were pledged with a variety of pawnbrokers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Medical Officer of Health for Lambeth—Brixton is within that district—on Saturday, 11th June, I was called upon by Sergeant Relf—in consequence of what he said I went to 4, Frederick Terrace, shortly after 11 o'clock—I went down stain to the front room, and there found the two prisoners, and five babies, besides one which was Ellis's—they were all together in the front kitchen—Ellis had hers in her arms, the others were lying in a row, three on the sofa and two in a cot adjoining, or in chairs made up as a cot—one of the five was pointed out to me as Miss Cowen's child—Waters took it out of the cot and brought it to me—I examined it minutely, sufficiently to form an opinion—I examined its lower parts; I took the clothes partly off—it had on the ordinary clothes of a baby of that age, a night-dress—they were quite clean—the body of the child was very much emaciated, extremely wasted, the besides almost coming through the skin—it was a miserably wasted child, no flesh hardly on the bones, the bones almost protruding through the skin, and it had that aged appearance in the face which made it difficult to form an opinion of its age; but I took it to be a month old, and I was informed that was its age—it was not a small child with regard to the size of its bones, I should say it had been a fine child, but at the time I saw it, it was no miserably wasted, that it was nothing but skin and bone—it was in a thoroughly insensible state; the eyes were closed, the limbs hung down, and it appeared in a very profound stupor—I raised the eyelids, and found the pupils very much contracted, not in a natural state—I should say that in ordinary sleep the pupils would be somewhat contracted, but they were con<lb></lb>tracted more than ordinary, very much contracted—I endeavoured to rouse the child, and used considerable endeavour for that proceed it would not at all rouse with a slight endeavour—I should think it was untter my obser<lb></lb>vation on that occasion quite twenty minutes—I succeeded slightly in arousing it, just to show it was not in a natural sleep—neither diarrhoea or thrush would account for the state it was in—my opinion is that the child was in a state of narcotism, arising from the administration of some narcotic poison—laudanum would be the very thing that I should suppose had been administered, from the appearance of the child—it would be a very improper thing to administer to a child—supposing it to have been affected by thrush or diarrhoea, laudanum, to produce insensibility, would be a very improper remedy—it would be difficult to say what amount had been ad<lb></lb>ministered, some would be under its influence with a smaller dose than others—I asked Waters about the child having been ill—she said it had suffered from diarrhaea and from thrush—I saw that it had suffered from thrush, but the thrush was somewhat improving—I asked what food she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187009190116"></xptr>
               <p>had given it, and what medicine; she said she had given it no other medi<lb></lb>cine than what Dr. Harris had ordered; that he had been attending the child, he had seen it previously, and she expected him that day—I asked her if she had given it any sleeping medicine, or any soothing syrup—she said she had not, she said she had given it corn<lb></lb>flour, arrowroot, and plenty of milk, as her bills would prove—from the state of the child, I formed an opinion that it had been either improperly fed, or that it had been fed on such food as had not nourished it—I noticed the other children slightly—I noticed one other child; it seemed very ill—they were all very quiet, I did not examine them tho<lb></lb>roughly—they were all quite quiet, and it afterwards struck me as being a very remarkable thing that they should be so very quiet for such a length of time—I was in the room I should say nearly half an hour, so as to know that there was no cry all the time, nor any motion of the children—Cowen's child was given to Mrs. Rowland to take charge of—I ascertained that she was a healthy woman, and capable of nursing the child—I thought her a very suitable person, her baby being only seven weeks old—she had suffi<lb></lb>cient milk for her own baby as well as this one—at the request of Mr. Cowen I attended the child while it was with Mrs. Rowland—I saw it daily—it rallied for a time, it improved for some days, then there was a return of the diarrhoea, but not very excessively, and the child went off again and did not rally; the day before its death it became in an insensible state, with convulsions—it died on 24th June—in my opinion it died of a combined cause, atrophy, or extreme wasting, with exhaustion and congestion of the brain—my judgment has been formed upon a general view of this case, and the cases of the other children—there is no doubt that many children brought up by hand will die of atrophy; still, my judgment would also be formed from what I saw in this case alone, seeing that the child was narcotised at the time I saw it—in my judgment death arose from want of suitable food sufficiently early, and also from the improper administration of a narcotic—many children die that are brought up by hand; I mean a disproportionate number to those that are suckled—I am unable to form a decided opinion as to the proportion—there is no doubt that with great care a larger proportion would be saved—where a number of children are brought up by hand together, the chances of living would be less—I saw very little of the other children who subse<lb></lb>quently died; but I heard of their state from the medical men who attended them, and I also saw them several times—they wore under the care of Dr. Bullen, and Dr. Pope also saw them on several occasions, and from what they told me, and from what I saw of them myself, I have formed an opinion of the cause of their respective deaths—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">objected to this evidence, at it would open an inquiry into the antecedent circumstances attending the con-dition of each of the children, and would not assist the Jury in arriving at the cause of the death of the child in question.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">was clearly of opinion that the evidence was admissible, if the same mode of treat-ment was pursued towards all the children, then the effect of that treatment upon the others became important, in relation to the cause of the death in question</hi>)—My opinion is that there was congestion of the brain in the other four children—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and the con<lb></lb>gestion of the brain formed a very important part of the cause of death of those four infants—I had noticed the condition of those children whilst living, and they all appeared to have been more or less subjected to the same</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187009190117"></xptr>
               <p>influence as the infant that was entirely under my charge from the time of its removal, the kind of stupid condition, which led me to believe that narcotic had probably been also administered to them, as I was certain had been in this case—I attribute the cause of their death to a want of suitable food, and probably also to the administration of narcotics—when I went into the front kitchen, with Sergeant Relf, I noticed on the table a small phial, lying with the cork beside it—this is it—I marked it—it contained a few drops of a fluid, which I was of opinion was laudanum—I subsequently examined it more thoroughly, and I am certain it was laudanum—I think it is tincture of opium, which is laudanum—there were only about three drops in the bottle—I don't think it was in a diluted state—I think it was as it would be sold as laudanum—after smelling the bottle, and handing it to Relf to smell also, I again asked Waters if she was quite sure she had not given the child anything to make it sleep—she said she had not—cleanliness is very im<lb></lb>portant with a child, whether brought up by hand, or in the ordinary way—this child was not kept well clean, under the arms and behind the ears, and generally it had not been well washed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say "not well washed;"I suppose then we may conclude that it had been washed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no doubt it had been washed to some extent; but not habitually well washed—I have no doubt it had been washed at some time; but not as frequently as it ought to have been—a child suffering from diarrhoea would require it more frequently than others—a child taken from its mother three days after its birth, and exposed to the night air, would be liable to catch cold—a good deal would depend upon the kind of evening, and partly on the constitution of the child—a strong child would probably be less liable to take cold than a weakly one—the circumstances of the mother during the period of gestation may in some cases have an influence upon the constitution of the ohild; but this appeared to be a remarkably fine and healthy ohild; I believe it has some influence mentally upon the child; I mean on the nervous system—that might be the case without its exhibiting external signs of it—in the case of an illegitimate child, the mother, endeavouring to conceal the matter, and being under alarm and apprehension, might act upon the child she was bearing—I had no means of discovering whether this child had been so affected or not; it might have been, without my being able to discover ft—in the bringing up of a child by hand it might make a slight difference if it was affected in that way—the bringing up children by hand is attended with very considerable difficulty and danger in all cases; there is a greater risk of the child not living—in all cases it is attended with some risk—I have had a great experience, medically, as regards children who are brought up by hand—it is not a fact that the majority of them die—I cannot give you the per<lb></lb>centage—milk and water and sugar would agree, at first, with many children, and disagree afterwards—if the digestive functions became deranged, then the milk Would very likely not agree with it—if the milk was the cause of the derangement, I think it would appear within three days—cow's, milk agrees with most children, with sugar and water—a little sugar is added, because infants will not take cow's milk—it is not sweetened, as a rule—there is more saccharine matter in the human milk, and there<lb></lb>fore sugar is added to approximate the cow's milk to it, which would probably make it more likely to agree with the child—I don't think it would have taken the milk without sugar; but if the sugar was discontinued after two or three days, I don't think it would make that difference that it would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187009190118"></xptr>
               <p>disagree with the child—I don't think it would have any injurious effect upon the digestion—if I found an alteration in the food, upon which the child did not do well, I should be disposed to attribute it to the change of food—anything that deranges the digestive organs of a child of that age would be likely to produce diarrhoea, and derange the whole system—thrush may arise from that cause; but it will also frequently arise in infants with<lb></lb>out any apparent cause—soothing medicines are not usually given to children suffering from diarrhoea, they are given to keep them quiet—I believe it is not an unfrequent thing for those who have charge of them to give them Godfrey's cordial, or syrup of poppies (it goes by different namet), and laudanum sometimes, I suppose—I should never give it to a young infant, I can't say what others would do—a small amount of laudanum might have a tendency to stop diarrhoea; but I think that would be very much counterbalanced by the injury it would do to the digestive functions—a small amount of laudanum might be given by some medical men, for diarrhoea; but not to produce narcotism, or insensibility, or what I witnessed in this infant—if nurses give anything of the kind, they probably do it to keep the children quiet—if given in excess, for the purpose of stopping diarrhoea, it would produce stupor—at the time I saw this child it was Mid to be suffering from diarrhoea; but when it was removed there was not much diarrhoea, at first, when I attended it; very slight, indeed—I think it is probable it had been suffering from diarrhoea—if it had, it had been checked—there was less at the time I took charge of it—I can't say posi<lb></lb>tively that it had suffered from it, or that it had not, I only took the statement that I received—I could not speak with certainty, from my own observation—laudanum forms a principal ingredient in the soothing medi-cines I have named—syrup of poppies is not laudanum; but the active principle is very much the same, it is a narcotic—it is more often than not made up artificially with opium—poppy and opium are different things—you can extract an opiate from poppy—the syrup extracted from poppies is very like laudanum—it is sometimes given by nurses in excess—I am of opinion that there was nothing in this bottle besides laudanum or tincture of opium, which is almost the same thing—either, diluted, would be a very improper thing as a narcotic, and under any circumstances, it would be a very improper thing to give to a child—it would never be proper for a nurse to give Godfrey's cordial or laudanum to a child, not if it was diluted, or to give any soothing syrup—it would be most improper in all cases, unless a medical man had ordered it—I consider that a nurse never should give laudanum to any child of her own accord—I did not know Dr. Harris; I never spoke to him till yesterday—diarrhoea will of itself produce ema-ciation, more or less, according to the length of time it exists, and according to its severity—if an opiate had been improperly adininia-tered for the purpose of checking the diarrhoea, and had checked it, the counter effect would be a still greater derangement of the digestive system—the direct effect of an opiate is to render the liver torpid; that would, in a child of this age, still further increase the emaciation—if an opiate had been administered to check the diarrhosa, I <hi rend="italic">should</hi> not be surprised to find a child in a state of emaciation—I had never seen Mrs. Rowland before that day, to my knowledge; I considered her a healthy woman; I depended upon what she told me, and also from an examination of the state of the breast as regarded the state of her milk, and also from examining her infant, which was a very healthy one—I cannot</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187009190119"></xptr>
               <p>recollect her age—I think she said she had four children—if a woman has plenty of milk and her health is good, I think she might fairly suckle two children; a good deal would depend upon the nourishment given to her; she would require a greater supply, and she had it—the child improved the first two or three days while with her, it improved when it had the change of food; I account for its not continuing to improve, from the state it was in at the time I <hi rend="italic">first</hi> saw it—the diarrhoea returned, but very slightly; it had a little astringent medicine for that, only on one day—catechu, with a small quantity of ammonia; no opium—that was administered, I think, about a week before its death; it checked the diarrhoea—a very small quantity was given; there were several doses at intervals; Mrs. Rowland told me they were given at the proper times—they did not appear to have any other effect than to stop the diarrhoea—one of the injurious effects of opiates improperly administered would be congestion of the brain—laudanum is never applied externally to infants in diarrhoea, to my knowledge; I have never ordered such a thing—I should think a flannel with brandy on it and a few drops of laudanum, bound round the bowels was improper, but it was not on the bowels of the child—I could not undertake to say it was not at any time; I think if it had been it would have been improper; it could do no good—if the laudanum was applied in a concentrated state to the surface, a certain amount might probably be absorbed, which might produce some stupor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and practice as a surgeon and general practitioner at 2, Northamp<lb></lb>ton Terrace, Denmark Hill, about three quarters of a mile from where the prisoners lived—I know both the prisoners—I first saw them on 9th Hay of the present year; I knew Waters by the name of Mrs. Lackburn—I was sent for to the house on 7th May; I went on the 9th; it was to see a child about two and a half years old—at the same time I saw another child, about a year and a half old, and an infant a few weeks or a month old, which was Mrs. Ellia's; it was a small child—I was not called on to attend the child a year and a half old, I merely saw it there; the one two and a half years old was the one I was called in to attend—on 1st June I was out, and when I arrived home I found I had been again sent for—I got there about 10 o'clock at night—I saw Ellis she said they</p>

               <p>had a child suffering from diarrhoea and flickness, which her Bister had brought up the previous evening from Bristol; she said it was about three weeks old—I was then shown a child about that age; Ellis had it in her arms in the front kitchen when I went in—a friend of mine called with me—there were some children in the room at the same time; two young infants, on the sofa—this was in a room below the ground, on the basement—I don't think I saw Waters that night—I did not take much notice of the two children, they appeared to be asleep—I have no means of knowing whether the child I law at that time was Cowen's child, only from what the prisoners have told me—it was a male child, and it appeared to be about three weeks old, and I have heard since from one or other that it was Cowen's child; it was not very lively—I heard that it had diarrhea and sickness, and I prescribed for it a preparation of mercury; the black oxide of mercury, triturated, in the form of a powder, to be dissolved—I took it out of my pocket, and mixed it with water, in the house—I did not administer it—it is not a soporific—it was intended to stop the diarrhoea—this was all on the same day, 1st June—I left directions if the child was not better that I was to be sent for the next morning—I ordered it to have milk and water, with sugar of milk dissolved in it—I was not sent for the next day—I went again on 3rd June, to see another child, my first patient—I don't think I saw this child on that occasion; I was told it was better—I did not make inquiry about the two children I had seen on the sofa, on 1st June—Ellis told me, without inquiry, that they had been left with them for a day or two, until a home could be found for them in the country—I know nothing of the number of children that were in the house—I can't say positively that I saw Cowen's child after the 1st of June—I new prescribed opiates for it, or for any other children there—I should not like to swear that I never saw it again, but I feel sure in my own mind that I did not; I am sure I never saw it professionally—I was not there at all on 10th June; I was there on the 8th, and saw Mrs. Ellia's child—I did not see Cowen's child on 10th, and prescribe for it—I was not expected to call and see it on the 11th—I saw Ellis's child on the 8th; it had diarrhoa—I directed beef tea to be given to Cowen's child—I think that was on my second visit, without seeing it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> On 1st June, I understand you to say, you did see Cowen's child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was apparently suffering from diarrhoea; I was told that it was—children brought up by hand are very subject to diarrhoea—it was not more prevalent among children at that time than at any other—the medicine I have named was the only medicine I ordered—I prescribed again, the second time, without seeing it, not the same medicine; I think I altered it then, and prescribed <hi rend="italic">podophyllum,</hi> a new American medicine—I think it is in the pharmacopoeia—that was on my second visit, on 3rd June; it was in the form of a tincture; it is called vegetable mercury by some persons—we don't use it as an astringent, we use it more to act on the liver—it is not calculated in any way to produce torpor, or even sleep—I am a homoeopath—<hi rend="italic">podophyllum</hi> has been in use as a medicine for several years—it is recognized in our branch of the profession; I can't say that it is universally—I mixed so many drops in water for a tea-spoonful to be given at a dose, so many times a day—I can't tell how long the child took it—I gave about enough to last three or four days—I think I was told afterwards that the child was better—I will not swear positively that I did not see the child after the 1st—I don't remember that anything was</p>

               <p>said about thrush; I did not treat it for thrush especially—I ordered sugar of milk; that is not a medicine, it is an article of food sold at the chemists' with printed directions for its use—the effect of it is to make the cow's milk I nearer approach to the mother's milk; I ordered it for that purpose—I thought it very likely that the cow's milk was disagreeing with the child; it will disagree with a good many children, even when diluted—if I heard that a child had had cow's milk, with merely the addition of water, and that it was suffering from diarrhoea, in the absence of any other cause, I should attribute it to the milk—that would be a sufficient cause in many cases—I really did think at the time that the cow's milk was disagreeing with the child—that was my reason for ordering sugar of milk—there are, no doubt, some points of difference in the milk of different cows; the milk of one cow to-day and another to-morrow, might disagree with a child—when I saw the child on the 1st it was in a moderate condition as to clean<lb></lb>liness; I did not strip it—it seemed tolerably clean—I don't think she complained of its food disagreeing with it; she told me of sickness and durrhcea—I don't know what sort of sickness—I daresay I asked her at the time, but I do not remember now—I don't remember that she said its food disagreed with it, and that it was wasting away; she did not say much about that, because I understood she had only had it the previous night—she did not say she had had it three weeks; she said it was three weeks old—I called on the 8th—I don't remember that I made any inquiries then about the child; it was for Ellis's child then—I ordered sugar of milk for that—I did not inquire about the child I had ordered it for before; I sup<lb></lb>posed it was well then, I had not heard any more about it—I don't know of my own experience that soothing syrups, are often given by women and surces improperly to children—I don't remember saying before the Magis<lb></lb>trate that I thought I had not seen the child more than twice—I don't think I did, but I can't swear it; it is possible I may have seen it twice—I went a second time for the purpose of attending another child—I am quite certain I did not twice see Cohen's child professionally—it was Mrs. Ellis I saw when she showed me Cohen's child—I did not see Waters that night—I have seen her, but I can't say on which day—they professed anxiety about the state of its health—diarrheoa is a common complaint with children brought up by hand.</p>

               <p>examination—in my opinion, the cause of death was severe congestion of the brain, and emaciation—I considered the peculiar congeition of the brain to be due to the administration of a narcotic, and the emaciation to a want of proper and sufficient food—on Monday morning, 13th June, I went with the officer to the prisoner's house, and went down into the front room on the basement, a little before 9 o'clock; they called it a front parlour; it was below the surface of the earth—I think one of the prisoners was there, but I can't recollect, exactly, who was in the room—I found one infant there; it was asleep—I examined it, and found its bowels were out of order—it was in a dirty state, in a bed made up on a chair—one of the prisoners took the child in her lap for me to examine it—I found the motion of the child in a very unhealthy state—I roused it, and it cried weakly—I should think it might have been about three months old—I then went up stairs to a bedroom at the top of the house, and saw four babise in bed—two of them were in a very dirty state, in a small cradle, placed together, asleep—I did not rouse them—I did not examine them; I just lifted a part of the clothes, and found it in a very dirty state, and left it alone—it was quite wet; everything belonging to the cradle was wet and saturated—the children looked very thin, and were soundly asleep—I examined them again, casually, at the Police Court, the same day—I noticed one of the children very torpid indeed—its mouth was parched, and partially open; the lips were separated—I told the Magistrate I be-lieved the child was then under the influence of a narcotic—that was my opinion—I did not observe that the others were so torpid as that—they were afterwards taken to the workhouse—when I saw them at the prisoner's house, they had ordinary feeding-bottles beside them, with tubes reaching to the mouth—I am speaking of the four—I did not especially examine the contents of the bottles at that time; I looked at it, and pronounced it to be a mixture of corn flour and water—I examined them more particularly at my own surgery, afterwards; not the same day, I should think a week afterwards—I noticed that some of them were sour when they were lying by the side of the children; one particularly I smelt, and it was sour—I unfastened the stopper at the time and smelt it—I did not see anything against the kind of food that was in the bottle if it was sweet, it <hi rend="italic">would</hi> do occasionally to give a little corn flour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and medical officer of the Lambeth Workhouse—on the afternoon of 13th June, nine children were brought there—I was there at the time—three of them were from two to three years old, as near as we could guess; the others we con<lb></lb>jectured to be from three weeks to eighteen months old, or it might be rather more—having no names for them they were numbered from 1 to 9—Nos 1, 2, and 3 were subsequently claimed and removed—they were the elder tnes—they appeared to be in very fair health; I did not discover that there was anything specially the matter with them—Nos. 4 and 5 were the next eldest, the younger about eighteen months and the other rather older—a claim has been made to one of them, but they are still under my care—they are very much better—they were not in good health when admitted, far from it, but they have recovered surprisingly, and I think are now out of danger—as to Nos. 6, 7, 8, and 9, the youngest was about three weeks old, and the eldest about three months; they have all died—the first that died was No. 8, a female infant, she died on 23rd June; No. 6, a male infant, died on 26th June; No. 9, a female infant, on 5th July; and No. 7, a female infant, on 11th July—No. 8 we judged to be from three to fire weeks old at the time of admission, on 13th June; it was in a state of great emaciation, and very puny—there were marks of recent thrush about the buttocks, and thush was also present in the mouth and throat; it was in a condition of torpor, inanimate—when I saw it, it had been washed by the nurse—there was a peculiar glazed look about the eyes in the whole four, but in this child especially; the pupil not answering very well to light—the great emaciation was ostensibly attributable to want of sufficient and proper nourishment; and the torpid inanimate condition I believe arose from its being under the influence of some soporific drug—the children were exclusively under my care from the time of their admission to the time of their death—I saw them daily, and several times a day—the first child for the first two or three days appeared to get better under the stimulus of plentiful food; subsequently it rapidly succumbed—the symptoms were occasional sickness, and almost continuous diarrhoea,</p>

               <p>which I was unable to arrest—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examina<lb></lb>tion, on 24th June, the day after the death of the child—it was about 22 in. in length; the body and limbs were much emaciated, but there were no marks of violence—there was still the appearance of recent thrush about the bottom part of the person—on opening the head, there was found great congestion of the whole brain structure, both externally and internally the membranes also showed the signs of infor<lb></lb>mation; the dura-mater was glued to the skull in some portions, so that it could not be separated, which is an unusual occurrence—those appearances confirmed the view I originally took of the cause of the symptoms—the child weighed nearly 5 lbs.; it was weighed shortly after admission, and again at death; there was not very much difference—the ordinary weight of such a child would be about 12 lbs.—No. 6 was from three to four months old—when admitted it was in a very puny and emaciated condition; the weight takes almost immediately after admission was 6 lbs. 15 ozs.—a child of that age should not have weighed much less than 20 lbs; its length was about 26 in.; it was also suffering from thrush in the same way as the other—the nervous condition was torpid, the eyes having the glazed appear<lb></lb>ance before described, and there was very little animation about it—it took its sustenance greedily at first, but subsequently the same change took place as in the other; it failed—the alimentary canal was continually disturbed, sickness, and curded slimy dejections—I was present at the post-master examination of that child—I attribute its condition to the same cause as that of No. 8, want of proper and sufficient food, and also a congested state of the brain—No. 9, a female infant, was not so emaciated as the preceding two; its condition, as regards the nervous system, was more lively, and the pupils were not contracted when I observed them—I supposed that child to be from four to five months old—it was emaciated, but, compared with the others, it did not strike the observer so forcibly—the weight of this child, as of all, was not more than that of a new-born child it was about 10 or 11 lbs.—it was weighed soon after admission, not on the day—it had a great deal of diarrhoea; that existed on its admission, and continued <hi rend="italic">with</hi> slight intermission, conjoined with occasional vomiting, up to its death—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of that child; there was con-gestion of the brain, and also effusion in the ventricles of about an ounce of fluid—I ascribe the death of that child to the congested and inflamed state of the brain, associated with emaciation and diarrhoea—I ascribe the emaciation to want of sufficient nourishment previous to admission into the work-house—from the appearances noticed in this child I could not speak pon<lb></lb>tively as to the brain having been congested at the time of admission—No. 7 was supposed to be about from three to four months old—I am not certain of the weight of that child at the time of admission; the weight taken at death was 41/2 lbs., but that would hardly indicate what it was on admission, it was so very emaciated—it appeared very ill upon admission, and was suffering from profuse diarrhoea, which was visible upon examina-tion—this child had thrush worse than any of the others, it was quite raw with it, in a fearful condition—they all had slight signs of stupor, with glazed eyes and inanimate condition, but this and the preceding one were not so much so as the two first that I have mentioned—I always connect the occurrence of thrush with the existence of an improper or insufficient dietary; I never knew thrush to arise from any other cause, either through the mother, when at the breast, or when brought up by hand—there was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187009190125"></xptr>
               <p>also a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination in this case; the brain was in a much better addition than the others—the cause of death in this case was supposed and believed to be from mesenteric disease, which we found after death—there was an enlargement of the alimentary canal, and induration of the glands—that might be the direct result of insufficient food and nourishment nothing is more common than the result of mesenteric disease, from neglect or insufficient food—none of the children, as far as I could judge, would weigh the proper weight of a new-born infant—from the state in which they were when they came in, I should say they must have been poorly for at least ten days or a fortnight, if not more—they were undoubtedly so poorly that they would urgently require medical attention and care—from the position I hold I have had large experience in the treatment of infants taken from their mothers and brought up by hand—I think the baris of all proper food for infants must be milk, either pure or diluted, according to the age—some farinaceous substance should be added as it grows older—I think a quart of diluted milk per day and night would be suficient for a young infant; half pure milk and half water; that would be sufficient up to perhaps six weeks, after that a larger quantity would be Necessary—I think a pint of new milk, diluted to a quart, would be suffi<lb></lb>cent for a very young infant, every twenty-four hours, with some form of sugar admixed, and I do not object to a little arrowroet.</p>

               <p>breast it is common—when the attempt to bring up a child by hand fails, thrush, diarrhoea, and consequent emaciation is the result, and frequent con<lb></lb>vulsions, and affections of the nervous system—as to one of the children, No. 9, I did not observe congestion of the brain at the time of admission, yet there was considerable congestion at death—possibly it might have been produced while it was in the workhouse—congestion of the brain, I am bound to state, is a very common occurrence with children, and it may re-sult even from advanced thrush, and from prolonged diarrahcea; it <hi rend="italic">may</hi> occur entirely unconnected with the use of any narcotic—I do not think the congestion I found in the others might have been the result of thrush and adiarrhoea—in two of the cases there was a result from inflammation, an adherence of the membranes, that must have taken some considerable time; and in the youngest, the first admitted, there was not time for that result to have taken place, at least in my opinion—there was not an unusual num<lb></lb>ber of children dying in the workhouse about this time—I daresay then may have been six or eight deaths in the course of May, June, and July, in addition to those I have named; possibly you are alluding to some esta<lb></lb>blishment connected with the workhouse, but upon that I cannot speak of my own knowledge—children were sent out from the workhouse, and, for aught I know, they are so still—I believe, with the consent of their mothers, a certain number are removed from the breast to some' establish<lb></lb>ment at Pimlico, conducted by Miss Broughton—I called the attention of the Board to having heard of an unusual mortality there—I did not know it of my own knowledge—I believe some of the guardians went and inquired into it—I do not know the result.</p>

               <p>Friday night before they were taken—that child was taken to the work-house, and died in the workhouse—that came on the Friday, and she was taken the following Monday—it had its food on the Saturday—Mrs. Waters brought that child about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—Mrs. Waters seemed to be fond of children; four of them used to sleep with her—I have seen her carrying them about sometimes, not very often, and washing them—she washed them all every morning, except Miss Cowen's child, and that she said was too ill to be washed—she seemed fonder of that child than the others—I have seen her nurse it—I told her on one occasion that it looked ill—it was very ill one day, and she sent for the doctor, at Denmark Hill; it was Dr. Harris—he came in the evening, and the child was shown to him—I was in the other room, taking care of the children, when he came, and Mrs. Ellis took the child in to show him—she was in the room with him about ten minutes—he brought it some medicine; it was like water—the medicine was given to the child every morning by Mrs. Waters, a teaspoon<lb></lb>full of the mixture, by itself—there was no other medicine given—she used to send for some brandy sometimes—I used to see her mil up a little drop for the children, about a teaspoonful in a wine-glass of water—she used to give that to the children, with a spoon—she said the child was ill; that was Cowen's child—she used to give the medicine to the child in the morn<lb></lb>ing and in the night, twice a day, for about a week—the child did not seem to get any better; nothing seemed to do it good—she used to mix up a little isinglass with some sugar, sometimes, and give it to it—I used to mix the corn flour, and put it in the bottle—some hot water was put to the milk, to warm it, and some sugar—I used to give it to the children myself—Mrs. Waters might give it to Cowen's child sometimes—she would have the child on her knee, and it used to be lying on the sofa—the bottles were laid on the sofa, by the side of the children; and when they wanted it I used to put the teats in their mouths—Mrs. Waters said the lime water was put in the milk to keep sickness away from the children—Mrs. Ellis did not seem to approve of it—the children were dressed before they were taken away—they had as good clothes as she had to put on them—they used to have flannel on, and a nightgown and a shawl—I mean the four children that were taken away at night—they used to be wrapped in a shawl, and sometimes one of them would have a cape—they were com<lb></lb>fortably wrapped up—when they were brought down in the morning they were laid in the front kitchen, on the sofa, and they were taken into the back kitchen and washed, and carried up again at night—I earned them up sometimes, and sometimes Mrs. Waters, and put them to bed—the children that could eat bread food were fed three or four times a day—that was the elder children—the babies were fed once or twice a day, and then they used to have their bottles—they used to have corn flour very thick, and fed with a spoon—I have seen Mrs. Waters give Cowen's child corn flour with a spoon—Cowen's child got very ill after a day or two, and did not seem to improve—the medicine the doctor gave it did not seem to do it any good—it had a little cough—I used to go over to the baker's for sponge cakes—some<lb></lb>times I got a penny sponge cake for one of the children, and sometimes I used to go for <hi rend="italic">sally lunn</hi> cakes—I used to pay a penny for that, and some<lb></lb>times 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not do that every day, very often—I used to sop it, and give it to two or three of the infants, who used to eat sop, some of them that died in the workhouse—I used to give sop to them—the child that came on the Friday night had milk and corn flour.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Rye Lane, Peckham, and am a member of the Royal College of Physicians, of London—I professionally attended Mrs. Waters from 22nd September, 1868, to the beginning of this year—I left off attending her about a year ago, and have never seen her since—I have been called in to see infants that were ill, when she lived in the Bournemouth Road, and have prescribed for them—I never saw any<lb></lb>thing in her conduct but uniform kindness and motherly solicitude—opiates should never be ordered for children—of course, they are sometimes ordered; but under very peculiar circumstances—infants, are so wonderfully sus<lb></lb>ceptible to the effects of opium, it kills them like a shot, almost—there is a mixture called paregoric elixir that is sometimes given, a soothing syrup, that contains a small proportion of laudanum, two grains or a grain in an ounce, or something of that sort—that is given frequently; but very wrongly—I do not hold with giving children any opiates—women will do so upon their own responsibility; but medical men do not—paregoric elixir is prescribed for some children for cough, and, as a soothing medicine; if given in excess, it would produce narcotize, stupor—if children, suffering from an overdose of an opiate, rally for two or three days, I should de<lb></lb>cidedly think they had got over the stupefying effects of it; reason and experience teaches that—I have not heard the medical evidence in this case—if the stupefying effect of laudanum passes away quickly, the patient invariably recovers—lime water, properly made, is used to check the acidity of the milk—I have heard the evidence about the lime water; it was im<lb></lb>properly made—it would not have been improper to put a dessert spoonful of it in the milk, if it had been correctly made—this was too roughly made—there would be nothing positively injurious in it—it would have the effect of neutralising the acidity of the milk.</p>

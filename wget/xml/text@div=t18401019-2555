                  </hi>. I am a wine-dealer, and live in Milton-street, City. On Tuesday, the 29th of September, I was in Old-street, near the corner of the City-road—I saw two wagons coming along empty from Shoreditch Church, towards Goswell-street, following each other—the first had four horses and the other three—they were trotting at the rate of four or five miles an hour—I cannot say that I saw the drivers—I might have seen them, but not to take notice of them—the wagons passed me, and I heard a scream when the last wagon was five or six yards past me—the scream was in the direction of the last wagon—I looked and saw a woman on the ground in the road, a few yards behind the last wagon—I went up to her, and she was dead—two or three went up before me—I did not see any marks on her, nor any blood—she was about six feet from the curb-stone</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184010190106"></xptr>
               <p>—the wagons had passed over the spot where the body was—I had not seen her before the wagon passed—I saw the driver of the first wagon, but I do not think I saw the driver of the last at all—I heard a cry of "Stop," two or three times—I believe that was made by the hind wagoner—I do not know who the wagoners were—I saw no other carts or carriages in the road—the horses did not appear to be startled at all, nor running away—I and three or four more carried the woman over to Mr. Perry, a surgeon, very near the spot—her body was examined—the surgeon tried to bleed her, but very little came indeed—the body was then conveyed to St. Luke's workhouse—I saw the prisoner at the station-house—I cannot lay whe<lb></lb>ther I saw him before, but my attention was not directed to the wagon—I was looking in at a shop window.</p>

I was at the corner of Old-street, coming up Featherstone-street, at the cigar shop, and could not cross the road on account of two wagons—I then looked towards Finsbury-square, and had not been looking long before I heard a scream, I looked round, and saw the woman lying between the two wheels of the hind wagon, which was then going on—I saw the hind wheel pass over her body—an omnibus came up after the accident—the wagons were trot<lb></lb>ting—I am no judge of the speed of horses, but should think they were going at between five and six miles an hour—I did not see the Carmen—the wagon stopped as quick as possible—I could not see who stopped it—the woman was taken to Mr. Perry's, but was dead—I did not see the car<lb></lb>man at Mr. Perry's—I did not see the prisoner till I went to the station-house to give my address—I had not seen any thing of the woman before she was under the wheel.</p>

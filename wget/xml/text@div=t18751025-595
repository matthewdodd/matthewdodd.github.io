                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Benjamin Pardon, of Lovell's Court, Paternoster Row—on the 8th October, about 6.30, I was a few yards from the court when I saw two men (of whom the prisoner was one) with a barrow, on which were five reams of paper—I knew the paper, and I asked the prisoner where he was going to take it to—they were covering the paper with sacks—he said he was going to take it to some firm in Holborn; I think it was Poole's—I asked him where he got it from, and he said from Blackwood's, up Lovell's Court—there is a publisher there of that name, about 30 yards from us—I went back and looked into our premises, being the first door on the left up Lovell's Court, and I found the reams had been taken away by the way they had been stacked—I went back and overtook the two men with the paper at the-corner of Ivy Lane—they had taken the paper away—I said they had better come back and explain to Bhickwood's, because I believed it was out of our premises—the other man came back with me, and I turned round to go up <hi rend="smallCaps">THE JURY</hi>. and he turned away in an opposite direction, and I saw the prisoner running away with</p>

               <p>the barrow of paper, and I ran after him and overtook him, and gave. him into custody—the value of the paper is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had not seen the prisoner before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> When I told you the other man had run away, you told me to come up the road and see if I could find him—you asked me to go with you—you left the barrow and I got somebody to mind it, and walked up the road in search of a constable—you appeared to be sober—I did not see you take any paper; I said you had stolen the paper from seeing you in possession of it—you told the policeman that you were employed by the other man; I don't know anything about your understand<lb></lb>ing that the party was employed at my place—I did not know the other man; I should not know him again.</p>

I was on duty on the day in question, and saw the last witness with the prisoner at the end of Pater<lb></lb>noster Row, by Cheapside—the barrow was at the other end—the prisoner was given into my charge—I said "You will have to go back with me"—he said "I don't know anything about it"—I said "Do you know the other man?" and he said "No, I met him on the Viaduct; he said had some waste to move from Blackwood's in Paternoster Row, and I told him I would do it, and he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he took 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from his pocket and said "This is the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he gave me"—I asked him whose the barrow was, and he said the other man's; he didn't know anything about it.</p>

At about 7.45 on Friday night, the 8th October, I went to the prisoner's cell, when I found him suspended by this bit of string (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to the bar of the gate—I opened the gate and he broke down—he was much exhausted—in the course of a minute or so he came to himself, and said "All right, all right."</p>

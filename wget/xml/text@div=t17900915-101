The two prisoners at the bar robbed me of twenty silk handkerchiefs: they came in both together; the woman asked to look at some Irish linen; and Brown came and stood by the window, near a parcel of silk handkerchiefs: I turned my back to them, to take down the cloth; when I had taken the linen down, she held the cloth up side ways, as high as my face, as if it was meant to prevent me seeing Brown, and held it up between me and Brown, that I might not see Brown; she held it for some time, and kept looking me full in the eyes; she said, it is strong cloth, but let me see another; I pulled down another, and then my back was again toward them; she served me the same way again; then she ordered me to cut one yard, which I did; when she came to the door, Brown then remarked to the woman, you have soon dealt, cousin; you sometimes make a long wrangling and jangling; and then they went out; and about a minute after I turned my face towards the window, and saw a vacancy between the silk handkerchiefs and the printed callico; a thought then immediately occurred to my mind, that the prisoners had robbed me; I then stepped to the window to see, and missed a large quantity of handkerchiefs; I believe about twenty, to the amount of five pounds or upwards; I having no one in the shop but myself, called my son down stairs, in hopes to overtake them; but before he came down they were out of sight; I ran after them, but could not see them; I saw them no more till the 22d of July, when in consequence of an advertisement in the paper I went to Bow-street, to see whether they were the same people or not: when they were re-examined I saw they were the prisoners at the bar; I know them to be the same: I never saw them between May and July: I went that evening to enquire if I could hear or see any thing of them, but could not.</p>
               <p>Court. What time of the evening was it? - It was in the evening, after candle light; I suppose about nine o'clock, or past; I had seen these handkerchiefs before, a few minutes, because I had been looking at them; it may be a quarter of an hour, or half an hour, or more; I had been in the shop from the moment I saw them till the moment they came in; and I am sure there were no more customers in the shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Smith's Counsel. The woman paid for what she bought, and went away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you went to Bow-street, you expected to find the persons, from the advertisement? - I went to see whether it was the same or no.</p>
               <p>You expected to see the same persons that robbed you? - Yes, I did; I thought there was a similarity in the mode of robbing.</p>
               <p>Did you run after the people as soon as you missed your handkerchiefs? - I did as soon as I had called my son.</p>
               <p>The woman looked at the cloth, and told you to cut off a yard, and paid for it, and went away? - She looked at it in a very aukward manner.</p>
               <p>That is according to your suspicions; were I to look at cloth I should perhaps look at it aukwardly.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you ever see the two prisoners before they came to your shop? - Not that I know off.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Salmon's-lane, Ann's-court, Limehouse, and am a labourer. On Thursday evening, the 19th of Jan., I met a man named Sullivan, whom I knew at the West India Docks—he took me to a room where the three prisoners were—I understood it was Twine-court—I and Sullivan sat down in the room—Brian sat between me and Sullivan—Sullivan asked if I would have any beer, and I gave him sixpence—I had six half-crowns and sixpence in my trowsers' pocket—I took a sixpence out of my purse, and put it back into the lin<lb></lb>ing of my hat, which I put on—Sullivan went out for the beer, and while he was gone Brian got up, knocked my hat off, made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at the purse, and took it ith her—I got up and took hold of her behind by her dress—Hayes and Da<lb></lb>ley got hold of me, dragged me on the floor, and Brian ran down stairs—they separated me from her—when she had got out they let me go—I followed out of the house, and when I got out I saw all three going towards a public-house—I seized Brian in the street—I said it was a shame for her to take such a poor man's money—she called out to the others to catch hold of me, to keep me away—I had hold of her by the right hand—the other two seized hold of me, and got my right hand from her—I laid hold of her left hand then, and while I was holding her hand, Daley cut me with a knife—I saw a little of the knife in her hand—I went to the station—on the Monday following I found the prisoners at a public-house, and gave Brian into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist. The prosecutor came to my house on the following evening—I saw a cut between his third and little fingers, rather better than a third of an inch deep, or from that to half an inch, and half an inch long—it was such a wound as a knife might make—it was not a dangerous wound; I should say it was such a wound as a man might get in a scuffle, without any deliberate attempt—the knife must have been in<lb></lb>serted between the fingers—that was the only cut he showed me, and I believe that was the only one he had—no injury of any sort could arise from such a wound—it was not likely to produce any grievous bodily harm.</p>

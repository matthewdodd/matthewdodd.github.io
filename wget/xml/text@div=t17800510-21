             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Charlton. On going into my master's pantry, on the 14th of April, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I found the prisoner behind the pantry door; he asked me for some person, whose name I do not remember; not knowing his person, and seeing that a pair of candlesticks and a table-cloth were removed from the place where I left them, I suspected he had no good design there. I prevented his going out of the pantry, and called one of my fellow servants; upon his coming up the prisoner took these snuffers and the stand from under his coat and put them on the dresser.</p>
               <p>Did you see him? - I did; they were left on the dresser to carry up into the parlour after dinner.</p>
               <p>(They were produced in court and deposed to by the witness.)</p>
               <p>How did he get in? - The area door was left upon, and the other door was not locked; he had two doors to open.</p>
               <p>What did he say for himself? - He behaved rather insolent to my master at first, and said he wanted somebody.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am a hair-dresser by business; I came there to enquire after a servant, whom I taught to dress hair; he was to give me a guinea. I met him by accident; he said he lived at St. John Charlton's, Esq. in Berner's-street; he desired me not to knock at the door but go down the area and open the door and go in; the gentleman called his servants about me, and asked if I knew any of them? I told him they were neither of them the persons.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and live at 92, High Street, Shad<lb></lb>well; where I have carried on the business of a tobacconist about 12 years—the prisoner keeps the Globe and Pigeons opposite—I leave instruc<lb></lb>tions with my daughters what they are to do with coin—on 29th March I had just come in, and the prisoner's wife came over very excited, and I heard her say to my daughter that she ought to be more careful and not bring bad money over there—my daughter said "What is the matter?"—Mrs. Sampson said "Why it is a bad one, you ought to be more care<lb></lb>ful"—I said "What is the matter, Mrs. Sampson?"—she threw a crown piece down on the counter, saying that it was a bad one, and told me to bring five good ones for it—she went out, and on Sunday, 31st March, I was very ill, but I got up and dressed myself on purpose to go over and see the prisoner—I bade him good morning, he asked me how the sciatica was—I said "Very bad, and I should not have got up if it had not been for the five-shilling piece; it is a very unpleasant business; I should like to settle it; I want no bother, and under the circumstances let us go half a piece"—he said "No, I will have all or none"—nothing else took place till 9th April, as I was ill in bed; the prisoner then came over to my shop and saw my wife—I was sleeping in the next room, with the door open—I heard him say "Now, Mrs. Cambden, I have not come to tell you I am going, I have been to Mr. De Rutzen, and he has autho<lb></lb>rised me, unless you pay me the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>, to call a policeman and give your daughter in charge in the usual way"—my daughter afterwards wrote this for me, as I was blistered that morning, and I signed it. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated April 9th, from the Witness to the Prisoner, stating that if he came any more with his intimidations he would take immediate steps to prevent him</hi>.) These words "92 opposite" at the bottom of the letter were not there when I sent it—they are not my writing—the prisoner said before the Magistrate that he wrote them, and then he denied it—on the next Wednesday, April 17th, I saw something exhibited in his window and went across and took a copy of it; it was "Notice, beware of red noses and utterers of counterfeit coin, for particulars enquire within"—my letter was also there and the words "Read the dishonest letter and sign"—but a piece of paper was pasted over those words—I never saw them uncovered—on Thursday the 18th the paper had disappeared, but the letter was still there, and a picture of a gorilla, of which this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a <hi rend="italic">fac simile</hi>—over that printed in red letters was "Red face, the spacious caravans are densely crowded and contain"—that has occasioned me a great deal of annoyance up to the present time and my business has suffered.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was born in that neigh bourhood, not 100 yards off—the prisoner has lived there 10 months—this figure of a gorilla is taken from Wombwell's handbill—I cannot point out any thing in it which is like me—I have not a red nose—there is no doubt that my daughter changed a bad five-shilling piece there—I had been on good terms with the prisoner—he bears a good character in the neighbourhood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's daughter—on 29th April, from instructions I received, I took a five-shilling piece to the Globe and Pigeons for change—I asked Mrs. Sampson to see that it was a good one, as it was to be changed for a man in our shop—she examined it in my presence, and said "Oh, that is good enough," and gave me the change—she did not put it in the trier, she bounced it on the counter—about a quarter of an hour afterwards she came to our shop and brought a crown</p>

               <p>—I do not know whether it was the same—she said that I ought to have known better than to have taken bad money over there, and not to come for change any more—she threw the crown on the counter, and said that we were to send five good shillings for it, and went out—on 9th April the prisoner came over and saw my mother—I heard him tell her that he had been to Mr. De Rutzen, not to think he was going—on Saturday, 13th April, I saw my father's letter in the prisoner's window, and a crowd there—the body of the letter was in my writing, and the signature my father's—the words "92, opposite," were not on it when it was sent—on 17th April I saw this in the window: "Read the dishonest letter and sign"—nothing was posted over it then—my father's letter was by the side of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service—on 13th April my attention was called to a crowd looking in at the prisoner's window—Mr. Cambden's letter was there and this notice along side it—I took this copy of it: "Beware of those with red noses and utterers of counterfeit coin; for particulars apply within. Read the dishonest letter of 9th instant, and sign"—that is a true copy—on the following "Wednesday I saw the same notice," Read the dishonest letter, "but that was cut off or else a piece of plain paper put over it—it was a blank—a crowd at the window made me notice it—my uncle's letter was in the window, and a gorilla placed alongside it with the words, "The spacious caravans are crowded and contain": that was placed so as to run on, "and contain yours truly, see opposite" (<hi rend="italic">The picture</hi>)—I served a notice to produce on the defendant, who said, "Do you think you are going to frighten me with that bit of trash? there is the letter in the window—" I said "Will you give it to me?"—he said "No; it is not likely."</p>

I live at Peabody Buildings, Shadwell, at the back of the prisoner's house—on 13th April I saw some people looking in at the window, and saw a notice and a letter—I believe this is a copy of it—it said, "For particulars, apply within"—the notice was still there on the Monday, and I applied within, saw the prisoner, and said, "What is the meaning of those papers in the window?"—he did not answer at once, but went away and served somebody else—he then jerked his thumb over his shoulder towards the window, and said, "This person opposite"—I said "Don't you think it is wrong to have them in the window?"—he said, "I know what I am about."</p>

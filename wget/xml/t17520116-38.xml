               <p>Q. Where was you going?</p>
               <p>E. Henley. I was going home over the Bridge; I had been at two or three places in the city.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you when he threw you on the ground?</p>
               <p>Henley. No, he never opened his lips; I did not look him in the face : I don't know that the prisoner is the man that took either of the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer to be rude with you?</p>
               <p>E. Henley. No, he did not; when we were there, my way was on the left hand; the gentleman turned to the right; he had not gone two yards from me, when the soldier catched hold of my capuchin; he turned short again, and what happened then I cannot tell, I was so frightened.</p>

            . I was calling the hour of eleven when I heard the cry of, Stop thief! I put my lanthorn down, and saw somebody by the light of the moon, running hard; the soldier walked by me, who I knew before; then I called out to the next watchman, named Piercy, to stop him, which he did; as we were taking him to Justice Lediard, I was behind him and saw him shuckle, shuckle, shuckle; presently this bonnet dropp'd from under his cloaths, and I took it up; we carried him to the coffee-house, hearing the Justice was there; (the bonnet produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutrix) it was a moonlight night.</p>

               <p>I had been drinking in Tyburn Road ; coming home I heard this woman scream out in a dark passage; she said, soldier, for God's sake, take me away from this man, for I don't know what he wants, whether to rob or ravish me; I went to look at his face, which he hid between his legs: this was at White-hall; I came back again, and another soldier came up to me and wanted to go to my lodgings; that soldier and I went together to Channel-Row; when I was in King-street, Westminster, I heard somebody make a sad noise in Parliament street, who made it I don't know ; I saw the young man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175201160037"></xptr> follow her that had been in the dark place with her; I went down to Parliament-street, and saw nothing of them, but as I got upon Channel-Row, she called out, Stop thief; I went down the Row along with them, and the watchman came and took me; I made a stumble and kicked that bonnet before me; then the watchman called out, he has dropped the bonnet from under his arm.</p>

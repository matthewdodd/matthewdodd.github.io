                  </hi>. I am a detective-officer—I was on duty in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood of St. Paul's about eleven o'clock on the morning of 25th January—I saw the prisoner coming towards me in a very hurried manner, with this parcel under his coat—he was very restless with it, pushing it up and walking in a very hurried manner—he turned up Chapter-house court into Paternoster-row and up Ivy-lane—I went after him, he was running; I ran after him—as he was crossing Newgate-street I overtook him, laid hold of his sleeve and said, "I am an officer, what have you got here under your coat"—he said, "I don't know what you mean, 'and began to struggle—I said, "I must see what you have got there"—he said, "It is samples of barege"—I said, "Where did you get them from"—he said, "From Brixton"—I said, "I must see what it is"—we had a struggle—I got hold of the parcel and took it from under his coat—a ticket was attached to the end of it, which he instantly caught hold of—I tried to get hold of it; he struggled very violently and broke from me a short time—I called for help and he was stopped by the witness Hardy, within a few yards—after some difficulty I got him to the station—he was searched—no money was found on him—he was asked his address, which he refused to give—I lost the ticket in the struggle; so many persons got round, I don't know where it got to—I saw that it was a ticket like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman in the employ of Messrs. Hitch-cock and Williams—I know this piece of Orleans cloth; it is their property—I identify it by my own writing here, and also by a particular piece Cut out for patterns to send to customers—we took stock the last week in December—this piece was then in stock—I have not seen it since, till the officer showed it to me—there was a ticket on it of this description—this ticket is made expressly for us in Paris—I have examined the stock sheet and find a piece missing of exactly this length—I can positively swear we have not sold it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you invariably erase all marks on papers of goods that are sent out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I could not say that no piece of cloth goes out that has had patterns cut from it—we send out goods with the tickets attached—I have sold cloth of this kind many times last season, but we never send out a short length with the ticket on—we have more than one piece in the warehouse of the same length—other warehouses keep cloth of the same kind—this is the particular mark I swear to, the figures "40"—I can't say I may not have put those figures on other papers in the course of a number of years—it is the custom in all warehouses to cut patterns—this is pecu<lb></lb>liarly cut—I was obliged to refer to our stock sheet before I missed any cloth—I have never seen you before that I know of—we never send out this class of article in the paper in which it is kept in stock; we always put fresh clean paper—we are in the habit of selling cloth to parties to sell again—I think I should object to sell to a hawker, unless he was a respect-able man—I had not seen this piece for upwards of three weeks—hundreds of persons might pass through the warehouse in that time.</p>

             sworn. I live in New street in the City road, I am a <rs id="t18061029-47-viclabel265" type="occupation">stationer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18061029-47-victim487 t18061029-47-viclabel265"></join>. On the 3d of October I left my counting house, and from thence I went to Doctors' Commons about six o'clock in the evening; I left Doctors' Commons about nine in the evening, and was going towards home. In Bunhill row two women accosted me, they asked me to give them something to drink; I consented. After some few words had passed, we went into the White Swan, Bunhill row, nearly opposite the Artillery gate; we had two glasses of gin and water there. After I had paid for it I went lower down with them to an adjoining passage (I beg leave to observe in the mean time, had I not taken a glass of liquor I certainly should not have submitted to have gone); I went to an apartment in <placeName id="t18061029-47-crimeloc266">Blue Anchor Alley</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18061029-47-crimeloc266" type="placeName" value="Blue Anchor Alley"></interp>

I was then solicited very strongly to stop all night.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay. - A. Not above an hour and a half from the time I entered the room to the time that I left the house, I had then twelve one pound bank notes, which I changed a check for at Smith's, a gold broach, and several other things. I even went to bed there; I had not been in bed long before my coat fell from a line where it was hung, I found my small memorandum book absent immediately, it was inside of my coat pocket, I made my alarm to the parties, the prisoner at the bar was present, there was a second person in the room, I heard her rush out immediately, I then searched for my umbrella, I found it absent, I repaired immediately into the street, and called for assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of your property again. - A. None, I could not get the watch; immediately I went to the watchhouse in Bunhill Row, to obtain a constable, when I returned to her apartment she was absent and a padlock was on the door; I continued my searching until one o'clock in the morning, without effect; the next morning early I repaired to the house, and was informed that she had not been home all night, I then found by difficult search that she was gone to her mother's (whom I did not know) at Brick Lane, I accordingly went in search of her, and met her walking down the lane with her mother, I recognized her immediately, I took her by the arm and told her she must go with me, she went with me and stood in the street some time while I got a constable; the constable secured her and brought her before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. How many women had you spoke to that night as you were walking along. - A. I do not believe that I had spoken to any person previous.</p>
               <p>Q. You were a little fresh. - A. It brought me to my recollection afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you stopped by any other women. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your book. - A. In my side coat pocket, outside; I rather suspected that the prisoner at the bar took it and gave to the other.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to accuse her taking it, the other woman might as well as her. - A. I admit it in one sense, but I do not believe it; I cannot swear that the prisoner took it, I do not think that the other woman took it, she was on the reverse side.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were upon the bed; you never found the other woman. - A. No.</p>
               <p>- sworn. I am an officer. I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner, I searched her, I found nothing at all upon her.</p>

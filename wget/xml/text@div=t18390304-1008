                  </hi>. I live in Porter-street, Soho, and am a coal-dealer. On the 2nd of February, the prisoner came about half-past nine o'clock, and asked for 71bs. weight of coals—she gave me a shilling—I gave her 101<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in change—I put the shilling in my mouth, and when she was gone I looked and found it was a bad one—I bent it and put it on a shelf—I then put my hand into my pocket, and found I had three more bad shillings—I put them on the shelf, but I did not mix the one the prisoner gave me with them—she came again the same night, about half-past eleven o'clock—she asked for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of coke, and gave me another bad shilling—I asked her if she had got another—she asked what I meant—I said, "Another shilling, this won't do"—I gave her in charge—I gave the two shillings to the policeman—I had not seen her till that evening, but I took such notice of her on the first occasion as to be able to say positively she is the same person.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 90.) I was catted to the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's, and took the prisoner. I got five shillings from the prosecutor, but two of them were separate from the rest—the last one the prosecutor received bad a hole punched through it in my presence—nothing was found on the prisoner, but in going along in King-street, Soho, she put her hand into her bosom and put it to her mouth—I caught hold of her by the throat, and some hard substance went through her throat, but I could not tell what it was, it appeared to me that she swallowed something.</p>

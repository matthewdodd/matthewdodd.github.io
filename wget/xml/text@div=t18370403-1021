                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Lewis Garrett, who keeps a public-house in Clare Market. The prisoner came in on the 30th of March—he is a customer there—I know him very well—he called for half a pint of beer—it was between seven and eight o'clock in the morning—the baker came in for change for half-a-crown—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and while I was counting six pennyworth of halfpence, the prisoner took up the half-crown, and ran out—I saw him running down the street—he was sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner for an insult, and asked him what he did with the half-crown that he took from Mr. Garrett—he said, "I merely took it for a lark, I meant to return it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went there for half a pint of beer—a man came in who had left a book for a pot of beer, and he said to me, "Sheen, is this book of any value?"—I said, "I do not know, I will go down Castle street, and see if it is"—while he was changing the half-crown I had my back to him—I walked out to go to Mr. Potter's to see what the book was worth—I and the baker went on, and returned to the public-house in half an hour, and Smith said, "Some of you took half a crown;" and then he went to the baker, and said he took it; and when I was taken, he said it was me.</p>

In July last, the family were at the country house at Harlow, in Essex; the cook and the prisoner were left in town; the groom went to Essex, leaving his wife in town - our port wine was kept in quarts and pints. In consequence of what Mole told me, I went with her to the prisoner's room in our house, and found a quart bottle in his box, about half full of port wine. I told him he had better tell the truth. In consequence of what he said the officer went to Mrs. Grigg's close by. One set of the cellar keys were kept in the cellaret, and another set in a private drawer of my father's room. I found that the key of the plate-drawer, which was in the prisoner's possession, would open the drawer next to the cellaret, and one ward had been altered to make it fit that where the keys were sometimes kept.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's cook, and have been so fourteen years - the prisoner and I were left in the house. In consequence of suspicion, I noticed the prisoner's motions, and thought I heard the lock of the cellar-door go twice; I opened the prisoner's box, which was locked, and the first time I opened it there were two quarts and one pint bottle in it.</p>

            . My husband is Mr. Sims's groom. About June the prisoner came several times to my house; he once brought two bottles of wine, and said he got them when the prosecutor's servants were packing up. He came again, and I told him to bring no more to my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dresser at the Surrey Theatre. I have known the prisoner between two and throe years—he was what is called a super<lb></lb>numerary at the theatre, and had a shilling a night—they have nothing to speak, only to go on the stage to fill up—on Saturday evening, 23rd Feb., I went to the theatre about 6 o'clock—the prisoner was there—we were together in one of the dressing rooms—he asked me to have a glass of ale—we went into the beer shop—I drank the glass of ale, and he imme<lb></lb>distely said he meant to take my life that night—I said, "Why? Don't he so silly"—he said, "For something you did to me It twelvemonth ago, and I don't forget it"—I said, "If you can tell me what I have' done, I will rectify it"—he said, "No, I shan't tell you; I know what it is, and I will have your blood to-night?"—he swore, and said, "So help me God, I will have your life to-night!"—I laughed it off—I afterwards went and fetched him to dress for his part, and he said, "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, I am very much obliged to you," and away he went—some short time afterwards he wanted to fight me for five shillings, and he said he was going to take my life and be hung for it, as his cousin was at Horsemonger-lane, if it was Monday morn<lb></lb>ing he did not mind, he would have my heart's blood—he followed me about the dressing room, and certainly, when he lifted up his hand, I turned round, as I thought he was going to put his threats into execution, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him away from me, but I paid no attention to it—after that I saw</p>

               <p>him before the glass, colouring his face with vermilion—after he had made up his face and combed his hair ready to go on the stage, he went outside the room, and said, "Blood for blood, I will <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for you to<lb></lb>night!"—in about ten minutes I had occasion to go out to receive some money of a man named Leonard, and while I was holding out my hand for the money the prisoner sprang from somewhere, and struck me across the head with this iron bar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a long iron bar, that he had been and got out of the property room—as the blow came he made use of some very bad ex<lb></lb>pressions—he made another blow across my head, but my hand was up and when I was down he struck me across the legs with the same bar—I be<lb></lb>came insensible.</p>

I was employed at the Surrey Theatre on Saturday, 23rd Feb.—about 9 o'clock that evening I went to the long room to receive my money—when I had got it, Hurcomb accosted me and said, "I will take some money of you"—he is the dresser for that room—I said, "Come outside and I will give it you"—he came on to the landing, and as he was on the stoop, holding out his hand, he received a blow across the head which felled him to the earth—I turned round and saw the prisoner administering a second—Hurcomb fell as he received it, and then he received a third somewhere about the hip, or lower—the prisoner said, "Take that, you b—"—I took the bar from his hand, and afterwards gave it to the police<lb></lb>man.</p>

I am a surgeon in the Westminster-road—I was called in to the prosecutor about half past 8 o'clock on the 23rd—he was very faint, and had an immense scalp wound right to the bone—it was a dangerous wound—there was also a bruise on the inner part of the right ankle and on the left wrist—I have attended him ever since—he was in a precarious state for some days—he is recovering now—such a bar as this would inflict the injury I saw.</p>

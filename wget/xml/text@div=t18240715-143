               <p>"Proteus or the Life of an Actor," as I understood from my lad; I told him I had not, but would procure them by the evening; he said, he would call in the evening; I said he should be sure to have them. About nine o'clock that evening, I was shaving myself in the parlour, a knock came at the door, I immediately put on my coat and went to the door and opened it; when the prisoner entered, and asked if I had now got him the books; I said, I was extremely sorry, that I was particularly busy, and had not; but if he would wait in the shop a few minutes I would send my lad for them into the next street to Mr. Arnold, who published them - I sent the boyand gave him I think 8 s.; he was gone about ten minutes, during which time I entered, into conversation with the prisoner, as to the state of the weather, or some trivial thing; my lad came back and said he wanted more money, as there were four numbers out instead of three; I then gave him 2 s. more, he went for them, and was gone full ten minutes more; the books were then brought and handed to the prisoner; when he took them in his hand, he said,</p>
               <p>"I thought there was but three numbers out, what are they a number," I said, I believed 3 s. 6 d. but the price was marked on them; he said, he thought they were but 2 s. 6 d. - I replied, I could make no mistake as the price was on them; he said,</p>
               <p>"No matter, what will they amount to;" (putting his hand into his pocket as I thought with intention of paying) I said 14 s.; he then asked if I had the tragedy of Cato; I said I had not - he then asked, if I had the tragedy of Hamlet; I said No, for I had sold it a short time before - he then said, there was something else that he wanted, and waited about half-a-minute; he then said, it was some book that he had seen in my window; he reflected a moment, and said it was the</p>
               <p>"Farce of Blue Devils," it was just behind me in a glass case in the window. I pulled the glass case to reach it, and took it in my hand; this did not occupy the space of half-a-minute; I turned round to give it to him. when I saw him deliberately walk out of the shop - I did not feel surprised, thinking he was gone for some temporary purpose, as his appearance quite set aside suspicion. but in an instant I missed the books; I directly buttoned my coat up, ran round the counter and ran out into the market, but could see nothing of him; I returned and told the watchman; I did not see him or the books afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. How was he dressed - A. In a dark olive or pace coloured frock coat; a light waistcoat; a small key to his watch ribbon, and light coloured trowsers, which I think were cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. You expressed a wish for him to put his hat on - A. Yes, that I might be positive, though I am positive without that - I wish him to do it as he had his hat on in my shop. I saw him the first time for about five minutes; the last time was full twenty minutes. I am positive he is the man. [The prisoner here put on his hat.] I am still positive of him, though his hair appears darker than when he came to my shop, it appears to have been oiled.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you told us all that you have said about him, on any former occasion - A. I have.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not state at Marlborough-street, that he appeared to wear an artificial colouring on his cheeks - A. I did so, I had forgotten to state that to-day; I did not say it was on Thursday, the 25th of April - I said it might be on the 25th; but I could not positively state, but owing to a memorandum I made in the common day book, when I got home - I could positively state the day - I stated so at Marlborough-street, it was taken down as not a positive thing; I went to Mr. Abrahams, and told him I was mistaken and that it was on the 29th; I did not see the prisoner again till the 16th of June - I had never seen him except on this occasion; I desired him to put on his hat at Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it for satisfaction or what, that you desired it again to-day - A. For satisfaction, I should not like to swear to him without his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it with his hat on, or from seeing him in both states that you venture to swear to him - A. By seeing him in both.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the man who said if fifty juries acquitted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150059"></xptr>him you should die believing him to be the man - A. I am not; I have said, I should die convinced of him, but never mentioned about fifty people - I think he had a light striped handkerchief on; I noticed that when he spoke he had a peculiar twitch with his mouth; I did not mention that at Marlborough-street; I saw him talking with his friends there.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. You are quite positive as to the dress he had on - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you not said to Mr. Clark, that if 50,000 persons were to swear he was not the man who robbed you, you should not believe one of them - A. I have not; I might have said something inadvertently - I cannot be positive what I said - my lad is not here; he is only eleven years old.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a perfect opportunity of distinguishing the colour of his coat at that time in the evening - A. If I had I should have said whether it was puce or olive. When he called the first time it was so short I did not take notice - there was no light in the shop except one, which I brought from the parlour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In this case it is not in my power to prove an alibi. I have, however, solemnly to declare my innocence, and call your attention to the circumstance of the dress. I can give such an account of the proceedings of that day, as to make it impossible that I could have committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>MR. ABRAHAMS. I never in my life saw the prisoner wear an olive or puce coloured frock coat: he generally wore blue. I never saw him in a frock coat, except when he was in mourning, when I believe he had a black one. I have seen a person very similar to him near my house once, and once at Westminster - he might be mistaken for the prisoner, by persons not intimate with him.</p>
               <p>MR. FRAZIER. I never saw the prisoner wear a puce or olive frock coat.</p>
               <p>SUMMERS CLARK. Since the prisoner's committal I have had conversation with Mr. Veck; he said his opinion would be quite conclusive as to the prisoner's guilt, if 50,000 persons came to swear to the contrary. I never saw an artificial colour on his cheeks, or any alteration in his appearance, as if to conceal his identity. Since the prisoner's committal, I have seen a person so much like him that I could hardly know the difference, though I have seen him daily for months.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you see that man - A. In Princes-street, about three weeks ago - I was in conversation with a lady, (who knew the prisoner) at the time, and she remarked the same to me: he was standing in conversation with very respectable persons.</p>
               <p>MR. BING. I am the prisoner's guardian. I have seen him two or three times every week; I never saw him in a brown or puce frock coat: he generally advises with me before he has new clothes - I never heard of his having such a dress.</p>

            . I am a professor of music. Last Christmas, when the prisoner was out of town, I was going along Oxford-street, and met a young gentleman - I went up to him, and said,</p>
               <p>"How do you do, Mr. Robinson?" he turned to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"Ma'am, you are mistaken, my name is not Robinson," and to convince myself I called upon Mr. Abrahams that afternoon, to ask if he was come to town or not: I found he was not expected for some time. Any person might mistake him for that young man.</p>


               <p>JURY. Q. What sort of a coat had the young man - A. I do not recollect, only it was very similar to the prisoner's stile - I looked more at his face than his dress. I have dined at Mr. Abrahams's frequently with the prisoner.</p>

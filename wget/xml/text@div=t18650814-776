                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Limehouse—on Sun<lb></lb>day night, 6th July, about eleven o'clock, I was in Railway-place, Fenchurch-street, the prisoners Black and Stock wood caught me on each side—I looked round in surprise and saw them well; and when I was turning my face a taller man caught hold of my spectacles, took them off, grasped my mouth, and I was thrown backwards—I struggled—my watch chain was cut by the taller man or broken from the swivel—I grasped it, held it firmly, and called out as loud as I could—persons came to my assistance and the prisoners ran away—the tall man wore a cap but I did not see his face—the prisoners were afterwards brought towards me, and I identified Black and Stockwood—my mouth was bleeding—I missed some money and have been shown nearly the same sum since—I cannot say which of the three grasped my mouth, but Newton was the most active in all that occurred.</p>

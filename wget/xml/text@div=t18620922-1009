                  </hi>. I am a detective belonging to the Dockyard—on Monday, 1st September, I was on duty about a quarter to 2 o'clock near the gates in plain clothes—it was the day the Queen was embarking"—there was a crowd round the gates—I saw the three prisoners come from the direction of Charlton towards Woolwich—Jones went alongside of a female</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186209220119"></xptr>
               <p>and put his hand by the side of her dress, covered by the other two prisoners—Cain was in front of her, and Shaw was behind Jones—Jones then moved and came down towards Woolwich—when they got to the corner, opposite the' Dockyard, Jones again put his hand in a female's pocket covered by the other two, who were standing behind him—a cart passed, they were obliged to fell back, and I saw Jones' hand distinctly come out of the female's pocket—directly the cart had passed the crowd formed to the right again, and I saw his hand again go into the same pocket—I watched them two hours and three quarters, continually going to and fro—Jones attempted several other pockets, and I believe Cain did too, but I do not know—they were in a position that they must have seen what Jones was doing—just at the time the Queen's carnage was entering the Dockyard I saw Jones go up to the prosecutriz, the other two being behind him—there was then a little rush, and I distinctly saw Jones open hand go into the prosecutrix's pocket, and two seconds afterwards I saw it come out closed—he then immediately left the prosecutrix and went into a public-house opposite the Dockyard, close to where they were standing—I made inquiries of the prosecutrix, and in con<lb></lb>sequence of what she said I stood at the door of the public-house—Jones came out, pretending to do something to his trowsers—he crossed the road to the other two, and then, seeing me, they separated—he had then got his hand at the side of a lady's pocket—I got assistance and took them in cus<lb></lb>tody—I took Cain, and told her that it was for picking pockets—she said, "Do not handle me"—I took them into the yard, and they wanted to know what they were charged with—I said "Picking pockets"—I went into the back-yard of the public-house, got a light, and found a purse down the water-closet—the prosecutrix identified it in the prisoners' presence, who denied all knowledge of it, and of one another—I searched Jones, and found 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a half-crown, and 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, on Shaw one sovereign, 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, a duplicate, and a pair of spectacles; and on Cain 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper.</p>

I am the wife of William Whittington, a tailor, of 21, King-street, Woolwich—on Monday afternoon, 1st September, I was opposite the Dockyard gates, and in consequence of something Crouch said to me I examined my pockets, and missed my purse—I had felt it safe half an hour before—Crouch afterwards showed it to me—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was nothing in it except a paper when I lost it—I also know it by that paper.</p>

The prisoner was on my right hand. A gentleman's going in, left the passage clear, the prisoner chucked me as if to push to get forwards upon my right side, and I felt my watch going out of my pocket, I instantly seized the prisoner; he endeavoured to force himself from me; he was close to my right side when I seized him; he pulled me four or five feet. I said, you have got my watch; he said, he had not. Immediately I called the constable, who took him into the church-yard; immediately a boy, named

            , brought the watch into the church-yard to me, upon which the prisoner was taken to the compter. I am certain he was the person that took it out of my pocket, and I apprehend he dropt it on the ground. I have sent a subpoena to the boy's mother, but she would take no notice of it. I have taken some pains to get him here, but cannot meet with him; I imagine he is kept out of the way. (The watch produced in court and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible do you think for any body that was behind you to take it?</p>
               <p>Edlyne. He was so very close to me that I do not think any body could. I found none of the crowd press upon me but the prisoner, and the instant I felt my watch go out of my pocket, I instantly laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not another man have put his hand under your coat and taken it?</p>
               <p>Edlyne. I cannot swear that; I can absolutely take my oath, that it could not be any body behind me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>As I was going through the crowd, the gentleman charged me with taking his watch; I said, if you have any suspicion of me, take charge of me. He committed me to the constable, they took me to the church-yard. The watch was found on the ground out of the case, and the case upon the ground also.</p>

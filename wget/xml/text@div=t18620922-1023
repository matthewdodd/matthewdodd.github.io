I live at 17, Thomas-street, Lock's fields—on Wednes<lb></lb>day morning, 13th August, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was crossing the top of the Borough-road, and was knocked down by a female—I did nothing—I was insensible—when I recovered my senses I was in the station-house—I missed my bag, and had my trousers pockets torn; I cannot say what I had in them—I have not recovered my bag—I had not seen either of the prisoners before to my recollection—I do not know either of them—I felt sore at the back of my head next day—there are no marks there now.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 163). On this Wednesday morning, 13th August, about 2 o'clock or half-past, I was on duty at the top of the Borough-road—I saw the prosecutor come across the Blackfriars-road to the top of the Borough-road, and I saw Selby go before him and push him down—Bygrave came up directly, and said, "Wait a bit"—he walked round, took this life-preserver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of his pocket behind, and struck the pro<lb></lb>secutor once on the head, and several times on the shoulders—I was about five yards off, behind, in a doorway, waiting—Selby was trying to get at the pro<lb></lb>secutor's pockets while he was down, and Bygrave was striking him with this at the time—Selby tore both his pockets—I saw both the prisoners well, so as to have a good view of them—I knew them before; I had spoken to them that night before, and told them to go home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a teacher of music at Walworth—about 2 o'clock on this Wednesday morning I was crossing the Waterloo-road—I heard a voice sing out, "Do you call me wh—you beast," or something of that sort, and with that I saw the female' prisoner go towards the prosecutor and knock him down on his back—I made towards them, and then I saw the male prisoner standing over the prosecutor knocking him on the head, I could not say what with—I saw the female prisoner in a stooping position trying to rifle the prosecutor's pockets—I afterwards saw the constable come up, and saw him take the life-preserver and take Bygrave into custody—Selby walked away with the prosecutor towards the London-road, and she took him some short distance, which made me think at the moment that they were man and wife—I went with one of the policemen, and asked him, "Do you know this woman?"—he said, "No"—I am positive the prisoners are the persons I saw.</p>

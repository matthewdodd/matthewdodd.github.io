                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in the employment of Hugh Jones &amp; Co., of Wood Street—on the morning of 15th November the prisoner came into the silk department on the ground floor—he brought some patterns with him, which he wished to match—I showed him silks, but they were not near his patterns, and while I was getting some others he turned away from me—I afterwards saw him stopped, and this piece of silk (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) taken from under his coat—he had not left the warehouse—this piece of silk had been lying in a fixture on the top of some more goods—it is the property of Messrs. Jones, and is worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner had been at the premises on the Monday previous, and about three hours after he had left I missed a piece of black satin, worth about' 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—here are two pieces of paper, produced by the constable, which I recognize; and here is the buyer's mark on this piece—it is similar to the piece that was round the satin which I missed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This is a very large warehouse, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I swear to this piece of silk—I had seen it in the fixture a short time previous—we have some hundreds of pieces in the warehouse—I had not taken this piece out to show to the prisoner—the mark on the paper is a pencil mark—I can swear it is the mark of our buyer—he is not here—I had not complained to the police of the loss of the satin before the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service—I saw the prisoner in the silk room on this occasion—I saw him go to the fixture, take this piece of silk, and conceal it under the cape of his cloak.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have not been examined before to-day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was about five yards from Mr. Suter—I saw him take some pieces, open them, and cut some patterns—he turned his back to the prisoner to do that—the prisoner then went behind the pile of silks, and after looking care<lb></lb>fully round to see if any one was looking, he quietly took this piece of silk from the fixture, and put it carefully under his inverness, pulling the skirts of the inverness round him, so as completely to conceal it; and then he went back towards Mr. Suter—he was given into custody about a minute afterwards—after we charged him with stealing it, he said he was bringing it to have a pattern cut from it—there were other persons in the warehouse—there are, perhaps, 400 employed there—this was about 8.30 in the morning.</p>

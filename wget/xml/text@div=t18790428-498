                  </hi>. I am a solicitor at 30, Wellington Street, Strand, and was the solicitor for Mr. George Stevens, the present prosecutor, in the action of Stevens v. Claxton—I received instructions to take proceedings against, the prisoner, and served him with a copy writ with special endorse<lb></lb>ment—this is the original (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—he appeared in person to it, and I in due course took out summons under order 14 to sign judgment for want of a defence—I filed affidavit, issued summons, and obtained order at Chambers to show cause why judgment should not be signed—this is the summons, 4th March, 1878 (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—on the 6th March, the day the summons was returnable, the prisoner called on me at 77, Chancery Lane, and made a proposal that having sold the horses and not being able to get the money, and his position being precarious, he signed this memorandum: "I consent to an order for judgment for 123<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and costs to be taxed. John Claxton"—at Chambers, on attending summons, he repudiated it—I filed this affidavit by Mr. Stevens in support of the summons. (<hi rend="italic">This claimed</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for four horses purchased by the prisoner for</hi> 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">less</hi> 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">deposit, and that by letter (Exhibit A) the prisoner had admitted a balance of</hi> 123<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">to that affidavit this letter of the prisoner, dated October</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">was attached, marked A, stating that Stevens had brought to his (prisoner's) stables as livery, four horses, at</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per week, and ultimately agreed to sell them to him for</hi> 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">each; that he paid him</hi> 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">deposit, the balance to he paid when the horses were sold, but on examination they were found to be unsound, that he sold the bay mare for</hi> 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">the black horse for</hi> 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and the pair of chestnuts for</hi> 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and deducting therefrom for keep of horses</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">shoeing, commission, &amp;c.</hi>, 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and deposit</hi> 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">left a balance of</hi> 122<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">which the prisoner admitted to be due. The affidavit repudiated the plaintiff's claim of</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on the ground that the horses were unsound and unfit for use.</hi>) The result was that the Master made an order giving leave to defend; and that is endorsed on the</p>

               <p>summons—I felt dissatisfied at the Master's decision and appealed against it to the Judge in Chambers—Mr. Parkes attended on the prisoner's behalf, and the Judge made an order that unless the prisoner paid the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into Court within a specified time judgment would go against him—he never paid in the money or any part of it and we signed judgment—I wrote him a letter for payment but had not been able to obtain anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, at 5, James Street, Oxford Street—in September, 1877, I had four horses for sale, and saw the prisoner at Dorset Mews, and he said "If they are good ones I can sell them," and it was agreed that he should keep the horses for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week, and have 5 per cent commission for selling them, the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week to include man for cleaning and everything—I fetched the horses up from the country a few days after, and took them to the prisoner's place in Dorset Mews—he had them there some ten weeks, but did not sell them, and at last he agreed to buy them for 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including all expenses previously, and to charge nothing for keep and shoeing; it would have come altogether to about 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including keep, &amp;c.—he agreed to pay me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit on the following Saturday, and the balance, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., within a fortnight—he said he would either pay me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the Saturday after the deposit and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Saturday after that, or pay me the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. all together on the second Saturday—he paid me the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, I left the horses with him, and have never received anything since—I called on the Saturday for the first 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said he had not got it, but I do not recollect</p>

               <p>whether he said he had sold some of the horses—I called again for the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said he could not pay it because he had not got it—I had seen Mr. Sutton several times, and had called a dozen or twenty times to get the money or a part of it—my horses were not always there; the pair of chest<lb></lb>nuts were the last I saw there—I came to know Sutton through driving round there with Claxton—I first saw my bay mare in Mr. Sutton's brougham, but do not think I spoke to the prisoner about it—that was before Christmas in the same year—I did not go to see if Sutton had the horses till after the prisoner had made the affidavit—he had previously told me and a cousin who was with me that he had sold Mr. Sutton two of the horses, and when he got the money from Sutton he would pay me part of the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me he was going to send the other two horses to a Mr. Cooke at Liverpool, and I sent a telegram for him about them—I have had no money except the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit—in February, 1878, I instructed my solicitor to take proceed<lb></lb>ings against him to recover the amount, and handed him the prisoner's better which I had received as the basis of the action—he admits there that he sold the bay mare for 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the black horse for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in consequence of what I heard about' the summons and the affidavit! the prisoner had sworn I went to Mr. Stevens and made these copies (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of the two receipts he produced to me—I? was particular in copying them, and my brother-in-law, who was with me, read the originals over to me after I had copied them—I have never had a farthing to this day—I afterwards lost sight of the prisoner, and in consequence of something I saw in the news<lb></lb>paper I preferred this charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Was paid after the horses had been some 10 weeks in his premises, and the balance was to be paid within a fortnight, but when I called he either said he had not sold them or had not got the money—after calling 20 or 30 times I received this letter in 1877 that he had sold the horses, and in 1878 I look civil proceedings against him for the' balance due, and got an order, but we found that the prisoner had nothing—I do not know if the horses Were sent to Mr. Cook, of Liverpool—Mr. John Curtis is not my partner and has no interest in the horses—he has been in America 18 months—I said before the Magistrate, "Mr. Curtis was part owner of the bay mare," but I think I said at the same time that I had settled up with him and he got his share of the money—he had an interest in the bay mare till he went to America—I introduced the prisoner to Curtis—I know nothing of Mr. Cook, of Liverpool, but have seen him; I only know from what I have heard from other witnesses that he has been sued for the price of two horses, but I know nothing about the proceedings against him.</p>

             re-examined. The prisoner never accounted to me for these monies; he has taken out bread every day since, and brought the money home - I had not asked him about this money before I discharged him, and then I told his wife of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know he did not account for this money? A. By the book - that is not here; he was discharged on the 16th of September, and on the 23rd he was apprehended; if he had paid this money to me it would have been in the book - he has paid monies to my wife when I was not at home; he has very likely paid her 2l. - I have played at cards with him in the bake-house for a drop of drink.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you discharged him on the 16th of September? A. Yes; he had for seven days before that brought me no money from Mr. Potter; I go by the book; when I went round to my customers I gave Mr. Potter a bill for seven loaves, and he said, "I don't owe you a farthing - I have paid every day;" I could recollect he had not paid for some days, independent of my book -I know he did not pay this money from the other witness, because they had owed eight loaves for some time, and he paid three loaves off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He has not taken his scores regularly, but it has gone three or four days; if these persons have paid me, I am certain I paid it.</p>

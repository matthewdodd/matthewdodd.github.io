               <p>Q. Have you more up stairs than the attic - A. No, not on my own account; all I rent is the shop, parlour, and the sleeping rooms, which are the attics. I pay so much for the whole together.</p>

               <p>COURT. What time - A. A quarter after seven. I recollect sending my errand boy out about seven; I invariably set down the time when I send him out and I think it was about a quarter of an hour after I sent him out.</p>
               <p>Q. What attracted your notice - A. The alarm of glass being broken; at the moment I cast my eyes to the window I observed a man's hand inside of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the shop window - A. The shop window, especially at a tray; the tray contained gold chains to the amount of forty pounds, and upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that hand take the tray, or leave it there - A. He had some difficulty in taking it away, and it fell out of his hands, and at the same instant I saw that tray fall from one hand there was a second report of glass breaking at the shop window, at the next pane; I saw a man's hand taking out of one of the trays some gold seals; I then turned round to it, and took away those gold seals; there were seven taken away; I missed seven that night; I saw the seals taken out by that hand; I went round to the shop door, and gave the alarm immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your shop door fastened - A. Yes, it was fastened by a rope to the brass handle of the door, and to the scraper, and also to the rails underneath the shop window; I got out in two seconds, in consequence of the brass handle the rope was fastened to breaking by my force, at the instant I got out the prisoner Smith was brought in by a neighbour, Mr. Burne; I went in pursuit of the other robber; I left Smith in the custody of Mr. Burne, and went in pursuit of Harper.</p>
               <p>Q. You went in pursuit you did not know of whom - A. No, I did not. I went in pursuit of another from a description Mr. Burne had given me; I pursued him into George-yard, Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any man run - A. No, I did not see any man run myself; I came back to my house without having seen the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards did you go a second time - A. In about twenty minutes I went back to George-yard, Drury-lane, with Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance is George-yard from your house - A. About an hundred yards. On our entrance the second time into George-yard Davis identified the prisoner Harper, he was walking out of George-yard very slowly; I seized Harper.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you seized him - A. Yes; I called the officers to come and assist me, and they came up; on the approach of the officers Harper got one of his hands from me; I had hold of him; he put his hand into his coat pocket on purpose to throw the seals from him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you see they were seals - A. I felt them fall against me, and before they came to the ground one fell into the officers hands, and one into another person's hands; one or two of the seals came to the ground, which were afterwards taken up; I saw one fall into the officer's hands, and one into another person's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that gentleman here - A. Yes. I did not see the seals fall to the ground, nor I did not see them picked up.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the name of the street - A.Wych-street. I heard the call of stop thief, I flew out that moment, I saw a number of people running to the George-yard, the corner of Little Drury-lane; I enquired what was the matter; I found there had been a robbery; I got a light and went up George-yard, and searched, I could not find either property or person; I returned back to Mr. Hamley's shop, Jones was tyeing Smith; I hurried back to George-yard again, Jones, me, and Hamley, and several more.</p>
               <p>Q. What time elapsed to your return from George-yard, and going back again - A. Not more than five minutes. When I got back I just got under the gateway, I heard Jones say, Oddy, here is one of them; I ran to him directly, and found that he had hold of Harper's right arm; I immediately laid hold of the left, Jones gave his brother the other that he had hold of. We were taking him across a passage to take him into a public-house; I then observed him throwing something out of his hand; he threw away two or three seals, as I thought, one hit my thigh, it fell to the ground; I put my right foot upon it, and picked it up; this is it. Two others were picked up in my presence; there were four picked up altogether, two I picked up myself, and two the people picked up. I took them from the people, they have been in my possession ever since.</p>

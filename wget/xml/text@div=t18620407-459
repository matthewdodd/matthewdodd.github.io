               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Langham's Defence.</hi> I was at home in bed by 11 o'clock on the night of the robbery. They did not go and see whether I gave a right address, and whether I was at home in bed at the time I state. The prosescutor states that Sheehan was the man who had hold of him. I appeal to anybody in this Court whether the prosecutor could state, on his oath, if he saw a man with whiskers on that night, in a dark suit of clothes; and saw him again eight days afterwards without whiskers, and dressed differently; that he was the same man. He says he can speak to Sheehan better than to me. I saw the constable Gordon on Sunday night, afterwards: I was the man who spoke to him when he came in. I know every word he said to the landlady. I remained there that night until 12 o'clock. I saw him on the 27th, standing in plain clothes, in Seven Dials, and passed him within three yards. It is evident, if I was the man he intended to capture for this robbery, he would have taken me then. I was not the person. It is because, perhaps, I bear rather an indifferent character, I am selected as the victim of this case. I think Mrs. Donovan is here to prove that I was in bed.</p>

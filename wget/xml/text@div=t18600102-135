I am barmaid at the Globe public-house—on Tuesday evening, 13th December, the prisoners came between 7 and 8 o'clock—Derry asked for a pot of stout and put down half-a-crown to pay for it—I examined the half-crown and broke it with my teeth—I told Derry it was bad, he said "You are a liar"—he asked me to give it him back which I refused to do—I kept it in my hand till my master came down, and the prisoners were given in custody—I gave the half-crown to the policeman—I had seen the prisoners once or twice before.</p>

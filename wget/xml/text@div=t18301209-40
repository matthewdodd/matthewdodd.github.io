            . I am a sawyer. At a quarter before six o'clock that morning I was going to work, and went into this house; I saw the prosecutor drunk, standing with his back to the counter; I saw the prisoner put her hand into his left-hand pocket, and take something out- I told the landlord, who took her directly; I had not been in the house above three minutes before I saw it done- I cannot tell what money she took out, but I saw the landlord take some money from her; I do not know whether they had been together, or knew one another.</p>

The prosecutor had been there about ten minutes - I believe the prisoner had come in before him; I did not see the transaction, but I took her from the information of the last witness - she gave the money into my hand, and I gave her to the Policeman; she gave me two shillings, a sixpence, and 3 1/2d. in copper - I believe I have seen her before.</p>

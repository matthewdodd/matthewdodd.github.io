                  </hi>. I was in partnership with Mr. Buckland, at 5, Salters Hall Court, as estate agents—I first saw the prisoner somewhere about the middle of May, in reference to finding a large loan upon property that he then possessed—he gave me to understand that he was possessed of large property, that he was a member of the families of the Dukes of Abercorn and Hamilton, which we subsequently found to be correct, and that he was possessed of 250,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in India Four per Cents, and Egyptian Bonds—about the 15th June, he instructed to us sell out 60,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I never saw any bonds; we simply made arrangements with our broker to do so, and a day was fixed for us to hand the bonds over to the broker; but he did not bring them, he brought a person named Pryme, who he re<lb></lb>presented to be one of his trustees—the Austin property was mentioned about a week later; we introduced the property to him about 5th June, we asked him if he was open to buy any other property; he said he was, and after considerable negociation in which he shewed very great skill, we submitted the Austin property to him at 350,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he ultimately, agreed to give 336,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he signed a preliminary contract—he intro<lb></lb>duced Mr. Hemsley to me as his solicitor—about the 16th June, he asked me if I could oblige him by changing a cheque—he wrote out two cheques in our office, these produced are them—we gave him the exact sum 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I parted, with that money believing his statement that he was possessed of these bonds and this property, and that he had money at the bank—he said that Messrs. Barron &amp; Smith, on whom the cheques were drawn, were his army agents, and did his banking—the next day he wrote to us asking us not to use the cheque, that he would call on us—on 25th June, I saw him at his, then residence, 30, Blenheim Crescent, Notting Hill, and I went with him to Lancaster Gate, and met Mr. Austin, at the resi<lb></lb>dence of the late Lord West Dury—the prisoner gave me this letter; it was not brought to me by a cabman.

               <p>Mr. Tippett's property, which was in Paddington, it was necessary for him to have a local banking account, and he had opened an account at the City Bank, Paddington Branch—I gave him the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he gave me this cheque—I believed his statement when I parted with that money—I have never had a <hi rend="italic">rap</hi> or a fraction back—this cheque for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and this letter are the prisoner's writing. <hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>: "10th September, 1874.

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 23rd June</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">to the prisoner, and contained advice to postpone the purchase of the Tippett property for a week until the money market became more settled.</hi>) That refers to the selling out of stock—when I sold you Mr. Austin's property I was acting as your agent in that respect—if I sold the property I was to receive 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as commission from Mr. Austin, of which you were perfectly aware—after the 31st August, and after your cheque had been dishonoured, you still entertained an idea of being able to get the money; you led us to believe it was possible for you to do so, and we accompanied you to Messrs. Barker, Peek &amp; Bird—you went to Mr. Devon<lb></lb>shire, a solicitor, who wrote on his and your behalf to Messrs. Barker &amp; Co. about the property—after that letter was received Mr. Bird, as solicitor for Mr. Austin, drew out an agreement for the purchase of the property, adding 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the price; that was upon your representation that you were still possessed of this 250,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you never denied owing me this money; you were daily meeting me for the purpose of paying me, but I could never get it—you afterwards said you would have nothing more to do with me, for you found I had been opening your private letters—that was when I told you you were a thief and a scoundrel—I did not say I would go to Mr. Passingham's office, and let him know what had taken place—I did not go there direct; I may have called upon him on that day.</p>

               <p>afterwards saw him again, and he asked me to hold it over for a short time, as he did not wish so small cheque to be presented at the bank—I held it up to 18th July—on 18th July he owed me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more, and he then gave me this cheque for 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I returned the 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cheque to him—I believed there were funds at the bank when he gave me that—he asked me to hold that over for a few days—he continued using the brougham daily—about the latter part of August he showed me a paper, and said he had bought a large estate, Mr. Austin's property at Lancaster Gate, for which he was to pay or had paid 230,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 28th August he paid me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—I still held the cheque for 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at his request, and was holding it on 10th September—he frequently asked me when he came to the yard why I did not take some stables which were on the right hand side of the yard, and have a private yard—he said it would be a great advantage to me—I said I had not sufficient money to do so, and he-said he would advance me 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the usual interest; I think it was 7 per cent.—I did not ask him for that; it was a free offer on his part—I took him to Mr. Gray, my solicitor on that business—I believe that was on the 10th September—I heard him make a statement to Mr. Gray, and I was present when Mr. Gray gave him a cheque—at that time I believed he was a man of property, because I had seen the advertisements of certain por<lb></lb>tions of Mr. Austin's property having been sold, and the prisoner said he had bought that estate; I believed that statement most implicitly—on 28th September the prisoner gave me this cheque for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had incurred a further debt at that time, but I had stopped the carriage on 15th September—I told him I could not go on any further, as the amount was too heavy, and I refused to serve him for some time, and on the last Saturday in Sep<lb></lb>tember he met me and asked me to remove him to 50, Cambridge Gardens, and I continued to serve him until the 1st October, because he said the money would be forthcoming about 26th September from his rents, &amp; c.—he owed me 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and two guineas afterwards made it 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I have had nothing but the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 28th August.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an iron founder of 95, Upper Thames Street—I am trustee of the property of Mr. T. B. Austin, which was adver<lb></lb>tised for sale and which included an estate at Lancaster Gate—Sheffield &amp; Sons acted as solicitors for me, and the prisoner was introduced as an intend<lb></lb>ing purchaser—an appointment was made for 7th July to finish the contract—that was altered to the 22nd, and again to 29th July, as far as my memory serves me, first at 11 a.m. and afterwards at 3.30, at my place—the prisoner came there with somebody as his solicitor—he was to pay a deposit of 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that day—he wrote two cheques, one for 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 25,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at our place—we were to exchange contracts, but by advice I refused until the cheque was cashed—I paid the 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque into my bank, and after I had done so my solicitor got a telegram not to pay it in—I afterwards paid it in a second time and it was dishonoured—the property has since been sold to Mr. Bird—I had no further dealings with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> You did not press me to hand over the contract until I got cash for the cheque—I received this telegram from you "Don't present cheque for payment until Tuesday, when both will be paid. Wednesday. Cannot clear my draft before then. Have made an arrangement. Expect me to call Wednesday 12 sharp. Please don't fail my wishes"—I replied to you by this letter.

                  </hi>. I am master of the <hi rend="italic">Venus</hi>, trading from London to Newcastle. On Wednesday, 21st Dec., about 2 o'clock in the day, I came on to Tower-hill; as I came across, the prisoner Large asked me to be so kind as to show him the way to London-bridge; I told him I would show him as far as I was going—I was going to the Goal Exchange—he and I came across the hill, and in crossing Bear-lane, he said he was going in to have a glass of ale, would I come along with him—I told him my time was short, I did not wish to go; but by persuasion, I went with him into the Ship Afloat, in Bear-lane—Mr. Brown's name is over the door—Large went up stairs, and I followed him—he called for two glasses of ale; they were brought in and handed to Large, and stood on the table—another man came from the farther end of the room, and he showed to Large three nut shells—he said, "Those men who were sitting at the table, asked me what I called these, and I called them monkey skulls, which I brought from Gibraltar with me;" and he said to Large, "I will show you how I play with them"—Large sat down, and he asked me to sit down, and I sat down on his right hand—the prisoner Crane then came in, and sat down by the side of me; they did not appear to know each other—as soon as I sat down, he sat down on my right hand, and he got on playing with that gentleman who had the nut shells—I can hardly describe the play—there were three nut shells and a pea under them—I do not know whether Large began to play first, but one of them did—I do not know whether it was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at first—it was to know what shell the pea was under—one of the prisoners was betting with the man who was playing with them—I do not know which began first, but they both betted; one at a time—after that, Crane, who sat on my right hand, persuaded me to bet—he said, "You had better try"—I said, "I have only 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket; that is all I have—I betted the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and I won; I found the pea the first time—Crane then put a half sovereign into my hand; he held the money—the man the shells belonged to staked the other 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Crane then said to me, "You had better try again: try your luck, you are lucky"—the man that had the nut shells was shuffling them about all the while, and he said he would bet a sovereign that no one would find out where the pea was; so I betted the half sovereign, and I just put my hand on the shell where I thought the pea was, and there was no pea there, and I lost—I said, "I have got no more money now, I am done"—one then consulted with the other; they looked at one and then at another—I looked at them, and they looked at me, and Crane said he was a loser too; but he did not say how much, and I do not know how much—Large then put his hand in his pocket, and said to me, "There are two sovereigns I will lend you"—I took the two sovereigns—he just put them into my hand, and said, "I will lend you these two sovereigns, you are sure to win this time"—the player was shuffling the shells round at the same time, and showing me the pea—I saw it two or three times—he then said he would bet five sovereigns to one, or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that no one would find the pea—the two prisoners said, "Try," and I betted the two sovereigns, and there was no pea there—I then said I had no more money; I was done again; and I came out of the house, and the two prisoners came out too—I do not know what became of the player;</p>

               <p>I did not see him—I walked up a little towards the Coal Exchange, and I said I was going to get some money—Crane said he was going to draw some money; he was going to a friend of his, and he would come back again to redeem his loss, for it would not do for him to lose—I said it would not do for me to lose either; I would do anything to get it back again—Crane then left us, and said he would be back in half an hour's time to the Ship Afloat—I then went on to my coal factor's, and drew 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and five sovereigns—when I came out of the office, I saw Large standing in the gallery—I had told him I was going to draw 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he and I went back to the Ship Afloat—as soon as we got in and sat down the man with the nutshells came in, and sat down by the side of us, and I had no sooner sat down than Crane came in—Large called for two glasses of ale, and we began to play again, and took turn and turn about—I think I betted a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note first, that was to find the pea, and I lost to the man who is not here—I do not know whether the next bet I made was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I went on betting, and lost—I put my hand into my pocket, and found I had only five sovereigns left—I gave Large his 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I betted the other 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I thought I might have a chance of getting something back again—I lost that, and I said, "Now I am a <hi rend="italic">hatter"</hi>—I suppose that means a man that has nothing—we then got up to go—the man whom the nutshells belonged to left the house first—the two prisoners and I stood up, and I took the glass of ale that was standing there—I had not touched any of it before—I took it up to drink—I said, "I am dry now," and both the prisoners persuaded me not to drink it—I said, "I must have a drink now, for I have paid dear for it"—I drank about half of it—I did not feel anything particular, but when I drank the half I held it up to the window, and I thought it was very thick, so I put it to my mouth again, and then stood the glass down—I did not drink the remainder—I put it to my mouth to taste if there was anything in it, and I did not taste it—the two prisoners and I came out of the house together—we separated at the top of the same lane—one took one road, and the other the other, and I walked to my ship, which was in Middle Hole—when I got to my vessel I sat down on a chair, and fell asleep for two hours—the mate persuaded me to go to bed, and I went to bed—I dare say it was half-past 4 o'clock when I got on board.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you servant of all work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there is no other servant but me there—I cook—the kitchen is a different room from the bar—it is down stairs, on the same floor as the bar, behind it—I washed up the plates after dinner, in the place where I cook—Mr. Crane, Mrs. Crane, and myself, dined there that day—we were all at the table at one time, at 1 o'clock, in the bar parlour—after dinner I went into the kitchen between half-past 1 and 2 o'clock—I cannot see into the bar from the kitchen—the tea time that day was between 5 and 6 o'clock—I had frequently been in the bar between dinner and tea time—I was coming in and out—I am more in the bar parlour than anywhere else—I have to serve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after you had done dinner can you undertake to say that you went back into the parlour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Before the clock struck 2—I remained there about nine minutes, or ten at the outside—I did not go back into the kitchen, I went up stairs into one of the bedrooms—I remained there about five minutes—I afterwards came down, and was remaining in the bar parlour, and between that and the public parlour all the whole evening.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember word being left at your master's house that the policeman wanted him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that day—the policeman said, "We want a tall, thin young man that has been seen coming in the evening before"—I saw the two policemen come in the evening, and say they wanted him—I know what my master was taken for—I heard he was charged with this on the 21st—I did not go to the Police office—I spoke to my mistress—she never asked me to go and speak about it—I believe it was last Friday when I was asked to come, and give this evidence—I knew he was taken before the examination at the Mansion-house—I first knew that he was charged with cheating Captain Hamilton on last Saturday—I heard before that he was charged with something concerning a watch, and he got discharged—I did not know till Saturday that he was charged with this offence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came your mistress to speak to you about it on Friday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because he was kept in prison—it was not on this charge that she spoke to me—I was to say that he was at home all day on the 21st—his wife went once to see him when he was in custody—I think it was on Monday morn<lb></lb>ing last; not before then—she never went to inquire what he was in custody for, nor me either.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you know it was anything about the 21st? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I saw it in the paper on Saturday morning—my mistress spoke to me on Friday about the 21st, because she understood, and so did I, that both transactions were on the 21st—I saw Mr. Beard on Friday night—he came and took Mrs. Crane in the parlour, and spoke to her privately.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you remember this was on the 21st, but were you not in and out of the bar every day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I remember that day particularly, because I made a remark to Mr. Crane about its being the shortest day—he was there every day, but I remarked that day, because I was longing for it to come that the days might be longer—I made a mistake in the cooking—Mr. Crane does not like to eat pork chops, and I left them for the old woman to eat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Mr. Crane at home, and in the bar all the 22nd? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I think he was out on the Thursday—he was out on the 20th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the prisoner's attorney, Mr. Buchanan. I have been managing this case—I first heard the prisoner was in custody on Thursday last, on a charge of stealing a cash box—that was the only charge at that time—there was some talk of another case, but no evidence was called; not this case—he was remanded till Friday on the other charge, and on Friday e was again placed in the dock—he was discharged on that case and left the Court, and got as far as the exterior of the Mansion House, when two or three officers ran after him, and said he was wanted on another case—I went back with him, and heard Mr. Hamilton give his evidence—Mr. Crane said he knew nothing of it, and he asked me to get a remand to prove an alibi.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not this charge mentioned on Friday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but not till he got out of the Mansion House—this was not the first charge made against him—the first was by a person of the name of Rogers.</p>

               <p>Prisoner THOMAS. Q. What time did you miss your property? A. Between six and seven o'clock in the evening - I did not take my bonnet to a Magistrate, because it was a good deal bruised and injured, and I took it to a person to get it set to rights - I took the constable to my lodgings to get the cap, and then I took him to York-street, where the bonnet was; there are two lodgers in the house; one is a married man, who goes out daily - they do not get their living by plunder.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go to Thomas'? A. Yes, and I asked him if he knew of any body going up my stairs; he said No, he had been out at work; he lives close to me.</p>

On the 20th of September, about seven o'clock in the morning, I saw Walker in Pump-court - I saw him receive a bundle from Thomas, tied up in a red and yellow handkerchief - he came past me with it, and went along the street - I afterwards saw Thomas go away without any thing - I did not see what was in the bundle, but it was in the shape of a bonnet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner THOMAS. Q. How far off were you? A. I stood at the corner of the street, eight or ten yards off - you was without your hat; it appeared to be like a bonnet - you then returned into the house, and went up Pye-street.</p>

            . I am a coal-dealer, and live in Perkins'-rents. I saw the two prisoners together about half-past six o'clock that morning; they went into Old-Pye-street, and then Walker returned into Pump-court; Thomas was in Wilkinson's-court, which is at the back of No. 53, Old Pye-street - Thomas handed a bundle over the wall to Walker; he then came by me, within about five yards - they went up Old Peter-street; he had a bundle under his right arm, which appeared like a bonnet - it was in a yellow belcher handkerchief, which I believe was silk - I did not then know whose it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner THOMAS. Q. You say it was a yellow belcher handkerchief? A. Yes, a lemon colour; I saw it was a bonnet tied up in it, and he had it under his arm; I did not tell the Magistrate that it was in the shape of a coal-scuttle.</p>
               <p>WALKER'S Defence. I am quite innocent: I was at the Tower to meet my brother going to Margate in the steamboat; the witness said he thought it was a bonnet, and now he says it was a bonnet.</p>
               <p>THOMAS' Defence. I was in bed at eight o'clock: I got up and was going to work at nine; I saw the prosecutrix looking out of her window, and said to her, "It will be a fine day:" when I came home at nine o'clock at night, I went to bed, and she came to my bed-side with a parcel of neighbours, with a key and a Bible, to know if I had seen the things - I said I had not; the next morning she came to me, and I said I was innocent.</p>

I met the prisoner in Ratcliff-highway on the 16th of March, and gave her some gin - I went home with her, and another girl, with a shipmate - I went up-stairs with the prisoner - I had fifteen sovereigns and a half in one waistcoat pocket, and a 5l. note in the other - I was on the bed, but kept every thing on but my shoes - I fell asleep, and awoke in about two hours - she was then gone - I went to sleep again, and when I awoke she was at my side - I then missed my money and said, "You have robbed me, and if you don't give it me I will have it out of you somehow;" she said she had got up and been and bought a pair of boots - I found nothing but a few halfpence in a corner of her shawl; the landlady came up, and I said she or the prisoner had robbed me - both denied it. I gave the prisoner in charge - I had been drinking, but I knew what I was about.</p>

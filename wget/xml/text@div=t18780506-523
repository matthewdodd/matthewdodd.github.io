                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Mullins, Higura, and Co, of New York, Shipping and Commission Agents—in September last the prisoner was appointed our London agent under this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on his getting samples from us, his duty was to show them to people who came to buy, and forward the orders to us for our approval, and if we approved of the purchaser we executed the order, and sent the goods to their destination—we invoiced them to the purchaser, and sent the prisoner a copy of the invoice under the terms of this agree<lb></lb>ment—the bills of lading ordinarily would go to the purchaser, and in this case we sent two to the prisoner by his request, as it was to be collected on delivery—this was not usual, but we did it to protect ourselves—the money was to be collected on the delivery of the bill of lading—in Decem<lb></lb>ber last we received an order for 130 kegs of nails for Frederick Smith, of London, but they were to be consigned to Glasgow—on the 4th January we dispatched them to Glasgow, <hi rend="italic">ex</hi> Bolivia—the invoice was made out to Frederick Smith, but we put it in our letter to the prisoner—Smith's letter was in an interior envelope—in February we received an order from the prisoner for 122 kegs of nails, and 22 cases of hardware for William Rose—this was shipped on 13th February on the Anglia, from New York to London—the voyage would take about ten days—the consignment was gent to Mr. Ross, and a copy of the invoice and the bill of lading to the prisoner—they embraced the nails and the hardware—we afterwards re<lb></lb>ceived this letter from the prisoner by post. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 9th February</hi>, 1878, <hi rend="italic">from the prisoner to Messrs. Mullins, stating that Mr. Perry's connection with the firm had ceased in consequence of his incapacity for business; that he was endeavouring to obtain a partner, and expected to receive several amounts on account of goods next week, and requesting Messrs. Mullins to allow him to place the same to his credit and if so to cable to him "Agreeable</hi>.") The consignment on the Bolivia would arrive on 16th or 17th January in ordinary course, and that by the Anglia about 23rd February—the last paragraph in our letter referred to 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which the prisoner was collecting for Mr. Smith—that was all that was belonging to us on this side of the Atlantic—we did not understand that the goods coming forward next week were the goods which were the subject of Mr. Boss's consignment—he did not know that any goods were shipped by Mr. Ross—we thought he referred to the outstanding account due from Mr. Smith—we sent him this telegram "Agreeable"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060107"></xptr>
               <p>in consequence of his request for us to allow him to place to his credit certain funds which could not amount to more than 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and therefore we agreed to advance him that amount to help him, and our subsequent letter of the 6th explains that—we meant him to take it and use it for the expenses of the office—I wrote this letter on 6th March. (<hi rend="italic">This was to J, C. Marsh and Co., and referred to nails, citron fruits, and other articles., and stated</hi> "<hi rend="italic">In answer to yours we cabled Agreeable</hi>.") Under that letter the prisoner might pay in 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 101<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I subsequently received from him this letter dated 14th March. (<hi rend="italic">This acknowledged the receipt of a bill of lading and of a sample lot of oils; remarking on the different markets, and requesting to be allowed to place</hi> 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to Messrs. Brown's credit</hi>.) We did not comply with that request—no such arrangement, had been contem<lb></lb>plated—that was not Brown, Janson, and Co., but Brown, Shipley, and Co., of London—that was the first we ever heard of the arrangement, and on 26th March, on the receipt of that letter, we sent this telegram to the prisoner: "Hold goods, particulars Thursday," in answer to which he telegraphed "Goods held, amount needed advised"—he had instructed Brown, Shipley, and Co.—that was the first suggestion that 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid to them—he wrote to us saying he had several houses connected with Brown, Janson, and Co., and recommended us to do our business through Brown, Shipley, and Co.—we assented to that, but wrote to him telling him instead of either of them to pay the deposit into the Union Bank of London—I left New York on 27th March, and arrived here on 9th April—I called at the prisoner's office that day, and asked him what had become of the goods—he said that they were in store all right at 52, Lime Street—I asked him how it was he consented to take orders from irresponsible people—he said that he was assured that they would take them up on arrival—I expressed dissatisfaction, and he said that it was no use talking so harshly to him, there was but a little profit lost, a little difference in price, but he held the goods, and he volunteered to pay whatever loss we sustained on account of their non-arrival—nothing Was said about the bills of lading that day—that was all the conversation appertaining to the goods—I saw him again on the 10th or 11th, having reason to suspect that everything was not right, and asked him to deliver me the bills of lading, or whatever he had to show his title to the goods he had in store—after some hesitation he rang for his clerk, and asked him to bring in a certain paper—he then told me that he had given up the bill of lading—I said "Then give me the receipt or whatever else you received in its place"—he said that he had no receipt—I said "But you must have something to show what your goods are, some consign<lb></lb>ment from the warehouseman"—the clerk handed him a paper which he handed to me—it was simply a memorandum of loan by Davis and Turner of these goods on 18th March—this is a copy of it. (<hi rend="italic">This was a receipt for</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l., for which</hi> 132 <hi rend="italic">kegs of nails and</hi> 21 <hi rend="italic">kegs of hardware were deposited as security, with permission to sell the same if the</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l. was not repaid by</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th April</hi>, 1878. <hi rend="italic">Signed J. C. Marsh</hi>.) This other memorandum is the same with the exception of the power of sale—I asked the prisoner what he meant by pawning our goods—he said that he needed some money, and had put them in store there, and Davis and Turner had advanced the money—I said "You had no right to do that, and you know it"—he said "I did not get the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I only got 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and explained that 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was an old debt by him to them—I said "Why did you pawn our goods to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060108"></xptr>
               <p>pay your old debts?"—he said that a package of samples of pistols and guns that we sent to Davis and Co. as express agents, directed J. C. Marsh and Co., were detained by them for the old debt of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and to liberate them he had, at the suggestion of Davis and Co., deposited these two lots of merchandise shipped to Smith and Ross, thereby getting his express package and a further advance of 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, which, together with the charges and freight from New York, made up 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and over—I told him to take the memorandum of loan and endorse it, which he did—I expressed my dissatisfaction and left the office—I visited him again with Mr. Heritage, my solicitor, who asked him if he admitted that he was our agent—he said "Certainly"—he was asked if, when he pawned the goods, he knew that he had no right to pawn them—he said "Yes"—he was asked how he intended to give us back our goods—he said that he had no means, for he had not 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the world—the invoice form of the consignment to Ross is 327<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—under clause 2 of the agreement we have to pay half the rent and furniture, and we have paid 153<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down to 31st December, 1877, which is the half—no more rent became due till 1st April, 1878—nothing was due in March for rent or furniture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. My firm contemplated doing a large business in this country—we were to send over any American goods that we bought—the prisoner did not complain of the nails that we sent—we sold them from samples—he did not say that Mr. Ross had complained—he said that they were a bad assortment, and he expected a heavy loss—there are only two transactions which refer to bills of lading, except samples, and for those two we sent bills of lading—we shipped a little sample of oil from New York on 25th or 27th February to a gentleman in Middles<lb></lb>borough, to have them transhipped to the steamer at Black Eagle Wharf, London—we are agents, and we sent a bill of lading to him—an account was rendered to us of the three first months of the business, that carried it up to 31st December inclusive; the next account, up to the end of March, would be returned on lst April—I was not asked before the Magistrate about the conversation with Mr. Heritage—a warrant was applied for on 12th or 13th—I should say 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be due for the first of those shipments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I sent the telegram to the prisoner on 9th March augmenting my instructions in my letter of the 6th by the words, "Follow financial instructions. Letter 6"—in reply to which I received the telegram "Agreeable."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Davis, Turner, and Co., of 52, Lime Street, City—I have known the prisoner between two and three years—about two years ago he contracted a debt of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to my firm, which remained owing, and I did not see him again till 11th March this year—it was just before the Philadelphia Exhibition, two years ago, and we saw him on his return eight months after the opening—that brings us to the beginning of 1877—I only saw him in the street then, and I do not think anything was said about the debt<lb></lb>early in March this year we received a case of revolvers from our New York agents to be delivered to the prisoner; he wrote to us and we replied that we should be happy to send them if he would send us a cheque for the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(that debt had been contracted by his asking us to advance it to him, and to receive payment out of his commission when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060109"></xptr>
               <p>he was at the Philadelphia Exhibition—we had no security except a letter—he had been introduced to us by Mr. Sangster, the umbrella manufacturer—when the prisoner failed to pay we applied to Mr. Sangster)—just before March 11th I called on the prisoner and asked him what he was going to do—he said that he wanted the case of revolvers very urgently, and that he would pay me the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he did not name a date; I said that a bird in the hand was worth two in the bush, and I should prefer to keep the case of guns—I should think it was worth 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because there were several guns in it; he said "I must have the money down"—he said that he would send me on a cheque—he then read a paragraph from the letter of a firm in New York. (<hi rend="italic">This was</hi> "If you have no objection, we will place the same goods to your credit; if that meets your views please cable us.") He showed me the <hi rend="italic">cable</hi>—I told him to come round in the afternoon and see my partner as well as myself, and we can go into the matter"—he did not then tell me on whose behalf he was acting in London—I had never heard the name of Mullins and Co.—I saw under his name, "Agent for Mullins and Co.," but I could not have told what it was—I knew he was an agent, nothing more—he came in the afternoon and saw Mr. Foster and myself, and we agreed to make him an advance of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the receipt of the goods, and being satisfied that they were worth it—he asked us to make an advance at once, but we replied that till we got the goods we could not—he did not produce the bills of lading—I told him that on leaving the delivery orders of Pickford, where the goods were warehoused, we should not mind letting him have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he assented, and my impression is that he wrote out in our office a delivery order to Pickford's to deliver the goods to us, and we received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Pickford's agreeing to do so—Pickford's are sure to have the delivery order—as to the other goods an order was handed to us by Messrs. Henderson, of Glasgow, to deliver them to us—they are the pro<lb></lb>prietors of the Anchor line—the prisoner gave the two delivery orders to me, and then he went with our clerk to Pickford's, who got this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from them, and then handed the prisoner 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Pickford's place, I think, and got this receipt—on the larger consignment we ad<lb></lb>vanced 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.: it was agreed that the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be included in the advance, and we were to hand him over the case of revolvers, which we did on, I think, the 13th—on the 15th a further advance of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was made to him. <hi rend="italic">This was for a further sum of</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l., at</hi> 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">per cent, interest, with liberty to dispose of the goods if not redeemed within a month</hi>.) The interest and com<lb></lb>mission were 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not think it necessary to inquire whose agent the prisoner was, because he showed me this letter and telegram authorising him to do it—the bills of lading were never in my hands, and my impres<lb></lb>sion is that the prisoner came once or twice between the 18th and the 18th to see if the goods had arrived from Glasgow—on the receipt of the goods we should make the advance—Pickford's had delivered by the 13th, and thence the further advance—the goods arrived on 18th March at Carron Wharf, London, and on that day we made the prisoner a further advance of 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid for charges on Smith's consignment—taking those four sums together and the charges for freight, that made up the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for interest and commission—we gave the prisoner this memorandum of deposit on the 18th.

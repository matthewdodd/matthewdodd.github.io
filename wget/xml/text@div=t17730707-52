            : our house was broke open on Monday morning; I was last up, and saw the house all fastened. I went to bed about ten minutes after eleven; the dog alarmed me a little after one; I was waked by the watch, and found the kitchen window was broke open: the cornish was broke off the top, by which a small boy must have been put over the window shutter, and by some hook have drawn up the wooden bar which went across the window shutter. This kitchen window looks into Warwick-court, in Holborn: a table cloth was taken from a table drawer in the kitchen; I folded it up on Sunday night and laid it in the drawer; there was a tea spoon taken out of the mustard pot. These people came to me next day, and I was subpoena'd to attend at the office in Litchfield-street. I saw my cloth there and the prisoner was produced; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss the cloth?</p>
               <p>Cragg. Immediately as I went down into the kitchen the door was open; it was the only thing that was missed.</p>

            . I was constable of the night; two watchmen brought the prisoners into the watch-house; they said they took him out of an area in Red-Lion-square; this cloth was wrapped round him under his waistcoat; this was a few minutes past two on Monday morning. I searched him, and found upon him a center bit and a file (producing them); I asked him where he got the table cloth; he said it was his own.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Ely-place, Hoxton, and am a bootmaker—on Friday, 31st July, I saw the prisoner and the deceased man, Burke—I heard her make use of some very bad expressions as I was standing at my door—she was calling Burke an Irish b—r—I went to the house, and saw the deceased strike the prisoner a blow in the face, and she took up a knife off the table and stabbed him in the left thigh—he was standing at that time—as she drew her hand back, she said, "Take that, you Irish b—! I'll rip your liver out!"—she then threw the knife at him, and it passed over his shoulder—he came out of the house and said, "Oh! some one take me to a doctor; I am stabbed!"—I laid hold of his arm and led him down Hoxton; he was bleeding very much—he said, "I cannot walk any further, I shall drop"—his legs sank from under him, and I and some other person let him gently on the ground—he struggled very much, and there was a pool of blood on the ground—the prisoner came up soon afterwards—she broke her way</p>

               <p>through the crowd, caught hold of his arm, and said, "Get up; what do you want lying here for?"—he did not make any answer; he was insensible—a policeman came up, and the deceased and the prisoner were taken to the police-station.</p>

I was on duty in Hoxton, about 10 minutes past 10, on 31st July, when my attention was drawn to the deceased, sitting on the ground—he was insensible—the prisoner was by the side of him—there was a great quantity of blood on the pavement—I asked who did it—the prisoner said, "I did, with a knife"—I asked where the knife was—she said she did not know—I took the deceased in a coster<lb></lb>monger's barrow to the station—we got there about twenty minutes past 10 at night—he was then insensible, and his trousers were saturated with blood—I saw him die about half an hour after we got him to the station.</p>

I am a Bachelor of Medicine, and live at 1, Kingsland-road—on 31st July, about half-past 10, I was called to see a man at Hoxton Police-station—he was dying from loss of blood—I did not examine him at that moment—my assistant had arrived first and put a bandage on; and, as the wound was not then bleeding, I did not undo it—he died from loss of blood soon afterwards—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination and found a division of the femoral artery; the wound was five inches deep—it went right across the thigh—it was such a wound as could be inflicted by a common table-knife—the deceased looked about thirty-five years of age—he was healthy in every other respect.</p>

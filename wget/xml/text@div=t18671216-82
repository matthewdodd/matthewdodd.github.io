I am a seaman, and live at a boarding house in St. George's Street—on 15th December, about eleven o'clock, I went into a fish shop in Ship Alley, and had twepennyworth of fish and some potatoes—the prisoner was serving—I gave her a sovereign—she said, "I will go and get you some change"—she went out with the sovereign, and I did not see her afterwards—a man afterwards came in—the prisoner said at the station that I had given her a shilling—I am quite sure it was a sovereign.</p>

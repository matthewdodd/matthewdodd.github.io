                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 38). On 9th Jan. I went to Mr. Kershaw's, linendraper, in London-street, Greenwich—I went up stairs, and found Mr. Kershaw, the prisoner English, and the witness Stanley, there—Mr. Kershaw charged English with stealing some things, and I took her into custody—I searched her boxes, and afterwards went to the prisoner Susan Dauncey's, and told her that her son and the housemaid at Mr. Kershaw's were in custody for robbing him, and that I suspected she had some of the stolen property, and that she must be careful what she said about it, because whatever she said would have to be mentioned before the Magi<lb></lb>strate—I told her I had come for all the property brought there by her son and English—she said she would bring me all that had been brought there; her son had brought nothing, but English had brought two or three things—she then got on the bedstead, and took from off the top of it, over the furniture, this box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I opened the box, and found that it contained these plumes of bonnet feathers, two pieces of braid, eight pieces of ribbon, and some artificial flowers—she also gave me three parasols (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) two of which she took from a box, and one was hanging up in the room—she said that was all English had brought—I then examined the box from which she had taken the parasols, and found this pair of cuffs, which she said were her own—Miss Stanley, who was present, said, "These cuffs came from our shop"—I said to the prisoner, "You hear what she says?"—the prisoner said, "Well, Ann English gave them to me"—I asked her again whether she had any other property that had been brought by English, and she said, "No"—seeing something in her bosom, I asked what she had there—she said, "Nothing but what belongs to me"—I insisted on seeing what it was, and she pulled out three handkerchiefs, saying, "They are my own"—I examined one, and found on it the name of "Hutchinson"—I said, "That is not your name," and Miss Stanley said, "That is one of the young men in our shop"—I asked the prisoner how she could claim it as hers—she said she was sorry for what she had done, but that it was brought there by English—the three pri<lb></lb>soners were all taken to the station—I found some articles in English's box.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant in the millinery department at Mr. Kershaw's. In consequence of information, I missed things from the show room—I know this bonnet string—I had missed it, and it was found at Susan Dauncey's house—there is our private mark on these flowers, and I speak to the things generally as being part of our stock—they had not been sold—I went with Carpenter to Dauncey's house—I have heard the account he has given; that is correct—I saw the handkerchief produced with "J. Hutchin<lb></lb>son" upon it—before that was found she said she had nothing more—hers is a private house—we have missed three or four such handkerchiefs as these other two in the last month or six weeks—I cannot speak to these, as they have been washed—we keep them ready made—we sold none like these to English—other persons than me sell in the shop—the handkerchief with the name on it is of a different sort to the others.</p>

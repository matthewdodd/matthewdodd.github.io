                  </hi>. I live at 65A, Long Acre, with my friends—on the night of 31st August, I was in Mansion House-street waiting for an omnibus—the prisoner came in front of me, put his hand in front of me, and took my purse—I am sure that he put his hand in my pocket—he then crossed over on the other side of the way and spoke to a man there—I crossed over to him and the other man left him directly—I told him he had put his hand in my pooket and taken my purse—he said, "I have not got it, and I was not on the other side of the way"—I said, "You have, for I saw you standing close by me"—he said he had not got it—a policeman came up and the prisoner was given in charge—I told him he was standing in front of me, and he said that he was not, that he had never been on the other side of the way where I had been standing—I had told him that I was on the other side of the way, and had crowed over to tell him, and he said he was not there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live at 35, Berners-street, Middlesex Hospital—I was with the last witness, my sister, on the night of 31st August, waiting for an omnibus—we saw the prisoner standing in front of us—he turned round and looked us both in the face—I looked at him, and at the same time my sister said, "This man in front of us is feeling my pocket"—I said, "Oh! be careful"—she said, "Let him alone; he has not got his hand in it;" and then she put her hand in and said, "He has got my purse"—he went across the road and we ran across after him—he was standing there handing something, I could not see what, to another man, who ran off directly we came up—my sister said to the prisoner, "You have got my purse?"—he said, "It's not me"—I said, "No; not now; you have just given it to the other man"—he said, "Why don't you go after the other man?"—I said, "No; it is no use now he is gone; we will keep you"—neither of us had said anything before that about locking him up—be had not got three feet from us before my sister said, "He has got it" and went after him—I had a baby in my arms and was a minute behind her—the policeman was there, and the prisoner said to another man, "Go fetch the purse; you know who has got it."</p>

Q.</hi> Was not this what he said, "I think it is you who have got the lady's purse; if you have, or know who has, give it up like a man"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was not the same man that the prisoner had spoken to after he crossed the road—my husband had come up and had the prisoner by the collar—he was looking for a policeman, and a man whom we had not seen before, came round the corner, and the prisoner said to him, "Go fetch the purse; you know who has got it; bring it to me; then I shall not be locked up"—the man walked away—I suppose we walked about ten minutes before the prisoner was given in custody—we had not gone a mile—we went down two or three streets towards the Bow Station—the prisoner did not go very quietly—he punched my husband once or twice—the prisoner was not indignant.</p>

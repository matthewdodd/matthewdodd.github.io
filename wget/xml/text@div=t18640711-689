                  </hi>. I am inspector of letter-carriers in the South-eastern district-office—Rixon has been employed in the Post-Office seven or eight years; the greatest portion of the time at the South-eastern office—the Mawby-road was the name of his walk—he was on duty on the afternoon of 16th April at 3 o'clock—his duty was to assist in the general sorting of the letters; it is probable that he would have sorted some of the letters from the Folkestone bag; they were placed before him, and before the whole of the sorters, with other letters—the letters for Bridge Hotel and Maze-pond would not be delivered by him, but by another letter-carrier.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Rixon. Q.</hi> Had I not to make a collection of letters from the receiving-houses that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not that day; your collection did not come for two or three days after that—it was your duty to be at the office at 3 o'clock—your duty was to assist in sorting all letters placed before you—all the Folkestone letters come first to our office, those for the Sout<lb></lb>heastern district being tied up separately by the postmaster at Folkestone—we retain those at our office, and the others are forwarded to the General Post Office—it would not be the duty of a man named Pollock to take the South-eastern letters—the bag is untied, and the letters put out to be stamped and sorted—it only occupies a few minutes—Pollock would check them, to see that they were all local letters, and that they contained no mis<lb></lb>sorts, or letters for other districts—Pollock had the opportunity of taking those letters, and so had I, and any one in the office as well as you—both</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Rabbitts, bootmaker, of Newing<lb></lb>ton-causeway, near the Elephant and Castle—on the evening of Saturday, 16th April, about twenty minutes to 5, I saw the prisoner Walker at our shop—he came in and wanted a pair of boots—I sold him a pair of clump side-spring boots—they came to 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he tendered me a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Canterbury note, for which I gave him change—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it appears to have been joined—I gave him a pen and asked him to give me his name and address, and he endorsed the note "J. Garwood, 107, or 197, Lupus-street"—he wore the boots away with him—I believe these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be the boots—I packed up the old ones and gave them to him, and he took them away—these are the pair I sold him, and on the occasion I stretched the right boot, which was a little tight in the joints—I saw these boots taken off the prisoner's feet when he was in custody—they have our private mark inside—I also saw the old ones and recognised them directly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you ever seen him before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—he was in the shop about a quarter of an hour—I next saw him at the General Post Office, St. Martin's-le-grand, about 15th June, two months afterwards, about half-past two in the day—I could not say in what part of the Post Office it was; I believe it was in the solicitor's office—I was never there before—one of the authorities came over for me; that was the first day they had the man, and I came over to recognise him—I knew I was going there to see if I could identify the man that had given me the note—I was accompanied by our managing man—there were several other persons in the room; perhaps a dozen—no one called my attention to Walker—I was asked if there was any body there who passed the note, and I pointed out Walker—I had been in the room about five or ten minutes before I was asked that question—Walker was in the room all that time, sitting down there—I had not spoken to any one during that ten minutes—there were one or two policemen there, but I did not know which were the policemen and which were not—I did speak a word to them till after I had recognised the man, nor they to me—I was with our managing man, talking to him—he thought he could recog<lb></lb>nise him, and could not, and I said he was the man—he did not see so much of the man as I did; I served him—the one that he recognised more was Rixon; he thought he was the man that accompanied the other to the</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlady of 5, Charlotte-street, Old Kent-road—Walker lodged at my house—Rixon was freqently in the habit of visiting him there—I have seen them together—Walker came to lodge there on 18th April, and continued there till he was taken into custody—I did not know that he was in the habit of using hair-dye, until I saw that his beard was dyed—I noticed the change of colour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was his occupation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> An oil painter—he was a very quiet orderly tenant; I had no reason to suspect anything wrong till this charge was made—I had no fault to find with him as a lodger.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector</hi>). I was with Hancock when he arrested Walker—I asked him if he knew Rixon—he said, "No"—I afterwards took him to the station where Rixon was, and asked him again—he said he neither I knew Rixon or Parker—I asked him if he could write—he said he could neither read nor write.</p>

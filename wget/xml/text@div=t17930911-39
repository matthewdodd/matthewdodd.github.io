             in Lambeth-street, Whitechapel, about a quarter of a mile from Morphew's house, I met him there with a bundle and another young man with him, coming the way from the house that had been robbed, I stopped him, seeing him have a bundle under his arm, asked him what he had got? he said he had a jacket, I felt of it, I told him it was no jacket, Sir, says he, you may depend upon it, it is, if you will take my word, I told him I was an officer and I insisted on seeing it; he said, I might depend upon it, it was one of his own killing jackets; he is a <rs id="t17930911-39-deflabel214" type="occupation">butcher</rs>

Says he, if you will step to the other side of the road I will tell you the truth, it is a woman's petticoat, and I hope you will not hurt me; which I opened and found it was a stuff petticoat, I took him into custody and at half past ten had him before Mr. Wickham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him to see if there were any other things about him? - I did not, I had not that knowledge about me at that present time, being only a young officer. This petticoat was tied up in a silk handkerchief which was marked E. M on it. When he was up to Mr. Wickham's, he was committed to the house of correction, he came up again on Thursday and was acquitted, because nobody came up, and on Saturday Mrs. Morphew came up in consequence of an advertisement.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This man is a working Butcher? - He is.</p>
               <p>Q. He worked for Mr. Williams? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He was discharged on Thursday, and you know that then he went to his master's? - I met him in St. Catherine's in the same dress he is now after he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him at his Master's on Saturday? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in his working dress then? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. However he was at his master's the two days after he was discharged? - He was.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Morphew. The petticoat is mine; I know it by the particular mark about it. I had a pair of velveteen breeches and a pocket taken, which were returned out of a neighbour's yard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming along the morning I was taken up and a man saw me pick the petticoat up, and he asked me what I had got? and I told him, I don't know, the man is here now that see me pick it up.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this? - It was Monday morning the 8th of July, to the best of my knowledge about five o'clock in the morning, says I, what have you got there? says he, I have found a bundle. I don't know who dropped it no more than you</p>

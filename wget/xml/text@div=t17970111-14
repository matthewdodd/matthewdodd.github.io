             sworn. - I am a patrol of St. George's, Hanover-square: On the 8th of December, my partner and I were on duty, a little after six o'clock in the morning; coming up Berkley-square, we heard some glass rattle, we took it to be a lamp broke; the prisoner met us in the middle of the horse-road; the prisoner met us in the middle of the horse-road; we asked him if he saw any thing of a lamp broke, he said, no; we asked him if he heard any alarm of glass, he said, it was an empty bottle he threw out of his pocket, with that he passed us, and we took no farther notice; when he got a little way from us, we heard the same found of glass, we imagined it could not be all empty bottles, we followed him, and took hold of him, and this bottle was concealed under his great coat, it had some gin in it at that time, in the struggle the gin was all spilt; he said, he was going on guard that morning, he struggled to get from us, we took him to the watch-house, we found a bottle of gin and a bottle of rum upon him, and a bottle of brandy was picked up by a watchman, and brought to the watch-house; there was a quart pewter pot, with the prosecutor's name on it, and a piece of old canvas found upon him; my partner had the bottle of rum and gin in his possession, I had the quart pot and brandy.</p>

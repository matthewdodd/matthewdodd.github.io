            . I was in company with the last witness. We were both shoved off the path into the kinnel. When I was getting up, the prisoner at the bar had his hand in Cooper's pocket; I observed that; I am quite sure of it. I did not know his name then, but afterwards from the description I gave of him, I learned his name was Greenfield; I gave a description of him to Gillmore, the officer.</p>

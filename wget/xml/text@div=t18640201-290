I was lately captain in the military train at Woolwich—this revolver and knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my property—I think I saw them last about the 15th January, about ten days prior to the com<lb></lb>mittal of the prisoners at Woolwich; they were then in my quarters at the camp—I cannot say what day I missed them—one day I required the knife to open a book, and could not find it on the table, and I asked my servant about it—that must have been on or about the 15th—I did not miss the revolver until I was told that a four-barrelled repeater had been discovered—I then opened the case, and missed it—that was two days before the prisoners were committed—I don't know the day—the policeman came up to my quarters, and told me it had been sold in Woolwich—I know the prisoners; one is a non-commissioned officer, and the other is an officer's</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Holding.

I said, "Let me look at them." He brought them to me, and I said I would try; he said, "Whatever you get for them, I will give you half." I was down in Wool<lb></lb>wich, and having occasion to go into the marine-store dealer's shop, I showed the things to him, and sold them for a sovereign. I gave my right name and address. I heard nothing more about it till last Monday week, when I heard that Corporal Hewson had been locked up. I spoke about it to the men in the room at Captain Miller's, and told him how it had occurred. About an hour after that the constable came down; he asked me if I knew anything about a revolver and knife. I said I did, and I took him to the shop where I sold the things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hewson's Defence</hi>. On Thursday evening, 14th January, I saw Holding in his room; he pulled down a dagger first. I asked him what he had got there that he wished to sell. I said, "Are they yours or your master's?" he said, "They are my own. I have had them some time." He asked me to sell them for him, and he would give me half the money. I took them to Evans; he tried to sell them, and could not I got them of Evans again, and gave them back to Holding; he came to me on the Friday evening, and gave me eight shillings, and two or three days afterwards he said to me, "Do you think the person who I got these from will miss them?" I said, "I don't know; if you have not got them honestly, I would rather give you the money back again." Now, in the Court here, he has offered to give me money to say nothing about it.</p>

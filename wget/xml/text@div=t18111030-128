I lost the articles on the 29th of October. On the Tuesday morning her sister called to know how I liked her, I answered, she would not suit me, she was so dirty, she had better take her with her, she said she would call in the afternoon and take her. In the afternoon she came about six o'clock, I asked the prisoner if she was ready to go with her sister, she said she was, I saw her pockets extended, I asked her what she had got in her pockets, she said nothing, she kept nudgeing her sister, I said,</p>
               <p>"what do you nudge your sister." I begged her sister to see what was in her pockets, she pulled her own handkerchief out, and then afterwards pulled out my half handkerchief and other things, her sister told her to strip, the officer came in, and then came my shawl, it was three times round her waist, the officer told me to search her stockings, we did, and there were several trimmings of lady's gowns, and in her box was my tippet.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. I doubt whether in this case there is any property in the prosecuton, it differs from the case, she was the carrier, and I think the property of this is wrong laid in the indictment, and in point of law the prisoner must be acquitted; at all events the case does not come up to the indictment, which is for a highway robbery, for the coat was not obtained from her by threat or violence, and the man throwing himself down for her to fall down, in order that the other might avoid the pursuit, was a subsequent transaction, and could not alter the circumstances of the robbery at all.</p>

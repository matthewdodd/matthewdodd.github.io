               <p>- Litton. I met the prisoner on the 13th of this month, in Thames-street, he appeared to be more bulky than common. I was just by Gally Key Gate-way. I stopt him and examined him; and under his coat I found this tobacco; (producing it ) I found some more in his breeches. I took him to the next house and gave him in charge of an officer; there was six pounds of it; he seemed to be come up from the other gateway; he was busy there all day long; there was many hogsheads there. I had a suspicion, as he seemed to walk as if he was frightened.</p>
               <p>- Preston. This gentleman gave him in charge to me. I found some of this tobacco back part of his breeches.</p>

               <p>I was coming through the Gate-way and found it loose on the ground; there was no tobacco besides it.</p>

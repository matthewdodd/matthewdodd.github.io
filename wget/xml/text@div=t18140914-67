            . I am an officer. On Monday, the 28th, there was a disturbance in Kent-street; the prisoner was brought to me by two men, charged with robbing a young woman of this small handkerchief. I searched the prisoner. I found this turnbridge-ware-box on the prisoner. I searched his lodgings in Kent-street I found this piece of flannel, and this pawnbrokers duplicate. I went to the pawnbroker's; then I found out the prosecutrix. I shewed her the goods; she claimed them. The other unfortunate young woman drowed herself on Monday; through distress of losing her things.</p>

            . I live at 150, Kent-street, in the Borough. The prisoner came in on Sunday morning, with a bundle; he went up stairs, and opened it at the foot of the bed; a pair of jean shoes dropped out of the bundle, I picked them up, and delivered them to him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A day after I arrived in London from Liverpool, I was going through Gray's-inn-lane I was disappointed in business that I came after. I met this girl, she was standing in an entry in her shift; she asked me to give her something to drink; I said, I did not care if I did. I not being accustomed to drink in the morning, it took effect of me. She prevailed upon me to go up into her room. After being in her room, she told me all her clothes were in pawn. I very imprudently, knowing my own circumstance, released her gown and shawl, which cost me fifteen shillings; after that, she got me to send out for more drink. She then took me to a milliner's shop, where I purchased a bonnet for her, at sixteen shillings. We went into a confectioners, where I bought more articles. Then after that, she told me that the other young woman had some things out; she got one pound seventeen shillings of me, and during the time I was with her, I was nine pounds the worse for being in her company. She took me to the Bull and Gate inn, Holborn, she there demanded a one-pound note before she would go to bed with me. The other young woman seemed to have something very heavy on her mind; she said, as soon as she could, she would charge her lodging. I gave her five shillings, and a one-pound note. I went up to these girls room, a black-smith was in the closet, which she called out into the room.

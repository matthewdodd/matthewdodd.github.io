In about five minutes I saw the prisoner go behind a gentleman in black, the other was close behind him-the prisoner put his hand into the gentleman's coat-pocket, and pulled his handkerchief out; I told the gentleman of it, and laid hold of the prisoner; the gentleman took the other man-the handkerchief was dropped; the gentleman picked it up, and assisted me through the mob with the men; I then asked for his name and address? he said he had too much business to attend to, and went away.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 20th of June last were you out - A. Yes; on my return to my house about twelve o'clock, I was going from the upper part of Wimpole-street to my house, through <placeName id="t18130915-26-crimeloc150">Millhill-mews</placeName>

               <p>Q. Upon the solemn oath you have taken, had you touched him, or his private parts - A. No, I had not gone near him; he might have touched the back of my hand by rubbing against me; I had not gone to him, he came to me; he said why will you handle my private parts; I said, I touch your private parts. He said yes, and I'll make you know it; he look hold of my collar. I resisted; I said you have not a blackguard to deal with, I will give you my address; on which I gave him my card; on receiving the card he held his hand on my collar, and looked on the card. I told him if he was not satisfied with that, he might watch me home; he would see me let myself in with my own key, which I had in my pocket, that he would not be deceived where to find me. He then said you are an opulent tradesman, twenty pound will not be an object to you; I must have that sum, or I'll expose you, and you'll be pillored. Upon this I proceeded towards my own house. He had hold of the sleeve of my coath; e went with me, and insisted upon the money being paid, or he would carry his threat into execution. I felt myself greatly terrified at that, saying, I believed I had not twenty pound in the house; would not ten pound or less do. He went home with me, and followed me into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What servant had you in the house - A. Only my female servant in the house, that servant was gone to bed. I let him into my house; I remonstrated with him; he insisted in it, that he would swear the charge against me if I did not give him twenty pound, no less sum would he take. I went to my drawer, and took out my pocket-book; I then thought I had done wrong by letting such a man into my house; I went into the passage and took out the money to give him; I took out four five-pound Bank of England notes; I gave them him instantly; when he had got the money he immediately made way to the door; he went out; he told me I never should hear from him again, he was going to sea, or abroad; he was going out of the country. This was on Sunday, the 20th of June. On Monday, the 21st of June, I was going through Saville-row, I believe about five o'clock in the afternoon, I passed the prisoner, he was with an old man; upon passing him the prisoner followed me, he put his hand on my shoulder; he said, do you know me; I said, no; at that instant I did not recollect him. Upon my saying no, he said, do you recollect on the Sunday night how you gave me your address; I then said you are the man that extorted twenty pound from me; on that he went up to the old man, he said father this is the man that I spoke to you about; the old man then came close to me, he said sir, (in the hearing of the prisoner,) this is my son, but he is a d - d rascal, I want to send him to sea, and from what he has told me about you, you will not have any hesitation to assist me; I have not money to send him; we will go into some house sir, and have a bottle of wine, and talk this matter over. I excused myself going into any house with them, saying, I had not time, I would, meet them on the Wednesday; we appointed to meet on the Wednesday morning, at the Cumberland Arms, in Oxford-street, nearly opposite of my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Against the Wednesday did you provide yourself with a Bow-street officer - A. I went immediately to Dyer's-buildings, to Mr. Townes, my attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in point of fact get a Bow-street officer - A. Yes; I kept my appointment, and was there five minutes before them; I saw the old man come in after me, and called for a glass of beer at the bar; the prisoner came in about five minutes after. I sat myself down between them in the parlour; Adkins, the officer, was in the same room; Adkins and I were not seen to go into the room in company together. Then I being with these two men, I said, now gentlemen, what do you want with me; I said I understand on Monday you wanted more money, I can muster ten pound more to the twenty you have already had of me, and looked at the young man. The old man said, no, sir, if you give money it must be your own voluntary act. I perceived the old man's eyes to be particularly upon Adkins. The old man said, I want your interest; I know your interest is great; I want you to get my son out to sea, as I told you before, I want you to get a captain for him to get him out; I said I know no captain, all I can do, is to give you ten pound to the twenty pound you have already had. I got up and said Mr. Adkins that is the man, take him into custody; Mr. Adkins took the prisoner into custody, and I called a coach; upon this the old man went to the door, and said, what is all this about; when he saw Adkins push him into the coach, Adkins said to the old man you must go with us; the old man said no, I must go to get some men to come and speak in behalf of my son's character. I have never seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you parted with these five-pound<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150023"></xptr>notes under what impression did you do it - A. Under fear from a threat of a rascal, who had no hesitation in swearing any thing; I did it for fear that he would swear that abominable thing that he charged me with.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Where had you been on the 20th of June - A. I was walking in the afternoon with some friends over Westminster-bridge, and then after that I called on Mr. Roberts; finding that it was earlier than twelve o'clock I went into the Rose public-house, in Wimpole-street, looked at the paper, and had a pint of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. You then went in your way home through Mill-hill-mews - A. It was my nearest way home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any body at the Rose public-house that you knew - A. No; I am not in the habit of frequenting public-house, unless to see the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night, was it a light night - A. Not moon light, but cloudy.</p>
               <p>Q. Mill-hill-mews, is that a light place - A. No, it is a dark place; it was light enough to see to read the name on the card; he held it up as though he read it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Mill-hill-mews from your house - A. Perhaps five or six hundred yards; it may be near a quarter a mile; I think it is less than half a mile</p>
               <p>Q. This man walked with you, holding you by the sleeve to your house at twelve o'clock at night. How many watchman did you pass - A. Not one, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a watchhouse there for the inhabitants of Marybone - A. There may be. In my way home I do not recollect meeting a single watchman; my fears and terrors were great; I do not know that I met one single person.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you by the desire of the prosecuter, go to the Cumberland Arms - A. By the desire of Mr. Read, the Magistrate, I did at the instance of the prosecutor. I got into the house first, after I was in the prosecutor came in, the prisoner came in, and an old man.</p>
               <p>Q. After they were all in the room did you bear any part of the conversation - A. I did; there was a conversation about the young man going to sea in a faint voice by the old man; Mr. Gunning said, I understand that money was your object, I have mustered up ten pound, and that with the twenty pound you have already had if that will do I will give you that; Mr. Gunning appeared to be holding a note in his hand, in his waistcoat pocket. The old man's eyes were fixed on me. The prosecutor got up and said that is the man who obtained the twenty pound; I told the prisoner who I was, and took him in custody The old man said this now must be settled before the magistrate; I asked the old man to go with me; he said, he would go and get persons to speak in his son's character; he would be down there as soon as me. I have never seen him since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am entirely innocent of the charge that is alleged against me. I never demanded a farthing of the man in my life; he never gave me any money at all.</p>

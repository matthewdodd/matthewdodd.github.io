Ferry lives in George-street, Shoreditch, Eglinton keeps a chandler's shop in Blossom-street, Norton-falgate, Jordan lives in Star<lb></lb>alley, Fenchurch-street—I have seen Jordan and Eglinton together frequently—about a quarter past one o'clock, on the 11th of March, I saw Jordan leave his house in Star-alley, and go up White Lion-street, Norton-falgate—Eglinton was standing at the corner of White Lion-street—Jordan passed by him without taking the least notice of him—I had seen them together before that day, at Eglinton's house—Jordan turned up Blossom-street and went into Eglinton's house—at the time Jordan passed Eglinton he pointed his hand along White Lion-street, and Perry was crossing from the City of London Theatre—I should say he could see Eglinton when he was crossing—Eglinton went into a public-house, and Perry directly after him—that was all I saw that day—about one o'clock, on the 19th of March, I saw Perry leave Bow Church-yard, where the pro-secutor's warehouse is—I followed him to the Black Dog in Long-alley, Moorfields—he went in at a sort of private entrance they call the "bottle de<lb></lb>partment"—he remained there nearly five minutes, and came out with Eglinton—they parted in Crown-street, and Perry went along Long-alley—on the 23rd I saw Perry leave Bow Church-yard, about twenty-five minutes past eight o'clock in the morning—I followed him down Bow-lane—he went into a coffee<lb></lb>shop in Great St. Thomas the Apostle—he afterwards came out and went down Garlick-hill—I continued having my eye on the coffee-shop in Great St. Thomas the Apostle—I saw Eglinton come out of the same coffee­house and go towards his house—I went to the Plough, in Plough-yard, Shore-ditch—after I had been there a little while Perry came in and went into the tap-room—she remained in a few minutes, and then Eglinton came out, and then Perry—they parted about the door-way—I then went after Eglinton and took him—I told him I was a City of London policeman, I should take him for receiving stolen property belonging to Mr. Sutton, of Bow Church­yard, from Perry the porter to the firm—he said, "I never received any stolen property that I am aware of, or yet to my knowledge"—I searched the house, No. 9, Star-alley, Fenchurch-street (I had seen Jordan go in and come out of that house on several occasions) I found three boxes of Scots' pills with this writing on them as it is now, "William Sutton and Son, late Dicey and Son, Bow Church-yard."</p>

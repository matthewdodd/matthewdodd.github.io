               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the time he received the sentence of the Court, at Clerkenwell? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in prison the time he was ordered? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in your custody? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt about it? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>- JONES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You keep a public-house in Chiswell-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I do. On the 27th of January the prisoner, and another man with him, came to my house, and called for a glass of gin. When they had drank it, they put down a bad half-crown; I told them it was a bad one; he gave me another, for which I gave him change. They went out, and I followed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you follow them? - A. I suspected they were doing something they should not. I followed them till they went into another house in Finsbury-street (Mr. Hall's), and I went in when they came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a half-crown produced to you by Mr. Hall? - A. Yes; he had it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same half-crown the prisoner tendered to you? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the half-crown again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened then? - A. Mr. Hall and I went after them; we overtook them in Little Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to them? - A. Hall shewed him the half-crown, and told him he had given him a bad half-crown; they said they did not know it was a bad one; I said I had told him before that it was a bad one myself; they answered they did not know me, nor where I lived; the other man said that. We took them back to the White Horse (Mr. Hall's, in Finsbury-street), and sent to Worship-street for an officer</p>
               <p>Q. When the officer came, did you see him search the prisoner? - A. Yes; there was nothing but good money found upon him, and some gin in a bottle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the other man? - A. No, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they in your house? - A. About two or three minutes; while they drank their liquor.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Q. Was there any thing particular in that half-crown? - A. Yes, there were letters on it. I marked it when Hall had it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mark it before? - A. No; I marked it by the desire of the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard of a reward? - A. I did not do it with that intent; I do not look for it; I do not know that there is, I will swear.</p>

On the 27th of January, the same morning he had been to Mr. Jones's, he came to my house; they both came in together; he and Wootten; the one called for a glass of gin, and the other for a glass of raspberry. I did not examine the half-crown when the prisoner put it down; I gave him change for it; when I took it up, I found it was a bad one. I was going out after them to get it changed, when Mr. Jones met me at the door. We pursued the prisoner. They were not out of sight.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you search the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any bad money? - A. No; but I found 6 s. 6 d. in silver, eleven halfpence, and two farthings; and a pint bottle full of gin. He would not tell where he lived. He said he worked at the New Docks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I gave him the place of my abode.</p>

               <p>Mr. MENCELIN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are one of the moniers of the Mint? - A. Yes. (Looks at the money.) It is a bad half-crown, and such as nobody would take but in a hurry.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Jones.) Is that the half-crown that was presented to you? - A. Yes; there is a G and J, two letters that I put on it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hall.) Is that the half-crown that he tendered to you? - A. I am sure this is the same half-crown; there is a mark on the other side that I put on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As we were coming on, the other man was with me, we went into this house to have something to drink; I put down half a crown; the first witness said it was a bad half-crown, I said I took it for a good one, I did not suppose that man to be a judge, I had drank two or three glasses before, I did not think it a bad one when I went in, I had been working at the docks; we went into the other house to drink again, and there I offered it, thinking the other man might not be a judge, whether it was a good one or not. I really did not know it was a bad one; I took it for a good one</p>

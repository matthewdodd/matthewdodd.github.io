            . I lost my shawl on the 27th of August. The prisoner came on the 27th of August, she came to enquire if I had some shawls for a lady to look at. I asked her where; she said at Bow-street. I asked her to leave the address, and I would send them. She said, she was going there, and if I would send any person, she would send them to the lady. I sent my shop woman with them, with two lace shawls. I did not hear any more until the person came back again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you ever see the prisoner before - A. Never before she came into my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear positively to her person - A. So far as I can judge, I verily believe her to be that person.</p>

            . I am a shop woman to Mrs. Rennie. The prisoner asked me to go with her; as she went along, she said, she was quite a stranger in town, and her mistress was a foreigner in Bow-street; when she got there, she told me to go into the parlour, and she would go up, and tell her mistress she was come; she came in again in a few minutes; she said her mistress being a foreigner, did not like to see strangers; and she would take one of the shawls up stairs to her, and show her. I waited there a little time, and she never came. I saw two servants in the passage; I went; and asked them where the young person was; she told me to sit down, she dare say she would not be long. I waited there a long time, after that, and began to be quite uneasy, and asked her again; she said the person was gone out that came in with me. I asked her what she was gone out for; she said, to shew her mistress the shawls. They said they knew nothing of the girl, she was quite a stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. What house was this - A. The Brunswick Hotel in Bow-street, Covent-garden. I never saw the prisoner again, until I saw her at Bow-street; I am sure she is the person to the best of my recollection; it is her, I have no doubt about it I never saw the shawls again.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the person dressed that came into your mistress's shop - A. A purple spencer, black bonnet, and a dark silk gown.</p>

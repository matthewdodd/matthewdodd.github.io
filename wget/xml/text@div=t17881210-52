               <p>This is a malicious prosecution; I was employed by the prosecutor to carry home goods, and bring the stamps back again, to defraud his Majesty of his revenue; and I asked the prosecutor for a hat, and he gave it me; it did not fit me, and I changed it for that hat marked Lyons; I pledged the hats; the other was another man's, pledged the day before, it belonged to a man I worked with; he never saw it before: he has transported two men before; he will try to keep me confined, on account of the information; he laid a capital offence to my charge, a sham robbery, you never heard of any thing so scandalous; I came into the very neighbourhood to work after.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I deny every thing he says about the information; we are as careful as possible.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He had a very bad hat, and I gave him a decent looking one, from under the counter.</p>

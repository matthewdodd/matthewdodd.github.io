               <p>SARAH DUNDON. I am a widow, and lodge in a second floor back room, at Richard Snugg's; the prisoner lived on the same floor with a young man, as her husband. On the 21st of June I turned up my bedstead, and went out about noon; the blankets and counterpane were then in the bedstead; I think I locked the door. I returned in a quarter of an hour, and found it was not locked, but I was not sure that I had left it locked. I went out again about six o'clock - I am sure I locked it then, and took the key; I had missed nothing then. On coming home at nine I found the door unlocked, but shut, and about eleven I was going to bed, but on turning the bedstead down I missed a counterpane and two blankets; the prisoner was not at home: I saw her at one o'clock next day but one, in custody of a watchman. I cannot say whether Mrs. Snugg was out or in when I went out; she was at home at nine o'clock, and is seldom out. The street door is always kept shut. I have a key to let myself in.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Bishopsgate-street. On the 21st of June, about half-past eight o'clock at night, the prisoner pawned this counterpane, in the name of Mary Ann Wood, for 5 s. - it is worth 8 s.</p>

            . I lodge at Snugg's. I saw the prisoner come down into the yard about quarter past seven o'clock on this evening; she went up stairs, and came down about half-past seven, with a large bundle under her left arm, and went out in great haste. Next morning I heard of this robbery, and did not see her again till the watchman brought her back. Mrs. Hannah Snugg was at home all day, and was undressing her children when the prisoner went out.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was desired to look out for the prisoner on Tuesday night, and on Thursday morning she and a young man came down the road - I stopped them. I know that this house is in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you feel it go from you? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it go? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did these men surround you? where they going one way, or in different directions? - They were going the same way, as I went up Cheapside towards St. Paul's, or Newgate-street; there were some before me, and some behind me, there were four of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body touch you besides the man that gave you the blow? - Not to strike or hurt my person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other people push you about at all, besides the man that gave you the shove on your left shoulder? - They did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive the blow before your watch was taken, or after? - Before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the watch go instantly on receipt of the blow, or some time after? - Instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened to you after that? - The prisoner at the bar and the two that I conceived to be at the front of me, immediately ran across the way, the way between the coaches; I immediately called stop thief! at that instant, Woodman, a constable came up; he asked me what was the matter? I told him I was robbed of my watch; after I had called out stop thief, the prisoner was obliged to cross the way back again, on account of the mob, and I saw him at the top of Ironmonger-lane, after he had past the coaches, the same side of the way, where I had been robbed.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this nearer to St. Paul's than where you was robbed, or farther distant? - Alderman Boydell's is at the corner of Ironmonger-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was near the same place where you was robbed? - It was. After he was stopped they took him to the Compter; Woodman stopped him, I see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do which you know the man was dressed? - I came that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you kick about him, to know that he was SAILER sworn. that you saw at Ironmonger-lane you the shove on your shoulder? - I know his face, I had seen him in the it man before, but not to know him personally.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing else that you venture to swear to him by but his face? - That is the principal.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a hat on or not? - He had a hat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a round hat or not? - I cannot tell positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the lamps light at this time? - It was getting duskish, I don't believe there were any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this man speak to you before he was taken? - Not before.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the man, is that the man? - I am certain of it; the next day another party (Hyams) was taken, who has turned King's evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you are positive to his per son; I want to know whether you was as positive to this man's person before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170060"></xptr>you knew any thing of Hyams! - Yes, I was as positive, I have never conversed with Hyams on the business.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you happen to see Glandfield at all? - Yes, I saw him, but I did not see him robbed, I ran over to Ironmonger-lane, and there was a man said, there was a thief at the corner, and Mr. Glandfield had got hold of Morobus, the prisoner, and he said, this was the man that hit him on the back.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive that the man that you followed up Cheapside, and the man that Mr. Glandfield took at the corner of Ironmonger-lane is the same man? - I am positive, I have no doubt at all.</p>

            Was you, or was you not in Leadenhall-street that evening? - We never were near it that evening, though the boy said that he followed us from Leadenhall-market. Then we met the gentleman that lost his watch between the Change and the Mansion-house, us four were walking along talking of one thing or another, Mr. Glanfield was going up towards St. Paul's, and Stokes, says, there is a sucky gorge,(meaning a drunken man,) with that Stokes got before him, and we three were walking behind the gentleman, going along that way we missed Stokes. I thought we had lost him, we followed the gentleman from the Poultry compter till we came to Ironmonger-lane, then Stokes came and crossed the road from Ironmonger-lane, and ran against the gentleman, as we were behind the gentleman, and said to us, I have got it, (meaning that he had got the watch, as I thought,) with that there the gentleman did not miss it directly, he walked from the corner of Ironmonger-lane, to the corner of Queen-street, and then he missed his watch, he then said, I have lost my watch by some person, and he did not know by who, and he catched hold of a strange man that was going along the street, and then he made a catch to catch hold of me, and I asked him what he wanted with me? he said, he had lost his watch this instant, by somebody, by whom he did not know, and Morobus happened to come past, and he catched hold of him likewife, and let me go, and he challenged him with it, and he said he had lost his watch, and he believed he was one of them, a mob got round and he said that he had lost his watch, and by whom he did not know; and the prisoner said, that he was very willing to be searched, that he had no watch, nor knew of any watch, then the mob or constable took him to the Poultry compter; I did not stop to see, then I went on the opposite side of the way to the Poultry compter, and I met Stokes and Drew, I asked Stokes whether he saw the prisoner go into the Compter?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170063"></xptr>he said, yes, he had, I asked him where the watch was? he said he had it safe enough, he had hid it somewhere, I told him to go back and fetch the watch, where he had hid it; and he went back, and I went back with him, he went then to a court opposite Ironmonger-lane almost, where there is a pastry-cooks at the corner, and he put his hand between some water tubs that were full of water for the sake of water for the horses, there are five or six, and Stokes took it out, and gave it to Drew, Stokes did, then we all three, me, Stokes and Drew, went and sold the watch for a guinea at Mrs. Lee's a silversmiths in Shoreditch, and we went and parted the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as soon as the gentleman let you go, you made off? - No, I made the other side of the way from the mob.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you whether the prisoner did not give the gentleman a blow or push? - He did not; Stokes ran against the gentleman and pushed the back of the gentleman against us two; the prisoner never touched him at all; I said the same before the Lord Mayor; the boy said, that he followed us from Leadenhall-street; and we were not in Leadenhall-street that night; and as for the prosecutor, he appeared to be rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You told us it was duskish? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the lamps light? - It was between.</p>
               <p>Q. Stokes had left you; you know you never saw him again till he came rushing against this gentleman? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You three had hold of each others arms? - I and the prisoner had.</p>
               <p>Q. Robus never put up his hand to strike? - He never did, if I was to die this minute.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know any thing at all about the watch being taken till it was over? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. The prosecutor took up a strange man first? - He did; he let him go and then he laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make sufficient observation to know whether the gentleman, the prosecutor, was drunk or sober? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sucky gorge? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner Robus any of the money? - I gave it to his sister to bring to him, on account that he was in trouble, because we went out together, I thought he was entitled to his there.</p>

               <p>Court. What business did you go out upon? - To see what we could get.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Robus take any part in this business at all? - No; neither did he know the robbery was committed, till Stokes ran past, and said, he had got it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going up Cheapside, just after the robbery, the gentleman was to much in liquor he laid hold of me, and Hyams, and several others that he came nigh, and then the mob came up, and he had me taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Will you say that you did not take hold of any body else? - I did not upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Jury to Woodman. Was the prosecutor in liquor? - I really don't believe he was in liquor; he did not appear to be in liquor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Have you ever been a witness before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know there is a forty pound on this man's conviction? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Hillier. The prosecutor did not appear to be perfectly sober, but so sober that he well knew what he said, because he told the exact story the next day.</p>
               <p>Court to Glanfield. Is it true that you never said you lost your watch till you got to King-street; did you give<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170064"></xptr>the account instantaneously or not? - Instantanecously.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. Look at Hyams; was that man one of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. With regard to Leadenhall market, did you see these people in Leadenhall-market, or was you coming from Leadenhall street? - I did; I see them all there.</p>

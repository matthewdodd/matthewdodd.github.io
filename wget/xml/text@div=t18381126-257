                  </hi>. I live in Clapham-rise—Dady was in my employ as footman. I missed some property, and charged Dady with having stolen certain empty bottles—he acknowledged his guilt, and begged for forgiveness, it being his first offence—I said it was my duty to give him in charge—I procured a search warrant, and went with the officer—I found at Robinson's house a great quantity of bottles, among which were the two which I now produce.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housemaid to the prosecutor. On Wednesday, the 7th of October, I saw Dady take some glass bottles out of the stable and deliver them to Robinson, who was in the yard on my master's per<lb></lb>mises—I think he took about a dozen—he put them into a hamper, took them out of the yard, placed them on a barrow, and wheeled it away—I asked Robinson where he got them from—he said he brought them from Balham-hill—he came back in about ten minutes, and then he had a bundle and a pitcher with kitchen grease in it—it came from Mr. Evans's house—I asked him what business he had there—he said he had nothing more than what he paid for.</p>

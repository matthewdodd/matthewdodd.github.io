             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am shopman to the last witness; I saw the prisoner bring a carpet under his arm; I pursued him and took him with it under his arm; I asked him where he was going with it; he told me that a gentleman asked him if he wanted a job, and told him he would give him a shilling to take this carpet to the Mulberry Tree, in Whitecross-Alley; he asked me if it was my property; I told him it was my master's; he smacked the carpet down upon the ground, and damned me and the property too; he ran away, and I immediately took him; I took up the carpet, and have kept it ever since separate from any other (produces it).</p>
               <p>Q. That is a common pattern, is it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the stock, to see if any carpet was missing? - A. No, but I can swear to it from the mark J W U P.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my carpet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine your stock to see if it was missing? - A. No, my stock is too large to take stock often; I keep a list as near as I can of what carpets I have in hand, that I may not buy too many of one sort, and not have enough of another; I remember the carpet perfectly well; it is rather an uncommon size; it is longer than usual for the with.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was looking out for a stall to work in; a gentleman was standing at that gentleman's door, and asked me if I wanted a job; he desired me to take this carpet to the Mulberry Tree, he helped me up with it; I never was in the shop in my life; I never swore nor threw the carpet down at all.</p>

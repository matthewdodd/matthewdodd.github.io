                  </hi>. I live at No. 39, Finsbury-square, and am as apprentice of Mr. Green, of St. Thomas's Hospital. I was in Fleet-street, on the night of the 19th of December, about 10 o'clock—I found that the shadow of a bonnet was close to me—I put my hand to my pocket, and felt my handkerchief safe—I felt again and missed my handkerchief—I turned and saw a female and the prisoner conversing together, and looking at me—I went to them and touched the woman, and saw the handker<lb></lb>chief in the prisoner's hand—he was about to leave the curb-stone—he ran into the road—I pursued him to the corner of Fetter-lane—I saw him throw something, which I imagine was my handkerchief—he ran up that lane about three yards—I took him, and some person brought my handker<lb></lb>chief to me, which was wet with mud—this is it—the one I saw in his hand looked like this—he ran away and threw something away.</p>

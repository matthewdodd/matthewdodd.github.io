On the 20th of March, about one o'clock in the day, I was in the warehouse in conversation with Mr. Bonsor - I saw the prisoner with a bundle of paper in his possession at the top of the warehouse - he was a stranger - he was going out into the street with it - I ran up to him - he immediately put it down, and asked if it belonged to us, and said he had taken it from a boy in the street - it had been on the counter before, in that warehouse - his statement could not be true - I saw him take it from the counter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see it in my hand at all? A. I did; you walked very fast out of the counting-house, and then ran - I saw you drawing the paper from the counter - you had it in your hands, and immediately put it down by another pile of paper - it was on two other bundles on the counter - this is the paper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman never saw it in my hand - I went into an apothecary's shop, and asked if they wanted an errand boy - they advised me to go into this shop - I went, and saw a boy run from the door, and the paper lying down - the gentleman came up - I asked him if it was his, and he collared me.</p>

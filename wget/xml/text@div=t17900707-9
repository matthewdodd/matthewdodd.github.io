               <p>On the 29th of May I was going out to work: I left the prisoner to take care of the house, and the children: I told her I would give her sixpence and some victuals. I came home about eight o'clock in the evening, and found some of my things were gone; my child was at the door at play; and he said he had been with Nelly to sell the things; (enumerates the things); I was very much flurried; and some people sent for me; and I was going along the street, and there was a crowd, and she was looking out of a coach window; I took her, and gave charge of her to the watchman; I came back and searched, and found the remainder of my things were gone: she was taken to the watch-house: I found some of my things again; they are here: she lodged in my house: the things were found at a house in East-smithfield; the person is here.</p>

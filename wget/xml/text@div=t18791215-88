                  </hi>. I keep a fancy goods shop at 18, Caledonian Road, Islington—on 14th November, about 6 p.m., the prisoner came in and chose a shilling box of dominoes, which he said were for a publican in the neighbourhood—he gave me a half-sovereign—I gave him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change, and"put the coin between my teeth; it bent, and he ran out with the change and the dominoes—I ran out after him, and a policeman caught him—I had never lost sight of him—he was brought back, and the policeman asked him what he had got in his mouth—he said "Nothing"—the policeman said "You have"—another policeman said "If you don't give it to me I will take it from you"—the prisoner then took a half-sovereign from his mouth, and was going to hand it to me—I said "It is not mine, give it to the policeman"—he did so, and I gave the policeman the other half-sovereign—this is it—I know it by the way I bent it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 456). The last witness pointed out the prisoner to me in Pentonville Road running very fast; I never lost sight of him—he ran towards some cabs; a cabdriver moved his cab, and I caught him on the other side of it, about a quarter of a mile from where I first saw him, but he escaped again, and I caught him about 15 yards off—I saw him take something from his pocket, and put it in his mouth—I took hold of both his hands, and said "Give me that which is in your mouth," but he said nothing—another officer came up, and we took him to Mrs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of Mr. Hendrick's horse-keepers, of Church-lane, Whitechapel. On the 18th of may, about nine o'clock at night, I saw the Prisoner coming out of the yard, with a truss of hay on his back—he went towards his own home—I afterwards saw James Dell, the store-keeper, and I mentioned it to him and Mr. Hendricks.</p>

                  </hi>. I manage the business of John Hendricks, my father—he is an omnibus proprietor in Church-lane, Whitechapel—the prisoner was in his service as horse-keeper for four or five months—in consequence of information from Thomas Lay, I went to the prisoner's house, in a court in Lambeth-street, about a quarter past eleven o'clock at night—I took as officer with me—he knocked at the door, and in three or four minutes the prisoner's wife answered it—before that I had opened the window shutters—the door opens into the room—when it was opened I went in and saw a truss of hay facing the door—I looked at it—it was mixture hay—I gave the prisoner in charge for stealing the truss—he said, "I know it is your hay, I have taken it for the horses in the morning.</p>

Q.</hi> Does your father attend to the business at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he does not interfere—we allow the horses no hay uncut—I have not seen them eat uncut hay for the last three or four months—I have never seen them eat it in Back Church-lane—our hay is kept in Church-lane-yard, and the horses are kept in Back Church-lane—if the prisoner had intended to take the hay to Back Church-lane, he would not have gone to Lambeth-street at all—he would have done work at a quarter-past eight o'clock at night—h</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 21st of October, about half past four, I was coming along <placeName id="t18111030-118-crimeloc669">the Strand</placeName>

There was a gentleman just going to get into a coach, he put his hand through the coat and took this case out of his pocket; I saw him do it. I apprehended him, and saw him drop it; I took it to the gentleman in the coach, I asked the gentleman if he had lost any thing, he said he had not; I told him to feel; he felt his pocket and said he had lost his ink-case; I shewed it to the gentleman, he said it was his; he said he was going in the country, he could not attend. I took the prisoner to Bow-street, on searching him I found this skin, he said he found it.</p>

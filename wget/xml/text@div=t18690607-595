                  </hi>. I live at 5, Edwards Square, Caledonian Road, and am an ivory turner—last Saturday night I was going home from Carter Street, Walworth—I inquired my way of a man, and then went into a public-house and saw the three prisoners there—I asked Newing the way to the station—he said, "You are too late to go by the train, mate; what will you stand?"—I stood two pots of ale, and paid with a sovereign—I put the change in my pocket; I had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether, in silver, there—I stopped there more than half an hour, and went away, leaving the men there—when I had gone 100 or 200 yards, I stopped at a coffee-stall and had a cup of coffee—I then went towards the station, and received a blow—I turned round, and Newing hustled and struck me in the back of my head with his fist, and then another blow in the face—I was knocked down on the ground, and bled—I saw the other two prisoners—Newing thrust his hands into my pocket and took my money out, and one of the others put his hand in and took some more, because Newing did not get it all—the third man stood over me—they ran away, and a constable picked me up—I afterwards saw them in the hands of the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At what time did you leave Walworth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 10.30—I had been over on this side of the water—I was going to the Elephant and Castle station—the public-house I went into was between Carter Street and the Elephant and Castle—I arrived at that part of Surrey at 9.30—I had never seen the man before—I treated them, and stopped till nearly 12—the road where I was knocked down was very dark, with arches—I had been into other public-houses that evening; but not several—I had had a glass or two of ale; but not more than a glass or two at a time—I may have repeated that process three times.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 43). I received information, and saw Freeman going down the New Kent Road, and the three prisoners following a short distance behind him—he had to pen under a railway arch before he turned to the station—he was talking to a coffee—stall keeper, and they consulted together just past the stall—I passed them, and stood at the corner of Weymouth Street, and I watched them—Freeman left the coffee-stall and turned down under the arch—I ran down Weymouth Street to the corner of Baker Street, but could not see them—I ran across to the arch-way, which was very dark, and saw Policeman 308 pulling Freeman up from the ground, who was bleeding very much from his mouth he said, "I have been robbed?"—I ran through the court, under the arch, and caught Harrison—they were all three standing under a lamp post, apparently dividing money—I said, "I charge you with knocking down a man under the railway arch, and robbing him"—he said that he knew nothing about it—Hillman ran away—I said to Newing, "Heenan, it is no use running away"—he said, "No, sir, I will not run away"—Hillman was caught by another constable—I searched Harrison, and found 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer—I was on duty on 29th August in Whitechapel, between 7 and 8 in the morning—I observed the prisoner walking down North street with a bay mare—he offered it for sale to some man who refused to buy it—I went and asked him where he came from—he said from St. Luke's—I asked him how he became possessed of that mare—he said he had had it for six years and a half, that it was blind with one eye and broken winded, and he wanted to sell it as it was of no use to him—he afterwards told me that he and another man took the mare from Hackney-marsh, from a field near the church, about half-past 5 o'clock the evening before—and if I went in that direction I should find the owner—I took possession of the mare, and Mr. Tate came and owned it—I went to Hackney station and gave information—the prisoner said, "The other man that was with me when we stole the horse, has just made his escape."</p>

I am a greengrocer and carman—I had a mare—on 28th October it was on the marsh ground at Hackney—the next morning my son went to fetch it, and could not find it—I saw it afterwards at Worship-street—I did not give anybody any permission to take it away or to sell it—it was taken unknown to me—it was worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> I am a pianoforte-maker, and live in the Old Kent-road—the prisoner has been in my service upwards of two years. On the 13th of May he had work to do—he left me, and gave no notice—in consequence of his leaving, I made inquiry—I was shown a pianoforte by John Dudbridge's wife—it was partly made of veneer, which I am able to say was my property—I had not sold it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a pianoforte maker, and live in the Kent-road. I know the prisoner—in the early part of May I purchased a pianoforte case of him for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is what is termed a mahogany case—it is partly veneer and partly mahogany—Mr. Binkes came to me to ask me to give up the piano<lb></lb>forte, but the Magistrate told me not—I know the prisoner as a journeyman to Mr. Binkes—Little has seen the pianoforte—I was in Mr. Binkes's employ some years back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it not the practice of persons who are in employ to have time of their own, and to employ themselves? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Mr. Binkes wanted to take pianoforte away from me—I never refused to have a part of it brought here—a part might have been brought here if demanded—I have known the prisoner from five to seven years—he has a wife and five children—they have been in the Union since this—I never knew anything against the prisoner—I am a grocer and cheesemonger—he has dealt with me for the last two years, and paid me honourably—he was in arrears for rent about the time he went away from Mr. Binkes.</p>

                  </hi> I have been journeyman to Mr. Binkes nearly four years—I have been in the business about twenty years—I have seen the pianoforte that Mr. Dudbidge has got—I have seen the veneers on it—I know them to be my master's property—I have not the smallest doubt of it—all the veneer is his except the veneer in front, that I cannot be positive about—Mr. Binkes does not allow his men to work for themselves, all the men know that perfectly well—Mr. Dudbridge keeps a grocer's shop in the Kent-road, twenty or thirty yards from Mr. Binkes' premises.</p>

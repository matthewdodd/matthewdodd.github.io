                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. John Nussey, of No. 4, Cleveland Row. On 4th May I was in bed, and about 1 o'clock in the morning I heard a noise—I sat up in bed to listen, and saw the prisoner come round the counter, in the surgery; he had a light—I asked what he wanted there—there was no answer, but the light was put out—I got up, and went to the outer surgery door—I had fastened the doors the night before at a few minutes after 11 o'clock.</p>

On Monday, 4th May, I was called to the prosecutor's house, between 1 and 2 o'clock—I examined the premises, and saw footmarks on the window ledge, waterspout, wall, and roof—the skylight had been forced—persons had got down that way, and a small desk, standing on the counter under the skylight, was broken.</p>

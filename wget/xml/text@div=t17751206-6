When I met them one passed me and turned back again, took hold of me, and made me fall back against the wall, and held a knife to my throat, and bade me deliver my money: I am pretty sure it was Camper held the knife to my throat. They pressed me against the wall, and took the money out of my pocket, and the watch. I do not recollect either of the other prisoners, but one of my seals was found on one of them. I took no notice of any but Camper, who stood before me. They wanted to take out my buckles: I told them they would be of no use.</p>

This seal I gave to Mr. Bentley: I can swear to the setting of it, that it is the same. (Mr. Bentley was desired to look at those seals, which he did, and deposed they were those he had to his watch the night he was robbed).</p>

            , Constable. I think it was on a Thursday or Friday the 20th of November, I am not certain as to the day, one Dumon came to me and described the three prisoners at the bar, and said they were gone into the fields.</p>
               <p>How long is it since that man told you of the prisoners going out into the fields? - I think it was the 22d of November: he said they wanted him to go out with them and get some money. We went after them, and found the three prisoners sitting in a public-house, the sign of the Castle, in Red Lion-street. We brought them to the justice, and they were committed. He told them that they were to be examined on Monday. The gentleman swore to Camper. The seals were found on Hatch the prisoner, which Mr. Bentley swore to.</p>

            . I am servant to the governor of Clerkenwell Bridewell. We were told that there were three people gone a robbing: we went and found the three prisoners at the Castle in Red Lion-street.

On Monday Camper said the knife was his, and begged me to return it.</p>

               <p>Are you now positive that he was one of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you saw him at Mr. Sherwood's office, was you positive? - Yes; he had a close-bodied brown great coat, with a round hat; this was on the Monday after I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Are you positive that those are your seals, and that they were to your watch at the time he stopped your person? - Yes; I charged him immediately as soon as I saw him. Mr. Sherwood asked me, if I could swear that he was the person; I told him I could; and did swear.</p>

I had scarce drank when these gentlemen came in, and desired me to sit up. I said, if they insisted I would. They took me into a back room and searched me. This gentleman (meaning Mr. Bentley) came to the justice, and said he was not sure of me. They searched me a second time, and found those seals now produced, which I bought of a Jew.</p>
               <p>[The constable was called, and asked, if he searched him twice? who said, that he did, but found nothing on him the first time.]</p>

I am in the prosecutor's service, as invoice clerk—I did not see three dozen wine glasses delivered to the prisoner, on 18th Jan.—my duty is to take an account of the returns which the different deliverymen bring back—on the 18th he gave me an account of some returns of wine glasses, I have the book here—he gave an account of three dozen wine glasses as returned from Mrs. Dallas, of Kensington—I made an entry of that from his mouth—the book is then passed over to Mr. Moss, and he examines the goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman in the employ of the prosecutors—it is my duty to check the returns of goods that are not taken by customers—on the day in question I checked with the prisoner this entry of three dozen wine glasses—he produced twenty two to me—I asked him what had become of the other fourteen—he said, "Why, I could not have had more than twenty-two, because we had no more in stock"—I knew that to be</p>

               <p>false, and told him so—I had the return hook before roe at the time—I called his attention to the entry, and his explanation was that he could not have had more than twenty two, because there were no more in stock of that pattern—I had myself given him the three dozen on the Monday, to take to Mrs. Dallas, of Kensington—this was on the Wednesday—not having made his delivery on the Monday, he started off on the Tuesday morning, a thing unprecedented, without his horse and cart, without coming into the warehouse at all, which was decidedly against the orders of myself and his superiors—it was his duty to have come on the Tuesday morning, to know if there were any other orders the same way, that he might deliver—I did not know of his absence till I sent to his house to inquire after him—when he told me there were only twenty-two in stock I said it was false, and I should tell Mr. Defries of it immediately, and while I turned to speak to Mr. Defries the prisoner went away—that was about 11 o'clock, on the Wednesday—I saw no more of him till he was at the Mansion House—it was his duty to have remained at the warehouse to the end of the day—he had another delivery to get ready to take out.</p>

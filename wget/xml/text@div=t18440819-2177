On the 2nd of March, about a quarter-past nine o'clock in the morning, I was hanging my things in the yard, and heard a terrible fighting in the second floor in the next house—the prisoner keeps that house, and lets lodgings—he hawks things in the street—I never saw Mrs. Hobbs but once, but I know she lived on the second floor of that house—I went and knocked at the street door, and demanded it to be opened (as I heard screams of murder) four or five times—it was then opened by a woman—I said, "What is Mr. Carroll doing up stairs?"—the door was slammed in my face—I went into my yard again, heard the blows repeated, and "Murder" called—I demanded the door to be opened again, and saw the prisoner stand<lb></lb>ing on the stairs, and Mrs. Carroll by the deceased's side—I said, "What are you about? if you don't let the woman come out, I will fetch a policeman"—he told me to mind my own business—I saw Mrs. Hobbs come down stain with a blow on her forehead, and the blood trickling down her neck—she called the prisoner many bad names, and used many bad expressions—she asked him for her boots and her husband's—Mrs. Carroll said, "Betsy, I will give them to you when you have paid for the crockery you have broken"—the deceased called her several names, and continued calling out for revenge, twenty times over, and aggravated them very much—they both used bad words—he said if she did not leave him alone, he would cut her head off—she had a fork in her hand, beating it up and down—I did not see anything in the prisoner's hand—the door was slammed in my face again—I went in<lb></lb>doors, went out again, and heard her call him bad names, and say, "Carroll, don't strike me with the poker, I am not a man, but a woman."</p>

I was called in to see Mrs. Hobbs about ten o'clock in the morning—she was lying on the bed dead—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on Monday morning—I found a slight abrasion on the right elbow, not of any importance; a bruise on the left cheek just under the eye and above the eye, and one on the temple—there was a wound behind the right ear about an inch long—on further examination all those bruises and the wound corresponded, with a large quantity of blood clotted within the skin between that and the bone—I found the bone in no way injured—I found the dura mater very full of blood, more than usual, and the membranes con<lb></lb>taining</p>

               <p>the brain were more than usually turgid with blood—the brain was not particularly turgid, and in no way injured—the heart, lungs, chest, sto<lb></lb>mach, and bowels were all perfectly healthy—the stomach contained nothing more than is usually found, just the remains of a meal—I attribute her death to concussion of the brain—the brain was turgid with excitement, and the covering of the brain was turgid, producing pressure on it—in my opinion the concussion was produced by repeated <hi rend="italic">blows</hi>—it is usual in great excite<lb></lb>ment for large quantities of blood to flow to the brain—in my judgment the cause of death was from conjoint pressure on the brain, the large flow of blood, and the concussion from repeated blows.</p>

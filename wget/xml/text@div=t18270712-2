I had not been there many minutes when Raymond whispered across the table to Johnson; I became alarmed, and wanted to go out; Raymond said I should not go unless I tossed with them for a pot of beer - I refused, but he said I should not go out till I did - I then tossed, and lost; he said I should not go till I had tossed for another pot, which I also lost; I threw a shilling on the table, then jumped over the table, to get away, but I was directly surrounded by eight or ten of them - the four prisoners were among them; I cannot say that they laid hands on me - my arms were held up, and my throat seized, but I do not know who by; I felt some hands in my pocket, and my money was taken from me, but I cannot say who did it. As soon as they let me go I went to the door; there was a watchman there, I told him I was robbed, and a young man came to the door with another watchman; we all four went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120004"></xptr>in together - I pointed Raymond and Cowley out; they were taken to the watch-house; I said there were two more whom I could describe; as soon as I entered the room Johnson held his head down; he was taken. The watchman went to the bar, and asked the landlord who officiated as waiter; he said George - he called out, "George," and Lovell came along the passage; I said he was the man, and he was taken. I lost a sovereign and 2s. 2d. When we got to the watch-house Lovell said to Raymond, "You know who has got the sovereign as well as I do;" Raymond said, No, he did not - Lovell said, "Yes you do - it is Bill or Jack - I do not know his other name, but you do."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. In whose employ are you? A. In Mr. Palmer's, of Bishopsgate-street. I then lived with Mr. Dobson, of the Strand. There were twenty or thirty persons in the room, and some females, but none at the table with us. Raymond did not complain of losing money in the scuffle - he did not ask me to drink; I believe he said he was a bricklayer, and I said I was a paper-stainer. I am certain that when they let go of my throat the four prisoners were round me, and before they took hold of it they were all as close to me as they could be. I had not talked to any females. It was quite daylight; there was no disturbance except with their surrounding me - the prisoners surrounded me, and prevented my going out, or I should not have been robbed. I cannot say who robbed me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner JOHNSON. Q. Were you not sitting between two women of the town? A. As God is my judge it is false - I spoke to no woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner LOVELL. Q. Did you not knock at the door about half-past three o'clock? A. I was in bed at that time; the doors were open when I went in.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Giles'. I was in my box about half-past four o'clock on this morning, when Harman called out Watch! I went to the door - his waistcoat was unbuttoned, and he seemed much agitated; he said he had been robbed, and was in dread of his life; I asked him to go in and point them out - he said he would wait at the door, and they would be out presently; he pointed out Raymond and Cowley; I took them to the watch-house. I returned to the public-house, and he pointed out Johnson in the tap-room; he said the other officated as waiter; I asked the landlord where he was - he called George, and Lovell came; I secured him, and at the watch-house he said to Raymond, "You know who has got the sovereign," or the money; Raymond said, "I know nothing of it." A young man had come out of the house to look for a watchman, before Hariman called me; I cannot find him now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search the prisoners? A. Yes - I found several shillings on Cowley, but nothing on the others; he was outside the door when I took him; the man who fetched me pointed him out, and Harman identified him; Harman did not appear intoxicated.</p>
               <p>RAYMOND's Defence. I got up that morning to get some spirits to send to my father-in-law, at Birmingham - I went into the Black Dog, and the prosecutor asked me to drink out of his pot; I sat down, and joined his company; he was between two girls of the town - he said he would toss me for a pot of beer; I did not like it, but Cowley whispered to me to toss him - I tossed, and won two pots - he put a shilling down; I took it to take for the beer: he then offered to fight any man in the room for a sovereign - he had some words with another man, and stepped over the table - he was surrounded, but I was sitting at the table. - When he went out I followed, and he said it was through me he was robbed. I lost 6s. myself in getting over the table.</p>
               <p>The other prisoners made the same Defence.</p>

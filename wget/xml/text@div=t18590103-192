                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—we have been married three years and a half—on 13th September, I was living at 4, Oak-place, Stepney, not with my husband, but he came there, and stayed a night and a day—we had parted on 12th September, the day after he came—he found me out at 4, Oak-place, I do not know how, and came there drank with his shirt all bloody, and said that he had been fighting in Baker-street—nearly a month afterwards, in case he should come again to me, I removed to Wellington-street, Stepney, and occupied a room on the ground-floor—I have one child by the prisoner, a little boy, who was living with me—on the morning of 14th December, I was in bed with my little boy, when the prisoner came into my room—I said "Well, Fred, what do you want here "—he said "I have come to see you, but I shall not stay long"—he came to my bedside, and I said "Move away, I want to get up and get some tea"—this was about 10 o'clock in the morning—he said "You lie there, there is plenty of time for that, and forced me down on the bed with his left arm—I said, "Come, none of your nonsense, or I shall call murder"—he said "Where is the baby?"—I said "Here he is" and pulled the bedclothes down to show him—he went to lock the door, and then went towards the window, and I got out of bed—he was pulling something out of his left hand pocket, and I said "What a fine cigar-case you have got"—he said "Yes it is"—he replaced the case in his pocket, but what he bad in his hands I could not tell—there was nothing more till I felt a razor across my throat, as I was putting on some of my clothes, and he was standing by the wall at the back of me—it is a small room—I felt myself down on the floor, with my head on the fender, fighting to get possession of the razor—he kept trying to cut my throat while I was on the floor, and cut it in three places—he had his left hand on my chest, and one knee on me, and with his other hand he was wounding me—I laid hold of the razor, and my hands were cut in eight places—I caught hold of it two or three times, but could not succeed in getting it from his hands till the last, and then I did; and in the struggle, it broke, and I had possession of the blade in three wounds in my hand—the handle came off, and I kept the blade—I kept crying "Murder," and begging him to desist, but he never answered—when I got the blade from him, he screamed out "Oh!" and went to reach a white-handled dinner knife off the table, but he overbalanced himself and fell, and that is how I got up, I unlocked the door, and found myself in the other room on the same floor—I took the razor from the wounds and flung it away in the fender, as I could not remove from where I stood—I had the presence of mind to think that if he followed me, he would get possession of it—a surgeon was sent for—I was afterwards taken to the hospital—there was no razor in the room when ray husband came in the morning—I saw a razor-case produced at the police-court—that is what I took to be a cigar-case.</p>

I live at 9, Wellington-street, and let rooms—Mrs. Goodey came to live with me about two months prior to 14th December—on that morning about 10 o'clock there was a knock at the front door—I opened it, and the prisoner came up and asked me for a name which I did not know—he then said, 'Goodey,"—I said, "Yes,"—and he walked in and opened her room door, I did not show him her room—he went in, and not more than five minutes afterwards, I heard Mrs. Goodey say, "If you do I will shout murder"—the door was shut and lacked, and my daughter knocked at the door—I heard a confusion, and my daughter ran to the police-station—I heard a very great scuffle, and she screamed "Murder" over and over again—I tried to force the door open, but could not; I begged of her to unlock the door, and called out loudly to her—some one unlocked the door, and Mrs. Goodey came out, and into my back-room,</p>

               <p>covered with blood—she had a petticoat on over her night gown, and that was all—the prisoner came out to me—I was very much frightened, he lifted up his arm to me, and said that he was mad—I said, "For God's sake have mercy on a poor old widow, do if you please go into that room and sit down"—that was the prosecutrix's room—he went in, and I took the key from the inside of the door, and locked him in, and while I was in the back room he got out at the window into the street—the police came and took Mrs. Goodey to the hospital in a cab.</p>

I found, marks of blood in the front room—on my way to the house I saw the prisoner about a quarter of a mile from it—he was drunk, and I did not speak to him—he was confined at the station, and about four o'clock in the afternoon he was sober—I read the charge over to him, and cautioned him that he was going to be taken before a Magistrate, and whatever he said to me it would be my duty to relate to the Magistrate in court—he said "I know nothing of it, I have no recollec<lb></lb>tion of it."</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner lodged in the house where I was acting as nurse, prior to 14th December—on that morning he was brought home intoxicated at 2 o'clock and was in a state of great excitement—about half-past 8 o'clock I made him a cup of tea—he was then in a state of great excitement and still apparently drunk—he had taken his clothes off excepting his trousers—excepting when he got in that state he was a quiet inoffensive man—I have seen him drunk three times during the time I have known him, and on those three occasions he was always in that violent excited way; but he was a quiet, harmless, inoffensive man—he appeared like a man with something on his mind when drunk, but when sober he acted like a gentleman—I did not know his wife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jabez Goodey—I have known the prisoner and his wife since their marriage—he was a peaceable inoffensive man, unless it was through her drunkenness—that was the dispute between them—I have put her to bed four nights out of the seven, and have been obliged to put my children to bed at 4 o'clock that they should not hear her abusive language—he behaved as a good husband to her when she was sober—she has told me something about Mr. Keith—I have seen him—he inquired for Mrs. Goodey and for Mrs. Jervis—he did not know the right name that she went in—I denied him to her several times—she went by the name of Jervis.</p>

I have known the prisoner and prosecutrix just upon two years—I washed for Mrs. Goodey—I saw Cook on 1st December in Mrs. Goodey's room, and she was there also—they were sitting together writing letters—Mrs. Davies was not with me—I was going to call for the washing at another time, and was always desired to tap at her shutters, but on 1st December I had to go for my money—about a fortnight or three weeks after December 1st, I tapped at the shutters—Cook was then sitting in the arm chair, and Mrs. Goodey was sitting on his lap—I called Mrs. Davies to see it.</p>

I am a seaman—between 7 and 8 on Monday evening of 25th November I was in High Street, Shadwell—I saw the prisoner there; I did not know him before—I went with him into a public-house—he asked me for a drink; I gave him a drink—I came out with him—he would shake hands with me—I said I did not want to have anything to do with him—he repeated his request, and I again declined—I had a red pocket handkerchief containing 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some silver—I walked away, and he came and knocked me down senseless and took my money—when I recovered my senses I was on the ground at the same place—the prisoner was not there then—he ran; another man was with him—I was taken into a house, and the blood washed from me—I was much hurt, and I had a wound on the cheek which was bleeding—when I was in the public-house I had taken out my handkerchief with the money in it in the prisoner's presence—when I called out, the witness Leman and a young lady came to my assistance.</p>

I am landlord of the White Swan public-house, in High Street, Shadwell—on Monday evening, 25th November, I was standing at my shop door; I saw the prosecutor in the street; I saw the prisoner go up to him—he asked "When you go, shake hands with me;" he said "No, let me alone," and he went round the corner of Gravel Lane—he again said "Shake hands with me," and knocked him down—there was another man, who stood aside; he jumped over him, and kept him down—they put their hands in his pocket, took something out, and ran away together—I ran after them, but could not find them—I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 31, Welclose Square—Henry Knowles lodged in the house, and his things were kept in a chest up two pairs of stairs—I saw them safe on the evening of 19th August, at 6 o'clock, and missed them about 8.30—the prisoner lodged in the same house—when I came home that evening, I received information from my servant—I saw the prisoner about 10.30—I showed him this coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which the servant had found in the shed, and accused him of taking it—I asked him if he knew anything about it—he said "No"—I went up into the front room and found, in a bag, the things I had missed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. What time did you see me? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. At a little after nine; you had then been out for about two hours—I did not come in till 11 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to the last witness—on 19th August, be<lb></lb>fore she came home, I went into the prisoner's room, the back parlour, to make his bed—his shoes were by the bed side—he came down stairs about ten minutes afterwards without his shoes, and with this coat on his arm, which he took out into the yard and put it into the shed, and then came back into the house and went down stairs—I went to the shed, got the coat out, and showed it to my mistress when she came in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. How long did you leave the coat in the shed? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—when you went out I went and got it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I had had charge of the house the best part of the afternoon, and had plenty of opportunity of taking several articles if I wished, but I scorned the idea. I came home at 10.5, and saw Miss Jack<lb></lb>son's young man in the house. I went out, got a pint of beer, which we drank between us. I took off my boots and left them at the side of the bed. I went up stairs, and as I came down I met Annie Jackson, with a candle in her hand; if I had had that jacket on my arm, she must haveseen it. The street door was wide open, and the young man went out. I went out for beer, and when I came back Miss Jackson bad that jacket on her lap, sitting at the supper table, and asked me if I knew anything about it. I said "No!" She said "It is very strange; Mary said she saw you coming down stairs" When she got before the inspector she said that I had the jacket on my arm. When I had been in bed twenty minutes, they fetched two policemen, who took me. I am innocent. I do not know who put the clothes in the bag.</p>

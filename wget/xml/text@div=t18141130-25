On Saturday, the 5th of November I went to my bed-room about eleven o'clock in the morning, on my going into the room I observed William Green, the prisoner, under my bed, I saw his legs under the bed; I gave an alarm; I called down to my servant; I was outside of the door; I called my servant up, my witness came up James Styles.</p>
               <p>Q. Before

             came up, had the person came from under the bed - A. No, he had not moved.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose when 
               <persName id="t18141130-25-person293">
                  James 
                  Stiles

             came up, then you and he went into the room - A. Yes, I went up for some change; I missed the box, and five pounds in silver. Styles asked him what he did there; he said, nothing. He got from under the bed; my witness Styles rather pulled him from under the bed; I believe he pulled him from under the bed; I saw his whole person; I knew him, he had lodged in my house a month or five weeks. My box of silver was under the bed where he was laying; I took the box up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you use to keep that box - A. In my drawer, in my bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that drawer locked - A. I don't know; I sometimes locked in; I cannot say whether it was then locked or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when you last went to that box, and saw it in that drawer - A. On Saturday morning, about ten o'clock in the day; I counted five poundsworth of silver in the box that morning; at ten o'clock I left the box in the drawer; I went up at that time for some change.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that the prisoner was taken from under the bed, did you look at the drawer, and see whether it was open or any keys in it - A. The drawer was a little way open.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found this box under the bed, was any thing said to the prisoner about it - A. I found the money in the box as I left it; my witness searched him, and found no property on him, but the box under the bed where he was laying; the box was shut with the money in it; the money had not been taken out of it. I don't know whether I said any thing to the prisoner about the box and money. This is the box, it is a screw box; it holds five pounds; it was shut as it is now. I lost nothing at all; the prisoner always conducted himself well before, and he had been ill about ten days, and had not worked.</p>

            . I am a blacksmith, at Potters Bar. I was alarmed by Mrs. Darnell; I was at work in my shop, there was a great alarm; I ran out, and up stairs immediately. When I went into the room Mrs. Darnell stood at the door; I asked what was the matter; she said, there was a man in the room. I looked, and saw part of a man underneath the bed; I catched hold of him, he immediately came from under the bed. I asked him what he did there; he said, he did not know. I asked him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300016"></xptr>whether he had got any money, and what he had got about him. I searched him; he had only three or four halfpense about him. I found nothing about him; I looked under the bed, I saw a box; I called Mrs. Daniel, and told her the box was under the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the box been missed before that - A. Not to my knowledge; she took the box up from under the bed; I asked the prisoner whether he put it there; he said he did not know that he did, that is all that passed. I took him in custody, and took him before a magistrate. Mrs. Darell opened the box in my presence; she said all the silver was right, five pounds.</p>

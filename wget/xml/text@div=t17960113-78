               <p>I am clerk to Messrs. West and Lowndes; the adjoining wharf to Messrs. West and Coe: Having received information, several times, of coals having been taken off our wharf, and the wharf of West and Coe, particularly the 15th, we determined to form a plan for taking the parties that took them; two watchmen, a constable, and myself, got up on Sunday morning, the 20th of December; we went down, thinking to find them on the craft of Messrs. West and Lowndes; we staid till seven o'clock; we then thought, on account of its being high water, they could not get to our craft, and were just going away; at about a quarter after seven, I saw a person come down a shore plank, at the wharf of Messrs. West and Coe, going on to the barge, with a bag; we stopped some time, and heard the same man begin to put some coals out of the second barge, as it appeared to me; I will not swear to the exact barge; I am near sighted; the man put the sack on his back, and came up the plank to shore again; one of the watchmen and the constable went round to meet him, coming off the wharf; they did so; he was stopped, just under the nook of Mr. Stapleton's.</p>
               <p>Q. What was found upon him? - A. A bag, containing coals: he was taken into custody; he knew me, and wanted me to get him off; I told him, I should do no much thing; I gave charge of him; he pretended he wanted to ease himself, and got away from the watchman, but was taken in a few yards; he was not out of sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp Q. How far were you from the barge? - A. As far as from here to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. This was about a quarter after seven in the morning of the 20th of December? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not very light? - A. It began to be so light I could see a person very plain.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not light enough to identify a person? - A. I am near-sighted; if it had been ever so light I could not identify the person.</p>

               <p>I am one of the two watchmen of St. Bride's parish: On Sunday the 20th of December, we had been to watch Messrs. West and Lowndes's premisses, in consequence of a quantity of coals being taken away before; when we were coming away, about a quarter after seven, we saw a man come down the plank, and go into the second barge of Messrs West and Coe's, as I was informed.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Ryall.) Who does the second barge belong to? - A. Messrs. West and Coe; I saw him put the coals in the sack, and tie the mouth of the sack, and put it on his shoulder; I went round, and took him as he came up, with the bag on his shoulder; he pitched the bag down, and begged to ease himself, and then attempted to run away from the watchman, but was taken and committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a watchman now? - A. No; through a quarrel with the people of our ward, I was dis charged.</p>

            . I am a scavenger at No. 12 wharf, Paddington. The prisoner came on the 21st of April to my house with another man, and brought three sets of harness in a cart, which they offered me for 4 l. - I considered it was worth 15 l. or 20 l., and detained him under pretence of getting change for a 10 l. note, while I sent for an officer, who took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was there not another person in company with the prisoner? A. Yes, but he ran away; the prisoner waited for the money as I told them I had sent for change for a 10 l. note; the night before they had brought me a bridle; the other man has been taken to Marlborough-street, and let go on his own recognizance: the prisoner was committed.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

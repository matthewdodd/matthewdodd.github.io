It appear'd by the Evidence that the Prosecutor was come to Town upon Business, and being willing to satisfy his Curiosity in viewing the Publick Buildings &amp;c. went to the Royal Exchange , and having gratified his Eye with that fine Structure and the Effegies of the Kings and Queens there, as he was returning Home, met with the Prisoner in Cornhill, who looking upon him, said sure he should know him, and ask'd him what Country-man he was; he answered him Essex , near Colchester; the Prisoner reply'd he was his Country-man born at Colchester, and named several Persons whom he knew there; that he was very glad to see him, and would needs take a Glass of Wine with him; and being so near they went to the <placeName id="t17190225-27-crimeloc150">Swan-Tavern</placeName>

They were very ready to look for the Pocket Book, which was soon found, with the Bill in it, just by the Prosecutor's Feet; they were very glad the Gentleman had found it; and he seem'd to be mightily rejoyc'd at his good Luck; and said if they were not engag'd in private Business he should be glad to joyn Company with them, but however he would be his Pint. The Prisoner told him that they had no great Business; that he was his Country-man whom he had not seen a long while, and were come to drink a Glass of Wine together and talk of their old Acquaintance. After drinking a Glafs or two about a Pack of Cards was found, and the Gentleman shewed a great many Tricks with them, offering to lay Wagers , which the Prisoner prompted him on to do; but he still refusing,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171902250005"></xptr> the Gentleman gave him rougher Language, saying, he believ'd he had not 40 s. nor could not command it; that he being provok'd at his Expressions told him he could have 20 l. for searching of Mr. Walder in Bread-street , which they soon persuaded him to do; the Prisoner said the Reckoning, and away they went together to Bread-street , where Mr. Walder having paid him 20 l. viz 19 Guineas and 1 s. in Silver, they came all back again to the Tavern and went into the same Room; but he still refusing to play or lay Wagers, the Gentleman took an Opportunity to snatch his Bag with the Money in it, which he had in his Hand on the Table, and run away with it, the Prisoner run after him pretending to bring him back; the Prosecutor finding himself thus trickt cry'd out ABOIT, and follow'd as fast as he could, but was stupp'd at the Bottom of the Stairs by a Drawer for the Rockoning; the Drawer presently perceiving the Prosecutor was bit, pursu'd them, and took the Prisoner in Lloyd's Coffee-House , where he had run to conceal himself among the Number of Gentlemen that use that House. When he was taken he said he would send for the Money and return it and accordingly wrote a Letter to one

It plainly appear'd that he was a Confederate, and that there were three more in the Gang, one of whom went like a Country-man with a Whip, and another like a Quaker. It was also prov'd that a Bill of Indictment was found against him about the 7th or 8th of August , for defrauding one Mr. Barret of a Silver Watch and 20 s.

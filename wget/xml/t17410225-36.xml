Middleton broke a Board down, and unbolted two Bolts, and we went into the Shop. They carry'd me with them, because I cou'd get through a smaller Place than they: When we were got into the Shop, we filled a Bag with Iron, and sent

We took from thence ten Pewter Plates, and a great many other Things, and delivered them to Robinson, who carried Home as many of them as she could at a Time. When all these Things were carried away, and we were going Home, Middleton who had been the old M Lodger, ran up Stairs with a Knife in her Hand, and said, she would kill the old Man and his Wife, for she knew they had Money in a Corner Cupboard, and she certainly would have done it, if Robinson and I had not pulled her down Stairs.</p>

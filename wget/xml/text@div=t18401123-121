                  </hi>. I am a stay maker, living in High-street, Whitechapel. The prisoner was in ray service for two years and a half, and managed the busi<lb></lb>ness when Mrs. Moss was unable to attend—from what I heard in October last, I went to Mr. Aaron, a pawnbroker in Whitechapel, and found four<lb></lb>teen pairs of stays belonging to me—I said to the prisoner, "I have dis<lb></lb>covered fourteen pairs of stays pawned, you have done it?"—she said, "Me! how can you suppose I have done it, who have been so anxious to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184011230097"></xptr>
               <p>do your business, and run about every where?"—I gave her in charge—she made no discoveries to me respecting the other stays—I heard about some other stays from the policeman, and the prisoner's mother said, in her presence, "Mary, do tell Mr. Moss all you have done"—I had then given her in charge, and her mother begged me on her knees to let her off, as she had been ill all day, and she did not know what would be the consequence—the mother said it should be all right, she had written to the uncle, and she would get the whole of them out—depending on her telling me the truth, we walked to the station, and I with-drew the charge—we went to a public-house, and the mother told me of some, to the amount of four dozen, and occasionally the prisoner put in a word—I believed that was the whole that had been taken—they told me where they had been pledged—I afterwards received of them 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave them a receipt for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to avoid the stamp—I afterwards found that more property had been taken than they told me of—I found stays pledged at upwards of thirty-five pawnbrokers (the stays which they had told me of had been redeemed before I discovered these)—I found some at Mr. Telfer's, in Ratcliff-highway, at Mr. Avila's, Mr. Tilly's, Mr. John-son's, Mr. Sowerby's, and many other places—they were all mine—I should not have prosecuted but for the discovery.</p>

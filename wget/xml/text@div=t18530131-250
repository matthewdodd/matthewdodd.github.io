                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father, as lamp glass manufacturers, in Hounds ditch. The prisoner was in our service as porter and delivery man—it was his duty to take out goods, and deliver them according to our directions—on 13th Jan. he had two dozen of Bohemian salad oil decanters to deliver to Mr. Buckman, of the New Cut—he had no right to sell those decanters to anybody—if any of them were not retained by the customer, it was his duty to bring them back and account for them to our foreman.</p>

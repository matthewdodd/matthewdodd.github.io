            . I am twelve years old. One evening as I was coming from school into Ironmonger-row, I met Chaplin; he then told me he swept the shop every morning, and all the pieces of stuff in the dirt, was his own perquisites. I went with him to Butterfield's to sell some silver; he told me to stay at the door till he came down; I staid at the door near a quarter of an hour; he then came and asked me to go up; and when I came up just to the door, he said, say you found it; and when I got into she room, Butterfield said, is that your name, do you live there, and did you find it. (The witness was taken unwell, and was obliged to be led out of court.)</p>

            . On the 10th of November, I was sent for to Mr. Govett's house in Ironmonger-row; I went, and Mr. Govett told me the boy had robbed him of some silver and a dollar.</p>
               <p>Q. What boy. - A. Chaplin. I searched him; I found in his waistcoat pocket some silver clippings, and in his half boot I found a dollar; he said he took it from his master's board, he was going to sell it to Butterfield, a watch pendant maker; he lived next door but one to his master's, and he had sold some silver there before with Holloway's boy.</p>

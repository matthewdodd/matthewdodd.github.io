                  </hi>. I am a carrier in High-street, Sydenham—I hire a stable at Mr. Stemson's yard, next to the police-station at Sydenham—on Friday night, or Saturday morning, 20th December, I left my cart in the stable yard—it contained cases and boxes of various things that I had brought from London; amongst others, a small deal box addressed to Miss Duckles, Lansdown-villa, Maple-road, Penge—the stable gates were closed when I left them between 12 and 1—I went back to the yard between 7 and 8—I found something was shifted and missed this box—I know the prisoner—he works with a person named Pocock, who hires a stable in the same yard—I got leave of Pocock to draw the staple and search the stable, and there I found the box concealed behind some straw; it had not been opened—I did not meddle with it—I gave information to the police and they took the matter in hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Have you not the use of that stable as well as my master? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not cut chaff there that same day; if you allowed my man to do so that has nothing to do with me—the stable was locked when I went to it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 62). Spiars gave me information about this box and I went and concealed myself in Mr. Pocock's stable under two trusses of straw, with my hand on the comer of the box—the prisoner came in while I was there—after he had done his work he put the light out and came up and removed the straw until he came to the box—he shoved it and said to himself, "It's all right"—he then covered it up with two bundles of straw and moved away—I jumped out and said, "It is not all right; it don't suit your purpose to take the box to-night, I suppose"—the only reply he made wan "It is not worth taking"—I then took him into custody and said he would have to account for the box—he said he knew nothing about it—the box has since been opened; it contains three silver forks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> After I had done my horses, I went out of the stable with my basket under my arm; the constable came up to me rubbing his eyes as if he had been asleep, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, what are you going to do with the box 1" I said, "I have no box, what do you mean?" he said, "Oh, you know all about the box;" I said, "I know nothing about any box at all—I came back with him and he felt me and searched in the straw, and picked up this box. I know nothing about it; the stable was open for Spiars and his man to go and out chaff there, and the man was there cutting chaff when I went to work.</p>

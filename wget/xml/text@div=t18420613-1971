                  </hi>. I am a coachmaker, at Greenwich. The prisoner was in my employ for about a week—I had a pair of chaise springs in my shop—the prisoner said he knew a person at Woolwich, where he had been at work, that wanted a pair of springs, and he repeatedly asked me, in the course of the week, if I would dispose of them to his friend—I said they were disposed of to another person, which they were—but as the per<lb></lb>sons did not come for them, and thinking that the sale of these would enable me to make a new pair, on Whit Monday, the 16th of May, I trusted the prisoner with them to take to Woolwich and show his friend—he said he did not know the man's name—the prisoner had repeatedly asked, in the coarse of the week, to buy them himself, which I refused, and also refused his taking them to Woolwich, till the Monday morning—they were worth 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have a copy of the account which I gave him with the springs—I did not tell him what to do if the man did not pay for them—he took them from me, in the full confidence that the man would take them at that price—it was to be a ready money transaction, of course.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I worked for Mr. Gower nine days and three-quarters, but could get no wages, and understanding these springs were for sale, I asked him if he would sell me them; he said a person had been about them; I asked him for money; he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at a time, in the course of the week; on Saturday night he gave me half-a-crown, and said, if I would call in about an hour, he would give me some more; hearing that he had deceived so many of his men, I said, if he would give me another half-crown I would make shift till Monday; when I went on Monday he said, "I think you shall take these springs, and bring me back a few shillings, as I am very short this morning." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I deny the whole of it—I had paid him his wages, all but a trifle—he only worked for me four days and a quarter—he was to have 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week—he received 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the course of the week, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Saturday night—when he came to work on Monday morning I gave him the springs to take to his friend at Woolwich—he said he should be home between nine and ten o'clock, and I never saw him till he was apprehended—I gave information to the police, and they put it in the "Hue and Cry."</p>

               <p>I went to Reading after the prisoner, seeing his description in the"✗ and Cry"—I said, "I want you for a robbery at Mr. Gower's, at Green<lb></lb>wich, for a pair of coach-springs"—he said, "Oh, he can't hurt me for that, I bought the springs; in fact, he gave them to me to sell, and I sold them to a man on the road, in a horse and cart, but I don't know the man, nor where he lives."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence,</hi> Mr. Gower agreed to give me 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week, and I only received 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; a man who lived with him heard us talk about my buying the springs, and that man told me he could not get his money; he said, “Mind, he is very deep, if you can't get your money buy the springs of him." I was up all Friday night, not being able to get money for a lodging; when I went on Monday morning, he said, "Halloo, young fellow, I thought I had lost you;" I said, "I thought you had no money for me;" he said, "Oh, I can always squeeze out some for you;" and afterwards he said he had none, and gave me 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. The Magistrate said he believed my statement was true, as he had been there before, trying to cheat his men, who had summoned him for their wages, and put him in the court for it. He told me he had a boy coming to work for him; and when the boy came, he said, "Oh, I am not going to work for him; they tell me I shall never get any money." He had no money to give me on the Monday morning, and he said if I had a friend to buy the springs, I should have them. I met a man on the road, and he said, "Those springs would look well under my cart;" I said, "You can have them," and I sold them. I was going home to get work where I served my time. You could buy such springs for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. anywhere; 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is due to me.</p>

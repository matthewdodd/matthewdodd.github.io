                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Boyle, a jeweller, of 28, Cheapside—it is my duty to sleep on his premises, and take care of them—on 28th October I was in the parlour of a public-house in Farringdon-street, about 8 o'clock in the evening, with a female friend, who is servant at the next door to my master's—the three prisoners came in about a quarter past 10 o'clock—while they were there one of them handed me a glass of ale—I left the public-house about a quarter or twenty minutes before 11—the servant left with me—the three prisoners followed me as far as the Old Bailey—I did not say plainly "Good night," but they were for leaving, and one of them; said, "We must have something to drink," and I, having tasted their ale, went into a public-house, and got a pot of ale and gave them some—we then all proceeded together to Cheapside—I bid them good night, and pro<lb></lb>ceeded up Fountain-court—I saw my friend home to the next door, and I went into my master's premises—I took my hat and coat off, and went up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185909190026"></xptr>
               <p>stairs to the kitchen—I then went out to get some beer for the family—I was in my shirt-sleeves—I was sober—in order to get the beer, I had to come to the top of the Court—when I reached the top the three prisoners were standing there—I had a jug in my hand, and one of the prisoners said, "Are you going for your beer"—I went down Gutter-lane to get the beer, and they came down the lane along with me—I am quite certain the prisoners are the persons—I reached the public-house, and went in and got my pot of beer—I came out with it, and when I came out Homer came up to me and clasped her arms round me, and turned her face towards mine, and Judd said, "You shan't have it like that," or "You shan't do it like that," and he caught the jug of beer to pull it out of my hand, and, while I was thus engaged, Pullen came up and snatched the watch from my breast pocket—it was suspended to my person by a guard—it was taken—the bow of it was broken, and my waistcoat was torn by the pluck—(I had not a handkerchief at that time; I had when I was in the first public-house)—Pullen started away with my watch—it was some little time before I could get away from the other two—I ran after Pullen as soon as I could get from the others.</p>

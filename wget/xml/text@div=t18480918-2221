                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Brunswick-court, in the parish of Christ Church, Surrey. I am thirty-four years old—I lived with the prisoner ten or eleven weeks, as his wife, and he agreed that we should go to Australia—I allowed him to sell my furniture, and we went together to Woolwich, to embark—about half an hour before we were to go, he came and told me the ship had started at four o'clock in the morning—I had got my furniture by being in service—the prisoner is nothing at all—he is twenty-two years old—my furniture is all gone—the prisoner gave it away; he did not make much of it—he had promised me marriage, but he said he had not got money enough—we did not stop all night at Woolwich; we came back to my lodging in the evening—I had seven sovereigns, five shillings, and some halfpence, wrapped up in my pocket—they were safe on the night of 22nd Aug.—I went to bed with the prisoner as usual—he got up about ten minutes after five o'clock next morning, and went out between five and six—I got up at seven, and after a while I found my pocket between the box and the wall, but my money was gone out of it—I had seen the money safe when I went to bed in the evening—there was no one in the room but me and my girl, who is ten years old—I am a widow—I went to look after the prisoner—I could not find him—after two days I found him at the Surrey Theatre—I went up to him, and asked him if he was not a pretty fellow—he said, "No, not at all "—I said, "How came you to take my money?"—he said he had not taken it.</p>

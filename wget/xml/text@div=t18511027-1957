                  </hi>. I am a filesmith, and live at Sheffield. I was present in 1831 at Rotherham Church, Yorkshire, when the prisoner was married to Sarah Haynes—I saw her last night—I think the marriage was in the month of April.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Pearson-street, Kingsland-road. Last August five years I was married to the prisoner at Charlton Church, Kent—I got this certificate at the time (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have lived with him ever since-some female came, and said she was his wife, but she did not wish to lire with him, if he would allow her a maintenance—the prisoner had a sovereign from me, and gave it to her, and an agreement was drawn up between them next morning, but I forget what it was.</p>

Q.</hi> When was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it was on the 12th March—it was in 1846 that I married him; he was with his regiment then I know he asked leave of his commanding-officer to be married—I do not know that he stated he had heard his first wife was dead—I was not with him—I know he made a declaration before a Magistrate, stating his belief as to the death of his wife—he was in a regiment which was at Charlton when we were married—I had a brother in the same regiment, and that is how I became acquainted with him—I afterwards went with him and his regiment to Leeds—he has now been discharged, on account of long service, and has got a pension <hi rend="italic">of Is.</hi> a day.</p>

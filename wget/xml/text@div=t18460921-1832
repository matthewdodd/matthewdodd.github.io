I met the prisoner at the corner of Well—street on Wednesday, the 12th of Aug.—he took a lodging of me—I am laundress at the Sailors Home—I showed the prisoner the bed-room—he said he was hungry, and he ate a hearty supper—he left me the next day, without paying for the room—I afterwards missed a bundle of linen—I saw him on the Friday in Neptune-street—he was then better dressed than he had been before—I said, "You have got your clothes"—he said, "No; I met a friend of the name of Taylor—he was afterwards taken, and I found this one shirt, which has a private mark—it is one I lost with the rest of the bundle of linen.</p>

I met the prisoner at the bottom of Ship-alley, Wellclose-square, at two o'clock in the morning, on the 19th of Aug.—I asked him if he belonged to the Sailors' Home—he said,"No"—he said he wanted a lodging—I pointed to a public—house, and said, you can get a lodging there for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; you will not get one under"—he said, "I have not got any money; I lost my friend at the west end of the town" I said. "You will have to <hi rend="italic">pad</hi> it"—he asked if I knew if there was a person of the nane of Munns lived about there—I said, "Yes, in Harrod<lb></lb>alley; but I don't know whether she takes lodgers"—another officer came up at that time—the prisoner had a small bundle tied in a white handkerchief—I asked what was in it—he said he was no thief, and I had no authority to see it—I took him to Munns, and found in it this shirt, which Mrs. Munns identified private nark in the skirt of it—the prisoner said he was at the west end of the town, that a gentleman went into a shop in Pall—mall, and bought a new shirt, and gave him this shirt—this shirt had not been ironed or got up—it appeared as if it had been sprinkled and folded up.</p>

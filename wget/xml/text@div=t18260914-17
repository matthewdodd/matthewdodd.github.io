            . I am keeper of the gaol at Norwich, for the county of Norfolk, and was so in 1813. I remember the prisoner there - he came into my custody on the 26th of March, 1813. I have referred to the journal of the gaol for the date - it is kept by myself - I have not got it here - I referred to it on the 14th of July, on receiving a letter from Mr. Stafford - I have no recollection of the date except from reference to that book.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner going into Court to be tried? A. Yes; I took him into Court at the Lammas Assize, 1813 - he had been in my custody about four months, and rather better than a month afterwards. I took him to Portsmouth, in consequence of the sentence of the Court - he was in my custody full five months - I saw him daily, except duty called me away - it was my duty to notice his person; I saw him tried - he is the same person who was tried - I afterwards accompanied him to Portsmouth - we were two nights and a day on the journey. I am certain, beyond doubt, of his being the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. Have you many prisoners in your gaol? A. From two to three hundred in the course of a year; there might be fifty while he was there; I was in Court when he received sentence; I only had one servant at that time, in that department - he is at Norwich now - I do not recollect the name of the priso<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140013"></xptr>ner's prosecutor, nor any of the witnesses - he was committed by the Rev. Mr. Salmon, who is not living; I took five or six more to Portsmouth with him - our prisoners at that time wore a gaol dress as soon as they came in. I know him by his features - I have little doubt but I should recollect the features of the whole fifty I had in custody - I speak positively to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is it your particular duty to know the features of every prisoner? A. Yes; I take their measure and description - he wore his own clothes at his trial; I sat in Court all the while, and when he went to Portsmouth he wore his own clothes - I am certain he is the man.</p>

            . I first saw the prisoner at New South Wales - at Sidney; I was steward of the ship "Army;" he was employed on board the ship, when we got there, as a carpenter - as an emancipated convict; after we sailed from the colony he was discovered concealed in the ship - I knew he was on board when we sailed; he was concealed in the after-hold; he was on board from November till we got to Monte Video - nearly two months - he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were you displaced for misconduct? A. I was displaced, but was not told what for - I do not know now fully; Mr. Leach was the Captain; the prisoner took my place. There was a placard stuck on our mizen before we sailed, about John Shales; the prisoner was not examined in consequence of that placard - he could not be found.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What was the placard about? A. A convict having absconded, and offering a reward; the Captain's apprentice acted as steward after we got to Monte Video - it is a merchant's ship.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have only to say my name is not Shales, but King.*  I have spent most of my time abroad, and was never in Norfolk. I acknowledge concealing myself in the Army.</p>
               <p>* The prisoner had pleaded a misnomer, upon which issue was joined, and a verdict found for the Crown.</p>

            . I was Captain of the Army, on which Crowly was on board; I certainly would not believe him on his oath - I dismissed him shortly after I left England, for making away with my property - he was succeeded by a person; and about six months afterwards he fell on his knees, and begged I would restore him to his situation, on account of his wife and children - he knew the cause of his dismissal; he was despised by every body in the ship. There was a placard on our mizen - it is worn out; the prisoner conducted himself very well indeed on board our vessel; I trusted him with all my stores, and so did all the passengers.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you traded long to New South Wales? A. I have been three voyages; I did not know the prisoner was on board till we left; I did not have him from the convict establishment; I did not know what he was: he was found three days after we got to sea, and I have no doubt Crowly secreted him there, for he was not mustered with the crew; he was to have no wages. I found four persons on board before I started, and delivered them up. I was three hundred miles at sea when I found the prisoner; he went ashore at Monte Video, and never returned; I reported him there to Mr. Hood, as being on board unexpectedly; he was called by the name of James.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever write from the ship about him? A. Yes, to the consul, Mr. Hood; I suspected he was Shales by the placard; I knew such a man had escaped: I did not believe him to be the man; some people on board called him James Miller.</p>
               <p>JURY to JOHN JOHNSON. Q. Do you take a description of the prisoners when they come in? A. Yes; I have not got it here; he was about twenty years old when convicted.</p>

I am a mariner, and live at 6, Victoria-road South, Survey—on 6th September I was in Whitechapel-road, sitting on some steps, about 2 o'clock in the morning, as I felt rather sick—I had just come ashore, and had had a glass of ale, but knew what I was about perfectly—three men came up to me, and the prisoner said, "Get on your b——pins"—they kicked me first, and the whole three pulled me up—the prisoner then struck me, and knocked me down—I got up again to stand in self-defence, and he knocked me down again, and kicked me about the body and head several times—I was very much hurt—I bled a good deal—I lost from my pocket 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., my discharge, my character, and a black-handled knife—I have not got them back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale stay-manufacturer, of 10, Tre-degar-place, Bow—on 10th December, about 2 o'clock, I was in the White-chapel-road, and saw the prisoner pulled off the top of the prosecutor by two men—the prisoner then went up to the prosecutor, and kicked him, but I did not see where—the prosecutor then got up, and they both closed; the prosecutor was underneath—the prisoner was then pulled off again, and went and kicked him about the head four or five times—a policeman came up almost directly, and took the prisoner—I went up, and saw the prosecutor lying on the ground with his head in a pool of blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a walking stick maker, of 31, Duke-street, Union-street, Bishopsgate—on Saturday morning, 10th December, I saw the prosecutor sitting on a step in Whitechapel-road—two or three men went up to him, one of whom was the prisoner, who kicked him about the head, and pulled him up; he then placed his hand in his side pocket, but I did not see him bring anything out—the prisoner struck him again, and he fell,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186412120044"></xptr>
               <p>but he got up with him and struck the prisoner, who fell with him, and kicked him about the body—he was kicked hard and often—I went for a constable, and when I came back he was bleeding on the ground from his head.</p>

On 10th December, soon after 2 o'clock, I saw a crowd assembled; Kempsey came to me, and on going up saw the prosecutor lying bleeding on the pavement—I took the prisoner to the station and the prosecutor to the hospital—just after the prosecutor left the hospital he missed his money—I had kept him safe from the steps to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Well-street, in the parish of St. John, Hackney. On 30th Oct. I had an outside flap-door, leading to my cellar from the street, open till half-past nine or ten o'clock at night—it had been open the whole day and evening—I went to bed about half-past ten; my shop and premises were all safe—there is a trap-door lead<lb></lb>ing from my cellar to the shop; that was shut down, but there is no fastening to it—my canisters and different things were safe in their places in the shop when I went to bed—I came down about a quarter-past six in the morning, and found a canister near the flap in the shop, and eight other canisters in the room adjoining the shop which had all been emptied—I also missed about three pounds of tobacco from the jars in the shop—about half a dozen pounds of sugar, three pairs of scales, and a table-cloth—there is a back-door leading to an outhouse, and another door from the outhouse to the yard; those doors were both bolted when I went to bed, and I found them both unbolted in the morning—that would enable a person to get away from my premises—a person could not get into my premises by the trap-door leading from the street to the cellar, after it was shut, because it was bolted inside—a person could have got in while it was open and secreted himself in the cellar, which is very large, there might have been half a dozen persons concealed in it—a person secreted in the cellar could get into the shop through the trap-door—it was merely shut down—the prisoner was in my service about a year and a half ago, and was acquainted with my premises.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 232). On the morning of 31st Oct. I saw the prisoner at seven o'clock, in Bethnal-green-road, more than a mile from Mr. London's, with this bundle under his arm—I asked what he had got; he said dirty linen he had brought from his mother's in Well-street, Hackney, and he was taking it to the washerwoman's—I felt it and said, "You have got something more than dirty linen"—he said, "Will you go with me to the washerwoman, she lives down one of these turnings," pointing to the left of where we stood—I went with him into Wilmot-street, and he then said, "I don't think this is the street"—I then told him I wanted to see what he had got in the bundle—I partly untied it, and found it was tea—I then took him to the station—he said, "I will tell you the truth, as I was coming across the park (Victoria-park) I met a person who asked me to carry it, and said he would give me half"—I then opened the bundle and found in it these three pain of scales, 7 1/4 lbs. of tea, the sugars, tablecloth, and tobacco.</p>

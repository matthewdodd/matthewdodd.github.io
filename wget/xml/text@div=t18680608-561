               <p>afterwards communicated to my daughter what she told me—I told his mother that he was indebted to me and that the bill was not paid—she told me he was dead, that he died in Dublin—I told her I had received a letter—she did not say whether she had written it or not; she did not say anything against it, she did not deny it—I have not got the envelope—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi> "Miss Rickaby, Madam—This is a painful duty for me to perform but one that must be done; I much regret that you, upon such a short knowledge of the party, should ever have married. You are not his wife by law, for Reeve was not his name, he only took it on the stage, and was under age when he took you. You need not fret, the poor fellow died on 24th of last month, of small pox; he asked me never to let you know his name was not Reeve, but now he is gone it can make no difference to him; then if your child lives, never call him Reeve, Bryant Ruther was his right name. I can say no more, I thought it right to let you know all. I send this to you through your father, not knowing where to find you, only your father through Moon's office.") The letter came through the office of Mr. Moon, hop merchant, who I was doing business for at that time, I called on the mother after I had received this to see what she intended to pay me towards the bill and towards my expenses for keeping my daughter—the bill fell due in 1864—I did not make inquiries immediately, I kept it over—I thought he might return, or they might become friends again—I received this letter in 1865 and went and saw her shortly after within eight or ten days—my daughter was living at my house then—I communicated to her everything that I knew—the letter was sent to me, but was written for her—I might have destroyed the envelope at the time, for I sent it under cover in my own letter, just enclosed—my daughter went into mourning in consequence of the statement I made to her; I put on slight mourning myself, a hat band and so on; I believed the statement made by the mother and I should say my daughter did—I never saw or heard of him since in any way until this trial.</p>

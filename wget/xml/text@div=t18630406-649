I am a haberdasher in the Cornwall-road, Brixton—the prisoner came to my shop on the night of 5th February, and bought a yard of printed cotton, price 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a florin, which I put in the till—there was no other florin there—I afterwards took it out, and found it was bad—no one else had been to the till but myself in the mean time—I put the florin on one side, and afterwards gave it to the policeman—on 17th February, the prisoner again came in towards the evening, and asked for a bonnet front, which was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I served her, and she gave me another florin—I scarcely had time to look at it—I told her of the former one, and she said, "If you will kindly give me the florin back I will give you a shilling which I have"—I incautiously gave it her back—I then fetched out the twoshilling piece I had received on 5th February, and showed it to her, and she said, "Oh, yes; this is a very bad one"—she gave her address as "Pike's or Parke's Road, Willis-terrace"—a tradesman close by came in at the time—I asked her to go with him to her address, but she refused—I then asked her if she had any objection to the policeman going with her, and I should be satisfied if she could explain it—she refused to go with the policeman—I then said, "Will you stay here until he goes to your residence?"—she said she had no objection to do that—the policeman went, and while he was gone she said she felt very ill, and asked me to give her a glass of water—I did not see her put anything in her mouth—I gave her the glass of water, and I observed her swallow something—there was a gulp in the throat, or some<lb></lb>thing of that sort—I kept the first florin that she gave me—I asked her to give me back the one I had just given her—she searched in her pocket for it—she had it when the policeman came first, but it afterwards disappeared altogether—I gave her into custody.</p>

I live at the Prince Alfred beer-house, Cornwall-road, Brixton—on Wednesday, 14th February, the prisoner came to my house and asked for a glass of ale, and put down a two-shilling piece—I saw it was bad, and told her so—she said, "Is it?" and I said, "Yes, it is a very bad one"—she took it and bit it, and said, "Oh, dear me, it is a bad one"—I said, "Do you know where you took it?"—she said, "Yes, she had changed a five-shilling piece"—I gave it her back—I thought she was a person in the neighbourhood, as she had been to my house before—she then paid me with a good half-crown, and went away with the bad florin—she had given me two-shilling pieces before.</p>

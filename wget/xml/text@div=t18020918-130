               <p>Q. What reason have you to suppose it was the prisoner? - A. There was no other person in the room, he had slept there one night before; he must have let himself down by the blankets and sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. Where could the property be thrown to? - A.Into a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How could he get out of the yard? - A.Through the passage that leads into Spring-Gardens.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am in his Majesty's service; I went to that man's house, and was rather groggy; he forced me up stairs, and threw me on a bed, and locked the door on me; I remained there, till about four o'clock, when I got up, and wanted to get out, but could not; I knocked and called, but no answer; I did not know where I was, and as I could not get out, I took the sheet and blankets, knotted them together and got down, but did not take any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dixon. There were two sheets and two blankets he had left hanging at the window; he was a little in liquor. <rs id="t18020918-130-verdict695" type="verdictDescription">

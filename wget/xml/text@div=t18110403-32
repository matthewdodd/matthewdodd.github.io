            . I am warehouseman to Messrs. Hancock. On the 22d of February, at half past six in the evening, I saw the prisoner behind the mill, he turned to go into the stable that is under the mill, I followed him, he turned round to me, he had this bag in his hand, he said he had some sugar to put into some beer, he put it down on the ground, I took it up it was ground lump sugar, about four pound, it was worth about 9 d. a pound. He said he would give me a guinea if I would say nothing about it, and went down upon his knees, I put the sugar down again, he took it up and shook the sugar in the dung in the stable, and then kicked the dung with his feet to trample it down. I sent for Mr. Hancock, and then a constable was fetched. This is the bag, the sugar was not recovered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. That bag does not belong to you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And the sugar you could not swear to. - A. I looked at that in the bag, and that in the mill, it was all alike. I have no doubt of it being my masters sugar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The man used to take sugar out and put it in beer, and grate nutmeg upon it, I was never told that I was not allowed to have sugar. I took this sugar to put into small beer.</p>

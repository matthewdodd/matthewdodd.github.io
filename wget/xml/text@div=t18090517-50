            . My husband's name is William Craxford; the prisoner came to my house on the 14th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she an acquaintance of yours - A. I know nothing of her; she came in unperceived by me or any of my children; a neighbour knocked at my door, and from the information I received, I found her on the landing place; she had just come out of the front kitchen with some coats; I saw her laying them out of her hands as I came on the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. What coats were in her hand - A. Two of my husband's coats, and a pair of my husband's boots; she saw me come, and then she laid them out of her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had the coats been - A. They lay on our bed; I left them there not ten minutes; I asked her what she wanted down there, she said let me go backwards; I looked and saw that my husband's coats and boots were laying down by her; I asked her if she was going to take them away, she told me that she had not got any thing; she wished to get away very much. I sent for an officer, he apprehended her.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found out since who she is - A. I have heard a bad character of her.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Adam's Mews, Marylebone. I keep horses and stables—the prisoner was my carter, and had the care of my hay—there were nine horses in the stable, and a certain quantity of hay was delivered every Tuesday and Friday to each of the men to feed the horses—the horses stood at Kingsland, where I have the contract from the metropolitan road trust—this hay was taken there from my farm—the pri<lb></lb>soner, with two others, had the care of the stable—a truss of hay was pro<lb></lb>duced in me, which I have no doubt was mine—the prisoner had been in my employ for five or six months as a labourer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Mr. Nicholls. In consequence of information which I received, I went to the watch-house at Kingsland, and saw the hay, which I knew to be Mr. Nicholls's—I charged the pri<lb></lb>soner with stealing it—he said he had borrowed it of the ostler, and that Jemmy knew of it—the prisoner always had plenty of hay without borrow<lb></lb>ing, and that week in particular he had an extra truss on account of a horse going away.</p>

               <p>What made you first suspect her? - I missed it, and I saw her run, and I asked her, and she coloured, and I thought she had the pot, and her hand was through her pocket-hole; I did not see her take it, but I suspected her, and found it upon her; she was not taken up for this, she has been caught by another publican.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the same woman? - Yes.</p>

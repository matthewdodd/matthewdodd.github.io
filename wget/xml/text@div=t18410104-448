On Friday evening, the 18th of December, the prisoner came to my shop to pay me for a hat he owed me for—he offered me a cheque for ten guineas—it was very similar to the one now produced, but I am not positive of it—I had not sufficient change—he said he would call the fol<lb></lb>lowing evening, and left—I did not send him to the banker's the next day, nor did I detain any body at my shop from Captain Charritie.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 19th of Decem<lb></lb>ber, a person brought this cheque for payment—I did not notice him particu<lb></lb>larly, and cannot swear to him, but he was detained—he put the cheque into my hands—I asked where he got it—he said he came down in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> from Bond-street to ascertain if it was a good cheque, as a man was in custody at the hatter's, where he wanted to have it changed, and that the</p>

                  </hi>. I was sent for to Martin, Stone, and Co.'s banking-house, and found the prisoner in the private room—this cheque was before some gentlemen—I asked the prisoner his name—he said, "William Johnson," that he lived with Mr. Sewell, a hatter's, No. 9, New Bond-street; that the servant of Captain Charritie had tendered this cheque to Mr. Sewell in pay<lb></lb>ment for a hat, and Mr. Sewell had detained the servant, and sent him with the cheque—I asked how he knew it was Captain Charritie's servant—he said, "I have been with him," or "to him with a hat," I do not know which—I then took him in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to Mr. Sewell's, No. 9, New Bond-street, and ascertained that no person was detained there—I took him into the house, searched him, and took him in the same <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the Compter—I observed him fumbling in his pocket, which induced me to search the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and I found this paper at the bottom of the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> on the side he bad sat—it is a similar form to the cheque.</p>

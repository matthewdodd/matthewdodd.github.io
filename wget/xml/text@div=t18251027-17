On the 29th of September I went to dinner at half-past twelve o'clock, and left my tools on the bench; my employer sent for me to return - I went back and found the prisoner in custody - my articles were taken from him.</p>

               <p>THOMAS TERRY. I am a carpenter. Fall was in my employ on the 29th of September - when he was gone to dinner I heard the yard gate open - my wife looked through the window and said to me, "There is a person gone down the yard;" he went into the workshop and came out in about ten minutes, shut the shop door, and came down the yard as far as the archway by my house: I met him and said "My friend, what is your pleasure?" he said "I came for my tools:" I then took hold of him and found the saw tucked in the waistband of his breeches - the plow was behind him, and the stock in his pocket; he was very obstinate - I was about twenty minutes getting them - he was sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was stupidly drunk the night before, and was not much better that morning. I went to the yard to get some work - if I had been sober I should not have done it.</p>

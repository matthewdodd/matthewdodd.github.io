The prisoner came into our shop on the 5th instant about five o'clock, and asked to see some black ribbon. I shewed her a drawer full. She took one piece, and concealed it under her apron in her left hand. She saw my colour change I suppose; then she offered me an orange, and shook me by the hand. Then she took up two pieces more, one of which she concealed in the palm of her hand, and dropt it out of her right hand into her left. Then she said she did not like the ribbons, and went to go out of the shop. I threw myself upon the counter, and took hold of her, and pull'd her in, and said, what are you going to do with these pieces of ribbon. She said she thought no harm; we were made to forgive and be forgiven. Presently her mistress came in, and said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176201140010"></xptr> we were only humming her. Then my master came home, and he gave charge of her.</p>

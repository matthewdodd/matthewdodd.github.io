I lost a pair of shoes, on the 25th of October, from my house - I saw them in the prisoner's hands close to my shop-window; I heard a rattle, and my boy went out to see what the noise was - another man took the shoes, a man came up and charged him to lay them down; he struck my boy, took up the shoes and gave them into the hands of the prisoner, who got rid of them somehow - I never got them.</p>

            , JUN. The prisoner had the shoes in his hand when I came out - he had another man with him, who gave him the shoes; I had seen them together about ten minutes before - the other man struck me on the side of the head; I did not see the shoes taken from the shop, but I saw them in the other man's hands, and they were hitting one another with them; my father went out and asked the prisoner to put them down - he stripped to fight him; I had heard the shoes knocking about as I was in the parlour - it was between four and five o'clock.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I took the prisoner about eleven o'clock at night on the 26th - the prosecutor gave charge of him; he said that from the 25th he was in trouble for a row, and he was liberated on the Sunday morning - I said it was unusual to be liberated on a Sunday.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he was by the prosecutor's shop when there was a scuffle, but denied having had the shoes in his possession.</p>

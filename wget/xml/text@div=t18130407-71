               <p>Mr. Knapp. What was done with the forged check which you looked at just now - A. I understood that Cook was to deliever it to Kennet, in order to send it for payment.</p>
               <p>Q. What next then was done about this check - A. I took a furnished apartment in Francis-street, Bedford-square, for Kennet, as I understood that apartment was afterwards occupied by Kennet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. How do you know it was occupied by Kennet - A. Cook informed me it was, and a clerk was hired.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Were you present when the clerk was hired - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you ever converse with Kennet upon the subject of the clerk being hired - A. I did. It was intimated by Cook to Kennet that he should hire a clerk for the purpose of negotiating the draft, and a clerk was hired and sent to Messrs. Glyn and Company with the draft.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you see him sent - A. I saw the clerk afterwards when he had got the money. The first time that I saw the clerk I saw him in Newport-street: that clerk's name was Pollard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Had there any conversation taken place between you relative to the dress that Kennet was to be in - A. There had. We met at the house of Birdett, and also at the Bedford coffee-house, in Southampton-row. It was there agreed for Kennet to disguise himself in a suit of clothes, a coat of a drab mixed colour, a light waistcoat, and drab-coloured kerseymere pantaloons. It was agreed that he should have a wig and common green-glass spectacles. The clothes were procured by a person of the name of Hudson, a tobacconist, in Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. These clothes were to be obtained for this particular occasion, were they not - A. No, for another occasion of a similar nature. They were obtained for a forgery that was never committed.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not the clothes that Kennet used to wear - A. No, they were not. We entered into an agreement that Kennet should hire a clerk, and send him for the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see that person act as clerk - A. I did, that person turned out to be Pollard.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you talk about the draft - A. In our conversation we talked about the forgery: we talked of it being committed by Cook. The clerk did so present the draft, and it was paid.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When did you see that clerk - A. I saw him afterwards somewhere in Tottenham-court-road, and followed him to Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Tottenham-court-road is near Francis-street A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was that - A. On the 28th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see Pollard - A. I saw him on the evening of the 27th at the same lodging in Francis-street. He had been, as I suppose, with Kennet. I saw him in Francis-street, coming from a house. The next time I saw him was on the following day, previous to his presenting the draft. I saw him in Newport-street, previous to his presenting the check.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, before you saw him the next day in Newport-street had you seen Kennet - A. I did, on the morning of that day.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Kennet say - A. It was merely stated that Kennet was to send this clerk with this forged draft. Nothing else passed at that time, as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Where on that day did you see the clerk - A. I saw him in Newport-street first about the middle of the day. I saw him go into a boot and shoemakers shop. He was coming in a direction from Francis-street. He went into the boot and shoe makers; there I left him for a time. I was watching him.</p>

               <p>Q. Had it been agreed upon between you that you should watch him - A. It had.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose were you watching - A. To prevent the possibillity of detection at the banking-house. I was to follow him into the banking-house, to see if the draft was paid, but I left him in Newport-street. I afterwards saw him in Holborn, in the neighbourhood of Tottenham-court-road. I met him there by design.</p>
               <p>COURT. How came you to go from Newport-street and take your station in Tottenham-court-road - A. It was presumed by us that the money was paid, though we first thought it was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Then you had seen him go into the shoe makers - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go into the bankers as you had proposed - A. Because I did not think he was going to the bankers. I was to go to the bankers to see whether it was paid or not, and if it was paid I was to inform Cook of the circumstance, and if it was not paid I was to inform Cook that they might get out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. You supposed he was not going to the bankers - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you go to Holborn - A. To see whether he came where he was ordered to come. I went to Cook, and informed him that I thought the money would not be paid; in consequence of which we went away. It was afterwards thought by the whole of us, comprising Kennet and Birdett, Cook<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070042"></xptr>and me, that the money was paid. In consequence of that a note was sent to Francis-street, desiring the clerk to bring the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Who wrote that note - A. I am not able to speak to that positively. One of us four wrote that note.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you will know when you see it. Look at that note; is that it - A. This is it. I cannot swear positively to the writing. If it is Kennet's it is disguised: it is not his usual writing. I believe it to be Kennet's. I cannot speak positively that it is his writing. The note read by</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Directed to Mr. Pollard, No. 13, Francis-street, Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>"Sir, I request you will come to me at the White Hart, the corner of Warwick-court, Holborn. This is marked C.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp Q. to Richardson. That note was for the purpose of the clerk coming to the White Hart, the corner of Warwick-court to bring the money - A. Yes. I saw the clerk then near Tottenham-court-road, as if coming to Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to Tottenham-court-road - A. For the purpose to see if the clerk came alone with the money. It was settled by the whole of us that I should go and watch in Tottenham-court-road. I did, and when near Tottenham-court-road I watched him into Holborn, and in Holborn he accost-me, asking me which was the White Hart coffee-house. I went on the way to the White Hart. He asked me the way to the White Hart. I accompanied him to the White Hart, and went in the coffee-room with him, and staid a few minutes, and drank a gill of wine. I heard him enquire for Mr. Blunt in the coffee-room. I then returned to Chancery-lane, leaving him in the coffee-room. I returned to Chancery-lane, at the Six Clerks office; there I saw Cook in a coach. I informed him, that in my opinion the clerk was there with the money. I only saw Cook: Kennet might be in the coach; I did not see him. I informed Cook that I believed he had got the money. I then left Cook, having agreed to meet again at the house of Birdett some time afterwards on the same day, in order to share the money if it was obtained. I went then to Ship-yard, to Birdett's: the whole of us were present; Kennet, Cook, Birdett, and myself. I believe I got there first. I think Cook and Kennet came together, and Birdett.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Kennet, at that time he came to Ship-yard, dressed - A. I think, previous to his coming there he had changed his dress. I am not able to speak positively whether he came in his dress or not. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him in this transaction with that dress on - A. I think I had. I know I had, some time before this transaction, seen him with this dress on. At Birdett's we divided the money. Three of us received six hundred pounds each; me, Cook, and Kennet received six hundred pounds each, and Birdett two hundred and ninety pounds. The eleven shillings was not brought in question, and I think some time after we divided the money we separated.</p>
               <p>Q.How was this money produced - A. It was produced in fifty pound notes: they were in a pocketbook. I cannot recollect who produced the book. I think it was mentioned that the pocket-book belonged to the clerk. It was there agreed it should be sent back to the clerk with a little money in it for his trouble; what that sum was I cannot immediately recollect; it might be one or two pounds. I think Cook was to do that; I am not positive. We shortly after separated.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did you go by - A. At that time in the name of Rivers in the purchase of stock.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did the prisoner go by - A. I never knew him by any other name than Kennet. In this transaction he went by the name of Blunt, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him use any other name - A. I have heard him called by the name of King, but not in any transaction.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You seem very much at your ease in all this story. When were you taken up - A. For what, sir?</p>
               <p>Q. You may well ask that question: When were you taken up last - A. Some time in January.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon very many charges of forgery - A. Upon a charge of forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, and I take it for granted, you thought you should not have the good luck to be transported this time. In short, you began to expect you should be hanged - A. What my expectations were I cannot state.</p>
               <p>Q. You began to think your time was come - A. I cannot say that. I certainly felt aukward sensations, as any man in my situation must have done.</p>
               <p>Q. I think so: whereupon you said you could tell a story - A. I did not say that.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the bargain that you made at last - A. I do not know any thing of a bargain. It was agreed that I should be an evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. You have, in point of fact, made many confessions of many forgeries that you have been concerned in - A. I have, in point of fact, admitted that I have been one in this forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. You would much rather anybody else should be hanged than yourself - A. Any man in my situation would have done that.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN POLLARD. Q. I believe now you live clerk with Messrs. Lee and Company, wine merchants - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the beginning of the year 1811, were you in want of a situation - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You put an advertisement in a paper - A. I did, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper, and see whether that is your advertisement - A. That is the very identical one. (Read.)</p>

            , a boot and shoe maker. I occupied an apartment in that house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the advertisement inserted - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter, and see whether that is the letter that you received - A. Yes; this is the very identical letter. This is a letter addressed to B. P. No. 17, Great Newport-street.</p>
               <p>"If B. P.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070043"></xptr>will call upon Mr. Blunt to-morrow, in Francis-street, Oxford-street, he may meet with a situation that will suit him."</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of receiving that letter did you go to Francis-street - A. I did, on the following day, at the time appointed on the 27th. I there saw a person calling himself Blunt. He was dressed in a light drab coat, and also pantaloons of the same colour: they were kerseymere pantaloons. I think they were rather lighter than the coat. I cannot say any thing of the waistcoat, the coat was buttoned over it. He had on green spectacles; they were somewhat like goglers; they were tied with green silk to keep the dust out of the eyes; it was tied on with green silk, so as to go over the nose and eyes. He wore a carrotty wig. There was a great deal of hair upon the head; it strikes me forcibly that it was a wig</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what passed between you and the person calling himself Blunt - A. He said he wanted a clerk. He asked several questions of me; with whom I lived. I told him that I lived with Messrs. Lee and Company, whom I am still living with now, at Bath, and that I was superseded by a nephew of Mr. Lee's, in consequence of which I came to London to get a situation. He stated to me that he was recently from the West Indies, where he had been living twenty-one years or thereabouts, and he was just returned; that he had a series of accompts to settle that he wanted me to do with him at his leisure, when he could have me with him. He enquired after my reference in town. He asked me what salary I should expect to have. I would not fix upon any salary until I knew his employment, by way of saying something. He asked me if an hundred guineas would do for me, and to dine with him occasionally, to which I said, I thought it would. He made an appointment for me to call on the morrow, about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay with him - A. Half an hour, or a little more. When I came in he asked me to sit in a chair. I stood instead of sitting. On the next day, the servant let me in. He said, his agent had been enquiring at my town reference, and my character proved to be satisfactory; then he told me he had got his boxes coming from Portsmouth or Liverpool. He seemed to be at a loss when I should commence employment with him. He said something about calling on the morrow, before he fixed any thing else. He asked me if I was engaged for the afternoon. I answered him in the negative. He said he had a little business that he wanted transacted in town, he should be obliged to me to do it for him, to which I readily consented.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that business - A. He had then laying before him, on a table, a paper, pens, and ink, and on the paper there was something written on one part of it. He finished writing that. He broke a piece off, and wrote the whole of another. He asked me then if I knew where Birchin-lane was. I answered in the negative. He asked me then, if I knew the Royal Exchange, or Cornhill; to which I said I did know perfectly well. He then 
               <persName id="t18130407-71-person632">drew</persName>
             a piece of paper out of his pocket-book. This was on the morning of the 28th, as far as my recollection will allow.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the paper that he drew from his pocket-book - A. He said it was a check upon the house of Messrs. Carr Glyn that he wanted to get cash for.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper - A. It corresponded with this, and the same date, and worded verbatim the same, and the same amount. I believe this check to be really the same. He told me that I should take it there to Birchin-lane; they would pay me; that the bankers clerks were in the office, acting; and that they would pay me in large papers.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is bills of large amount - A. Bills of large amount. He said, large papers, for which I was to go to the Bank of England, and get them exchanged into smaller ones. I asked him what smaller ones. That he left at my option. He then took up a paper that he had furnished writing, which was that I was to go to Moorgate coffee-house, the corner of Fore-street, Cripplegate, near Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, is that paper that you hold in your hand the paper that was part written that he finished when you went in - A. It is. He wrote another, which is 
               <persName id="t18130407-71-person633">
                  William

            , esq. No. 13, Francis-street, Tottenham-court-road. The other paper he wrote entirely in my presence. After he gave me that I was to come to that house; I was to go directly into the coffee-room, and there I should find him, because he should dine there with a friend if it was a fine day. Then he put this in my hand. This he writ in my presence,

            , esq. No. 13, Francis-street, Tottenham-court-road. This, I presume, he wrote merely that I should not forget the direction where he was. They were all the directions he gave to me at that time. I was with him about an hour, or three quarters of an hour; then I quitted there. He told me the direct way for me was through Holborn. On my going out of the room I could not open the door; he rung the bell for the servant. The servant came, and the door was opened, and the servant of the house asked me if I had agreed to come into his employment. I communicated to the servant of the house that I was going to Birchin-lane. When I came out it began to rain a little; I went to my lodgings at Mr. Abbotts. I staid there about an hour. I communicated to Mr. Abbott where I was going, and shewed also the check. I put on a great coat, and also took an umbrella with me, as it was rainy, and I went to No. 20, Brewer-street, Golden-square, to acquaint another friend with my proceeding, to tell him that I had employment. I also expressed my sentiment somewhat to Mr. Abbott; I thought it a great trust to be put into my hands before my new employer had my original character. I went from Brewer-street to the bankers, and presented the check to the clerk, and he paid me. I went to the bankers, Messrs. Carr Glynn and Company, presented the check; it was paid me in two notes of one thousand each, a forty, and a fifty pound note, half-a-guinea and a sixpence. I went from there to the Bank of England to get them changed.</p>

               <p>Q. There, I believe, it is necessary for you to put your address - A. When I came there (I never was there before), I was a stranger which office I was to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070044"></xptr>to. A gentleman there informed me that I was to write my name on the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these notes, and say whether they are the notes that you received from Messrs. Glyn and Company - A. These are the two thousand pound notes. I wrote my name on them, and Blunt's address. I wrote no name on the smaller notes. I thought they were small enough. I only, changed at the Bank the two thousand-pound notes. I got twenty fifties, thirty-three thirties, and a ten. On one of the papers I made a calculation how many notes I was to have.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the notes that you received at the Bank - A. I put them in my pocketbook. In my way to the Bank, Mr. Abbott gave me a note to leave at a house in Leadenhall-street; that minute was put on at Mr. Abbott's. I put the notes in my pocket-book, and put the pocket-book in my breast pocket, inside. When I came from the Bank I went to Moorgate coffee-house, and when I came there, instead of doing as he directed me, I went and asked the landlord if there was such a person there. Instead of going into the coffee-room, I named a gentleman with green spectacles. He said, there was no such a person there, and it raining I was not urgent in my enquiry. I went from there directly to Francis-street. When I got to Francis-street he was not there. I arrived at Francis-street about twenty minutes after three o'clock. I rang the bell. The person of the house opened the door. Mr. Blunt was not there. I understood from the people of the house that he went out soon after I went. I sat there until half past five in possession of the money, in his room. I at last received a letter. This is the identical letter; it is marked C. This letter appointed me to meet him at the White Hart. In consequence of my receiving that note I left the house, and went directly through Gower-street, and in my way to the White Hart I met a person that since I know to be Richardson. He was walking the same way gently. I have seen him repeatedly to-day. When I came out in Holborn I rather gained upon him, and at Holborn I was at a loss which way to turn, either to the right or to the left. I asked another person passing by, the way to the White Hart; they could not tell me. Richardson stepped up, and said, who do you enquire for sir. I said, for the White Hart, Warwick-court, Holborn. He said, that he was passing by the house, and he would take me with him; and on his way there he asked me if I had been in the country, and how dirty it was. He said, he came from Brentford that day, where he had been on business. I asked him with respect of the house, the White Hart. He said, that it was a respectable house, that gentlemen resorted there. He asked me if I was going to meet a gentleman there, or going on business. I said I was going there on business to meet a gentleman. I expostulated with him that he was taking me too far from the house. I suspected him, and thought he was not an honest man. When he came to the White Hart he shewed me the White Hart. He said, there is the White Hart, sir. I went into the house, and enquired for Mr. Blunt, a gentleman in green spectacles. They said, there was no such person there. Richardson told the waiter to bring him a noggin of wine, and he heard them tell me that there was no such person there. He was present at the time; he called to the waiter to know what there was to pay. The waiter said, some pence under a shilling. He gave a shilling, and the change he said he would give to him, and he went off. I was very uneasy; what to do I did not know. I considered with myself whether it was not best to return to my lodging. I went out of the door, and stood waiting a little bit. I saw Mr. Blunt, my employer; he was coming across the street with one arm a-kimbo. He was the same person, and in the same dress. He was coming as if from Chancery-lane. He was in the middle of the horse-road, in Holborn, before I saw him. He came on to me. I stepped off the door, as if to meet him. He beckoned to me, and said, have you done that little business for me, continued walking, and told me to come round the corner, in Warwick-court. I told him that I had done the business, and told him how and in what manner I had the notes, saying, if he thought proper if he would have them there I could give them him in my pocket-book. I took my pocket-book out as I was speaking to him. He said, going into a coffee-house, he did not like to do it. He asked me, if it was convenient for him to keep the pocket-book until the morrow, until I came to him. I told him, that it was. I gave him also half-a-guinea in gold and a sixpence in silver, that made eleven shillings, and I gave him the pocket-book. Then I parted with him. He said then, I shall not want you now until the morrow at eleven o'clock. That was the last time I saw him in that dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, look at the prisoner, and say what you believe - A. I believe him to be the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt - A. A trifling doubt. The green spectacles and the habit altogether makes a little difference, but I believe him to be the identical man, knowing by his side face from his cravat. There is a flagginess about his chin, and his handkerchief is over it. When he was writing for me the Moorgate coffee-house direction I took notice of his side face.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you saw him again - A. The last time I saw him in the habit and the green spectacles was on the 28th of February, 1811. I think it was the 3d of February, 1813, he was exhibited before me again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you hear him speak enough so as to recollect whether it was the same voice - A. I did not hear him enough to say it was the same voice. After I gave him my pocket-book with the notes I went to see some friends. I went home to my lodgings between ten and eleven o'clock. When I came in there I received my pocket-book done up in a brown paper parcel, and a seal over it, and two one-pound notes were in my pocket-book, and I believe a few things that were in it prior to that. The note is;</p>
               <p>"Sir, I found by a letter from my most particular friend at Liverpool, she is very ill, whom I must go to see; am not certain when I shall return. I am, sir, your friend.</p>

               <p>Q. How often might you and Mr. Nares personally communicate upon the subject - A. Twice latterly; the first was in 1811.</p>
               <p>Q. I am talking of examinations of this year, did that impression remain throughout the examination, or did you alter your opinion; on your looking round, you said Richardson was the man - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this man pointed out to you - A. He was, by Mr. Nares I think; I first thought he was not the man. My opinion before I left the room was, that he was the man. On the second examination, upon nature consideration, I believed him to be the man that I saw in Francis-street. I really believe now, that to be the man that I saw in Francis-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Richardson and Kennet upon that subject - A. After procuring the draft, it was copied.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know what was the draft procured for - A. For the purpose of committing a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. You were to obtain the genuine draft for it to be copied - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. What transaction was he to have, in order that you might have the draft - A. He was to buy stock; he did buy in stock, and sold it out afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that draft, when so obtained, brought to you - A. It was. That is the genuine draft, procured from Mr. Trowers.</p>
               <p>Q. By what name did Richardson transact that business - A. By the name of

               <p>Q. Who was present when that draft was brought for the purpose of being copied - A. I do not recollect any one but Richardson and myself Richardson gave it me. I made a copy from that draft, and filled up that check.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you obtain the blank check - A. I had some by me. I do not remember how I obtained them. It was proposed that Richardson should hire an apartment for the prisoner, Kennet, and that the prisoner should go to the apartment and the next day the clerk should be procured. The clerk was procured: and I believe, the next day this draft was presented by the prisoner. Whether I gave the draft to the prisoner or Richardson, I have it not in my memory; we were all together. It was planned altogether that the prisoner should be at that apartment, and the prisoner was to go by the name of Blunt. He was to tell his own story, and his dress was settled. It was something of a drab coat, I do not exactly recollect the colour; drab pantaloons and hessian boots. It was a disguise for a purpose that never took place. He wore his own hair, but he had a wig and green spectacles. I saw him in this disguise at the Bedford coffee-house, Russel-square. The clerk was hired on the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at the Bedford coffee-house the day before the clerk was hired - A. Yes; the clerk was hired and I think on the following day the draft was given to the clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave the draft to the clerk - A. That I cannot say; I understood Kennet; Kennet was to deliver the forged draft to the clerk. Kennet was to transact the business with the clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. How early upon that day, in which the draft was presented, did you see Kennet; I am speaking of the day in which he got the cash - A.Between eleven and twelve o'clock I saw him at the Bedford coffee-house: that was by appointment.</p>
               <p>Q. You all knew that was the day upon which the draft was to be presented - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came to the Bedford coffee-house, was he in his usual habit, or the disguise - A. In the disguise.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the purpose of your meeting at the Bedford coffee-house - A. It was for the purpose of the prisoner taking the check, to give it to the clerk. I went with him, part of the way, from the Bedford coffee-house, to Francis-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you dropped him, I saw soon on that day did you see him again - A. It might be in two hours afterwards. I beg your pardon, I am incorrect.</p>
               <p>Q. You went part of the way with him to Francis-street, and there you left him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you take him up again - A. In<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070046"></xptr>about half an hour; he came to me in Francis-street. I was to wait for him there, within sight of the house</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the young man come from the house - A. No, I did not. When Kennet came to me, he said, he had sent the note by the clerk. We agreed to take a coach, and go to the back of the Bank, Princes-street, and there to wait, to know whether the draft was paid, or not; we were to know that by Richardson, and a man of the name of

               <p>Q. How long did you remain in Princes-street - A. I suppose, three quarters of an hour. Richardson and Birdett came and said, they suspected the clerk suspected the transaction, they had seen him go into a house in Newport-street, and therefore suspected that there was a suspicion of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know at that time, that Newport-street was the lodging of the advertising clerk - A. No. We went to a public-house, and concluded that the business was done away with, and all failed. It entered into our minds that the money might still be obtained. I thought it was a neglect in the man that was sent, for this purpose, that they had kept good look out, and at the

               <p>Q. Did you or Birdett write a letter which was sent by a porter to Francis-street - A. There was no other than one letter written or sent.</p>

            . I married Mrs. Shrimpton's daughter. Mrs. Shrimpton lived at 13, Francis-street. A person of the name of Blunt took the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was Blunt there - A. About three hours. He came I think, on the 28th of February, 1811.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed - A. In a mixed coloured coat, rather light, a slouched hat, green spectacles, and a light coloured wig. A person came as a servant, him in. He staid about half an hour. Mr. Blunt went out about half an hour after the servant went. The servant told me he was going to the Bank, for two thousand and ninety pound, odd money. I never saw Mr. Blunt at the apartment again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after, before you saw the person that you supposed to be Blunt - A. About two years afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. What servant did you understand the servant to be - A. A clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, Kennet - A. That is the gentleman that passed at my mother-in-law's house, as Blunt. I have no doubt at all of it now.</p>
               <p>MR. LEVIN. I am a tailor, in Princes-street, Hanover-square,</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Hudson - A. Yes, I have seen him here to day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time, make any clothes by his recommendation, for a person of the name of King - A. I did, in February, 1811. This is the pattern of the coat, waistcoat, and pantaloons. These patterns are part of the cloth they were made off I made the clothes by the recommendation of Mr. Hudson.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person that was to wear them clothes - A. I think the prisoner is the person that was measured in the name of King. He was measured by me, or my partner.</p>

            . Q. Were you an assignee under a commission of bankruptcy, against the prisoner - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that you were assignee had you frequent opportunities of seeing him write - A. Yes, and before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper marked B - A. If I had picked up this paper by accident, I should have said it is a hand writing with which I am familiar. It is a larger character, then the prisoner's epistolary writing; but to my belief it is his hand writing, and this other paper is the same hand writing, in my opinion. I believe this to be his hand; the i a m the three final letters in William, I believe to be the hand writing of the prisoner, Kennet. The word Blunt the u and n, and is, the two concluding letters in Francis, I think are his. The word, street is the next word the double e in the word, street. The word Tottenham, the em the am is his. The whole of the writing I believe is the writing of

               <p>Q. How long is it ago, since you have seen him write, is it less then ten years - A. No. I have not seen him write in that time to my recollection. My first acquaintance commenced with him in the year 1792, about the beginning of January it continued to the year 1800, 25th of February During that time he had four sons at my school I had frequent opportunities of seeing his writing.</p>

            . I am a shoe-maker, in Newport-street. The young man, Pollard lodged at my house. He called at my house on the 28th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070048"></xptr>of February, in the morning; he after that went into the City.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he receive a parcel that same evening - A. He did; his pocket-book, and other papers. I advised him to go to the bankers, the next morning; he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. That is the evidence on the part of the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly innocent of this charge.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH JAMES. I am a lace and fridge weaver, in Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you considerable transactions with Kennet when he was a tradesman - A. I had, and I was a creditor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your transactions in business give you an opportunity of seeing his hand writing - A. I have seen his hand writing, and have transacted business with him upon that hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been applied to by Messrs. Kay and Freshfield - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I show you the letter A first, do you or not believe the paper marked A to be his hand writing - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, making an allowance for disguise being used, and it is written larger, do you find any letters in his hand writing - A. Not any in the paper marked B. There is not any impression in my mind that is, his hand writing, and the paper marked C, to the best of my recollection, not any in that letter.</p>
               <p>Q. The paper D next, look at that now sir, as to any part of any one of them, do you find the hand writing of Kennet - A. I do not alter my opinion in the least. They were shown to me, and that was the answer that I gave first. In my judgment there are none of them his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Did you know that Mr. Kennet was in custody, before the application was made to you; whom did you communicate to before you had been applied to by the solicitor of the Bank - A. Mr. Hill called upon me, to get me to make a claim, that I had of Mr. Kennet.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the age of the claim - A. I have the note in my pocket. I think it must have been twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard anything about liquidating the draft, until after your old friend was charged with a forgery - A. It was mentioned before. I think some debts were in the habit of being purchased a twelvemonth ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the amount of your debt - A.Eighteen pounds two shillings and ninepence. Mr. Duff gave me to understand, that there was money lodged in the Court of Chancery, that would pay twenty shillings in the pound, about eighteen months or two years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You had heard nothing of it until about three weeks ago - A. It might be that time. I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your debt been paid - A. My debt has been paid. I received fifteen shillings in the pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you to keep your promissory note in your pocket - A. I was not asked for it; I gave a receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I should like to know, how a gentleman is approached under these circumstances - A. I think the solicitor for the prisoner saw me first, before the solicitor of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after Mr. Kennet was sent to prison, did his solicitor wait upon you - A. I am sure I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the honour of knowing Mr. Hill before Kennet was taken in custody - A.No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Hill upon his first introduction to you, tell you, that your old customer was in custody, charged with a forgery, and that you, and others would be applied to, to know whether it was his hand writing - A. Upon my oath, he did not. The first time was concerning the liquidation of this draft. He came to know what I would take. My answer was, that I had reason to believe the estate could pay twenty shillings in the pound, and that I would not take less.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to refuse to sell your debt, when your debtor found his way to Newgate - A. Because five shillings was offered. I took fifteen shillings in the pound.</p>

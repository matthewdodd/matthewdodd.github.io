                  </hi>. I am a confectioner, and live in Aldgate. On Monday evening, 28th June, between 7 and 8 o'clock, the prisoner came for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of pic-nic biscuits—I served him—he gave a half crown—I gave him change, and when he had left I discovered the half-crown was bad—I went out, but could not find the prisoner—I put the half-crown into a piece of paper, and gave it to the policeman the next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, of Aldgate. On 20th June the prisoner and another man came in my shop—the prisoner asked for half an ounce of tobacco, and his companion wanted two penny pickwicks, but I did not sell them—the tobacco came to three halfpence—the prisoner threw down a half crown, which was good—I put it in a drawer about two inches deep and sixteen wide—while I was giving the prisoner change, the other man said, "I will pay for the tobacco, give him his half crown back"—I took the half crown out of the till, where I had placed it carefully by itself, as I had a suspicion—I gave it to the prisoner—his companion then fumbled in his pocket for a minute, and he said, "You must pay for it now, for I have not any money;" and the prisoner threw down a bad half crown—I said, "My suspicions are realized, this is bad; I suspected what you were doing"—the prisoner went out—I sent out my wife for a policeman, and I gave the half crown to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were there other half crowns in the till? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and other silver—the half crown I took from the prisoner I put in the till by itself—I had not exactly shut the till—I do not know how many half crowns I had in the till; it might have been two or three.</p>

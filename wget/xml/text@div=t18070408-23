On Sunday the 8th of March, I went out about eight o'clock to take a walk; I returned back about eleven, and at two I went up stairs to clean myself. I found my things out of the box; I missed a new shirt, a pair of stockings, and a tool called a jigger. I turned round and looked over Statham's seat, I found his tools were gone, and his seat was covered over with a coat. I went down stairs and told Mr. Wiggins, my master; he and I went in pursuit after him, we met him at the Bell near Barnett-gate; he had a bundle in his possession. I challenged him with stealing my shirt and stockings, he said he was sorry that he had taken them, but they were safe in his bundle. I was not satisfied, he shewed me them; we brought him back and delivered him to the constable.</p>

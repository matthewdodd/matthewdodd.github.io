                  </hi>. I am a jeweller and silversmith, at Vine-street, Bristol. I received that parcel on Saturday, 28th Oct., about 2 o'clock in the day—I opened it—it contained some watch bags and five pieces of brick—they are there now—they are in the same state—my assistant saw me open it—he is not here—I immediately communicated with Mr. Hewett—he lives in Bristol, close to my place—we arranged to come to London to make inquiries—on Monday morning I went to Mr. Hewett's office, in the Old Bailey, to make inquiries—Mr. Hewett came up with me on Sunday night, and went to the office on Monday morning—I looked about the yard; I saw a piece of brick—Mr. Hewett and I had gone into the counting-house, and asked Mr. Lavington about the parcel—I was about to leave, and looked round the yard, about the counting-house door—I saw a heap of rubble just behind the counting-house door—I beckoned to Mr. Hewett, and said, "What is this?"—Mr. Lavington, the father, said, "That is for repairing the yard;" he said, "There is no brick there; it is only stone"—I said, "There are some pieces of brick;" and on going a little further I found this large piece of brick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have examined this brick with the brick that was in the box, and find three pieces fit—these three pieces fit; this other does not—(<hi rend="italic">the brick and pieces were examined by the Court and Jury, and fitted exactly</hi>)—I subsequently informed the police—I went with the inspector and Moss, the detective, to the prisoner's lodgings, and saw them searched—the first occasion I went, was the day the prisoner was given into custody, on the Monday—the second occasion was on the Tuesday week following—the policeman found on the second occasion a piece of piper—he has it—that piece of paper has been fitted to some papers which were in the box which the stones were in—it is dark paper—that is all I know about the matter—we found it in the box—I can identify it—Mr. Hewett wrote his name upon it.</p>

                  </hi>. I came up with the last witness from Bristol, on Sunday night, 29th Oct.—I went to the yard on the Monday morning with Mr. Bale—Mr. Bale made a search, and found a piece of brick in the yard—I am not positive that I saw him find it—I afterwards made a search, and found another piece of brick, corresponding with that which Mr. Bale found—that is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You cannot say that you saw Mr. Bale find that brick? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am pretty sure I did not see him pick it up—I was in the office with Mr. Lavington, and he beckoned to me to come out—he said that there was a heap of rubbish in the yard, and that he had picked up a small piece of brick corresponding with those pieces in the box—we turned round in conversation—Mr. Bale was behind, still looking over the bricks, and called my attention to another piece which he had picked up—neither Mr. Lavington nor I saw him pick it up—I found a second piece—Mr. Bale did not say anything to me about looking farther to see if I could find more—he came and produced it to me and Mr. Lavington, and we both said it was very like the nature of the brick in the box, and Mr. Bale went to the police station to get a detective—I remained in the yard—curiosity led me to look about, and I found the other bit within three or four yards of the place where Mr. Bale found this.</p>

               <p>was then in ray office with Mr. Hewett—I did not see them found—I after<lb></lb>wards saw Mr. Hewett find a bit of brick, three, or four, or five minutes, after the first: after Mr. Bale left.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Until Mr. Bale paid your yard a visit you never saw a brick like that; and since he paid it a visit, you have never seen another? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there are no whitewashed bricks about—when Mr. Bale first came up he showed me a piece of paper, on the 30th—he said it was a peculiar piece of paper, and he thought it might tend to trace the person—I believe that was his idea, and I believe it was his expression—I made a good many inquiries of him—the next day he said something to me about charging or fixing him—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Bale was directed to leave the Court</hi>)—he said if you can fix it here you are welcome to do so (<hi rend="italic">striking his breast</hi>)—that was on the 31st, at my office, in consequence of some observations I made—I merely inquired the day before who was present when he received the parcel and when he opened it—it was in allusion to that I imagined he did so—I had asked him the question myself—I asked him who received the parcel; I think he said he did himself, and I asked him how long he received it before he opened it—he made answer, about half an hour—I asked him whether the parcel had been disturbed since it was packed—he said, no, it had not the least appearance of having been disturbed that he noticed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said something about who was present, did you make that in<lb></lb>quiry? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—his foreman, I think he said—he mentioned somebody, at all events—I asked him if he saw him open it—he said he was at the farther end of the room—I understood that it was in relation to this question that he struck himself and said that—I do not know whether he said "young man" or "foreman."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective policeman—I was employed in this matter—I went to the lodgings of the prisoner—I searched his box on the first occasion—I did not find anything—Mr. Bale was with me—I afterwards searched his lodgings again, for the purpose of finding some letters—when I met Mr. Bale in the morning, he suggested that we should go and see the landlady, and inquire about a letter which he said he had received from Southampton—I went and searched his lodgings again—I found this small piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that piece matches with some others—the marks upon it are my initials—(<hi rend="italic">the witness produced two pieces of paper</hi>) these are the papers in which some of the stones were wrapped—as far as I know I received them in the box from Mr. Bale—I can fit that (<hi rend="italic">the piece found in the prisoner's box</hi>) in here—my object in going to the box a second time, was to look over the letters to see what acquaintances he had got—I came near to the bottom of the box, I lifted up a waistcoat, and this piece of paper dropped from the waistcoat and fell to the bottom of the box.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Can you recollect whether he or you first meddled with the box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I am sure of that—he came round and took a letter out—I am quite certain I first took some things out of the box—it was the two concertinas—that would bring me nearer to the waistcoat—then there were several music books—they did not cover the whole surface of the box—there were one or two shirts.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had Mr. Bale drawn your attention to the paper in the box before you went there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was after I found the dark piece—when I said, "This is something like what you have got in your box," I had not called his attention to the paper in the box, but I had seen it at the station—he had called my attention to it at the police station; I think it was on the first occasion, when he came with the brick—I am quite certain it was on the first occasion, because he was showing us the piece of brick, and the pieces he had found—he called my attention particularly to the paper before we went to make any inquiries at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you or did you not go to search for a piece of paper like that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not think of the paper at all till I found it, it did not strike me about the paper—nothing at all bad passed about searching for paper of that description—my attention had not been called before I went to search the second time, to the large piece of paper having a piece torn out of the corner—I received this large piece from Mr. Bale, on 7th Nov., the day that the prisoner was committed; that was after we found the small piece, after we came from the Hall—Mr. Bale had been in possession of the box and paper up to that time—I had seen the box and the paper before the first search; and Bale had called my attention to it—I did not find the small piece of paper</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270106"></xptr>
               <p>on the first search, I had no idea of searching for it—the watch box was emptied of its contents at the station—I think it likely that the small piece of paper could have been in the box the first time without my seeing it, because I did not take anything out, as I was quite certain the watches and duplicates were not there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But a duplicate is as small as this, or smaller; how could you expect to find them if you did not take everything out, down to the very bottom board; did not you take them all out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not, but I went to the bottom of the box—the waistcoat had been out before—I shook the things on the first occasion, and so I did on the last—I looked in the pockets, and the small piece of paper did not appear—I beg pardon, on the first occasion I did not match the paper—I did not put the two pieces together to see the size.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did this piece of paper come from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From Stauffer, the watch manufacturer's; it is the same size as the other was before; it was this size before it was torn—all the papers that these watches are sent over in are that size.</p>
               <p>

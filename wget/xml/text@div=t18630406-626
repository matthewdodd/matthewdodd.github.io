I am a grocer, at 41, St. Mary-at-Hill—about seven months ago I engaged the prisoner as a commercial traveller—he was to sell goods on my account, and they were to be delivered in my name—he was not to deliver any of the goods himself or to receive the money, but if he did receive money, he was to bring it to me immediately—it was his duty to enter the orders in my book, and I paid him his commission whether I received the money or not—I remember his bringing an order to me from Mr. Leach—I have the book here—it is entered in his own handwriting—I sent the invoice for that order—my clerk called on Mr. Leach—I got the balance of the money; the other 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the prisoner had received previously—he absented himself from my place after receiving that money—I afterwards found him in a public-house, and said I would give him into custody if he did not give me the money—he offered to pay me a sovereign, and to give me a duplicate, which I refused—I had no account with the prisoner—he was not authorised to hold my money in his possession, and pay it over to me as he thought proper.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner desired he might have the Liberty to object against the Prosecutor, he being formerly convicted of Forgery, and thereby his Oath not to be taken, in any Court of Judicature.</p>
               <p>The Records being examined. It appeared, That the Prosecutor was actually convicted of Forgery, and a Conspiracy, in publishing Forged Writing, and had the Judgment pass'd on him, as is usual in such Cases, upon which the Court ordered him to withdrew, and proceded to examine witnesses, against the Prisoner.</p>

             depos'd, That on the 8th of September, he being a Servant to a Gentleman near Edmonton heard a Noise, near his Masters House, between two Persons, the bidding the other deliver his Money; that he got a Fowling Piece, and mounting a Coach-Horse, pursu'd the Highwayman, upon the Prosecutor's informing him of his being robb'd; that a Tottenham he overtook the Prisoner and tho' he did not answer the Description of the Person who rob'd the Prosecutor, his Mistress and the Maid, saying, he had on Dark Wig, or his own Hair, and white Stockings, yet he caused him to be apprehended, at the Swan at Tottenham, where the Prisoner put up his Horse; that the Prosecutor, Mr. Sanders, coming there, and the Prisoner being gone to Bed, they went with Mr. Sanders, and view'd the Prisoner's Horse, which Mr. Sanders said was the Horse which the Person rode who robb'd him, they afterwards went and viewed the Prisoner's Cloaths, and the Prosecutor said the Person who robb'd him had those very Cloaths on, but what Sanders told him, was no Evidence, Sander's Oath not being to be taken, his Tale to this Deponent could have no weight with the Court, besides, by the Description of the Person who robb'd Sanders, as the Mistress, and Maid of the House describ'd him to this Deponent, he had on a dark Wig, on his own Hair, and white Stockings, but when this Deponent overtook the Prisoner, which was not long after this Robbery was committed, he had on a white Wig, and Boots, so as his Stockings could not be seen.</p>
               <p>This Deponent further said, That when he overtook the Prisoner, he was riding an even Trot, and stopping at the Swan at Tottenham, asked how far it was to London, and being told four Miles, he said he would put up a little, but he being tir'd, supp'd in the publick Kitchen, and after staying there some Time, went to bed, saying, he had rode forty Miles that Day, upon a very indifferent Horse.</p>

               <p>Mr. Legg depos'd, That the Prisoner put up his Horse at his House, at the Swan, at Tottenham, and supp'd with them, in the publick Kitchen, behaving himself very orderly, and had not the least Appearance of a Robbery, or suspicious Person; and that after he was apprehended, the Prosecutor saying, he had a Pistol about him when he assaulted him, he used his Servants to search very narrowly, under the Manger, and about the Stable, where the Prisoner's Horse stood, but after the most strick Search, they could not find any Pistol.</p>

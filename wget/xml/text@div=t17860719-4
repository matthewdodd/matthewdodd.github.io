               <p>Mr. Garrow. What sort of a night was it, was it dark or light? - It was a pretty clear light, and I could see twenty yards before me.</p>
               <p>Was this pen-knife a fit instrument to break open a house? - It was a small knife; I found no ear-rings about this man; he was not dressed as he is now; he said, he was a drover, and had been drinking at some public house in the market; he never spoke a word about cattle; I did not look upon it that he drove cattle.</p>
               <p>Court to Francis.

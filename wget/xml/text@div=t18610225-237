On 8th February, about 10 at night, in consequence of information I received, I went to 8, James-street, Fleur-de-lis-street, Spitalfields, at a quarter to 12 at night, with Sergeant Brannan, Inspector Fife, Sergeant Harris, and Elliott, 104 <hi rend="italic">G</hi>,—the front door was shut; it was, forced open by Sergeant Bannan at my request and we went into the first-floor front room, the door of which was ajar—no one was there—I looked in the adjoining room and saw the prisoner—I said, "Miss Cavanagh, I</p>

            . I am a constable. On the night of the 27th of April I saw the defendant at the corner of Ivy-lane, about ten minutes after nine o'clock in the evening; Mr. Allies' warehouse is at the corner of the lane - I passed by him, and turned round; two gentlemen passed me, coming down Newgate-street; I saw the prisoner stoop down, and enter the house; I watched between two and three minutes, saw him come out, and seized him at the corner of the lane - he got away, and I lost sight of him - I followed, calling Stop thief! I caught his coat tail, and by some means fell down, and he got from me into a public-house; I got up in half a minute, and caught him in the public-house; I saw him sufficiently to swear to him, and have no doubt of his being the man - I saw his features after he came out. I searched him at the public-house, and found on him some half-pence, a pencil-case, and a piece of wax. While I was tying his hands, to take him to the Compter, I said, "Take care that he drops nothing from his pocket;" a man behind him immediately lifted up a bunch of keys, and said,"These keys I found" - the prisoner was dropping them from his pocket; the prisoner said he did not drop them. Nothing disturbed him in the house; he came out quietly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. It was a dark night? A. Yes; he was about six yards from me when he went into the house; I saw him before at the corner of the lane; I will not be certain that I have seen him before; I only saw his back as he entered the house; he was inside two or three minutes, and when he came out I was about as far from him as I am from you; I seized him immediately - I lost sight of him afterwards for about half a minute or a minute - he turned the corner of a court, going into the public-house - he was stopped by three or four persons in the public-house; it is called the Hope; he was taken in the public-house - I do not know who keeps it; I saw no Mr. Jones there. I swear positively he is the man - the keys are not skeleton ones.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did he appear to let himself into the house? A. He stooped down - his head and body were nearly to his knees - he opened the door, but I do not know how.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was at the public-house with the last witness and the prisoner; I searched the prisoner, and found a skeleton-key on him - in trying it to the lock of the house I broke it - it went into the lock, and appeared to fit it; I tried it, and in getting it out it was broken; I cannot recollect whether I told the Magistrate that I tried the key, and it fitted. The prisoner was a stranger to me; I have been at the public house, but do not know any of the people who frequent it.</p>

            . I am waiter at the Hope public-house - Mrs. Wright, who keep it, has left; I remember seeing the defendant there on the night of the 27th of April; he used to come there for a glass of grog; he came about eight o'clock that evening, or rather before - I am sure of that; he had his refreshment in the parlour; there were other persons there, but they went away; there were three or four bookbinders, who live in the market. I remember some persons coming in and taking the prisoner out about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been out of the house from the time he first came in? A. I never saw him out; he could have gone out while I was in the tap-room, but I never saw him out; I heard a cry of Stop thief! when I was in the parlour - I did not see the prisoner there - several people came into the house, and ran right through into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was taken did he appear out of breath? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any men run in at the time you heard a cry of Stop thief? A. Several people came in, and one man ran through the house, opened the back door, and went away; Mrs. Wright took and shut the door after him.</p>
               <p>Q. At the very time the cry of Stop thief! was raised? A. Yes. Our house has two fronts, one in Ivy-lane, and another in Turk's Head-passage; after that man ran away the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He might have gone out while you were serving? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the person came in can you swear you saw him in the place? A. About three minutes before - there was not a soul in the parlour at that time - there was when first the prisoner came in; they were gone before the alarm; I went into the parlour to stir the fire, and as I came out I heard the cry of Stop thief! he was not in the parlour when I went in to stir the fire - I saw him three minutes before that, standing at the bar; nobody was in the bar but my young mistress, Miss Wright - she is about twenty-seven years old.</p>
               <p>Q. Then somebody reshed through almost immediately after you had seen him at the bar? A. Yes, and the constable followed.</p>
               <p>Q. He got in at one door and out at the other? A. Yes; there were about six people in the house - they were all booksellers, who carry books about.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, I suppose you told the constable a man had run through the house? A. No, for they collared this gentleman - they never asked me a question; when they collared the gentleman I thought he might be the one - I did not know whether he was the person they had come after.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you doubt about that if you had seen him at the bar? A. I had no doubt about it; the gentleman asked me to fetch a coach for him, as they were pulling him about - I went, and in the mean time he was gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310057"></xptr>Q. When they were pulling him about why not say the right man had run through the house? A. I did mention that a man had run through - I told the witnesses James and Jackson so. Our house is about one hundred yards from Mr. Allies'.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what they seized the prisoner for? - A. No; I heard a person say, "I have picked up a lot of keys," and those keys I had seen Mr. Sadler take out of the bar two or three days before; I heard the cry of Stop thief!</p>
               <p>Q. Could you doubt about what they took him up for? A. No. I told Jackson and the other gentleman about a person running through the house.</p>

            . I heard him say nothing of the sort, I am quite certain of it - he never said a word; when I went into the house, the man's hands were tied, and he said he would not be searched; I said, "You won't be searched, won't you?"

               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Will you swear he did not say, in your hearing, that a man had run through the house, in at one door and out at the other? A. I never heard an observation of the kind, made by any person whatever.</p>

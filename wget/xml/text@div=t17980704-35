             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Wright; on the 28th of June last, between four and five in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar, in company with the child at the bar, came into our shop, she wished to look at some shawls; I shewed her some, the boy was standing by the opposite counter, the boy went out before her; she went away, and said, none of them would suit her, she went out immediately after the boy; I came to the other counter to take the silk handkerchiefs I had left there, to mark them, I missed them, I suspected the boy had taken them, I followed them, and on Tower-hill I overtook them, she had a gown with her; I told the boy he had got something that did not belong to him, and she said he had, she had just found it out, and was coming to bring them back; she said, he had just told her so; she was then standing still, as I was coming up the Minories; I took the gown from her, I thought the handkerchiefs might be there; I looked in the handkerchief, and saw that the black handkerchiefs that we had lost were not there; I then called the boy to me, and asked him what he had done with them, and while I was searching him for them, she produced them, I cannot tell where she took them from; I brought her back to my master's shop, there were ten handkerchiefs, they cost two shillings and four-pence a-piece.</p>

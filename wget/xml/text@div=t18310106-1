I had seen this piece of cloth two or three days previous to its being taken - it was in the inner warehouse; a piece of this sort of cloth runs from thirty-five to forty yards: the prisoner was quite a stranger to us - I missed the cloth on the 5th of January, and saw it at the Mansion-house the same day, about twelve o'clock; the prisoner was in custody - I am positive the cloth is ours, and that it had not been sold; it is worth 12l. or 13l. - it cost 13l.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bassishaw ward. On Wednesday morning, about a quarter-past nine o'clock, I was passing by the gate of the prosecutors' premises; (there is a yard leading to their premises) - I saw the prisoner and another coming along the yard- they were inside the yard, coming from the warehouse; the other had the cloth on his shoulder - I collared him, and the prisoner instantly rushed between us, and disengaged the man from my hold; they dragged me outside the gate - the cloth then dropped from the other man's shoulder between us, and prevented my getting hold of the other one, and he ran away; the prisoner being behind him, I tried to catch hold of him - he ran across the road; I called Stop thief! and a gentleman stopped him - I never lost sight of him; I took up the cloth, and took him to the Mansion-house - Mr. Williams attended there, and identified the same cloth; I informed the prosecutors' porter of it as soon as I had secured him - I have had the cloth ever since.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAMS. This is our cloth - I know it by the manufacturer's mark on it, and our mark also; the warehouse is part of the dwelling-house - the warehouse door was open.</p>

            . I am book-keeper in a broker's counting-house. I was coming into the City a little after nine o'clock, and saw two men come out of the prosecutors' gateway, one of whom had the bundle of cloth - the constable seized him; a scuffle ensued, and the man who had the cloth ran off - the prisoner went across the way, and ran round a waggon, endeavouring to escape; I met him, and secured him, without losing sight of him - I am certain of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going down Basinghall-street, and went up the gateway for a certain purpose; this officer took me, caught hold of my collar, and said,"I will take you into custody:" he shook me, and I went over the way - this gentleman stopped me; I did not know what for - I had done nothing wrong.</p>

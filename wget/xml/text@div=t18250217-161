            . I live at No. 31, Strutton-ground, Westminster, and am a tailor. On the 12th of February the prisoner Dunn came to my shop with two others, named Rhodes and Nix, as I understand. I will not swear that Dunn had any thing; a bundle was left on the counter which was not there when they came in. I measured them all three for trowsers, which I made. They said there were some buttons and a piece of cassimere, and if they were of any use to me I might purchase them. Dunn said he had bought them. I said I did not want them, but the bundle was left on my counter. I made the trowsers partly out of some blue cloth which they brought, and part from my own; I did not cut the cassimere nor purchase it. On the 17th of February Morris came to my house, and took away a pair of blue trowsers, the buttons, and cassimere, and I have a frock coat which was cut out for them. Two pair of trowsers were taken away the day before Morris came, by a young woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. It is very difficult to identify cassimere? A. Yes; all the things were not to be finished till the 19th; the cassimere was left till they fetched the trowsers. I was taken into custody for five hours on this charge; my nurse saw them in the shop; she is attending my wife, and not able to come here.</p>
               <p>Mr. CRESWELL. Q. Look at these trowsers, (produced by SMITH.) A. I made these for Rhodes, part is made out of the cloth they brought; they brought four yards and a half, and wanted a frock coat and each a pair of trowsers, the cloth was tied up with the cassimere.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Cox. I know this cassimere to be his property. I have cut several garments off it; I cut it about two inches, and then tear it across; I know it by that. We lost nine or ten yards of blue cloth, and a quantity of buttons similar to these.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not common to tear cassimere? A. I do it so, and have seen other tailors do the same. The trowsers are made from cloth of the same quality; I cannot see any difference in them.</p>
               <p>Mr. COX. I have no reason to doubt about the cassimere. I have the list which I verily believe came off the same piece. I found it among my list at home. I have no other list of the same colour.</p>

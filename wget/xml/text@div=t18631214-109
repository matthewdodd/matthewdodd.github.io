                  </hi>. I am a painter of 7, Swan-street, Dover-road, Borough—I was present at the parish-church of St. Margaret's, Ipswich, on 10th March, 1842, when my sister, Ellen Pearman, was married to the prisoner—I gave her away and signed the book as a witness—they lived together as man and wife for sixteen years—they separated six or seven years ago—I continued to see my sister more or less from time to time—I was present at St. Stephen's, Westminster, when the prisoner was married to Jane Symons, on 6th March, 1859—I gave that bride away also—I knew that my sister was alive at the time—I signed the book as a witness to that marriage—Jane Symons knew at the time that the former wife was alive—the prisoner had at various times spoken to her about it in my presence—he has said that he was married before, and that his wife was living—he had been living with Symons for about a twelvemonth previous to the marriage.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you are the only person who complains, the second wife does not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't complain at all—I prosecuted through ignorance; had I been aware of what was going to take place I should not have prosecuted at all—I am sure the prisoner knew that his first wife was alive—it was about the year 1855 that he and his first wife separated—they came to my place soon after they had separated—I have never seen them together since—I saw my sister after the second marriage at intervening times—I did not tell her about it—I don't know why—I did not think it worth while—there were four children by the first marriage, two boys and two girls I never persuaded Symons to marry the prisoner; I am quite sure of that; I persuaded them both against it—I don't know why he parted from his first wife—there was a written paper of separation—I don't know where it is—at the time I gave the second wife away, I was not aware that I was doing either right or wrong; I did not give it a consideration—the first time I told my sister about the prisoner's being married to Symons was when he was taken to the police-court—I did not tell her—she heard of it from another party—I gave the prisoner into custody; perhaps it might have been from ignorance on my part—I had not had any quarrel with him.</p>

               <p>Brighton-terrace, but my husband persuaded me to sell the home, and I have done so—I have lived with him since our marriage, in March, 1859—I took care of his children—I thought his wife had just left him with three children, and he said if I would protect those children he would protect me as long as he lived, and I have done so—I have the youngest child with me—twelve-months passed away, and James Harding and his wife, my husband's sister, persuaded us to be married, and we were—I knew his first wife was alive, but she had left him, and the solicitor has a document that was brought to me—the prisoner has been a good husband to me, and a good father to the children.</p>

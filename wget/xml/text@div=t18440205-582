                  </hi>. In June last I was in the service of Mr. Cotes, livery<lb></lb>stable keeper, Chelsea—he lets out carriages for hire. On Friday night, the 30th of June, Colonel Fawcett ordered a carriage at my master's to take him up next morning—I think at a quarter to five o'clock—on Saturday morning, the 1st of July, I went to Colonel Fawcett's house, No. 188, Sloane-street, Chelsea—I got there at a quarter to five o'clock with a brougham, a close carriage with one horse—Colonel Fawcett came out in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and got into the brougham—he directed me to drive to the Hay-market—I drove to No. 21, Hay market, to the shop of Mr. Williams, a bool-maker—Colonel Fawcett got out, and rang the bell, and went into Mr. Williams's house—he came out in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes,—another gentleman followed him—they got into the brougham—I was or<lb></lb>dered to drive to, I think, No. 29, or 27, Great Portland-street—the other gentleman got out there, rang, or knocked, went in, and remained, I should say, twelve or fourteen minutes—he came out, accompanied by another gen<lb></lb>tleman—the gentleman who came from Portland-street came out and asked me if I knew the Brecknock Arms—the gentleman at the bar looks like that gen<lb></lb>tleman—it was a man who had mustaches on—I think it is the same gentleman—he is altered, rather—I fancy his hair is darker—he asked me if I knew where the Brecknock Arms was—I told him I did not—a close street <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> also drove up to the same house after the gentleman spoke—I saw the driver give the gentleman who came out of the house a card—the gentleman asked him if be knew the Brecknock Arms, Camden-town—he said, "Yes"—he got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and ordered me to follow the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the gentleman from the Haymarket got into my brougham—Colonel Fawcett had remained sitting inside all this time—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove on towards Camden-town—I followed it, it pulled up for a second or two, at the barracks in the Regent's-park, the Portland-barracks, I think they call it—I saw the gentleman in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> put his head out of the window as if he was inquiring for something—I did not hear him speak—he was rather too far off—I did not observe his face then, to recog<lb></lb>nize him—I did not stop at the barracks at all—I caught them just as they went on, and followed them again—we then drove to the Brecknock Arms—the gentleman got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and gave the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man his fare, I believe he gave him some money, and he drove away—I observed his face at the time he was paying the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man—the gentleman at the bar looks very much like him, in my opinion he is the gentleman—the gentlemen in my brougham got out also—there was a gentleman's open carriage or hack there when we drove up—another gentleman came up and spoke to the gentleman who left Portland-street—he was a stoutish gentleman—I believe it was Mr. Monro—I know</p>

               <p>Mr. Gulliver, the surgeon—I did not know him before—I saw him there—I am sure he was not the gentleman that came and spoke to the gentleman that came from Portland-street—the gentlemen then went away—some went into the field, and some went to the toll-gate—I think the gentleman from Port<lb></lb>land-street, and Mr. Monro, went away, and Mr. Gulliver went out of the road into the field, which is close to the Brecknock Arms—Colonel Fawcett and the gentleman who came from my carriage, walked through the toll-gate on the main road, towards the same field as the other gentleman had gone—the main road is along the side of the field they went to—there is only a board paling which separates it from the road—I saw them go through the toll-gate—I could not see them further—I also lost sight of the gentlemen who went into the field—the last gentleman I saw was Colonel Fawcett and the gen<lb></lb>tleman from the Haymarket come back again across the road, through the toll-gate, and go into the same field that the other persons had gone into—after they got into the field, they went on in the direction the others had gone—I lost sight of them, and some time after that I heard the report of a pistol or gun—I do not think I heard more than one report—I looked in the direction the report came, and saw two gentlemen coming across the field that led into the road, coming towards the gate, towards the Breck<lb></lb>nock Arms, in an opposite direction from that in which I had seen them going before—one was, I think, Mr. Monro, and the other was the gentleman from Portland-street—they were both coming together—they came out into the road, and ordered the coachman that was driving the open carriage, to drive them to the barracks—he was waiting at the Brecknock Arms—I cannot say which of them gave that order—they got into the open carriage, and were driven off—I was there for some time after they were gone, and the gentle<lb></lb>man I had taken up at the Haymarket, came to me, I suppose in full four<lb></lb>teen minutes after, and wished me to go with him—I went—he took me first across the field, near the road, then across another field into a third—I then saw Colonel Fawcett lying on the ground—Mr. Gulliver was with him—he appeared to be in a dying state—I assisted in taking him to the Brecknock Arms—they refused him admittance—I then drove the gentleman who bad been taken up at the Haymarket to Dr. Liston.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the Royal Horse Guards, Blue, and was servant to Lieutenant Monro, and have been so ten years. I did not know Mr. Grant while I was living with Mr. Monro—I never saw him in company with Mr. Monro—I think I had seen him once in town walking with my master, but I cannot say what street it was in—I cannot swear to him—he was something of the description of the gentleman at the bar, but darker hair—it was two or three months before July—besides a room in the barracks, Mr. Monro lived in Brompton-square, before we were quar<lb></lb>tered at the Regent's Park Barracks; and he was living, just before July last, in Munster-street, Regent's Park—he usually slept at home—he had moved his family to Brompton-square a fortnight or a month before—on the night of the 30th of Jane Icannot say where he slept—I did not sleep at the house—I saw him about eight o'clock that night, outside the barracks—he gave me directions that the regiment would march in the morning, and I was to get all things ready—I slept at the Jew's Harp, close to the barracks—on Saturday morning, July the 1st, I came to the barracks about three o'clock—master called to me, about a quarter before five, out of the stables, and told me he wanted breakfast—I went and got breakfast ready for him,</p>

               <p>and he had it; I rather think Mr. Gulliver breakfasted with him, but I was in a hurry, and cannot say—I afterwards got the carriage ready, a four-wheeled carriage; I think you call it a chariot—it had only one horse—my master and Mr. Gulliver got into it—I drove to the Brecknock Arms, Cam<lb></lb>den-town—they got out there, walked about a short time, and then a four—wheeled carriage came, a brougham, Ibelieve—two gentlemen got out of it—a third person came up in a street cab, and got out—there were five per<lb></lb>sons altogether—I only know two of the five, my master and Mr. Gulliver—I do not think I should know the two that got out of the brougham, and the one that got out of the cab, not to swear to them—it was quite light, but I had my horse to attend to—the gentleman that got out of the cab had moustaches—very soon after the five had alighted, they walked away, two down the road, and the other three down the fields—I lost sight of them—in fif<lb></lb>teen or twenty minutes I heard the report of fire-arms, but cannot say whe<lb></lb>ther it was one shot or two—in ten or twenty minutes after the report I was Mr. Monro—some gentleman came a little way behind—I cannot swear, but to the best of my recollection it was the gentleman who got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—they got into my master's carriage, and I drove them to the Regent's Park Barracks—they got out there—I got off the box on the right side, to hold the horse—master got out on the left, opened the door, and let the other gentleman out at the left side—they both went into the barracks—I have no recollection of seeing the prisoner anywhere—I do not think he is the person—he might be something like, but his hair is a great deal darker, if he is the person—my master left the barracks that morning—I cannot say whether he went to Knightsbridge Barracks or not—I have not seen him since.</p>

               <p>we had been there some time a brougham drove up—I am not certain who was in it—I think Colonel Fawcett was—I knew him very well—I have no date whatever that he was there that morning—(I know Lieutenant Grant, the prisoner—I was acquainted with his person—in June and July he had moustaches)—after somebody got out of the brougham, a hack-<hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove up—I did not see anybody get out of it—there were five persons there, including myself—Mr. Munro, Colonel Fawcett, Mr. Grant, and a gentleman, who I understand was Mr. Cuddy—I do not know him—by Lieutenant Grant I mean the prisoner—they went into a field ad<lb></lb>joining the Brecknock Arms—I followed them—they stopped in the field fur<lb></lb>thest from the road—there was one field between them and the road—I stood with my back towards them—I heard the words, "Ready, fire"—I then heard the report of a pistol, and a shout of, "Doctor!"—I went to Colonel Faw<lb></lb>cett, I found him lying on the ground, wounded on the right side—Mr. Monro, and the gentleman that I understood was Mr. Cuddy, were near him—I do not recollect seeing Mr. Grant at that time—there was something said about levelling—Colonel Fawcett said he was not coolly levelling at Mr. Monro—Mr. Monro and Colonel Fawcett shook hands, and Mr. Monro said, "God bless you, Fawcett"—I assisted Colonel Fawcett—I put him into the best position to enable him to breathe—his respiration was very much embarrassed before that—I do not know what became of Mr. Monro—I saw him leave Colonel Fawcett and go away—I do not know that I saw Lieutenant Grant, I am not certain that I did—it is probable that I must have seen him, but I cannot call it to recollection—I saw him last, to the best of my recollection, as they were going down to the field—Colonel Fawcett was removed first to the Breck<lb></lb>nock Arms—they refused to take him in, and then to another public-house, I think the Camden Arms—he went nowhere else—he was put to bed there—he died of the wound, I understand, on the third day, I think—I did not see him after he was dead—I saw him last on the Sunday preceding his death—I attended him with Mr. Liston—I saw him several times—in my judgment the wound was mortal—it was possible for him to have survived—persons have survived as bad wounds as that.</p>

Q.</hi> How far were you from the place where the words "Ready, fire," came from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Probably twenty yards—Colonel Fawcett was about thirty-eight years of age, I guess, and Mr. Monro about the same—Colonel Fawcett said he was not coolly levelling at Mr. Monro—Mr. Monro had said that he was—Colonel Fawcett's wound was on the right side of the chest, under the arm.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, residing in Clifford-street. On Satur<lb></lb>day, the 1st of July, I was called to attend Colonel Fawcett, at the Camden Arms, Camden-town—he was in bed, complaining of great pain, and suffering from a wound in his side—I should say that it was inflicted with a pistol bullet—it was a little below the armpit, on the right side—I continued to attend him till his death, early on Monday morning—on Monday morning I saw a gentleman named Sandys make a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I then extracted the bullet—I cannot say that this now produced is it—I did not mark it—the wound was certainly the cause of his death—the ball entered through the sixth rib—I think it passed across the route of the lung, and lodged in one of the vertebrae of the back, one of the bones composing the spine—in my judgment it was a mortal wound.</p>

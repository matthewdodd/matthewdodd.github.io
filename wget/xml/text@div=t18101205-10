            . I live at 29, Turnmill-street; I deal in old iron and marine stores. On Saturday, the 23d of November, between one and two, the prisoner came to my house, he offered me twenty-six pound of brass; I made an objection, I thought it was cock metal; he said, it was good brass. I paid him eightpence a pound for it; as soon as I bought it, I put what I had to it, and went to Messrs. Botten and Gillman, in Shoe-lane, to sell it altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take to them the some metal that you had bought of the prisoner - A. Every bit of it, and some more that I had laying by me some time before.</p>

               <p>Q. After that were you stationed to observe the men when they came to work - A. Yes; the prisoner was the fifth or sixth man that passed; I went into the work shop, and told him I understood he did not come honestly by the brass, that he sold to me half an hour ago; he asked me who said so. I am sure the prisoner at the bar is the man.</p>

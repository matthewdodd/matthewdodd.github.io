                  </hi>. I keep the Kenilworth Castle, 286, New North Road—on 27th September I saw this advertisement from a barman in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi>—I replied to it by post-card, and Wright came to me as the advertiser—I asked him if he was capable of fulfilling the duties which were set forth in that advertisement—he said he was, that he had been 10 or 11 months in the employ of Mr. Lacy, who had kept a public-house in the Borough—I asked him the cause of his leaving—he said "Change of hands"—I asked the address of his late employer—he said he was residing in private, in a private house at 33, Darwin Street, Old Kent Road—I arranged with him to go there on the following day—he gave me his name as John Wright—next day, on going to 33, Darwin Street, I saw Wright at the corner of the street—I spoke to him and he directed me to 33—I went there, and on knocking at the door I inquired for Mr. Lacy, and was referred upstairs to the first-floor front room, where I found Hennessey—I said "Mr. Lacy?"—he said "Yes"—I told him I had called respecting the character of a young man named John Wright, who had applied to me for a situations as barman and potman—I then put the usual questions as to his honesty and sobriety, and if he considered him thoroughly trustworthy and capable of fulfilling the duties for which I required him—he said he was—I asked the cause of his leaving—he said that he (Hennessey) had recently left his house in the Borough, and that he was seeking another—I asked if he had any fault to find with him—he said he had not, the only complaint he had against him was that he had been late twice on a Sunday—I replied "That is a minor offence, and if I find him only as good as you represent he will do very well for me"—he said he had been with him between 10 and 11 months—after I left the house I saw Wright standing in the street and told him I had seen Mr. Lacy, that the reference was satisfactory, and that he could come as soon as he pleased—I believed that Hennessey was Lacy, residing at 33, Darwin Street, and that he had been keeping a public-house in the Borough—he apologized for the house being slightly in disorder—Wright came into my service that same evening—he remained 10 days—I kept a daily account of my takings—whilst Wright was with me my takings varied from 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day less than usual, on the Sunday especially, when he was most in the bar it was between 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less than on any previous Sunday—after he left my takings resumed their former state—the Sunday he was with me was the worst Sunday I had the whole five years I was in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have not brought my books here, I did not know it was necessary—Wright was potman during the day and barman in the evening—his hours were from 8.30 a.m. till closing, which was between 12 and 12.30—he came to me on Friday, 28th—it was the second Sunday he was with me that the takings were so short; I did not observe it the first Sunday—I first noticed it on the Monday—I discharged him for being drunk—he did not give me notice to leave.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler in St. Martin's Court, Ludgate Hill—on 29th March, I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi>—I replied to it and Wright came to me as the advertiser—he called himself Charles Coleman—I asked if he was the young man who had advertised—he said "Yes"—I said "Where have you been living?"—he said with Mr. Brigham, the Prince George of Cumberland, Albany Street, Regent's Park—I said "Can I see Mr. Brigham?" he said "No, he is out of business, he lives at Camden Grove North, Peckham, but he will be at a friend's house this evening at 7 o'clock, Mr. Aaron's, the George, Houndsditch, and you might see him there"—I said I would be there, and he said he would let Mr. Brigham know—I took notes of the conversation and read them over to Wright—these are the notes. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Charles Coleman lived with Mr. Brigham at the Prince George of Cum<lb></lb>berland eight months and three weeks. Can see Mr. Brigham at the George at Houndsditch. Mr. Brigham left the Prince George, January 31st, 1878. Letters must be addressed to Coleman, 269, Old Kent Road.") The same evening I went to the George public-house, Houndsditch; Mr. Aaron was there—I asked for Mr. Brigham, and Lusby was intro<lb></lb>duced to me as Mr. Brigham—I went up to him and said "Mr. Brigham?" he said "Yes"—I asked him if he was the gentleman who had Kept the Prince George of Cumberland, Albany Street; he said "Yes;" I asked when he left, he said "At the end of January"—I asked if Charles Coleman had lived with him—he said he had—I asked how long—he said "Nine months"—I asked whether he was honest, sober and indus<lb></lb>trious—he said he was, and that he was a first-rate young man; he was only very sorry he was out of business, or he should take him back—be<lb></lb>living this I took Wright into my service; when he came in the evening he asked me whether his references were all right—I said yes, if he was half as good as the reference I had received from Mr. Brigham he would suit me—he was to come to work at 4 o'clock next day, Saturday—he came in the afternoon; Sergeant Smith of the City was there with a warrant, and he was taken into custody on his arrival with his port<lb></lb>manteau—he said nothing about Mr. Beddoe of the Royal George, or of Mr. Newland of the Swan, or the Cock in Old Street.</p>

He was only in my house five minutes, the sergeant took him as soon as he came in—it was on the 29th March that I saw Lusby in Houndsditch—I had never seen him before that I know of—I saw Mr. Aaron and asked for Mr. Brigham, and he said "This is Mr. Brigham"—he did not introduce himself.</p>

I keep the George public-house, No. 104, Houndsditch—on 29th March Lusby came and asked me if a gentlemen had called for the name of Brigham—I said "No"—he said "I expect a gentleman here, I will sit down"—he sat down for a few minutes, got up again, and said "I can't wait," and went out—he came in again in a few minutes and said "Has the gentleman called?"—I said "No"—he said "I will go into the yard; if the gentleman calls tell him I am here;" before he reached the yard the gentleman came in and asked for Mr. Brigham; I</p>

I took Wright into custody on 30th March, at Mr. Gabb's—I told him I had a warrant for his arrest, and that his name was John Wright—he said "My name is not John Wright, it is Charles Coleman"—I then read the warrant to him, Lusby's name was in it—he said he did not know the name of Lusby—he said he had been in the employment of Mr. Brigham, of the Prince George of Cumberland, for about nine months, up to the end of January—I searched his portmanteau, and amongst other things I found a shirt—I said "Here is J. Wright on the collar of this shirt, how do you account for this, you say your name is not John Wright?"—he then said that his mother had been married a second time and he sometimes passed by that name—he gave his address, 55, Camden Grove North, Peckham—about 6 o'clock the same evening I saw Lusby in a street in Clerkenwell—I said "Your name is Lusby; I am a police-officer, and I have a warrant for your arrest"—I put him in a cab and read the warrant to him—he said he did not know the name of John Wright (<hi rend="italic">Wright's name was mentioned in the warrant</hi>), nor did he know the name of Brigham—I said "You have been representing yourself as Mr. Brigham"—he said "I have not, and I know nothing at all about it"—at the station the warrant was read to him again—he denied knowledge of Wright, or that he had represented himself as Mr. Brigham—he was searched and two duplicates found relating to some articles of wearing apparel—he was asked his address, he refused it, he said he had no home—I took Hennessey into custody on the afternoon of 10th April near the Elephant and Castle—I said "Your name is Hennessey, I have a warrant for your arrest for being concerned with others in giving false characters"—he said "My name is not Hennessey, it is Mears"—I put him in a cab and read the warrant to him—he said he knew no one of the name of Wright, nor had he given a false character—at the station he gave the name of Mears.</p>

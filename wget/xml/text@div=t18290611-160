On the 11th of May, a little after three o'clock, I was going to the house, and saw the prisoner come out -I had never seen him before; I am positive it was him, because I looked at him very stedfastly - he had some cloth; he appeared to be in the act of adjusting it on his shoulder - it was in the folds, but was not tied up; I went into the house, and made inquiry; I went after him - I turned the corner of Nassau-street into Union-street, and saw him running along Union-street, with the cloth in his possession; he saw me coming after him, and increased his speed, and turned the corner into Well-street, where I lost sight of him - I soon turned the corner after him, and saw the cloth lying against a shoemaker's door in Well-street; he was then running down Well-street - he turned into Mortimer-street, and I lost sight of him at the moment, but soon regained the view of him, and saw him turn into Titchfield-street; I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Where is Bulmer now? A. He left a fortnight or three weeks after; he was a mercer, and I believe has failed - he had been there two or three months; I cannot say he did not employ the prisoner to carry the cloth.</p>

            . I live in Rebecca-court, Well-street, and keep a shoemaker's shop, at No. 49, Well-street. On the 11th of May, as I was at work, I heard the cry of Stop thief! in Unicorn-street, and saw the prisoner coming along with two rolls of cloth on his shoulder; when he got opposite the shop-door I saw him full in the face - he threw the cloth right in my face and ran down Well-street with his hat in his hand - I took it up, and kept it till he was brought back, which was in about five minutes, by Morrish and the last witness; this is the cloth - I carried it after the prisoner, and laid it on the table of the Sir Isaac Newton public-house, and left it in the care of Wall, the officer.</p>

            . I am a printer, and live in Westmorland-buildings, Aldersgate-street. On the 11th of May I was in Mortimer-street - on crossing Well-street I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running down Well-street; he turned round into Mortimer-street, and into Titchfield-street - a young man laid hold of him, who was in front of him; I came up immediately, and took hold of him on the other side - he asked me to let him go, as he had done nothing; Arthur came up, and asked me to bring him back; and on bringing him back he asked me to beg of the gentleman to let him go as he knew he had done very wrong, he had been brought into it by others - that there were two men with him at the time, and they saw the cloth through the parlour window, and told him if he would go and get it they would give him some money - I took him to the Sir

            . I live in Nassan-street; I keep the house; Mr. Bulmer had lived with me about two months; he called himself a woollen-draper, and said that was his place of business - I have seen cloth in his room, which was the front parlour; I have seen different coloured cloths there - I believe he used to take some out, but I never saw him; I never saw the prisoner before -I never knew that Bulmer frequented the Swan: he left my house a fortnight ago last Friday - he told me he was a married man; I never saw his wife - he left every thing behind him, I believe, except what he had on his back, which was very trifling - I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he owe you any rent? A. I believe one week was due the week before the cloth was taken: I seldom saw him in the day time - the property left behind is not worth 5s,</p>

On the day in question he asked me to get some things from his lodgings, as he was afraid it would be seized for rent; I went with him - he gave me this cloth, and took some himself; he said, "Wait a few minutes till I get to the top of the street, and then follow me:" I heard a cry of Stop thief! and threw it down.</p>

             sworn. - I am brother to Richard Rainsdon; I am clerk to the prosecutors; I pay and receive money: On the 15th of March, the prisoner did a job from Creechurch-lane to the Borough; he had booked it two shillings and two-pence, and he paid me two shillings and two-pence; that was in the evening; he said it was all he received for the job.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you speak from your recollection of the fact, independent of any reference to a book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to find out that it was wrong? - A. My master, in looking over the book, found it was not a satisfactory charge; it was not enough money; he had only three jobs that day; the other two were correct; we always settle with the

             sworn. - I am a constable: I apprehended the prisoner, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This gentleman hired me upon the stand; he said there were a few boxes; I asked him if he wanted any help, and he said, yes; I fetched the goods down two pair of stairs, and I told him I would not take less than three shillings and sixpence; I charged him two shillings and two-pence for the cartage, and one shilling and a pot of beer for my trouble.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Roach.) What did you agree with the prisoner for? - A. For three shillings and sixpence for the hire of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you to pay him a sum for carrying the goods? - A. Yes; when I paid him the three shillings and sixpence, he asked me if I would give<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020066"></xptr>him something to drink, I gave him a pot of beer; he did help me down stairs with some of the goods.</p>
               <p>Rainsdon. They are generally paid something for their trouble; a pot of beer, or sixpence.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.What is the fare from Creechurch-lane to the Borough? - A. For household furniture we charge more; the regular fare is two shillings and nine-pence, but for household furniture we are paid so much an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. If he was paid by time, do you think it would come to three shillings and sixpence? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that that is a fair charge for time? - A. I think it is too much.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing you were to deduct one shilling and four-pence from three shillings and sixpence, would that be a reasonable charge? - A. No; it is not enough.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Barnjam.) What would be a fair charge for carrying these household goods? - A. I think three shillings and sixpence a fair charge.</p>
               <p>Q. According to the distance, or time? - A. According to the distance, and according to the time; household furniture is very different from merchandize, because it takes a great deal more time.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you think it a fair charge? - A. Yes.</p>

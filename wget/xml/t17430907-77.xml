               <p>Millington. Mr Ambler sent to me several Times, to desire me to keep my Servant from coming. I know nothing of the Robbery - Thomas Fox is my Servant.</p>
               <p>Q. to Fox. Is that your Hand?</p>
               <p>Fox. Yes; but I had no more Value for it than nothing; I rented an empty Room of her for three Weeks, in the Time of my Necessity; I rent a House of 24 l. a Year now.</p>
               <p>- Ambler. I arrested the poor Man (Blathet.) and when I had him in Custody he said, If you do not stand my Friend, I shall be ruin'd; says he, Fox owes me five Pounds for which I have a Note of of his Hand. I went with this Note to Fox's House, and told him, if he did not pay it, I must arrest him, says he, If this is the Case, they shall not be long out of Newgate, and in a Day or two the Robbery was sworn against the Woman. Fox owned that he had the Value of the Note at that Time. One Mr Eastwood a Soilicitor, swore her Husband into a Conspiracy, and he was kept in Custody till be could raise a little Money to get himself discharged; the other never followed it. Her Husband was a Butcher in Carnaby Market, in pretty good Circumstances; but the swearing him into that Conspiracy cost him near 100 l.</p>

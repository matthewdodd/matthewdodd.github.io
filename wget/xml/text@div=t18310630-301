               <p>JOHN RODERICK. I am a Policeman. On the morning of the 25th, I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor walking arm-in-arm, near the Orange Tree, New-road - the prosecutor was intoxicated, and the prisoner was leading him; I went round my beat, and saw them again down a gateway, about forty yards from Tottenham-courtroad, and heard the prosecutor say to him, "It is of no use your talking, you have got my watch;" I went and asked if he was robbed - he said Yes, of his watch and money; I called him aside, and asked if he knew the prisoner -I then called the prisoner, and asked if he knew the person he was with; he said Yes, he was a particular acquaintance of his - that they had been drinking and playing at skittles at a public-house in Somers'-town; I asked if he knew he had lost his watch - he said, "Then he must have dropped it, and you had better search in the water under your feet;" I said I should search him for it, and as I put my hand into his coat-pocket my hand met his coming out - I said, "What have you here?" he said,"The case of a watch I picked up;" I found this case in his hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say he had lost his watch directly you came down? A. You did not.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I saw the prisoner and prosecutor together in the New-road; I saw the prosecutor down, and assisted in taking him up - he had dropped his hat and handkerchief; I noticed at that time that he had a chain and seals hanging out of his pocket - a gentleman's servant attempted to brush the dirt off his coat; the prisoner gave him a push, and said,"Let the man's pockets alone;" he said he did not mean to hurt the man's pocket; the prisoner said, "I will take care you shall not."</p>

When I first met the prosecutor he asked if we could get any thing to drink - I said I would go and see - he was knocked down by three men; I took him up, and he then dropped this case - I picked it up; I said he was a friend of mine, because we had been drinking.</p>

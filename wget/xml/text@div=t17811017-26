On the 4th of September, about twelve o'clock or a little after, while I was at dinner, the prisoner came into the shop, and said he wanted to buy some watches. He spoke it very well in English. I got up as quick as I could, and went to the window where the watches were. He said he wanted a good watch for his own pocket. I gave him one out of my pocket. He took it, examined it, laid it down, and asked the price of it. I told him it was five guineas, and I should give him a brief; that was, that I would warrant it. He laid it down, and said it would do, and he wanted half-a-dozen more. I told him I had not half-a-dozen ready, but if he would call in two hours, he should have them. He said, No; he could not call in two hours; he must have them then; he had the money in his pocket to pay for them. Thinking him a customer, I endeavoured to make up the half dozen for him, and sat down to get them ready. While I was getting them ready, I saw him put his hand on the show-glass, and take up something; I did not know what. Then I let him stand about five minutes, to see if he would put his hand in his pocket, that I might be a better judge if he had stolen any thing. I asked him what he had in his hand. He put his hand in his pocket, and said it was his tobacco-box. I told him I was certain he had taken something off the window, and I must see it. He then put his hand in his other pocket, and took his tobacco-box out. I told him that was not what I wanted, that I wanted what was in his other pocket. He then took out this watch-case, and threw it down on the board. He asked me then what I wanted with him, for he had nothing of mine. I sent for an officer. He told the officer I had put the case into his pocket: he said that in very plain English. He was taken into custody, and searched at a public-house in East-Smithfield; and this watch was found tied up in the flap of his shirt, between his legs. Before I took up the watch, I described the marks upon it.</p>

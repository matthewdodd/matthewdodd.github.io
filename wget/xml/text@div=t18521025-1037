                  </hi>. I am a bookbinder, residingin Charles-street, Westmin<lb></lb>ster, not far from the House of Commons. I have known the prisoner fifteen years—I was aware that he had a situation in the House of Commons—I had some dealings with him for waste paper, in 1848—I recollect meeting him just before Christmas, 1850—I learned from him that he had some waste paper to sell—I said I would have it—it was arranged that I was to fetch it with a horse and cart, which I was to take to the House of Parliament—I had purchased once before <hi rend="italic">of</hi> him, and I concluded I was to go there to the temporary entrance—on 24th Dec. my lad and my man went with the cart—I went at that time, and told the prisoner the horse and van were there—I stood against the Committee room door, up in the corridor—I did not see the paper removed—I heard him tell my man to clear the cupboard in the cor<lb></lb>ridor where the paper was—the man carried down the paper, and the boy assisted him—the prisoner was there when they were clearing the cupboard—he was with me standing against the Committee room door, some yards from</p>

               <p>the cupboard—I cannot say whether he was there all the time they were clearing the cupboard, for I went away and left him there—I was there with him perhaps half an hour—he came to my house the same afternoon, about 5 or 6 o'clock—the paper was brought from the cart to a little office and weighed—the prisoner and my man and I were there—while weighing it the prisoner saw a parcel in the scale, he took it out and opened it, and said, "This is better paper, I must have a higher price for this"—we had agreed that 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt. was to be given for the whole quantity, and we agreed for 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt. for the better paper; there was 14 cwt. 3qrs. 10 lbs. of the waste paper, and 3 cwt. 2qrs. 10 lbs. of the better paper—the whole amount was 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I drew a check for 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in mistake, and gave it him—that check was returned, and I gave him a check for the paper—I sold some of the paper that I gave 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the prisoner for, to Mr. Jennings in March last—I do not recollect what quantity I sold him—there was some still remaining in my shop—early in Oct., serjeant Thornton came to my house with Capt. Gossett—they weighed eighty pounds of paper, and took it away—it was part of the paper I bought of the prisoner on 24th Dec.—I think the prisoner called on me the same day, in the evening—he was a great deal excited—he said, "This is a bad job," and he asked me what he should do—I told him he must do the best he could—I told him the police-sergeant and Capt. Gossett had been there and taken the paper—he told me he was going to Mr. Chalmers—I told him he had better not come to my house—he came to me again the next night in a very distressed state, and I requested him to leave.</p>

                  </hi>. I was for many years principal clerk of the House of Commons; I have now retired. I am well acquainted with the prisoner—he was messenger there, I think, fifteen years—there is a certain sort of paper supplied to the House of Commons for the use of the short-hand writers—this is some of it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I know it by the ruling—here is some of a larger size—this is used by the copying clerks—when this was sent to the House of Commons it would he entered to Messrs. Gumey's, but the prisoner would have the care of it—Mr. Pike is clerk of the stationery; but, in bit absence, the prisoner would sign the delivery order, and take charge of the paper—it would not be kept in store any time—it would be kept in Mitchell's room, which adjoins the Committee-office—it would be for the use of Messrs. Gumey's writers, and for the clerks of the Copying-office; but while there, it would be kept in Mitchell's cupboards, but he has complained of want of room—it would not be kept there any time, because he would send word to Messrs. Gumey's office that it was there—I have given directions to the pri<lb></lb>soner to remove papers—there is a great quantity of waste papers, and it is necessary to remove them, to prevent confusion—he came to me on the morning of the 15th—he seemed rather agitated, and in the course of conver<lb></lb>sation it came out that he had sold some waste paper, and he remarked that other persons had done the same—I said he had no cause to make himself uneasy on that account—he had had no express directions to sell it; I hail told him to get rid of it, but I did not tell him what to do with it—there is no express authority to sell waste paper—in fact, there are baskets attached to each desk, in which the clerks put their waste paper, and the prisoner would have to empty them, and take it away—on the morning of 15th Oct. the prisoner called on me, and seemed in a very excited state—he made some efforts to speak, but could not get it out—I asked him the cause of his trouble—he informed me it arose out of the sale of waste paper at the House—I remarked, if he knew it was only waste paper, I did not think he need be under such extreme alarm as he seemed to be—he then told me that the man to whom he sold the paper had come to the House of Commons, and he had given him directions to clear a press, which contained waste paper, and, unfortunately, under the waste paper there was a quantity of ruled paper—he certainly con<lb></lb>veyed to my mind the impression that, having told the man to clear the whole, he did not see that this ruled paper was there—when I heard that there was some ruled paper, I told him that could not come under the description of waste paper, and I desired him to go to Mr. Dyson, my successor, who lives near Slough, and communicate the matter to him—he called on me again on Sunday, the 17th, and I told him that since I saw him I had learned that he had seen the ruled paper at the stationer's, and I said, "Upon discovering that, why did not you immediately withdraw it, and take it back to the House of Commons?"—the words he made use of I do not quite recollect, but the effect of them was that he had not moral courage enough to make known the</p>

               <p>circumstance of the paper to Parkins, the stationer—I do not recollect the words he used; but that it was a painful disclosure, or something that he had not moral courage enough, and I expressed my regret that he had not that courage.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not the duty of the clerk of the stationery to see that no paper of this kind was left in the cupboard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it ought to be kept in store—the prisoner's duty was to take care of what was left; but if the business had been done by the clerk of the stationery there would have been nothing left but waste paper; he had to keep an account of what would have been kept in store as well as what was left—I wish I could come to the conclusion that the prisoner might have thought that this was waste paper by the clerk not taking it away.</p>

Gurney said they were in want of paper, it was always my practice to give an order—when it came in it was received by Mr. Mitchell, but it was never checked, inasmuch as Gumey's knew what I had ordered, and they knew what there was—it was the prisoner's duty to receive it till Gumey's sent for it by their own man—I cannot account for two or three hundred weight of this paper being in that cupboard—I was away at the time—it is my custom to go into the country—it was my duty to summon the members, and various other duties—it would take me half an hour to tell you all my duties—with respect to the stationery, the forms were prepared, and I had to sign them when they were wanted; and I receive some stores, such as sealing wax, and tape, and other things—if Mr. Chalmers wanted things he could have them.</p>

            . On Tuesday the the 22d of November, I was out sliding, it being a frost, I saw a man go into the yard, who was not one of my father's men; I went behind the bricks, and watched him; he took one of the stones just at the corner of Collingwood's factory gates; he came back and fetched the other. He took the smallest into Doughty Mews: I saw a green grocer's boy I knew; I told him to go and inform my father's man. Immediately the prisoner went back to Collingwood's gates, took up the largest stone, and took it into Guildford-street. I saw my father's man coming, I pointed out the prisoner to him, then I went to Hatton Garden office for Mr. Read, the officer, and when I came back with Mr. Read, the prisoner was not there. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COLES. I am servant to Mr. Renshaw. On Tuesday the 2nd of November I was at work in the shop, in my master's yard, a lad came and said Joe is watching a man that has taken some of his father's stones. I went to look after Joe, I saw Joe in Guildford-street; he beckoned to me; I went up to him; he said, Coles, there is a man has got my stones. The prisoner had the biggest of the two stones with him; he put it down in Lamb's Conduit Street, and then he went back for the other one in Doughty Mews. He took the stone on his shoulder again, and then I collared him; he said, do not coller me, I will not run away: in the mean while up came a mob, and hustled me a considerable way down Guildford street. I walked with them into Russel-square to the end of Bedford-place; he said he lived in St. Giles's. I did not chuse to follow him into St. Giles's. I expected to have an officer to assist me. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

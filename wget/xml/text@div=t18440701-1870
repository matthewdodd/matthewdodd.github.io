                  </hi>. I am a drover, and live in Suffolk. On the 17th of June I was in Smithfield market—I had received some sheep from Mr. John Hudson, a salesman—they were marked down the rump with red ochre, and round the nose, and a great E on the off side—I was in company with my cousin, George Young, who works for me—I saw the two prisoners in the market, between twelve and one o'clock—I knew them, they are drovers, and were driving sheep—I asked how many sheep they had got—Richard told me to count them—I did so, and found they had twenty, which was the number they ought to have—I missed my own ewe in about an hour and a half or two hours after—it was one I had received of Mr. Hudson, but Mr. Ede had bought it—I made inquiries, but heard no tidings of it till the Friday following, when I saw Dodd—in consequence of what he said, I went to the prisoners in the market—I asked them about the sheep I had lost—they denied any knowledge of it, and said they wanted two themselves—I asked them twice, and then I gave them into custody—I afterwards went to Mr. Harsants, a butcher, in Hoxton Old Town, with a policeman, and saw my lost sheep—it was then alive—it was taken to the station and identified—I after<lb></lb>wards saw it killed—it was the sheep I had lost—the marks on the skin cor<lb></lb>respond—the skin is here now.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

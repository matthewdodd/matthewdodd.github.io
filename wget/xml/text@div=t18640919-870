                  </hi>. I am a farrier, and reside in Angel-lane, Ham<lb></lb>mersmith—I have known the prisoner and deceased about six months—on Sunday, 28th August, I met the prisoner at 2 o'clock, at the White Horse, Shepherd's-bush, kept by the deceased's sister—I and a niece of the deceased went out and got to the railway-station to come to London—we met the prisoner there—he said, "I am going back home; we might as well go home together;" and we all three got into the same carriage—when we got to Farringdon-street he asked us home to tea, and we went, and remained there three hours—he lived at 9, Cross-street, Hatton-garden—we had ten there, and enjoyed ourselves—during the time we were there, the prisoner and his wife appeared on most excellent terms—we had one pot of ale while we were there, and when we got to the station we were about twenty-five minutes too soon, and we had another pot of ale there amongst the four of us—when the train came up, we shook hands all round—we were all in very good spirits, and the prisoner kissed the young woman I was with, the deceased's niece, and he turned round to me and said, "Don't be jealous, old fellow; you can kiss my old woman," which I did, and we went off by the train—we arrived at Shepherd's-bush about 7 o'clock—we had been in the house twenty minutes or half an hour, when the prisoner came in—I asked him how he had come down there so soon after us—he said, "The old woman has been blowing me up, and I have come down here to get out of the way"—he had had a little drop too much to drink at that time; in feet, he was not sober—we had several drops of rum while he was there—I should think he drank three glasses of rum, one of brandy, and two or three of ale—that was at the White Horse, his sister-in-law's—he left there about half-past 10 to go home by the train.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was that the last you saw of him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he was intoxicated when he went away; I noticed that the deceased coloured up very red at the time of the kissing all round, and I remembered it afterwards, because I heard that she was very jealous of the prisoner—when he came afterwards to the White Horse, he did not say that his wife had been blowing him up for kissing her niece—he did not say what it was for—I have always heard that he was a kind and affectionate husband—I have seen them on pretty happy terms together <hi rend="italic">chafing</hi> and laughing—some<lb></lb>times I have seen them have a few words, but I have always seen him give in—he has made use use of the expression, "My old woman will nave her own way, and I must let her have it."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Cross-street—the deceased and her husband lodged in the same house—I have known them about ten months—when they were sober they lived, I thought, comfortably; when he was drunk they lived very unhappily—on Sunday evening, 28th August, the prisoner came home first; his wife sent for me afterwards—she asked to sleep with.</p>

               <p>me, as she had done several nights before—I did not see the prisoner again till 12 o'clock that night, when I entered the room, the second floor front—I heard his voice on the stairs about 12—he came up to my door, the back room, second floor, and asked if his wile was there—I said she was not—he then pushed the front room door open and went in, and in a very few moments I went in, almost as soon as the prisoner—when I went in the deceased was on the left-hand side of the bed, kneeling on her knees, and her chemise all torn—Mrs. Turn bull was in the room—I went round to where the prisoner and deceased were, and he struck her three blows about the head—he appeared to be very angry; he was swearing very much, using very bad language; he was in the height of passion—I took a clean chemise out of my aunt's drawer in the room, and put it on the deceased—during that time the prisoner sat on a box close to the deceased, and when he gave her a blow she said, "For God's sake, don't kill me"—that was while I was putting the chemise on her he gave her the three blows I have spoken of—they were such blows as a man would give when he was in a passion, just as if he was very cross and angry, and did not mind how hard he hit; they were with his clenched fist—he then got up off the box and kicked her; I only saw one kick with his right foot, in the side, just between the stomach and lungs—I saw the mark afterwards—she never rose up from her knees during the whole time—I said to her, "Are you much hurt?" and she said, "I am very bad"—I said, "Has he hurt you very much?"—she said, "Oh, he has given me my death-blow"—those were the last words the spoke—she leaned down on her side, and I went to her and supported her bead, as well as I could, and she vomited a little blood—the prisoner changed in a moment as soon as he saw the blood, and he helped me to raise her up, he got some water, and bore her up while we bathed her temples—he went for the doctor, and fetched some brandy, which the doctor ordered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The moment he thought he had given his wife some injury he did all that man could do for her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; directly it was done he did all that man could do to bring her back—he appeared very sorry for what he had done—when he came home he did not find her in her own room, but in my aunt's, Mrs. Turnbull's—whenever he was tipsy she always got out of his way, for fear of his knocking her about—he appeared to be very angry at her not being in her own bed—I believe they had had a good many cross words in the evening, not before they went out, but after coming from seeing their friends off; I did not hear anything myself; I was not with them—he was not so kind when he was liquor; that was his fault—they have two children.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon, of 115, Holboro-hill—on the morning of the 29th August I was called to see the deceased—I found her lying on her back almost dead—I observed two or three bruises on the face and arms—I applied remedies—she died soon afterwards—I made a post-mortem examination—I found all the organs of the body healthy ex<lb></lb>cept the upper part of the right lobe of the liver, the left kidney, and the spleen—on the upper and right side of the abdomen there was a slight abrasion of the skin, no bruise—there was a large quantity of effused blood in the abdominal cavity, which proceeded from a rupture of the spleen on its inner side, next to the stomach—there was no external indication of the cause of that rupture—a kick would have a tendency to rupture the spleen—the abrasion was on the opposite side to the rupture—a kick given there would not rupture the spleen; it could not do so—the rupture was the cause of death—I saw nothing about the woman to indicate that she would have died on that night if there had been no violence—violence might accelerate the death by rupturing the spleen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There was no appearance of any other cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—if the spleen had not been ruptured she might have been alive still—the rupture might have proceeded from a blow or kick, or from a fall—the spleen was preternaturally enlarged, and very much diseased; in an ad<lb></lb>vanced state of disease—there are very few cases recorded of a spontaneous rupture of the spleen—I don't think it was in such a state that it would have ruptured from disease in a short time; it was not so diseased as to lead me to form an opinion as to time—it might or might not result in sponta<lb></lb>neous rupture—rupture of the spleen may be produced by violent exertion, such as coughing or vomiting—from the state in which this spleen was I should say it would not be ruptured from a cough—it might have been oc<lb></lb>casioned by a fall, or a sudden twist in getting out of bed.</p>

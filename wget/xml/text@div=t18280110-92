This clock was fastened to the wall in my back parlour; I lost it on the 31st of December - I had seen it that day; I saw the prisoner there about eight o'clock in the evening, and missed the clock about an hour and a half afterwards - I had been writing in a private room; I came out, and met Barnwall at my tap-room door; he gave me information - I went into the parlour; the prisoner was standing in the middle of the room, in an agitated state; the clock was then down - I said, "Where is the clock?" there was nobody in the parlour but him; I found it tied in a handkerchief, behind the parlour door, on a bench - it had been screwed or nailed - I found a quantity of dirt on the floor under where it was fixed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many people were in the tap-room? A. There might be twenty - I did not know the prisoner - I found him standing some distance from the door.</p>

            . I was in the tap-room on this evening, and about half-past nine o'clock I saw, through the glass partition, the two arms of a man taking down the clock - I went and asked Butcher if he had authorised any one to take it down - I could not see who it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear there were two arms? A. Yes; I could not see his face; I told Butcher in about five minutes - several other people saw it - I went into the parlour about two minutes after Butcher; the prisoner was then sitting down, reading the newspaper - I did not see him standing.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Butcher. The prisoner came into the parlour - a lady and gentleman had been there before him; I went into the parlour with master - nobody was there but the prisoner; the lady and gentleman had been gone three-quarters of an hour, and during that time the prisoner was there alone; the handkerchief the clock was tied in does not belong to master; I had been attending to business during this; I saw the clock safe after the lady and gentleman left - I went into the room several times, to look at the fire; the prisoner was sitting, reading the newspaper - when I went in with master, the clock was tied up, and hid behind the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had not left my master three hours before - I went there to look at the paper - a man and woman came in and went away, and in half an hour the landlord came in, and said I had stolen the clock; I said it was impossible, for I had no means of taking it down - I said I had been out for a particular purpose, and when I returned, a man, who had been in the parlour, was going out.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 27.</p>

            . I am a merchant, and live in Aldermanbury. On the 15th of January I saw the prisoner in my counting-house; he produced to me this bill of exchange for 500l. (looking at it,) - I have put my name on it; he said he had brought that bill in payment of two drafts which I had upon him - one, which was for 200l., became due that day, the other was for 209l. 19s., and was due on the 26th of December, and was unpaid; I handed the draft of 500l. to my clerk in Fehrmann's presence - he said he would call the following day, in order to have the discount of the bill adjusted, and to receive a cheque for the balance; he did call on the 16th, and received the difference from my clerk - I was present, but did not adjust it with him; my clerk had the charge of the bill - he kept it some time, and then paid it into my bankers; the balance paid to the prisoner was 84l. odd.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, previous to the 15th of January, had you made any communication to the prisoner on the subject of the bill over due, and the one about to become due on the 15th of January? A. Yes; I am not certain whether I sent my clerk, or whether I wrote to him, but I applied to him for payment of the draft; and on the 15th of January he stated that he was obliged to me for waiting for the payment of the bill till that date. I had not heard or seen him since my application; he had made a reply to it; my own hand-writing is on this 500l. bill - I also know it by its general character; I wrote upon it previous to its being paid into my bankers - I do not think I ever saw it after that morning till the evening it became due; when it was returned to me with the words, "acceptance forged" written on it, which was not on it when I parted with it - the acceptance was on it when I received it, or I should not have taken it - the endorsement by the payee to Fehrmann was also on it; I am not aware of any alteration on it since I received it from him, except the words, "acceptance forged" being on it; and an endorsement purporting to be by Messrs. Lubbock - also my own endorsement which I have struck out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You knew at the time you have been speaking of, that the prisoner was in the employ of Messrs. Ward &amp; Co.? A. Yes; they are merchants of Broad-street; I did not know it of my own knowledge, but was informed so - I made no inquiry as to the bill being genuine, before he called on the 16th; he left it with me on the 15th - I cannot tell the time, but it was previous to my leaving business before dinner; if it was not in the morning, I should think it was early in the afternoon - he called about the middle of the day, on the 16th I think; I had plenty of time to make inquiry about the bill, but did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I presume you speak from the general appearance of the instrument when you say you are not aware of any alteration, except what you have mentioned? A. Yes: I see a number which my clerk added when he entered it; that is, No. 920 - I cannot tell whether these other numbers were on it, or the letter S. in the right hand lower corner.</p>
               <p>Q. I see under the words, "In need with Messrs. Doxat and Co." is, "St. L. &amp; Co.;" are you able to say whether that was on it when you took it? A. No, I did not look at those particulars; I observed, "Doxat and Co." on it - I am not sure whether those words were there or not; I observed the name of Rothschild on the acceptance, and that satisfied me - I should state that the acceptance was not a very legible one; but I have been in the habit of receiving bills on him, and thought the acceptance was similar; I believe the prisoner had told me he was in expectation of an acceptance from the Mauritius, and I think he said, from the Rio de la Plata - he also spoke of a remittance from Germany: I do not know of his having any speculation with Weise and Co. - the two bills I had previously held, were drawn by Weise and Co. on him; I had had other bills drawn by them on him some time ago, and paid by the prisoner - they are hat-manufacturers; I never heard of bills being transmitted from abroad with the endorsement in blank, to be inserted by the correspondent - I do not know whether there is such a firm as Stephen Lurman, Son, and Co., abroad.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Do you know of any such firm as Saint Lurman and Co., or Stephen Lemain and Co.? A. I do not.</p>

            . I am clerk to Sir John Lubbock and Co., bankers, of Mansion-house-street; I presented this bill on the 12th of April to Mr. Clemson, Messrs. Masterman's clearing-clerk, at the clearing-house in Lombard-street; I left it in his possession, and a very few minutes after that, I saw the prisoner at the clearing-house, it was about twelve o'clock; he said, "You have a bill of 500l. accepted at Mastermans, by Mr. Rothschild" - I referred to my book, and said, I had delivered it to Messrs. Masterman's clerk; I saw him go to Masterman's clerk - it is not usual to apply at a clearing-house to take up bills; it is sometimes done, I believe - I never gave up a bill; I have been applied to for them, and refused - the bill was brought to me again in the course of the afternoon; I did not receive it, but the gentleman who brought it to me took it to our house - this was between four and five o'clock; the words, "Acceptance forged" were then written on it - I do not know whether the gentleman who produced it to me, was one of Messrs. Masterman's firm, or a clerk; the same person took it away again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not know that person? A. I did not; he is here - the words, "Acceptance forged," are in large characters - whether anything else has been written on it, I do not know; I received it on the 12th of April, with a number of other bills to take to the clearing-house; I received them from no one - they are laid on the desk by one of the partners, and I take them off when I want them; I only know what hands it had been in from the endorsement - I presume it was kept in our safe while in our hands.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. John Masterman and Co.; there are four other partners I believe; On the 12th of April I was at the clearing-house, and received this bill from Messrs. Lubbock's clerk, to enter in my book to their credit, as it purports to be payable at our house; after I had received it, the prisoner applied to me at the clearing-house - he said he wanted to take up a bill of 500l. of Rothschild's acceptance, which I had received from Lubbocks; I told him I could not give it up without authority from our house, and referred him to them, he then went away; he assigned as his reason that he wanted to send it into the country; his application being rather unusual, induced me to look at the bill, and I did not think the signature of Mr. Rothschild authentic; I never gave up bills on such an application. I made a minute of the bill in my book and took it home; I delivered it to Mr. Daniel Mildred, one of our firm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You say it was rather an unusual application; I gather from that, that you have known such applications made? A. I have; persons, not in the employ of bankers, have access to the clearing-house; there were not so many clerks there at this time as there would have been in the morning; there could be only one from each house at that time, that would be about thirty; I am accustomed to see Mr. Rothschild's acceptance daily; the bill had not been actually cleared when the prisoner applied to me; I had not taken it down in my book - it was returned to Messrs. Lubbock's; we do not consider bills actually cleared till five o'clock; it had been taken down in account.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You do not consider the transaction complete till five o'clock? A. No; after the application was made, I entered the bill in my book, but that was not a final settlement.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. It is usual to take an account of all bills you have on that house? A. Yes, in order to allow them in account, if there are funds to meet them; there is sometimes a difference in Mr. Rothschilds acceptance, some are more legible than others, that is the only difference; I never knew his first names entirely omitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any first names to this? looking at it) A. Here is a mark, purporting to be the initials N. &amp; M. - I will swear that - I have seen acceptances like this - I have been with Messrs. Masterman nearly twelve years, and believe he has kept an account there all that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never know him sign a different name altogether? A. No; I never saw him write; he signs all his bills and cheques himself; except his wife, she signs a great many for him; I cannot speak to her signing acceptances; I never knew an acceptance signed N. De Rothschild, nor have I ever seen acceptances which could not be read, and yet have turned out to be his; I never knew acceptances of his refused as forgeries, which afterwards proved to be genuine - but I do not pay the bills myself, I only take them down; the acceptance in question bears some resemblance to his.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray do you know whether or not Masterman's have received the 500l. for this bill? A. They have received 500l. I understand; I have heard that it was paid in on the same day, but do not know of my own knowledge - I do not keep the book in which discharges are written against bills.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you in the first instance receive this bill as the acceptance of Mr. Rothschild? A. I took it as a bill, as I do all others; I have nothing to do with the acceptance - I take them down in my book, and they are examined at home; my duty is only to take an account of such bills as are sent to me; I should not have looked at the acceptance except from the application made by the prisoner.</p>

            , and am well acquainted with his hand-writing - (looking at the bill) - I believe this acceptance is not his; I am certain the words above the signature are not his, and I do not know the hand-writing; I know Mrs. Rothschild's writing - it is not her's; she does not accept bills for Mr. Rothschild - I am acquainted with Mr. Rothschild's correspondents at Vienna - he has none of the name of Harriet Barnard; I do not myself write to Vienna - I write to other places; Mr. Kerchner writes to Vienna; Mr. Rothschild has no account with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you been in Mr. Rothschild's employ? A. Eight or nine years; he has an immense correspondence in pecuniary matters, and accepts bills for many foreign parties - they circulate very readily both on the continent and in England; I do not know of the prisoner being particularly acquainted with Mr. Rothschild, so as to give him an op<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290028"></xptr>portunity of knowing his mode of hand-writing - I believe he is a German.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you have been with Mr. Rothschild, how many persons have accepted bills for him to your knowledge? A. Mrs. Rothschild in general, and on one occasion, when Mr. Rothschild went to the Continent, he left Mr. B. Cohen and Samuel Cohen, with a power of procuration for him; I think that was the case, but am not certain - they are the only persons I ever knew accept for him: I think he has been to the Continent twice since I have lived with him - he was there last, about three years ago; I believe he once added De to Rothschild - he does now occasionally sign so.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not his hand-writing in acceptances almost illegible? A. Not so to me; at times I can decypher the whole, but not always - he writes very indistinctly.</p>
               <p>Q. There is at times a scratch, and then a letter emerges? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You know his hand-writing, we suppose, whether it is distinct or not - you can tell whether it is the character of his hand-writing? A. I think I can.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Does it not happen that some times one letter is legible, and at another time another; sometimes, for instance, an R, or an o, and no others? A. In general the ths is legible, almost always the oths is legible; I never knew a genuine acceptance of his being returned as forged; I never of my own knowledge knew any acceptance, cheque, or papers, sent from the bankers to inquire whether the signature was his or not, and the answer to be given that it was. I am corresponding clerk - I know nothing of Harriet Barnard.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Should you have had the means of knowing if there had been such a correspondent with the house? A. I think I should.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Rothschild, and have been so about nineteen years; the signature to the acceptance of this bill is not his hand-writing; I do not know whose writing the words "accepted, &amp;c." are - it is not the hand-writing of any clerk in his house, nor is it his writing; I know most of the correspondents of the house - I know no such person as Harriet Barnard, of Vienna, or any where.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You are not the Vienna corresponding clerk? A. I am not, nor a corresponding clerk at all now: bills are sometimes drawn by persons who do not come within the general class of correspondents, but I think I must have some previous knowledge of the transaction, if a person has been authorized to draw a bill; I must have had some knowledge of them first, for those instances must have arisen from letters of credit - I write the letters of credit from this country; Mr. Rothschild has a brother at Vienna; Mr. Rothschild very seldom signs his name De Rothschild now, if he does ever - he may at times in correspondence.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the bill - is that signature N.M. Rothschild? A. Yes, I suppose it is intended for it; I have no doubt it is meant for that - there is something like N or M, I do not know which - it is nothing like De; Mr. Rothschild is not in the habit of accepting with one signature only; this is so indistinct I can hardly tell whether it is N or M; Mrs. Rothschild signs by procuration only.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. And she expresses it to be by procuration, does she? A. Always, my Lord, and she signs cheques by procuration always - she never signs but by procuration.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you ever known a genuine acceptance of Mr. Rothschild's rejected as a forgery? A. Never; I believe a cheque was once doubted, and sent back to be ascertained whether it was correct; Mr. Rothschild has not many correspondents in Vienna - he differs sometimes in signing his acceptances.</p>
               <p>Q. That circumstance arises from the haste in which he has to transact his affairs? A. I think that is the only cause.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Wards; the prisoner was a fellow clerk - I am well acquainted with his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you look at the endorsement on this bill, purporting to be that of Messrs. St. Lurman and Son, in whose hand-writing, to the best of your belief, is that? A. To my belief it is Mr. Fehrmann's hand-writing, the whole of the endorsement except the signature "Pay Mr. J. Fehrmann or order value account, J.F.B.G., Bremen, Jan. 5, 1828;" I cannot say whose hand-writing "St. Lurman and Son" is- I know no hand-writing similar to it; I believe the words"In need with Messrs. Doxat and Co.," on the face of the bill, to be the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is it not customary when a foreign bill comes endorsed in blank, for the person who receives it to write a special direct on to pay it to himself; have you not known it done many times? A. No, I have not; I have seen a good deal of bills - I do not know of such a thing, but should not think it unlikely - I do not know the signature of St. Lurman and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. The writing above it is without disguise, the writing of the prisoner; you have no doubt of recognizing it? A. There is a slight difference from his usual writing; but I believe it to be his - I cannot say what caused the difference; the words, "In need at Doxat and Co." is nothing that binds anybody.</p>

Doxat and Co." on the face of it to be his writing - but the initials I cannot give an opinion on; it is a common practice with parties abroad, to put a not a bene to their bills in order, that if the party to whom it is addressed do not pay it, the party referred to will; that is the object of this "In need, &amp;c.," it might be written by any party interested in the bill - I cannot make out the initials at the end of it?</p>

               <p>Q. From your experience of him, what was your opinion of his character? A.

               <p>Q. Did you known anything against his honesty at all, or was it merely his embarrassments? A. I cannot give any other answers than I have; as far as my means of judging went, I did not place the highest estimate upon his character.</p>

I am a partner in the house of Doxat and Co.; there is no firm of that name except ours - we have no correspondents named St. Lurman and Son, nor Stephen Lurman; there is no name in this bill that had authority to refer to us in case of need - the prisoner had no authority to do so.</p>

            . I am a marshal of the City. I took the prisoner into custody on the 12th of April, at the Terrace, Kentish-town, between five and six o'clock in the evening; I saw him come out of a house on the terrace; I searched him, and received from him a 40l. and two 10l. notes; I searched his house, and got a bunch of keys from Mrs. Fehrmann - he was not present; I had previously heard him acknowledge her as his wife - he had gone into the house with me for two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>MR. COPE also deposed to finding some papers in a wardrobe in the prisoner's house, but they were not given in evidence.</p>
               <p>The bill was here read.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Gentlemen, - Embarrassed and overwhelmed by the perilous situation in which I am placed, and being also a foreigner, wholly ignorant of your laws, and but imperfectly acquainted with your language, I feel myself very incompetent to the task of defending myself with proper effect against this most serious charge, - but relying on your justice and liberality to make allowances for my difficulties, I shall narrate to you a short history of the circumstances which have brought me to my present distressing and degrading situation. My parents, who are highly respectable, placed me out at an early age as a mercantile clerk, and about six years ago I came over to this country, with excellent recommendations, and entered into service with Messrs. - and Co., with whom I staid till their failure: I then went into the house of Mr. Elster, and after living with him two years, with unblemished reputation, I engaged myself to the respectable firm of Messrs. Ward's, with whom I lived up to the moment of this charge; and the beginning of last year married an amiable and respectable young lady: until that period my salary was more than sufficient for my support, and as my wife had a small fortune, which was settled on herself and her offspring, we might have lived comfortably; but having the prospect of a family, I was induced to enter into a mercantile speculation, of sending hats to the Mauritius, which Mr. Weise, the hatter, led me to expect would be a prosperous adventure; I gave him my acceptance, at nine months, which I was given to understand would be the time by which the returns would be made; I afterwards made a shipment to Rio Janeiro; unfortunately, the remittances for the goods did not come to hand in sufficient time to enable me to take up my acceptances, and as Mr. Wright held two acceptances which he was pressing me to pay, I became embarrassed and alarmed, lest I should be involved in law proceedings; my credit injured, and the loss of my situation incurred; in this dilemma I consulted a most respectable individual, on whose advice I placed most implicit reliance, as we had been friends from my boyhood; this friend offered to relieve me from my difficulties, saying he had a bill just transmitted to him from abroad, which had been transmitted from Mr. Rothschild, who had accepted it under circumstances which it was unnecessary for him to tell, or for us to know; the bill had three months to run, and I was welcome to the loan of it; provided I pledged my word to take it up, or provide for it, as Mr. Rothschild, (he said) had accepted it on the promise that it should be provided for by the drawer, or on the drawer's account; my friend also engaged me in the most solemn assurance, that if a question arose about the bill, I was to keep his name a profound secret - these promises I gave, and consider myself bound most sacredly and inviolably to adhere to them, whatever may be the consequence; unfortunately, my friend left England shortly after the transaction, and I have been unable to obtain any explanation from him, or a release from my engagement: but from the knowledge I have of his character, I cannot conceive he would have endangered my liberty, or my life, by placing in my hands a fabricated document. I am led to believe, as the bill appears to be drawn by a female, there may be circumstances of a delicate nature about it, which might be wished to be concealed, and this was my impression at the first moment I received it. So anxious was I to perform my promise, I even endeavoured to take up the bill in the morning, wishing to send it out of the country, as the clerk has stated; but not succeeding - I even went and paid 500l. into the banker's, on Messrs. Rothschild's account. After my hours of business were over, I went home in the stage, as was my custom, to enjoy the society of my dear wife and infant; when I was taken into custody by Mr. Cope, the marshal. I may be permitted here to state, that if I had been conscious of any criminality, I had sufficent warning given me to make my escape; for several minutes before I was taken, I was informed the officers were about my house, inquiring for me, but as I had done nothing dishonest, I went home, and surrendered myself to Mr. Cope and the gentleman who accompanied him. I trust, gentleman, from this simple statement of facts, you will see nothing to justify the present charge; I have always been taught to revere the English law, because it not only protects the innocent, but presumes every one to be innocent till the contrary is proved; would not, however, this excellent maxim be reversed, if by any legal perversion, an innocent individual was supposed to be guilty of fraud, when all the facts prove no such intention existed? and may I not, with humble confidence, refer to the facts in my case, and assert there is nothing to prove I uttered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290030"></xptr>this bill with a fraudulent intention? is not the contrary shown in every stage of the proceedings? if fraud had been intended, was it likely I should have put my name to the bill, or passed it to a gentleman to whom I was well known? or if fraud had been contemplated, should I have shown such anxiety to take up the bill? A fraudulent and guilty man, when he had succeeded in his object, flies from justice with the produce of his fraud; but my anxiety was to repay that which I considered a loan; and so far from attempting flight, when I was told the officers were in search of me, I went and resigned myself to them. As a further proof of my innocence, permit me to say, if I had been dishonestly disposed, I might have procured money without the slightest risk of detection; in the present instance detection was certain; but with the thousands passing through my hands, I might have taken to any amount, without discovery. Gentlemen, I beg to assure you I have never been a gamester or profligate; I have never squandered money in heedless expences - but on the contrary, every one who knows me can prove my habits have been correct and proper, and I have always passed my leisure hours either in the company of sedate friends, or generally in the bosom of my family. My embarrassments arose from what might be supposed to be imprudent speculations; even the morning I was taken to the Mansion-house, Mr. Cope handed me a letter, containing a bill of lading from the Mauritius, for part of the property I had before expected. I will not trouble you with further observations, trusting I have already offered sufficient to prove my innocence; if, however, from the peculiarity of the circumstances under which I became possessed of this bill, I am unable to preserve myself from suspicion, I very confidently hope you will not, on suspicion alone, consign a fellow creature to the grave; by the humane practice of the English law, if a doubt exists, the prisoner is saved, on the principle, that it is far better that nine hundred and ninety-nine guilty persons should escape, than an innocent man suffer; this kind benevolent feeling will, I trust, operate in my case, and by your verdict of not guilty, I shall be restored to the dear connexions I have in society, my aged and beloved parents, my amiable and excellent wife, and my darling infant, all of whose future happiness or misery depends on the result of this trial, and who are now, with trembling anxiety, awaiting your decision. - Gentlemen, my life, and the interests of all those dear to me, are in your hands, and to your kind and feeling hearts we all most humbly resign ourselves.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to MR. COPE. Q. Do you remember the prisoner's examination at the Mansion-house? A. Yes; I delivered him a foreign letter on the Monday, it was brought to me from Messrs. Wards; I delivered it to him by the Lord Mayor's order, and I was to see what it contained, which was a bill of lading.</p>

On the morning of the 12th of April, the prisoner was a passenger to town; and about a quater-past five in the evening I saw Mr. Cope at Kentish-town, he was alone when he first spoke to me, and I afterwards told the prisoner there were three men wanting him - I was returning from Highgate-hill to London; the prisoner was standing at his gate on the terrace as I passed - he walked off the terrace into the road to me, and I told him three persons wanted him; he walked to the back of my coach; whether he beckoned to the parties who wanted him or not, I cannot say - but he stood there till they came up to him; he was about two hundred yards from them when this passed - he stood still till they came up to him.</p>

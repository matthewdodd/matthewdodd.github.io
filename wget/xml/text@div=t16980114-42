The Evidence deposed, that the Prisoner had several times desired one of them to join with him in that wicked Trade, which, through great Importunities, he accepted: That the Prisoner had let him see several Say-pieces, told him he could do it as clean as the Pattern: That he had taken a fit House for that purpose, and that some of the Say pieces were shown to Sarah Smith for her Approbation: That they imploy'd another of the Evidence to put off some of their false Money, and to buy Melting Pots and Files: That Sarah Smith blew the Fire, and shewing some dislike at the Mixture of the Metal, said she would rather have it of a Copper mixture, of which sort she had put off a great quantity in the Country where her Husband coined, and she whitened and finished.

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went into that house to get change for half-a-guinea, on the 6th of November, about twelve o'clock; Mrs. Field was not at home; I stopped about ten minutes till she came in, she said, she could give me change, if I took half-a-crownsworth of halfpence; I said, they were no object, if they were good; I said, suppose, mistress, you give me eight shillings and sixpence, and two shillingsworth of halfpence; I laid the half-guinea down, and counted my money, and I went to the orderly-room, I had just come off a marching party, with a deserter; Mr. Field came down in a great passion to the orderly-room about it, I told him, as soon as I had settled my business with the major, I would go with him, but he took me away to Queen-square Office; I never defrauded any body in my life to my knowledge.</p>

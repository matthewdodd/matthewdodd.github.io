               <p>'' My Lord, I am the unhappy perpetrator of that '' most horrid and unparallel'd crime of which I '' stand charged; and as I have nothing to sue for '' but the mercy of God to my poor soul, I will give '' this honourable court no farther trouble: But as '' a penitent, sensible of my horrid guilt, I earnestly '' beg the prayers of all good christians; that God '' through his infinite mercy, and through the intercession '' of our blessed Saviour and Redeemer Jesus '' Christ, may blot out this stain of shedding innocent '' blood; and as the motives which induced '' me to do the wicked act will not appear here, '' as I do now acknowledge my guilt, in order that '' the publick may be fully satisfied of the same, I '' have delivered under my own hand writing, a '' just and full account of the whole progress of that '' sad and fatal transaction, from the beginning to '' its final and fatal end: To be published by Mrs. '' Walker the publisher, the morning after I am no '' more in this transitory world: In hopes the same '' will be a warning to all others, to avoid the steps '' that led me to it; and God of his infinite mercy '' I hope will have mercy on me.''</p>

I never saw her before in my life; I took hold of her, and said, lay the guinea down, and she would not. I went to get a constable, and this young man went to get one; she made her escape from me, and when we had got a constable, she was taken; I am sure this is the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her you would go for a constable? - A. Yes; she damned me, and said I might go; I went myself to Bow-street, and from there to Clare-market; when I came there I could not get one, I came back and the young man had got one.</p>

               <p>This woman came into our house in the Strand, and called for a pennyworth of beer; she had some ballads; when I asked her for the money, she would not give it me; I called my aunt to know if she wanted to change a guinea; she said she did, and had it; and when I came back again, the prosecutor had hold of her hand; I went for a constable and got one.</p>

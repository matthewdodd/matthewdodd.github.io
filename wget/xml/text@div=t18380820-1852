                  </hi>. I live in Sir William Warren's-square, Wapping. I was coming out of New Gravel-lane on the 15th of July, between six and seven o'clock, and met the prisoner—I had two half-crowns, two shil<lb></lb>lings, and two sixpences—he said, where was I going?—I said, "To a coffee-shop"—he said he had some bread—I said, if he came with me I would give him a half-pint of coffee—I drank mine, and laid my head down and fell asleep-in about ten minutes afterwards I caught his hand coming out of my pocket—my money was gone, and a hole cot in my pocket—I charged him with robbing me when I saw the policeman, in about a quarter of an hour-no other man could have taken my money but him—there was no other man on that side the box—there was a man asleep on the other side—I knew the prisoner a long time before—I had no quarrel with him.</p>

No, you said that you had no money, and I gave you half-a-pint—I heard the money jingle, but whether it fell on the floor or not I do not know—there was no hole in my pocket when I laid down—the prisoner ran out directly, and I ran after him.</p>

He laid his head on the table—the master came in and told him to mind his head did not go through the window, that was no place to go to sleep—he said he had been up all night, and he wanted five minutes' sleep—he laid down and went to sleep again, and I walked out, and did not see him till a quarter of an hour afterwards, when I was going up the Highway, and the officer took me.</p>

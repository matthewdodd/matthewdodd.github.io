            ; I received the malt from the prisoner; there were thirty-three sacks and a broken one; four bushels in a sack; I measured three sacks that I suspected; it ought to have been contained in thirty-two sacks; they had been apparently untied, one had a hay-band round it; I found a bushel deficient from the three sacks; the other sack was on the ladder, under the tilt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the place in which it would have been in the regular course of delivery? - A. No; we would not suffer the prisoner to unload the cart, another man did it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You do not know what was put into the sacks? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. One of them had a hay-band round it? - A. Yes; he said the sack had sell out of the cart and burst; there was a little hole in one corner.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a whole bushel found in the sack? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that brought to the place where he was to have delivered it? - A. Yes.</p>

             Sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am servant to Mr. Bell, at Stamford-hill: We loaded three hundred and twenty quarters of malt for Messrs. Hanbury; there were sixteen quarters in thirty-two sacks, in the cart that the prisoner drove; the sacks were tied with a bit of rope; we tie them with any thing we can get at times. Q. Was there any one on those sacks tied with a hay-band? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any extra sack in the cart? - A. No, unless he had any over his horses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. They do sometimes slip in the tying, do they not? - A. Very often; it was to go to Messrs. Hanbury's, Brick-lane, Spitalfields, about four miles from Stamford-hill; it is very common for the cords to slip, and a bushel or two to run out into the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it ever happen that a man should be so wicked, in that case, as to put it into another sack and place it under the the tilt of the waggon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. The same sack out of which it came would have held it again? - A. It would if they had taken pains to put it in.</p>
               <p>WM. PAGE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a maltster, at Ware: I was coming to town from Ware; I saw the prisoner standing on the cart, moving the sacks; I did not see him take any malt out of the sacks, but he was moving them; I informed the brewer of it; it appeared to me that he was taking malt out of the sacks; I saw the malt taken from under the tilt; it was lying upon the front ladder, with a little hay over it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Had you the curiosity to see if any of the sacks were bulged? - A. No. For the Prisoner.</p>

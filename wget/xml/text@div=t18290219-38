            . I am a watchman. About half-past four o'clock in the morning of the 29th of January, I was at the bottom of West-street, Mile-end, Old-town -I saw the two prisoners going up the street - they bid me good morning; I went to my box, and stopped till five o'clock - I then went round my beat, and was returning to my box, when I saw them with something; I darkened my lantern, and saw Daniels with a stove on his shoulder, and the other with a copper - as soon as they saw my light, they threw them down, and ran off; I sprung my rattle, and pursued down Dog-row, and I lost sight of them - I met another watchman, and told him to follow them; I returned, and took the property - the watchman came and said he had lost them; I then went and found the shutters off at an empty house, and these things had been taken from it: I cannot be positive as to the prisoners, but I speak from their height, appearance, and dress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had never seen Mundon before? A. No; he is not an uncommon height - their backs were towards me after the first time; at Bethnal-green watch-house they had the same clothes on - Mundon's coat was black with soot, but I did not see it.</p>

            . I am a labourer to Mr. Dodd. About five o'clock that morning, I was feeding the cows, and heard these things fall down; I got on a wall, and saw a man run very fast - I got over, and ran after him into Northampton-street: he got into a field - I lost sight of him, and I did not go any further: Daniels, Mundon, and another person were taken to the watch-house - I was fetched, and I picked out Daniels; I had not seen his face, but his clothes and his stature were the same, and his shoes had the same sort of mire and dirt on them as the ground we ran over: I believe Daniels was the man, by his dress and his stature, and the dirt on his shoes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How happens it that three men were taken? A. They were all in company.</p>

            . I am a watchman. My beat is at the bottom of the Black Dog: I was standing by a post, about twenty minutes before six o'clock, and the two prisoners came into the house - they were in a flurried state; I followed them, and saw Mundon's coat was black from shoulder to shoulder - I knew him, and asked him if he had been sweeping chimneis; he said No, it was grease - I went close to him, put my hand on his shoulder, and I found the black came off on my fingers; they went into the taproom - Mundon took off his coat, and exchanged it with another lad; I went to the watch-house, and stated what I had seen - our inspector pressed me and another to go down to the Black Dog; we went down, and saw but two persons, but on looking round, we saw Mundon concealed under the table - he said he had broken a button off his clothes, and was stooping to pick it up; I went to Mr. Christian, and we went to the place the property was taken from: Thompson swore to the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he had not seen their faces? A. Yes; I saw these men at the Black Dog, and then went to the watch-house; I had not left them in custody - I think I was not half an hour gone.</p>

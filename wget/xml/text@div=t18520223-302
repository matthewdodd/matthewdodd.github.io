On 3rd Feb., between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came for a half-quartern loaf—she gave me a shilling; I was trying it with my teeth, to see if it was good—while I was trying it a woman came in and said, "Try that shilling well; I have followed this woman up the Highway, she is passing bad money"—that woman took the shilling out of my hand, and gave it to my mother—this is the shilling, the marks of my teeth are on it.</p>

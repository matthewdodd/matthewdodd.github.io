                  </hi>. I am in the service of Walter Robins, of Lisson-street, Lisson-grove. The prisoner was our journeyman for six or seven months—he came from the country—I saw him behind the counter, near the till, putting the bread in the window—I afterwards went to the till, and missed half-a-crown, which I had seen there about five minutes before—I said either him or the other baker had taken half-a-crown out of the till—he said he did not—I called to the young man, and asked him about it, but the prisoner called out to him, "Hold your tongue," and then the other did not speak—at last the prisoner gave me the half-crown out of his watch-pocket, and said, "Here is the half-crown"—I told my mistress.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 3rd of December I was called to take the prisoner—I asked if he knew what he was taken for—he said, "No"—I said it was for stealing half-a-crown from his master's till—he said he knew nothing about it, but at the station he said he gave it back again to the boy after taking it—at the office the Magistrate asked how he came to take it, he said he had but 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week, that his master gave him warning, and he took it to pay his travelling expenses.</p>

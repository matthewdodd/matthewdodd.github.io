            . I am a glass-cutter. I was at my own door, in Birdcage-walk, Hackney-road; I heard a cry of Stop thief! and went round the corner - I saw several persons collected; I went up, and among them I saw the prisoner, who was accused of robbing a gentleman- he denied it, but the gentleman came up, and he was asked if he knew the prisoner - he said he could not say it was him; no one attempted to take the prisoner, and the people began to disperse, but the prisoner did not go from the spot; in a short time, I saw him stoop, and pick up something; I heard, what I thought were the seals of a watch rattle against the case; I asked what he had got - he made me a saucy answer, and ran away - I pursued, and cried Stop thief! he got into a field, and I saw others pursuing him - I stopped till he was brought back; I asked him where the watch was - he said "I have no watch - you may search me;" I was quite positive he had had it- I said "If you were to search you might find it," and about four or five yards from the path along which he ran, the watch was found without a case; I returned to the spot where I first saw him stoop, and there we found the case.</p>

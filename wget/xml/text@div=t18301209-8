            . I am a Policeman. I was sent for about two o'clock in the morning, and the prisoner was brought up to me, charged with robbing the porsecutor, who found the three 5l. notes in the bed, in my presence - he denied having any money about him, but at the station-house, in the lining of his jacket, I found three sovereigns and a sixpence; he had said he had no money, either of his own, or any body elses.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Registrar of Marriages for the district of Islington—I produce a notice signed by the prisoner in my presence and attested by me—I received the information from the prisoner, who said that the marriage was to be solemnized by license. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st April, giving notice to the Registrar that a marriage was intended to be held by license within three months, between the defendant, W. S. Midwinter, bachelor, aged twenty-six, and Laura Tomlin, spinster, of 5, Campbell Terrace, aged seventeen years; and it stated:</hi>" I hereby solemnly declare that I believe there is no impediment or hindrance of kindred or alliance or other lawful hindrance to the said marriage; and I further declare that the consent of Emma Tomlin, whose consent to this marriage is required by law, has been duly given and obtained thereto.") I posted that notice to the Superintendent Registrar, and on that a license to marry would issue—this is the license (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—an appointment was made for the 23rd—I went to the Superintendent Registrar's office, and the defendant did not attend, but he came to my office that day and explained that the lady was ill, and the wedding could not take place—he asked me how long the notice would run; I told him three months, and he went away—I saw him again on 23rd July, when he gave me a fresh notice, which was filled up by my deputy in my presence, and the prisoner read it over and signed it, and said that he wished the marriage to take place two days afterwards, on the 25th—I sent off to the Superintendent Registrar, and was there on the 25th; the young lady was there, and the marriage was solemnised by me—this is the register (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—it is the original entry of the marriage, filled up by me, and signed by the defendant. (<hi rend="italic">This certified the marriage of the prisoner and Laura Tomlin, on 25th July</hi>, 1872, <hi rend="italic">and was signed by the parties in the presence of Catherine Hicks and Jane Goodwin.</hi>) Catherine Hicks is the daughter of the Registrar, and Jane Goodwin is his servant—they brought no witnesses with them—it is signed by me and by the Superintendent—a printed caution relating to marriages is hung up in the office—I saw the prisoner write on three occasions—these two letters, dated 7th August and 28th September, 1873, are in his writing.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw that the young lady was under age—the prisoner gave me the name of her guardian for me to fill in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a law stationer of 102, Chancery Lane—I knew the late William Tomlin and his two daughters, Mrs. Bennett and the young lady Laura—his second wife was Emma Tomlin—he died July, 1866 and left a will by which I am one of the trustees—after his death there was a suit in Chancery to administer the estate—I was one of the plaintiffs, but it was a suit for other purposes—the proceedings were commenced by bill—I produce the probate which says "I appoint my dear wife Emma Tomlin to be guardian of my daughter Laura Tomlin"—the estate is a large one, Laura has from 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year and Mrs. Tomlin as her guardian had charge of her and had 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for her maintenance as arranged by our<lb></lb>selves and supplemented by this order of the Court of Chancery (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she used to go to school—I first heard of her marriage early last October—her sister's husband Mr. Bennett is one of the parties to the suit—I was not at all aware until I heard of this marriage that any such marriage was contemplated—Laura had I believe bad health—when the marriage was discovered it was communicated to the Court of Chancery.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you discussed the matter with her by correspondence from time to time you are not the one to divide two fond hearts; you would eventually have consented to the matter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I consider Mr. Midwinter quite equal to the lady he has married—I think Mrs. Bennett would have liked her sister to have waited a little longer; she does not like it—I do not know exactly that the prisoner has 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year of his own from his mother.</p>

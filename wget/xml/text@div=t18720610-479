                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 456). On the night of 2nd May, in consequence of information, I went to the granaries of Messrs. Muggeridge, in Thames Street, with three other constables—I posted them round the granaries, one in Thames Street, one in St. Andrew's Hill, and the other I was in the act of posting in the rear of the premises in Queen Victoria Street, when I saw the prisoner jump down from the roof of the counting house on to a piece of waste ground at the rear, which lies between Queen Victoria Street and the rear of Messrs. Muggeridge's granaries—he was within nine or ten yards of me—I got a distinct view of him—he ran up Queen Victoria Street, and I pursued him—he jumped over the railings on to the piece of waste ground, and across that into Upper Thames Street, over some railings again—he ran down Thames Street in the direction of Paul's Wharf—I followed him, crying "Stop thief!"—I saw him stopped by an officer named Snellgrove—I took him to the station, and charged him with break<lb></lb>ing and entering the granaries—I afterwards went back and examined the warehouse; I found an entry had been effected by climbing up an old disused crane, and breaking a window on the second floor, and opening it—he could then come down and open the doors that were used for loading the grain out—I examined the counting-house where I saw the prisoner come out, and found two high office chairs placed one on top of the other, so as to be used as a ladder; immediately over those chairs was a large pane of glass broken, and the wire guard of the glass bent upwards—it was the sky light of the counting-house which was broken—I received some crow bars from Sergeant Heath—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I followed him all the way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should say it is about 100 yards from Messrs. Mugger<lb></lb>idge's to where the prisoner was stopped, but I have not measured it; it might be 150 yards—I will swear it was not 300—I won't swear, because I have not measured it—I had three constables with me at the granaries—the others did not chase the man—they did not see him jump off the granaries or the counting-house—I posted them in three different places—none of them are here—I saw the prisoner jump over the railings into Queen Victoria Street—the man that I was posting in Queen Victoria Street, was with me then—he is not here—in jumping over the railings he hurt his ancle, and was</p>

               <p>not able to follow—he and I were joining in the chase—it was about 10.30 at night—there are lamps outside the enclosure of waste ground; there were no lamps there except the lamps which were in the street—the police<lb></lb>man hurt his ancle at the first railing—I afterwards took a gentleman, Mr. Ingram, who lives opposite Messrs. Muggeridge's, to see the prisoner, but he could not identify him—he gave evidence at the Police Court—I heard him state that he was watching three men for some time—he said he could not iden<lb></lb>tify them—he only saw this one man—he followed us to the station—the pri<lb></lb>soner was then in the dock for the purpose of being charged by me—I asked Mr. Ingram if that was the man he saw go in, and he said he did not know; he should not like to say.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 455). I was on duty in Upper Thames Street about 10.30, close by St. Paul's Wharf—I heard cries of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running—I stopped him—he said "Not me, I am running after him"—he was running from Messrs. Mug<lb></lb>geridge's towards me—I said "We shall see"—Taylor came up as soon as I got hold of the man, and we took him to the station.</p>

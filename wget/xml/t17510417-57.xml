               <p>Bridger. I am not positive which did; then they went to knocking down.</p>

               <p>Bridger. My son dodg'd round, but never left me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do to Levet?</p>
               <p>Bridger. I had business enough to guard the blows off, I had not time to observe.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear the pistol go off?</p>
               <p>Bridger. It was after I was down.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was it that was beating Levet?</p>
               <p>Bridger. I am not certain who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the first pistol went off, that the second went off?</p>
               <p>Bridger. In about two minutes after.</p>
               <p>Q. Who shot that off?</p>
               <p>Bridger. I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there in the whole?</p>
               <p>Bridger. There were five. After they were gone my son came to me, to contrive how he should get me home; he propos'd to fetch a horse, I said, I could not ride; he got help and led me home.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the person to you who fir'd off the first pistol?</p>
               <p>Bridger. He was within about five or six yards of me and my son too.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the pistol go off after all this beating?</p>
               <p>Bridger. I lay on one side when they were beating me.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you, in this miserable condition, be able to look about you, so as to see and hear what pass'd between your son and other people?</p>
               <p>Bridger. I was all the time in my senses, as I am now.</p>
               <p>Coun. Then the first use of your senses would have been self preservation, to endeavour to shelter yourself?</p>
               <p>Bridger. They beat my body more than they did my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you endeavour to croud your head under your body, or your face to the ground?</p>
               <p>Bridger. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the pistol go off very loud?</p>
               <p>Bridger. Yes, a great bang.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it loaded?</p>
               <p>Bridger. I cannot say it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was search made the day after to see if any bullet could be found, or appearance of shot, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Bridger. I never heard any such search was made.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your son hurt?</p>

               <p>Bridger. He had a good many wounds on his head; he was put to bed to me that night, and the next day he was removed home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any of your neighbours soon after, who it was that had done you this hurt?</p>

               <p>Bridger. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the three prisoners live with their father, and follow their own business from the 28th of October to the time they were taken up?</p>
               <p>Bridger. As far as I know they did. But how could I tell, when I was not out of my bed?</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not order your son to go and complain to a Justice of peace?</p>
               <p>Bridger. I order'd it a safer way, to have them secur'd, by sending to Mr. Legg.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you many blows before you was knock'd down?</p>
               <p>Bridger. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your scull fractur'd, do you imagin, before you was knock'd down?</p>
               <p>Bridger. No, I believe that was after I was down ; I did not know my scull was broke till after they had left me; I felt the cold draw into my head, then I put my hand up and felt the sharp edge of my scull.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you many blows given you after you were down?</p>
               <p>Bridger. Yes, sir, several.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your going onwards, the way home with Levet, accidental?</p>
               <p>Bridger. It was not a set design'd thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the second pistol that was fir'd</p>
               <p>Bridger. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you know it was a pistol?</p>
               <p>Bridger. I believe it was, for they had no guns.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of sticks were they that they had?</p>
               <p>Bridger. They were about six or seven feet long.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the person that sat up with you the first night, that you had been shot at?</p>
               <p>Bridger. I don't remember I did. I told it within a day or two after I got home.

            . I was called up on the 29th of October in the morning to go to Bridger's house, I found him in bed with six wounds on his head in different parts, with a large contusion on his right shoulder and both arms, and a rib or two broken, he was greatly bruised from his shoulders down both arms, and down the greatest part of his body, particularly the right side of the body. I bound him up and put on a proper defensative plaister, he was so shiftless he could not assist himself at that time, being a heavy man: on the 31st of October I called in Mr. Leech to my assistance, the Sunday following we discovered two fractures on his head, extending in length some inches, we extracted some pieces of the skull, the wounds were very large, we looked upon his life to be in great danger, the last time I dressed him was on the fifth of February.</p>
               <p>Mr. Leech. I happened to be then in town on business of my own, so I am not very positive, but I think it was the 31st of October, I was sent for to Mr. Bridger's, I found him with six large wounds very near as long as my finger on his head, three or four of them were open, two of them were sewed up, the surgeon endeavouring to get the poor man well as soon as possible; I was tearful the skull was fractured, and advised the gentleman to cut them open, we took out more than 20 pieces of the skull, we had a quantity of matter came very freely from under the skull for some weeks, a spoonful may be each time of dressing, it worked out thus; by keeping a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175104170030"></xptr> hollow thing like a shell over the wound, to keep our medicines from pressing upon the brain, so it discharged without opening the skull more; we had great success, the skull was broken in different parts, from the very forehead to the back part of the head; one side of his skull now lies the thickness of a half crown above the other, it lies upon it; as to his body he had a very violent contusion on his shoulder, but particularly his right arm and his body near the hip, he was all in a continued spot of black on his shoulders arms and body, I did not examine the ribs; when they are broke there is seldom any thing more done to them than putting a bandage upon them: Mr. Harssey told me there was a rib or more broken; we attended afterwards together the whole time, wh was about two months.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think a person beat in this manner, affected as he must be, could be capable of recling on one side, and observing what passed at a distance between other people?</p>
               <p>Leech. Had the skull been broke first I don't apprehend he could ; I asked him, how he found himself during the action? he said he found himself down, and they were thumping him blow after blow, till at length he gave up.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible for a person whose skull is fractured to have his understanding to give such a particular account as he has?</p>
               <p>Leech. I have known persons that have had a fractured skull, and the symptoms have not appeared till near ten days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his back bruised much?</p>
               <p>Leech. I believe great numbers of strokes were given on his back, his back was not stripes, but one continued black, and it was much more on one side than the other ; it is probable he did not lie on his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side was bruised most?</p>
               <p>Leech. The right side was worst.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he as to his understanding?</p>
               <p>Leech. The man always answered pretty reasonable, but we would not suffer people to talk much to him.</p>

               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>Hearsay. He bears the character that he would ruin all his neighbours if it was in his power All the days of his life he has been of a malicious dispositson.</p>

             these eight years, I am keeper of that park, he has been employed in it as an under keeper a little more than half a year, I never knew any harm of him in my life, I believe he would not wilfully forswear himself, and for all that I have heard of him he is an honest man.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he not reported to be a troublesome and a malicious man in the whole neighbourhood?</p>
               <p>Levet. I know his neighbours don't love him.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that owing to?</p>
               <p>Levet. Because he has shot some dogs lately in the forest, that got among the deer and rabbets, they had used to like him well enough before that.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it, or is it not his duty so to do?</p>
               <p>Levet. It is his duty to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know he was reputed a dishonest man before a twelve month ago?</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. The prisoner keeps the Hoop public-house at Kensington Gravel-pits—he has got a skittle-alley. On the 7th of March, about half-past nine o'clock, I was in the skittle-alley, playing—the prisoner came to put out the lights—I said,"Don't put out the light, master, till we have finished the game"—he put them out, and lighted them again—I was playing for a pot of beer—when we had finished the game, he said we might go into the tap-room and have the beer—we all went out of the ground but four, leaving him and the pot<lb></lb>boy there—I went into the tap-room—while we staid there some time the pot-boy came, and said, "You had better go down into the ground if you want any beer, for master has ordered me to take it down the skittle-ground"—we went down to the door of the skittle-ground—the prisoner saw us coming, and shut the door, saying, "I will have none of you <hi rend="italic">riff-raff</hi> set in here"—I told him I did not want to go into the ground, I only wanted a drop of the beer we had been playing for—one of the young men drank out of the pot, and ordered the landlord to give it to me, for it belonged to me, for I had won it—I then stood outside the door—the young man who I had won it of remained in the ground—he then gave me the beer, and I took the pot into the tap-room—the prisoner followed me, and said, "Now, you b—y <hi rend="italic">riff-raff</hi> set, get out of my house, for I will have none of you here"—I told him I would go as soon as the beer was drank, and not before—he said if I did not go, he would fetch somebody to put me where I had been before (<hi rend="italic">I have been in jail for getting tipsy, and several times in the station-house, but never for any thing but drunkenness</hi>) the prisoner went out, and returned in about ten minutes, with a large stick in his hand—he walked up to me, and struck me a violent blow on the head—I had a round cloth cap on my head—the blow knocked me down, stud<lb></lb>ned me, and when I came to myself, I saw him standing over me (<hi rend="italic">the blow cut my head—it bled for about an hour and a half—this is the mark which I have now</hi>) the prisoner was standing over me with the stick in his right hand, holding it up, going to hit me again, but a young man, named John Lamborn, laid hold of him—the prisoner was standing over me, threatening that he would cut my b—y brains and eyes out, or any b—I that took my part—Lamborn came in and laid hold of him—I ran out, fearing he would strike me again—I heard Lamborn say, "pray don't hit him any more"—two young men took me to Mr. Wright, a doctor—I was nearly a fortnight under his care—I feel well now—I have not much pain from it, only at times.</p>

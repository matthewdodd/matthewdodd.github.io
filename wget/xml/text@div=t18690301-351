                  </hi>. I am a veneer merchant in business with Mr. Wilkinson, at No. 1A, Rathbone Place—on 7th February, about 2 in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my place with a horse and trap—he said he wanted some veneers—I showed him some—I asked what he was?—he said he was a pianoforte manufacturer, and wanted the goods for that purpose, and gave me his address, 183, Queen's Road, Dakton—I asked if he had a factory there—he said, "Yes, behind the house, it is a manufactory, where I have sixteen or eighteen men employed, and the trade is rather looking up"—he said he had been in business there about six or seven years—we had got about 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods in the place—I took him to the warehouse first and showed him, he said he would have some, and asked how much they would cost—he took at first to the amount of about 56<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., afterwards he said that was too much, and said he would take 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—we then had some con<lb></lb>versation as to the terms upon which I did business—I told him 5 per<lb></lb>cent cash—he produced a bill for 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he said he had had from</p>

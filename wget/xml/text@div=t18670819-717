                  </hi> I live in Church Street, Epsom, and am a coach<lb></lb>man in the employ of Robert Carter, Esq., a Magistrate for Surrey—I first became acquainted with the prisoner about sixteen months ago—I received this letter from him—after receiving it I consented to his mar<lb></lb>riage with my daughter; I made inquiries first—I was not present at the marriage—after the marriage they resided at Dartford—before the mar<lb></lb>riage I spoke to the prisoner about his friends; he said they were living in the north, but he would not give me the address of his father—on 28th June, after making inquiries, I went to Dartford and saw the prisoner—I accused him of having another wife living in Yorkshire, and a child—he said first of all he had not, he afterwards confessed that he had a wife and child in Yorshire, but it was not a legal marriage; that was after I told him I had letters in my pocket—at the time he applied to me for ray consent he did not tell me that he had ever been married before—after admitting that he had a wife he child, I gave him the opportunity of going away, if he liked, with his tools, and I would pay his fare to France, as I did not want the affair made public—at first he said he would go, and said it was very kind of us to allow him; he afterwards refused, and I then gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>Court. Look on the Prisoner, are you sure he is the man?</p>
               <p>Lane. I know him very well, my Lord; he rode up to me on the right hand side, offered a pistol to me, and demanded my money, or I was a dead man; and that I might be certain what he did say, I asked him, and said, What did you say; he repeated the same words again, and said, Deliver your money, or you are a dead man, or words to the same purpose: I do not justly know, whether he said he would blow my brains out, for I was a little surprised: then I rode from him down the town, and called out a highwayman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he meet you or overtake you?</p>
               <p>Lane. He overtook me. As I was telling my story to some journeymen carpenters on this side of Bow Bridge, and describing the horse, I saw a man come riding down the town; he walked his horse, and was whistling: I imagined it to be him, and it was him. He came up; I let him go a few yards past me, and then challenged him, and said, You are the villain that just now offered to rob me by the church: he made answer, I am just come from the Bell in Warwick Lane; I said, Come from where you will, I am sure you are the man; he said, that cannot be, for you were describing him to be upon a black horse, and I am upon a bay horse, (but it was a dark chesnut horse, I thought it had been a black horse.) I was describing the horse to the men, and he overheard me; this was not above five minutes after his first attacking me. I said, I am very positive you are the man; he said, will you swear that; I said, yes, I will; with that he set spurs to his horse and rode very hard down towards Essex; I rode after him, and pursued him, and he got into the marshes, then some other people rode after him, and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Are you sure it was a chesnut horse?</p>
               <p>Lane. I believe it was, but I am very sure you are the man.</p>

            . I live by Bow Bridge in the Parish of Westham: on the 8th of December between seven and eight in the morning, Mr. Isaac Lane came riding up to my door, and asked me, if I saw a highwayman; I said, I did not see any: says Mr. Lane, then he is turned down some of these ways. I looked down, but could not see any body: as I was going into the marshes, I was told there was a man rode into the marshes: there is on osier ground, and I saw a place where a horse had leaped over. I tracked the prints of a horse's feet about 20 yards into the osier-ground, and suspected that the highwayman was there. I called more people to my assistance, and we went up all on a-breast and took him in the osier ground; another person laid hold of him first, but before he was laid hold of he opened his great coat, and said, he had no fire arms: we searched him, but could not find any about him.</p>

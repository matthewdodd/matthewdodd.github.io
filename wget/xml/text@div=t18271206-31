            , and live in Church-street, Soho. The prisoner and Barrett, the deceased, lived together at No. 5, Baldwin's-gardens, Gray's Inn-lane - Barrett came to my house on the 31st of October, about four o'clock in the afternoon; she had been drinking, but was not intoxicated; she had complained of a violent pain in her left side, for six weeks before; she appeared quite collected, and as usual in health, except the pain in her side; she continued at my house from the 31st of October, till the 9th of November, when she died; she was confined to her bed from the 2d of November - I had medical advice for her; the prisoner came to the house, on the morning after she came, about half-past eight o'clock; she was then in bed; he asked how she was, and seemed very anxious for her to go home; she told him she could not think of going home, because she had no one to attend on her; he wished her to have a nurse, or somebody; she said it was of no use her going home, unless she had money to go with; he said he could not get money till Saturday night; he left, and came every meal-time afterwards - I got Mr. Wade, the doctor, on Friday, the 2d of November; he attended her till her death - I had seen her the day before she came to me, she then complained of a pain in her side, and of the cramp - I had seen quarrels between them for many years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. She complained for six weeks of a violent pain in her side? A. Yes; when she came to my house, she smelled of liquor. and her lips were much darkened from drink; she had been drinking spirits; the prisoner paid her every attention he possibly could, and seemed much distressed about her; he is a working man.</p>

On Tuesday night, the 30th of October, between eight and nine o'clock, she came to my room door, and borrowed 1/2d. to buy a candle; she went up stairs, and I heard a man's footsteps go up after her, which I presumed to be the prisoner's; there is a floor between their room and mine - I heard a female voice scream Murder! several times; the last noise was faint, as if the person got weaker - I called to the prisoner not to murder his wife; he answered, "Mind your own business, mistress" - I saw him, and spoke to him, as he went down stairs, and went out of the house; he said, "Mind your own business" - I went up to her room; there was nobody in the house then but her and me - I found her lying on the floor, at the foot of the bed, in a dead faint; her clothes were all undone, and her cap off - I got some vinegar and water, and bathed her face, then fetched some brandy, forced her mouth open, and gave her a little with a tea-spoon - she then revived; I assisted her down to my room, and dressed her; she showed me her marks next day: her face and stomach were violently swollen, and there were black marks on her things and legs; she staid in my room about a quarter of an hour that night, and then went to a friend's house; she returned next morning for a few things, and went away directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know where her friend lives? A. In Church-street, Soho; it is a good distance - I only assisted her to the street door - I never quarrelled with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not frequently remonstrated with her for drinking with you? A. Never - I never drank with her in my life; and never spoke to him above twice in my life.</p>

            . I live in Baldwin's-gardens, in the top attic of the next house to the prisoner, and could hear what passed in his room - I only knew Barrett by sight. On the 30th of October, I was at home very poorly in bed. I knew her voice, and between eight and nine o'clock I heard her cry Murder! and Oh! I heard her open the window and call Murder! she called Mr. Bigmore twice - the second time her voice was faint. I heard the window shut with force, and she fell. I heard the prisoner say he could not go to work without his wash-brush, and say, with an oath, that he would murder her - this was after the window shut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know this woman? A. I had known her five months. I never saw her in liquor but once, and that was on a Sunday afternoon.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Gerrard-street. I was called in to attend the deceased on the 2d of November, at No. 35, Church-street, Soho - I found her in bed; she complained of a difficulty of breathing, and a pain in her chest - that she had fallen down in a fit, and hurt her left side against a chair or table. I found she had broken a left rib; the skin over the fracture was discoloured; she was then suffering from inflammation of the lungs, which, in spite of the usual means, terminated fatally on the 9th of November - I saw her daily. I examined her body two days after her death; there were two or three bruises on both her legs - the rib was broken in the most favourable manner possible; there were no external appearances to account for her death. I opened the body; the lung on the injured side was very little inflamed, only one rib fractured; there were no appearances on that side to lead me to account for her death, but the right lung was very acutely inflamed; there was no disease on the chest;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060025"></xptr>the liver and the lining membrane of the stomach, had evidently been suffering from a low degree of inflammation a considerable time - it might have been going on for months, and that of the right lung for a considerable time - these are the appearances we generally find in dram drinkers. I ascribe her death to the inflammation of the right lung; the fracture, in my judgment, had nothing to do with it.</p>

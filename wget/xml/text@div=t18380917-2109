                  </hi>. I am a patrol. At twenty minutes past seven o'clock I was in Fleet-street. I saw the prisoner and two or three others attempting to pick this gentleman's pocket, at the end of Shoe-lane—I followed then to the end of Wine-office-court—one or two of them then went round the gentleman, who stopped to pick up his glove, and the prisoner lifted his coat and took this box—he ran off—I pursued, till he came to Mr. Willey'i the fishmonger's door—there he threw down this box, and I took him.</p>

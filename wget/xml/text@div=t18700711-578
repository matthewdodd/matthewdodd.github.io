                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Lawler, and reside at 24, Sidney Street, Clarendon Square—I have two daughters, Clara and Alice—on Easter Thursday last, my daughter Alice left my house—she wore at the time a linsey dress skirt, with a flounce at the bottom, black jacket, enamelled side-spring boots, black and red plaid scarf, and a hat with a red rose in front, or a black velvet hat with a blue feather—she took both hats with her, but I do not know which she had on—she had also a quantity of under-clothing—she left a note upon the table—I went to the Praed Street police-station, Camden Town, and gave a written description of her—on the 15th May I called at the police-station, Bow Street, and accompanied a detective to Foggarty's Buildings in Drury Lane—we met a police officer on the way there—I stopped outside at the top of Foggarty's Buildings until they came back—they brought back my daughter with them—she was then clothed in rags—she had not the linsey skirt, nor the jacket, nor the scarf, nor the hat, nor the boots—I have redeemed some of those articles since from the leaving shops which were pointed out to me—one of them was a sweet-stuff shop—I have got a pair of drawers and the linsey skirt—the chemise is still retained, but I believe it will be given up by the prisoner's mother—I have at home the ticket for the petticoat, which was taken from her the same day she left, and pawned for a shilling in Drury Lane.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Peachey, and have known Wagstaff two or three years, and knew he belonged to a brass-founder's in our street - he brought these decanters to us for sale on the 24th of November, at half-past eight o'clock in the morning; I received them from him - I asked him if they were his master's property; he had before brought glass decanters to us - he said his master had bought them at Pellatt and Green's sale, and he sold them on his master's account; he asked 24s. for them - I gave him 22s.; they were claimed three or four days after - Wagstaff used to give his master's name as Stodart, but I have found it is Handy: Mr. Peachey buys and sells glass.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean that when he brought the decanters you did not know his name as well as his master's? A. Yes; I knew what his name was -I knew the house he came from; it was Handy's a brassfounder's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you at the time he brought them, know his master's name was Handy? A. Yes, but on account of delicacy, I put them in the name he gave, which is not unusual - I do not know Martin or his father.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 30th of November, I apprehended Martin, at Mr. Moody's Great Sutton-street, Clerkenwell - he denied all knowledge of the charge; I found Wagstaff the same day, at Handy's, a brass-founder, in Goswell-street - I told him I took him on account of receiving some decanters from Mr. Pellatt's shop; he at first denied it - I did not make him any promise or threat; I took him over to Peachey's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090020"></xptr>- they said he was the person who had pawned them- I took him to Mr. Pellatt's, and then to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure you have told us all he said? A. Respecting this indictment I have; he said an hour after that he had received the decanters from Martin to pledge, but never said for Martin's father - he never said on whose account he was to pawn them, or that he supposed them to belong to Martin's father, or that Martin represented his father to be a glass-cutter; I have told you all he said, to the best of my recollection - Lock, the witness, was present; he said that at Mr. Pellatt's - I do not recollect saying that nothing passed till I got him to the Compter; I swear I have not said so - I did not state where the conversation was in my examination in chief, because I was not asked, and that concerns another case; there are other decanters - what he said concerned the case altogether; I did not know whether I had a right to name it - I have seen his father, but do not know his business.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you swear to a pair before the Alderman, and afterwards find you were wrong? A. They are not in this indictment - they did belong to Mr. Pellatt; I made a mistake with regard to them, but nothing else.</p>

               <p>Wagstaff. When Martin gave them to me I took them to pawn for 16s. - he said they would lend that; another gentleman came behind the counter and offered me 1l. for them - I said he should have them for 22s.</p>
               <p>DANIEL STEPTO. He did ask for 16s. on them in pledge, but another person in our shop took them up and said he would not mind giving 1l. for them - he was very willing to sell them.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How came you to offer to buy property of a boy who told you his master wished to pawn them for 16s.? A. He left the shop for ten minutes, to consult his master, as he said - he came back and said the money would be of great service to pay a bill; we should have sold them for 30s., as they are not a pair exactly - we could not sell them for two guineas as second-hand.</p>
               <p>Wagstaff's Defence. When Harrison took me, he asked if I knew Martin - I denied all knowledge of him, as I never knew him by any name but George; he took me to Peachey's, then to a public-house, found the ticket on me, and said there, if I would confess it would be better for me.</p>

On the 16th of December, at half-past ten, or a quarter to eleven o'clock, I saw a black and white sow, with a stripe over one shoulder; Carter was driving her - he was on the left side of the road, and Timmins on the side of the path; they went on to a cross-way, and I saw Timmins throw something at her twice - Carter then took up something and threw at the carcasses of the houses; Carter smacked a whip.</p>

               <p>CARTER'S Defence. About half-past ten o'clock, I was in Maiden-lane; I saw the sow, and Timmins with it - he asked if I knew anybody that wanted a sow; I said I could very likely sell it - I went to Cook's, who did not want it; I then went to Harrison's, where I have sold pigs - they did not want it.</p>

            . He never sold me a pig.</p>
               <p>TIMMINS' Defence. I met this man driving a pig - he said he was going to take it home; we went to Harrison's, and then I went home.</p>

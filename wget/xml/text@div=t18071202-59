            . I am a police officer of Hatton Garden. On the 7th of September I apprehended the prisoner at the bar near Bagnigge Wells, at her father's house. I charged her with the offence; at first she strongly denied it. I told her I had but very little doubt but what she had taken the things; she at last burst out in tears, and said I have; she said her father had got the duplicates. I took the father in custody; he delivered the duplicates up to me before the magistrate. The shoes I found in a box at her father's; she said she did it in distress, she said her father took them away from her, and said how could she do such a thing. The whole family seemed to be in the greatest distress.</p>

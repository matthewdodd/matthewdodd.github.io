Hive at 17, Great Cambridge Street, Hack<lb></lb>ney Road—on 17th June I was walking down the Hackney Road, about 12.15, with Miss Pelham—the prisoner came in front of me and snatched my watch and chain, struck me in the chest, and ran away—it was rather a violent blow, and hurt me afterwards very much—I ran after him some distance, and then we went to the police-station and gave his description, and the next day I saw him at the station and picked him out directly from a number of men.</p>

I was walking with Miss Carmichael in Hackney Road when a man came in front of us and stole Miss Carmichael's watch and chain—I turned quickly and saw the face of the man for a moment—I ran after him—Miss Carmichael fainted in the road, and there was a great crowd—the prisoner is the man, I knew him as soon as he came into the Court.</p>

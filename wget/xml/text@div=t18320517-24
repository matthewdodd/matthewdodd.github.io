               <p>PETER CAMERON. I live at Blackheath. On the 14th of May, between twelve and one o'clock, I went to the <placeName id="t18320517-24-crimeloc144">Jerusalem coffee-house</placeName>

            . I am waiter at the Jerusalem coffee-house. I did not see the prisoner enter, but saw him before he got the length of the room; he went and took a newspaper, then went and sat in another part of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170044"></xptr>room, where he could see who went in and out; I afterwards saw him go out with this umbrella - I am certain he brought none in with him; I directly followed him into the Royal Exchange; he then took the cover off the umbrella, and put it into his pocket; he then opened the umbrella, examined it, and closed it again - I followed him down Cornhill, behind the Mansion-house, into Cannon-street, to Queen-street and Cheapside; I then met Joyce, who took him; I asked if he had been to the Jerusalem coffee-house that morning; he said he had not; I asked if he had a case to the umbrella; he said No - Joyce found it in his pocket; he ran from Joyce as far as Garlick-hill, and was taken without getting out of sight - ours is a subscription coffee-house, and no strangers and admitted - it is my business to see who comes in; I was left alone, but I thought I would watch him, in consequence of what passed before.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper. Miller spoke to me - I tapped the prisoner on the shoulder in Bow-lane - he denied having been to the coffee-house, or having a cover to the umbrella - I found the cover in his pocket, and said I must take him; he darted from me, and ran three or four hundred yards - I am sure he is the man.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that his distressed situation had caused him to have recourse to liquor, which he must have been under the influence of, if he committed the offence.</p>

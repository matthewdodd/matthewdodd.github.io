            . I remember Signor Spagnoletti coming to give me a lesson in music on the day of the drawing room, the 8th of June; he left his pencil-case behind him, which I understood to be gold. Mr. Harrison called afterwards, and wanted a pencil - I saw him use this. Isted then dressed me to go to Court - the prisoner and

                  Barbara

             were there; Isted and Waters then went out, and when I went away I saw the pencil-case there, and I desired Isted to take particular care of it - when I returned I missed it, and said to them all three, "Have you seen it?" they all denied it, and Cox said, what business should she have up in the drawing-room. On the following morning Signor Spagnoletti called, and we could not find the case. I do not know that Cox's husband had been at my house that day; he had been there once, but I refused his coming again.</p>

            . In the course of a second search at the house of Cox, about three o'clock in the afternoon of the 26th of July, I found this pencil-case in a jar by the side of the mantel-piece; Cox was not there, but her husband was.</p>
               <p>ERNESTO DIANA DOMENICA SPAGNOLETTI. This is my pencil-case - I left it upon the piano-forte at Miss Kidney's, on the morning of the 8th of June; I think I called a day or two afterwards - Miss Kidney is mistaken in saying it was the next day: we could not find it. I gave a guinea for it - I bought it because it belonged to poor Naldi.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Can you swear to it? A. Yes, by a mark I made upon it.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL MORRIS re-examined. Q. Were you at the Office when the pencil-case was mentioned to the prisoner? A. Yes, and I think it was the last prisoner who said that was the case which was left in the drawing-room.</p>

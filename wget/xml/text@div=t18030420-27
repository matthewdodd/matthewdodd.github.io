             sworn. - I am servant to the Hon. Mrs. Gage; I was left at home when the prosecutor went out. About five o'clock I was setting my tray for dinner in the pantry; I thought I heard a foot in the passage below, which occasioned me to open the pantry-door; I opened the door, and saw the prisoner with a trunk in his hand; he was coming out of the hall into the passage leading to the area; as soon as he saw me, he set the trunk down, and asked me if the house was Lady Middleton's? (she lives in the same street, the name on the door;) I told him it was not; I asked him who he wanted, or what he wanted if it was Lady Middleton's, or who told him that it was; he said, some person in the street; I asked him again, and he said, dear me, I thought it was Lady Middleton's; then he went out, put the trunk down, and went up the area-steps; I followed him, and overtook him about ten yards from the gate, in the street; I caught him by the collar, and charged him with robbing our house; he said, my dear Sir, you must be mistaken, it could not be me; do you think a person like me would come down your area-steps to rob your house; I told him I was certain he was the man, and I insisted upon his going down stairs with me; he made no resistance, but went with me; I shewed him the trunk, and told him that was the trunk he had taken out of the servant's hall; he begged very much for me to let him go; I told him he might depend upon it I should not till my mistress came home; he said, he had a wife at the end of the street, who was waiting for him, and I was keeping him out of his business; he begged to go out to speak to his wife; I said, if he had any thing particular to say to her, he should, but he might depend upon it he should not go out of my hands; I went into the street with him; a woman came up who said she was his wife, and he said she was; she asked me if I thought a man of his appearance would come down to rob a servant's hall; I told her it mattered not what his appearance was, he was the man; she tried to loose him from me; a soldier was going by, and I charged him to assist me, which he did, and we took him down stairs again; I set the trunk before him, and desired the soldier not to let him go out of the house, and when my mistress came home, he was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Was the prisoner a stranger to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The trunk was never removed out of the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He asked you how you could suppose he was the person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect him? - A. I never lost sight of him till he was taken.</p>

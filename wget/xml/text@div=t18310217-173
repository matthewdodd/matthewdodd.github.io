I knew the prisoner in 1802, and before that; she was then single - I was invited to go to her wedding, in that year, but I could not go - she was to be married to a person of the name of Rogers; I had known him before - I think the wedding was about May; her master gave an entertainment, but I was not there - I think I saw

No; I have paid eight shillings a week for the prisoner, for about two years - I did send her to a mad-house, but I was with her for fourteen or fifteen years, till I became in danger of my life. and I was advised to part with her; she has been living as a lunatic pauper in Clerkenwell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a confectioner at 1, Eagle-terrace, City-road—about 4 o'clock, on 20th January, I was passing along Smithfield from Long-lane; some man came up and asked me a question about an omnibus, and he continued talking to me and walking by my side for some few yards—we met three or four more—the prisoner was one of them—they all huddled</p>

               <p>round me, and stopped me, and it was hardly half a minute before I felt my watch drawn from my pocket by the chain—that was done by the prisoner—I saw him do it—I caught him by his arm, and hugged him; and a policeman came up and took him in charge not five yards off—I saved my watch—it is a valuable gold one; but I have been wiser since then, and only wear a silver one now.</p>

On 20th January, about 4 o'clock, I was at the end of Long-lane, and heard a cry of "Seize that man!" at that moment the prisoner darted by me—I am sure he is the man—I recognised him, and grasped at him—I took him to the station—some money and a key was found on him—at the time this occurrence took place there was a large crowd of persons assembled, owing to a collision between two vehicles—the prisoner gave an address which I could not find out.</p>

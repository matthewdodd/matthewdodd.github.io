About 12.30 in the morning, 16th August, I was on duty in Lower Bland Street, Borough, near the Royal Oak public-house, kept by the prisoner—I heard a cry of fire—I went to the house, and saw him with his head and part of his body out of the first-floor window, which is about 10 feet from the ground—he said "I have got a fire in my place"—after saying that he jumped out, and I caught him—he was fully dressed with his coat on his arm—he had on his collar and tie, hat, boots, and everything—I asked him if there was any one in the house—he said "No, no one, my wife and children are in the country"—I sprang my rattle, and some other constables came up—I then tried to force the front door open—the prisoner said "It is almost an impossibility to force it in, as there is a strong bolt inside"—Constable Lane got in through another door, and then opened the front door, and I went in—I saw there had been a fire.</p>

At 9 o'clock on the morning of the 16th August I went to the Royal Oak beerhouse; I examined the materials in the cupboard, they consisted of a heap in the centre of the cupboard; there were two brass candlesticks that had grease or tallow on them; on the top I found a small spirit-lamp with the top screwed off, some bundles of firewood, pieces of wicker-work basket, straw wrappers for bottles, rags, paper and wood heaped together apparently burnt, and in the centre a bottle containing some spirits-of-turpentine—I did not examine the bottle at that time, it was brought away by Sergeant Kimber, and I found that it did contain spirits-of-turpentine; all these things were heaped up together, and there was no other inflammable material in any other part of the cup<lb></lb>board—it looked as if these inflammable matters had been burnt together for the purpose of creating a flame; in the bar I found newspapers only had been burning on the top of the cask—I have a sample of them here, there were no pipelights or anything else near—I should say the distance between the two fires was about four yards, there was not the slightest connection between them—I went up into the front bedroom, and found a bed and bedstead, a table and a chest of drawers quite empty, and two cupboards empty, with the exception of two old pieces of crockery in-one—in the second room I found children's beds and another empty cupboard, and a large box empty.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on 22nd November at 74, Stanley Road, Poplar, which he was then occupying—I had held the warrant from 27th August, and had tried to find him—I had the hospital watched repeatedly—I told him he was charged with setting fire to his beer-house, the Royal Oak, Bland Street, in the Borough—he said, "I did not set fire to the house"—I found on him this receipt from the Liverpool, London, and Globe Insurance Company, dated 31st October, for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. premium on a policy for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also found on him this pawn-ticket.</p>

It is in the name of Walter Whitham for something pawned at Norwich—before taking the prisoner I had traced his wife and son, and kept observation on them and followed them, and knowing that he was an out-patient of the hospital I kept observation there and made inquiry—I know now that he had been residing for three weeks at the house where I took him—he had only been to the hospital the week previous to my apprehending him—I have not said that he had been there from May 20th to November 20th.</p>

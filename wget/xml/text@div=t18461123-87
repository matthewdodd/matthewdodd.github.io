                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable B</hi> 153.) On the 25th of Nov. I saw the prisoner in Henrietta-street, in the Vinegar-ground, in Old-street-road—he went to the door of a house, put his shoulder against the door, and stood talking to a girl—he had this bundle under his arm—I went up to him, and asked what he had got—he said he was going to deliver this to Mrs. Wild, a lady in Lansdown-place, Hackney-fields—it was then past twelve o'clock at night—I said it was rather an unusual hour to take things home—he told me he came from the West End—I wanted to look at the direction on the parcel—he snatched it out of my hand and ran away—I pursued—he chucked the parcel away, I picked it up and took him—I said, "It is a curious way to deliver a parcel in Hackney-fields, to throw it away"—he said he was going to take it to Beauvoir-square—I found on him a key of a street-door, and a letter directed to himself, at his master's residence—the parcel contained this shawl and table-cloth—this key which I found on him opened the door of his master's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live at No. 98, Leather-lane. Between one and two o'clock in the morning, on the 25th of Nov., I went to the prisoner's room, and found the bed had not been used—he had been in my service about a month—I found my street-door was unbolted, and the policeman produced the key of my street-door—I found a candlestick with a rushlight in it, burning on the kitchen stairs—this shawl and table-cloth are mine—when I lost my table-cloth there was a mark at the eorner of it—I thought it was an ink mark, but it was a black pencil mark—I am quite cer<lb></lb>tain they are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sub-manager in the grocery department of the Stores Association, 136, Queen Victoria Street—Golding was in their employ as manager, and Cairns counter-man, in the grocery department—it was Golding's duty to go during the day to different public offices to obtain orders from the subscribers to the Association, which he got on forms like these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and he would receive the money at the same time, and bring it with the orders to Queen Victoria Street and take them to an examiner, who checks the prices, and if the addition is right, stamps the order with a red stamp bearing the date and the cashier's number—Golding would then bring the order to the cashier, giving him the money, and he would stamp the order with a perforated stamp—the examiner and the cashier would enter the order in their books—Golding would then take the order to a counter man to be made up, who would put it on his file after executing it—the orders on the file are collected at night—for a reason which I had, I told Golding to have all his orders made up by Cains—on 21st February the two prisoners were brought into the committee room, and I saw these three parcels taken from Golding—Harding, the detective, was in the room—Golding was asked if he had anything in his bag which was not paid for—he said "I have; I have always been an honest man up to this time"—he was asked where he got them—he said from the man who always makes up my orders—Cains was present—I looked at the parcels, and saw Cains's writing upon them—I have consistently seen his writing—I searched Cains's file of orders, and found two legitimate orders of Gelding's upon it—they had been paid for—I found no orders relating to these things.</p>

I did not mention before the Magis<lb></lb>trate that Golding said that he had been an honest man up to this time—I was not asked what statements were made—I answered all the questions that were asked me—I said that Golding said he had them from Cains and had not paid for them—Cains was brought in afterwards—Golding did not mention Cains's name—he said "By me man who always executes my orders"—the names on the parcels are Leech, Blackie, Rowe, and Egerton—these persons are members of the Association.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. It was Golding's duty to go every day to the savings bank and the post office, and take orders and money from different gentlemen, and also to the National Debt Office and the Inland Revenue Department—he also had to deliver the goods ordered in that way to the different offices—he would collect six or eight a day in my de<lb></lb>partment, and there were other departments—he was instructed to goto a particular counter man, and that was Cains.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On Thursday, 21st February, I was on the premises of the Civil Service Supply Association—I had been engaged there about two months—Golding was stopped by Turford that day and taken into the committee-room—Cains was there—I told Cains that he would be charged with stealing these parcels, 5 1/2 pounds of tea, 2 pounds of sugar, and 2 boxes of sardines—he made no answer—I told Golding that he would be charged with receiving them from Cains, not having paid for them—Cains heard this and said nothing.</p>

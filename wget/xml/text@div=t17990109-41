               <p>Q. Who were in company with you? - A. Willey, Powter, and Griffiths; we found a boy that we went after in bed with three women; we wanted him for being concerned in robbing a shop in Field-lane; the prisoner at the bar was sitting in a chair by the fire side, very genteelly dressed; I told the boy to get up, and I said to Mackaway, you may as well go with us too, for if you stay here, you may be robbed; Mackaway said, do you want any thing with me, gentlemen; I said, no; when the boy had got up, we went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not attempt to take the prisoner at that time? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Black-boy-alley in your parish? - A.Part of it is, but that house is not; when we had got into our parish, I took hold of him carelessly by the arm, then Willey gave me a nudge; the prisoner then asked Willey whether he knew him; Willey said, no, I know nobody; the prisoner said, my name is Carey; Willey made answer, Carey, then I want you, come along; Mackaway then pulled himself away from me, and ran something in my mouth, I cannot say what it was; I said to my partner, d-n his eyes, he has got a knife, mind his knife; Powter was close behind us, and the the watchman, Griffiths, was before with a lanthorn; I still kept hold of him, and he and I russled a good bit, for the space of two minutes or thereabouts; then Powter hit him over the arm with a stick, and, what he held in his hand, I suppose, dropped from him at that time, but I cannot positively say.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any warrant for apprehending him? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What took place after he had struck you? - A. There was a pistol found.</p>
               <p>Court. In this case, if death had ensued, it could have been but manslaughter; this man was not disturbing the peace at all when he was taken into custody. Gentlemen, you must acquit him upon this indictment.</p>

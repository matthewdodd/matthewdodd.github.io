            . I live at Finchamstead, Berks. I sometimes buy pigs, and fatten them. On the 15th of March I had a full grown hog, which I had fattened - it was kept in a stye in my garden - I saw it safe there between five and six o'clock; I got up about six the next morning, and it was gone; I traced it seven, eight, or nine miles; there was the track of two men having been with it - I there lost that track, and traced the mark of a donkey-cart, as far as a place called Bishopsgate; we inquired there, and met Peck in a donkey cart, at Egham, who gave us information; we came on to Hounslow, and went into a public-house there - I at last found the hog at the prisoner's house at Hounslow; we asked him if he had bought a pig of two strangers out of a donkey-cart - he said, No - I then asked him if he had seen a black and white pig in a donkey-cart, with two men in it - he considered a little, and said he did not know but he might have seen such a thing go along the street - Dearlove, my brother-in-law, who was with me, asked if had bought a pig at all that day - he said Yes, three or four of a neighbour, and mentioned a name, which I do not recollect - he did not say Peck - Dearlove asked to see the pigs; he went to three, which hung up in the shop, and asked me if either of those were mine - I said No - we left his premises, went to a public-house for about three quarters of an hour, made some inquiry, and Gilham took us to the prisoner's house again - Gilham asked him to show us the pig, which he had bought of two men out of a donkey-cart - he made no answer for a little time, and then said,"I have got another pig;" or two or three, I cannot say which he said; he lit a candle, and took us down a passage into a back room, it was nearly ten o'clock at night - some pigs hung there - he took a cloth off one, and it was mine; he said that was the one he had bought of two strangers; there was one or two more pigs in the room - the hair had been scalded off, but the rings were in the pig's nose (which I knew), and it had been a good deal bruised - I have not the least doubt of its being mine; the entrails had been taken out - I told the prisoner not to cut it till I came again, for it was mine - he said he had got some of it bespoke, and he did not know but he should cut it up if it was wanted; his house is about twenty-six miles from mine - we left the house, and returned with the watchman, who said, if he did his duty, he must take him and the pig; but we left it in the house - we then went to Egham - the prisoner was in the other Court when Peck was tried, and was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. He was a witness against Peck? A. Yes; he was bound over, and attended - Peck was convicted, and he was committed by direction of the Court for prevarication; the Judge ordered him into custody as a receiver - I cannot tell whether the Jury convicted Peck upon his evidence - he was not the only witness.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first went to his house, was not your question whether he had cut up the stolen pig, which he had bought of some man in the road? A. No; another person went with us - I cannot positively swear that he said nothing of the kind - when we went the second time, he was some considerable time before he took us into the back room - I cannot say how long; I will not swear it was as long as five minutes; it was in a room down a passage at the back of the house - there was some blood down under where the pigs hung - he said nobody should take it out of the house till I had sworn to it; the watchman had said he must take it - he said I might leave somebody on the premises with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050045"></xptr>Q. Did he not say, if you would allow it to be sold the money it produced you should have, if you proved it to be yours? A. I do not recollect it - we said we would be there at ten o'clock next morning, or as early as we could, and it was not to be cut up till we came - this was on Friday, but we did not go till Sunday, as we had to attend Peck's examination.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you quite sure, that when he was asked if he had bought a pig of two strangers in a donkey-cart, he said he had not? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother-in-law. I went with him, and asked the prisoner if he had bought a pig of two strangers out of a donkey-cart - he said No - I asked if he had bought any pigs that day - he said Yes, three or four of a neighbour, and mentioned his name - he showed us some which hung in the shop, but did not offer to show us any other; we left, supposing it was not there - we returned in about a quarter of an hour with Gilham, who had given us information at the Lion and Lamb public-house; Gilham asked for

             - he came, and Gilham said he wanted to see the pig he had bought that day - he stood a minute or two, then took a candle, and went down a passage, through a sitting room into another room adjoining, and there were three or four pigs, one of which was Loader's; directly he saw the nose he said it was his - Gilham asked if he might cut the rings out of the nose - he said Yes, and gave him a knife - we then went out, and returned with the watchman, who told him not to cut it up - he said he had promised some to his customers, and should like to have liberty to cut it - the watchman said he must not; but it was cut up, for we never saw it again - the prisoner was bound over as a witness - he appeared here, and we were bound over to prosecute him as a receiver - the pig appeared hardly cold, and not fit to cut up - it must have been driven twenty or thirty miles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not expressly agreed that the pig should not be cut up till ten o'clock the following morning? A. We said we would be there by ten, if we possibly could, but we could not promise - he said he would wait till ten o'clock, but not that if we were not there by ten he must cut it - he said he did not wish to keep it if it was stolen - we told him not to cut it whether we were there or not by ten o'clock - it must have been about nine at night when we first got to his house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went the second time, was there the slightest hesitation on his part to show you the pig? A. He lit another candle - he might be three or four minutes; I did not look for any furniture in the room where the pig was; there was no carpet - it was a room, not a slaughter-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell the Magistrate that he cut the pig up for the benefit of all parties? A. I did not hear him state that - he said he gave 3l. 7s. for it; I should think 4l. a fair price, and he could then get a living profit by it - we said nothing about a stolen pig the first time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure that when he was asked if he had bought a pig of two strangers out of a donkey-cart, he declared he had not? A. He did; that was the first word he said - he has neither returned the pig nor money.</p>

            . I live at Cranford-bridge, two miles from Hounslow. I saw two persons in a donkey-cart, with a pig - it went down Hounslow, and then returned - I saw them take the pig out of the cart into Shervill's house about noon - the two men were strangers at Hounslow - Peck was one of them - neither of them live at Hounslow, or I must have known them; between eight and nine o'clock in the evening. I saw Loader and Dearlove - I went with them to the prisoner's; he took took us through the shop into the passage, and there the pig hung with two more - I was never there before; he might keep pigs there to get cold - I asked the prisoner for a knife, and cut the rings out, which I gave to the watchman; when the two men had taken the pig into Shervill's, he came over to the Lion and Lamb with them; they said "The pig ought to have been 4l.;" he said, "I have given you 3l. 7s., I think it is a good price; what do you think it will weigh?" Peck said, "I fed it, and it ought to fetch 4l."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This conversation was in the public-house? A. Yes, seven or eight persons were present; there was no secret about it - I do not think Shervill thought it was stolen; I have known him from his infancy; he is postman of the town, and an honest steady man; I know they took the pig to Mr. Funnel, and then further down, before they sold it to him; I heard all that passed before the Magistrate; Shervill did not say he was willing to pay a fair price for it; as soon as it was ascertained to be his, I said, "Jem, if it is that man's property, he ought to have it;" he said, "I cannot tell that it is stolen, and shall not give it up;" I said, "The watchman had better secure it for both;" they agreed to be back from Egham by ten o'clock in the morning, and he said it should not be cut till after ten; I got there at ten, and stopped till one, but they never came - they said they should come as soon as they could, and told him not to cut it till they did come; the prisoner was examined on Peck's trial, but did not give a good account of himself - he never offered to pay the money for it in my hearing.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many have you killed in that place? A. A good many; it is not a private place; it opens into a garden, and they hang there to cool; it is not a slaughter-house nor a furnished apartment; each side weighed 58lbs., and the head 8lbs.; it was not worth 3l. 7s. as it turned out; it was so much bruised, but that could not be told when it was alive.</p>

On the 16th of March a stranger called at Funnel's in a donkey-cart, and offered one for sale; he sent over for me; I was out, but was sent for, and went to Funnel's, who told me a person in a donkey-cart had offered him one, and he said if he had wanted one he should not have he sitated at buying it; I went, and overtook the cart - they wanted 4l. for it - I offered 3s. 5s.; they would not take less than 3l. 15s.; I was turning away when the tall man came up and said, "The lowest I will take for it is 3l. 10s." I offered 3l. 7s., which they would not take; we separated about one hundred and twenty yards; they returned, and said if I would stand half a gallon of beer I should have it; I said No - they at last brought it down to my house, and turned it into my yard; I had not the least suspicion of its being stolen - I went to the Lion and Lamb, and took a draught of beer with them.</p>

            . I was working in Doctor Taylor's garden on the 16th of March, which is about half a mile from the prisoner's shop. I saw the prisoner come up to some men in a donkey-cart, and bargain for a pig; I heard all they said; the man wanted 3l. 10s. for it - he offered 3l. 7s.; they said he should not have it, and went on about one hundred and twenty yards - they then beckoned him back, and said he should have it if he would stand half-a-gallon of beer; he refused, and they shook hands and agreed at 3l. 7s., which I should think a fair price for it, and said so; Peck, who was in the cart, said, for the sake of a shilling he would not go two or three miles further.</p>

            . I keep the Lion and Lamb, two doors from the prisoner's house - he came to my house with two men in a donkey-cart; he paid sixpence towards the beer - they wanted him to pay sixpence more, but he refused. I learned from their talk that he had bought a pig of them.</p>

            . I was at the prisoner's house on this night; he came to me at the Red Lion public-house about half-past four o'clock next day, and said, "These men are not come - what am I to do with the pig? it will spoil;" I told him he had better sell the carcase, but to be sure and save the head that they might swear to it - he said he would save the head; Loader came next morning, and said the Magistrate told him he might take the pig - I went to the prisoner's house, and said, "Have you made away with the pig's head?" he said, "Yes, I have sold it." I do not believe there is a man in Hounslow bears a better character than the prisoner.</p>

On Wednesday, 1st June, I was on duty about eight o'clock in the evening; I saw the prisoner go into Mr. Stanton's, a metal warehouse, in Shoe-lane—I remained outside about half a minute—I then followed him in, and saw he had got something under a sack, or covered over with a sack—he was standing at the counter—I asked him what he had under the sack, he said that was his business; I asked him again what it was—he said it was his property—I asked him what it was, and he said, "It is a piece of lignum vitae"—I asked him where he got it from—he said again it was his property, and he found it—I asked him where be found it, and he made no answer—I took him into custody—there might hare been three or four persons in the warehouse at the time—I did not hear the prisoner offer this for sale, but I beard the shopman say, "Wait till Mr. Stanton comes down"—the shopman was behind the counter, and the prisoner on this side of it, and this log was on the counter—this is the piece that was under the sack.</p>

Fauntleroy live in Potter's-fields, Tooley-street—I loaded the wagon with lignum vitas—the prisoner was there, and he helped me to load the wagon—he then came out of Potter's-fields into Tooley-street with me, and we then had some beer together—he then left me, and I did not see him again—this piece of lignum vitae is similar to that with which I loaded the wagon—it is the same sort of wood.</p>

                  </hi> I am a seaman, livingat-10, Cannock-Street, "Greenock—in April last year I was one of the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Barbadian</hi>, a British ship, Daniel McNeil was the master,-George Nathaniel. Beattie was first mate, Gilbert Kerr second-mate, and Peter McArthur steward—the prisoner was one of the crew, as a seaman—there were seventeen altogether when we first sailed—I can't tell how many there were at the time this occurred; there were less than there were at first—on 18th April we sailed to Buenos Ayres and discharged our cargo there—we then sailed in ballast to Java—we went about 20 miles from the port of Cheribon to discharge the ballast; Cheribon is in Java—on. 4th November we were discharging the ballast during the day, it was dry sand—the prisoner was working in the hold, I was on deck—he understands English—the captain was sick during the day—the second mate, Mr. Kerr, was in charge of the hold; he was superintending all that was going on—I can't exactly remember whether Mr. Beattie was in charge of the ship—at 6 o'clock Mr. Beattie told me to leave off discharging the ballast—we then left the hold—he then gave orders to slope the awning, and pay out some chain—sloping the awning means taring it down close to the rails, to make use of it—it was pretty fine weather during the day but it rained very hard that night, it was very hot—I am not aware that the prisoner said any thing when Mr. Beattie gave orders to slope the awning—I went to do it—when I returned I saw Mr. Beattie and the prisoner—rash words passed between them—there was not one of the words that I took any notice of—it was all about having to come and pay out chain before we shifted our clothes; the prisoner grumbled about it—I can't say what Mr. Beattie</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187507120051"></xptr>
               <p>said to that—the chain had not been paid out then, I was helping to pay it out with the rest of them when I came forward—four five of us did it—I then went aft to get some water in a bucket, the prisoner "went with-me—we had finished paying out the chain and the awning too—there was' about a quarter of an hour between the two—as we were passing to get the water, the prisoner spoke to Mr. Beattie, but what he said I can't remember—"Mr. Beattie told him to come back and he would hit him in the mouth; he would strike him if he would not hold his noise—he was not making much noise the was speaking angrily—Mr. Beattie then gave him a push and pushed him down backwards on the top of some spars—he was still speaking when that happened, they were both <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi>—Mr. Beattie was then going aft—the prisoner still kept talking to him, rash words, angrily, and Mr. Beattie went to strike him—the prisoner was then standing up on the top of the spars, standing on deck rather, when George Beattie came back again he turned round and went up to him with the intention of striking him, he was making for Monson, and Monson jumped on the top of the spars and pulled his knife out—Mr. Beattie was lifting his hand up, just as if he was going—to strike him—he was "3 or 4 feet from him, and I believe he was going to strike him,—he was raising his hand, and the prisoner got on the for of the spars just alongside of him, not going away from—him and drew his knife from his breast with his right hand—it was under the waistband of his trousers; I could see the handle of it before he drew it, it was in a sheath in the waistband—it was a clasp knife—when he was pushed on the spars he said "I—will settle this yet" where he drew out the" knife; he stabbed Mr. Beattie in the shoulder—Mr. Beattie ran, at him like this (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>), and he took the knife out like that, and put it over the top of his shoulder—Mr. Beattie was coming toward him at the time, he got close up to him, they were breast "to breast—Mr. Beattie then got hold of him and knocked him down on the spars they both wrestled and fell on the spars—Mr. Beattie did not say anything, he never said a word that I heard—I called out that the mate was stabbed, and all hands ran aft to separate them—the captain afterwards attended to Beattie and the prisoner was put in irons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was working on deck at the main "hatch way the prisoner was working in the hold—it was not wet and dirty there, it was dirtier work on deck—you got damp and wet with sweat in the hold, and so you did on deck too, it was so hot—I think Kerr was working in the hold, there were three or four of them there—we had been working from 6 o'clock in the morning till 6 o'clock at night, knocking off three times for meals—the heat was nothing more than usual, it was very hot—we could not send a boat on shore, it was too far, we could not stand a pull so far—the spars on the deck were spare topmasts, about a foot or a foot and a half high off the deck—the angry words between the mate and the prisoner had "been going on for some time, they were <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> each other—I am certain that the words the prisoner used were "I will settle this yet—I have said the words were "I will settle it yet," or words to the same effect—I have been examined several times, in Scotland and before two naval courts, and also before the Magistrate here—when the prisoner got up from the spars, Beattie had gone about three yards from him, going aft—the prisoner stayed close to the spars, taking water out of a water cask to "wash, but still <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi>—Beattie then came back and walked right straight up to him like' this (<hi rend="italic">doubling he fist</hi>)—the prisoner sprang away from him on to the top of the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, living at Edgware—the prisoner was my carter for many years. On the 31st of August I sent him with a load of hay to Smithfield-market—it consisted of thirty-six trusses, and was loaded and packed in the usual manner—I had just before received an anonymous letter, in consequence of which I called at the station, and spoke to the police—in addition to the load, the prisoner was given a bottle</p>

               <p>of hay for his horses—it is seldom weighed—it ought not to weigh more than 40lbs. —I believe it sometimes weighs 60lbs. —he had no authority to sell hay by the truss—he was to take this hay to Mr. Circuit's, a hay-salesman, to be sold as an entire load—I saw some hay in the possession of the officer—to the best of my belief that was mine.</p>

In consequence of information, I watched, on the 31st of August, in the neighbourhood of Paddington, for the prosecutor's cart—I saw it come towards London, driven by the pri<lb></lb>soner—I followed to No. 3, North-street, Paddington—it stopped opposite that house—the prisoner took a truss from the top of the load, and put it on the rails in front of Mr. Udell's, a green-grocer—he passed on with his wagon—I stopped him—I said, "I want you about that hay"—he said, "I have sold that hay to Mr. Udell, for my master; I sometimes sell him a quarter of a load"—I took him into custody, and took the hay to the station—the hay was produced before the Magistrate, and shown to Mr. Carter—it was not weighed—it was a perfect truss—the load was all corded up except that truss—it was taken on to Smithfield, and sold as a load.</p>

I have known the prisoner twenty years - he came to our shop on the 9th of August, a little after nine o'clock in the morning - he had been in the habit of coming there from time to time; on the 9th of August, I went to a drawer in the parlour at the back of our shop, and gave my husband some money out of a pocket-book - there is a door from the shop to the parlour - it is not a glass door; I do not know exactly what money there was when I went there, but I left two 20l. Bank notes, 3 sovereigns in gold, and 17s. in silver - I am certain that is what I left; there were some shillings among the 17s., and it was all in a small pocket-book; when I took the money out, the prisoner stood on the left hand side of me, and my husband on the right; I cannot exactly say how near he was to me, or that he saw what I was doing; I gave the money to my husband that I took out - he and the prisoner were to go to buy some goods for the shop- they went out together about half-past nine o'clock - he returned with my husband between ten and eleven; he soon went away then, but returned between five and six in the evening - he did not stay long then, but he came again between eight and nine in the evening, and went away a little after twelve; I do not remember his saying anything to me, but my husband was speaking to a man about making him a grate, in the yard, and the prisoner wished me to go and tell my husband not to let the man make the grate, because he could get one much cheaper, but I did not go; I saw the prisoner shut the door between the shop and parlour once or twice in the course of the evening, and he had shut it in the afternoon as well; in the course of the evening, I went to the drawer in the parlour to get change for a sovereign, that was a little after ten o'clock - the money was all right then - I saw the pocket-book there; I left the sovereign in the same drawer, but not in the pocket-book - I took the change for the sovereign out of a bit of rag in one corner of the drawer; I have a bacon-knife, which I saw the prisoner take into the parlour between eleven and twelve o'clock - he did not stay in the parlour above two minutes, if he did so long - the parlour door was then a little way shut, but not close; no one came into the shop but the customers - none of them went into the parlour; when the prisoner went away, he said nothing particular - he bid my husband good night - I do not know that he bid me good night; my husband shut the shop up between twelve and one o'clock; my husband had not been in the shop all the evening - after the shop was shut, I saw the bacon knife on a table close by the drawer in the back parlour; I went to unlock the drawer, and it was unlocked - I had left it locked; I did not observe any marks on it; I missed all this money - it was all gone; it was between twelve and one o'clock; the bit of rag with the rest of the money was safe - this was on Saturday night, we expected the prisoner the next day; he had promised to come, but did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You told your husband you had this money? A. He knew I had it - I told him that night that I had missed it - I will swear that; I did not tell anybody that I did not miss it till between twelve and one o'clock on the Sunday, nor till Sunday afternoon, when I went to look for a brooch in that drawer - I did say on the Saturday morning that two sovereigns was all I had in the world; because I did not wish the prisoner to know what we had got; I said so before the magistrate - that I will swear; it was my husband who was asking me for money when I said I had no more - I only said it out of a bit of fun; he knew I had more - he had as much money as he wanted of me for his business - he had 6l or 7l.; he asked for more, but I thought he was asking for too much, and I said "Don't ask me for more - I have but two sovereigns left," but he knew I had more; I did not wish the prisoner or any person to know what I had, and because I thought my husband was asking too much; I did not take any one else up on this charge; I sent for a little girl to know if she knew anything of it - I did not accuse her of stealing it - that I will swear - I persist in that; I did not accuse her of stealing it from between my pillow and bolster, nor tell her I would transport her if she did not tell me the colour of the pocketbook, nor that I would transport her father and mother if she did not; I did not send for the streetkeeper to take her, but my husband went out to fetch her, and he met Forbes, the street-keeper, who came in, he found a piece of wood broken from the drawer, and said he had no doubt the prisoner was the man; and he would assist in taking him - this was about five or six o'clock on Sunday evening; I searched the drawer ac<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110125"></xptr>curately on the Saturday night, but did not discover that it had been broken; I did not offer the girl a sovereign to tell the colour of the pocket-book, nor anything of the kind; I did not on my oath; I did not give her sixpence to hold her tongue; I gave it her because she cried - that was when it was discovered that it had been broken open, and I knew she could not do it - she might be there an hour in conversation, but not two hours; I mentioned when she was there that I had lost notes - I did not say sovereigns and silver only; the prisoner has been exceedingly kind to my husband in his business - he assisted him in buying things, but my husband always gave him things home with him; I have been married five years, nearly - I am lawfully married; my husband did not go for the street-keeper to take the girl up - he met him by accident; he went to the girl's mother's, and brought her from there; she had left my house at half-past ten o'clock, and I had seen my money safe then, but I did not recollect that when I sent for her, my agitation was so great; she had been there on the Sunday morning, but I did not ask her then, because I expected the prisoner to come and bring the money back; I did tell him at Hatton-garden, that if he would give me my own money I did not want any one's else - I might say so in his father's presence; I did not say "Your father is a respectable man, and can easily raise the money;" upon my solemn oath, I did not tell Mrs. Griffiths that I had put the money in the drawer on Saturday morning, and did not miss it till Sunday afternoon.</p>

            . I live in John-lane. I was in my shop on the evening of the 9th of August - between eight and nine o'clock that morning I had asked my wife for some money, and she gave me about 6l. altogether; I think she took about two sovereigns out of the pocket-book - I saw her take it out, and the prisoner stood on the left hand of me and close to my wife; he saw my wife take the money out - he was in the shop in the evening; he went into the parlour several times during the evening, and I noticed him taking the bacon knife to cut a slice of bread for a drunken man - he cut the bread in the parlour, but he did not stay there more than a minute or two; the drunken man was outside my shop window - the prisoner left the knife on the dining table; he went away between twelve and one o'clock, and told me he would be over on Sunday morning, if he did not go to his father's; I did not know exactly how much money was in the drawer: when the prisoner was gone my wife found the money was gone - she made an alarm, and I went to the drawer and examined it - this was between twelve and one o'clock on the Sunday morning: I did not see any marks on the drawer at that time, not till the street-keeper pointed them out - I saw them then, that was on Sunday; the marks were on the upper part, where the bolt of the lock shoots in - it was a small place; the street-keeper compared the bacon knife to the place - I merely said I suspected the prisoner, and I went with two officers on the Monday morning, about eight o'clock, to apprehend him; he was at his residence, on the other side of Christchurch - he asked me if I accused him of it; I said I certainly did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know that your wife had all this money? A. I did not rightly know how much she had, but I knew that she ought to have near this money - I gave it her; I did not ask her for any more than the 6l. that morning - I am certain I did not; but previous to her giving me the 6l. she gave two sovereigns out of the pocket-book, and said I must not ask her for any more, for that was all she had: I knew she had about 40l., but she did not like to satisfy the prisoner how much she had got - he was exceedingly kind to us; she told me that night that she had lost the money - I went and looked at the drawer then, and examined it again on the Sunday, by day-light; the prisoner was not more than two minutes in the room - I was about one minute looking at him; I did not immediately send him to cut the bread, but a man came and asked for a pennyworth of bread, and he said, "You can sell a pennyworth of bread?" and he went and cut: I had a right to suspect the girl, as I had been robbed by a girl before - my wife knew that; she did not exactly know that I went out for the girl - I brought her in; the street-keeper was there: it is possible my wife might say, in Forbes' presence, that it was all nonsense, that she had been robbed by a girl before, and she could not get the money from her till she got an officer to take her into custody, and then she got it - I did not take notice of every thing she said; I have no recollection of such an expression; I did not hear her offer the child a sovereign if she would tell her the colour of the pocket-book - she did accuse her of taking the money, certainly; she said to the girl, "if she knew anything about it to tell her the truth" - I told the streetkeeper I had been robbed, and I rather suspected the girl; I did not see my wife give her 6d. when she was going away, but she told me of it afterwards; I cannot tell what she gave it her for - she asked the girl if she had seen anything of the money about; she said she thought she had mislaid it, and put it under her pillow, and the girl had taken it from there - I will not be certain whether Forbes was present; I suppose the girl was there half an hour; it was not so long as an hour - I went to the girl's father, her mother was out; I do not recollect that I told her father I was sure his daughter had taken the money - I told him I had been robbed, and he said the girl had brought nothing there; I think I did not tell him I was sure the girl had robbed me: the prisoner came as a friend to assist me - I offered to make him a recompense, but he never took anything but a few goods; he introduced me to a few customers, and to some wholesale dealers - I know now that he was taken very ill the next day.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner on the 11th of August, at his lodging in Collingwood-street, over the water; I saw his wife, and asked for Mr. Chapman; I said I had a job for him - she said she would be there in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour if I would wait somewhere; I said I would wait, and she went into a cart-house or shed and closed the gate - I went in, and in about two minutes she came, and said it was useless my waiting, Mr. Chapman would not be there for an hour and a half or two hours; I told her I thought he was in bed; she said he did not sleep there, he slept at Kennington; but in about five minutes I saw him - I told him Towell had been robbed; he said, "He don't suspect me, does he;" I said, "Yes he does;" I told him he must come outside and speak to him, which he did; he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110126"></xptr>nothing further but denying the charge; I found 9s. on him - this was about eight o'clock on the Monday morning; I had been sent for on the Sunday by Field, a brother officer - I went to Mr. Towel's about seven o'clock one Sunday evening; the street-keeper showed me this knife, and I compared it with the upper part of the drawer - it appeared that this knife had been forced in, and the shuttle of the lock had been forced down - the knife fitted the place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you known the prisoner any time? - A. Yes, for years; he knew I was an officer; I did not know that he referred people to his father's house in consequence of the obscure situation he lived in; I searched his place and his wife, but found nothing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent - on my oath I never saw the money; and I do not believe the prosecutor ever had it.</p>

Yes; I went in with Mr. Towell, and the child was crying; I went directly to the parlour, and the bolt had been shot; Mrs. Towell said she was very happy to think she had not given the girl into custody: when I first met Mr. Towell, he told me he had been seriously robbed; I went with him to Griffiths's house, and from there we returned to Towell's, and the girl was crying - Mrs. Towell said she suspected the girl, that she had been robbed by a former girl, and she owned it to the officer afterwards; he said he considered he had not money enough in his pocket, and he sent his wife to get him some - that she went to put the key into it and it would not unlock; he did not say what money his wife had given him; I have known the prisoner twelve or thirteen years; I have not been particularly intimate with him - he has not been living in that neighbourhood lately.</p>

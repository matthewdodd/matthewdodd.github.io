Mrs. Nicholson, No. 40, Sussex-street." I put up the things, and sent them down by my lad, in five minutes afterwards - I gave him eighteen shillings and a penny, and he was to bring me back a sovereign; he came back and put into my hands this medal - he was not to part with the goods without bringing back a sovereign.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It appears that this circumstance was transacted on the 5th of June, at past nine o'clock at night; I was then finishing a tea-caddy which I sold to Mr. Graham in Holborn, the next morning - I serve several shops with them; I sold one of the Saturday afterwards in Seymour-street, the person wanted a basin for it - I went to get one, and met a young man, who told me a man like an officer had been looking for me; I went after dinner to see what was the matter - I went to Mr. Newbury to know; he was out, and his wife told me to call in the evening, at nine o'clock; I said, I would, but I could not - I called on Sunday morning, his wife said he was out; I then went to a person near the prosecutor's, and bought some wax to mend my little girl's shoes - I asked the person how work went on, she said, it was slack; she had got her biggest boy at home, but he had been at Mr. Thompson's, who had turned him off, because he was not big enough; I went again at nine o'clock on Monday morning, to see what they wanted me for, and the policeman crossed from Mr. Thompson's and took me into custody - I went without resistance, as I was confident I had done nothing; Mr. Thompson asked if I was not the man; the boy said he thought I was; but it appears that this boy, since I have been in custody, says he knew me when I was taken up, as the person who had been to his master beore, to pass bad money; and if he had, why did he not tell his master of it? - is it possible that, I should go within five or six doors of the prosecutor, if I had been guilty; my hand never wrote this note, nor had I anything to do with it - I do solemnly swear, before my God and all present, I am innocent as a child unborn - I hope I may be struck this moment dead if I am guilty of it.</p>

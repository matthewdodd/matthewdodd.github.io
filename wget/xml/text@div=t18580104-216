I was on duty on 24th Dec., and Knapp pointed out the prisoners to me—they walked together about twenty yards; they then got near the Victoria Theatre; one crossed to the theatre, and the other to the Marsh—I said to the male prisoner, "You have got some bad poin about you?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Do you know that woman who has just parted from you?"—he said, "No"—she was then within a yard or two of him, going across the road—I said, "I shall take you to the station, as she has passed a bad half crown"—as we went along I heard something drop, but did not stop to search—I searched him at the station, but found nothing on him the first time—I went back to see the woman brought in by Knapp, and seeing the male prisoner very uneasy I searched him again, and found five half crowns between the leather and the cloth of his cap, and a florin in his waistcoat pocket—I said, "You are very clever, certainly"—I had searched both those places before, and they were not there—he might have had them in his hand or in his mouth—whenthe woman came in, she said, "That is my son"—I said, "You passed a bad half crown to Mr. Knapp"—she said that she did not know it was bad, she had it of her son, and gave it back to him when she found it was bad—I searched the place where I heard something fall, but found nothing.</p>

I saw the prisoner take a pair of shoes, belonging to my brother, from the table in his lodging: the shoemaker's wife had just brought them. I followed her to a public-house, and asked her to give them to me, but she would not - I had known her, but not where she lived; I am sure she is the woman; it was this day four weeks: I have never seen them since, and did not see her again till she was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came in to see her aunt - the witness was sitting there, and the shoes came in; I said according to my country fashion, these shall pay the beverage, half a pint of gin; I put them into my apron, and went to the public-house, sat down, and said, "Shall I pawn them for half-a-pint of gin?" the woman, her brother, and another were there, and we went to another house - what became of the shoes I do not know, as I took a drop too much. I sent my child on the Saturday week following, and offered two half-crowns to pay for them.</p>

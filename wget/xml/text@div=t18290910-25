On the morning of the 29th of July her basket was brought to me by one of the other workwomen; I found in it a piece of calico and a small quantity of oats and beans: when she came in Mr. Jay and myself taxed her with having some property in her basket - she at first denied it, but afterwards confessed that there was some property in it; the officer was then sent for, who went to her lodgings, where we found the other articles charged in the indictment; I saw her again - she said, "I know I have done very wrong, and I hope Mr. Jay will be merciful to me."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was Mr. Jay at the office at the time she said that? A. Yes; I did not press him to prosecute her - there are about twelve women in the employ now; I cannot say how many there were at that time - no person is here who heard her say the calico was in her basket; Mr. Jay and one of the clerks were present at the time: Mr. Jay was rather reluctant to prosecute - I am not aware of telling him that he ought to do it; I cannot swear I did not: I cannot identify any of these articles by a particular mark - I compared this calico with the piece we had then in use, and it matched exactly - here is a trifling stain of fruit on it, which I saw when it was taken out of the basket.</p>

I was sent for, and the prisoner was given into my custody; she begged Mr. Jay would not prosecute her, and she would never be guilty of the like again; I asked where she lived - she said at No.53, Margaret-street: I asked if she had any property belonging to Mr. Jay - she said she had, and if I would go there with her she would give it up - I took her to the office, then went and took the things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you think it your duty to question prisoners? A. I do, Sir - I did not tell her that I should use her answers against her.</p>

               <p>On the 9th of July I was at the Rotation-office in Litchfield-street, and Smith came down, I went with him to the Three Tuns in Oxford-street; I took the prisoner into custody; I waited with him till they fetched the mare out of the stable, Mr. Patie told me it was his stable; I desired they would bring it and come along with me, I took the prisoner and the mare to Litchfield-street office; the magistrates were gone out of the office; I put the prisoner into St. Ann's-watch house, and the mare I took to the White Bear livery-stable, St. Ann's Soho, I gave the stable-keeper charge of her, to suffer no person to have her but myself; at six in the evening the prisoner was brought before the magistrate and committed on suspicion according to the evidence; I enquired of him very minutely who he was, and where he had lived; I searched him and found this pocket book with several receipts in it in the name of Beadle; I told him then his name could not be Smith, as he had made out the receipt which I found in his pocket book, in the name of Smith; the receipt in his pocket book was to receive the money for a Mr. Shaw who he said lived in Long-acre, I went to enquire, and at last heard of a Mr. Shaw that had lived in Mercer-street, Long-acre, that had kept a chandler's shop and dealt in vinegar, which he told me; the prisoner did not say Mercers-street, he told me Long-acre; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090009"></xptr>found several receipts in his pocket book as receipts from Mr. Shaw, some for grocery and some for vinegar, and upon enquiry the people could not tell me where he was: but he was gone away; then the prisoner told me he had the mare from a miller at Lee Bridge out of his marshes, I think his name was Hodges; I went down to Lee Bridge to enquire, and on enquiry there I found they had had none in the marshes for a considerable time; the prisoner farther informed me that he had left word at the turnpike gate at Lee Bridge to inform Mr.

             the miller that he had taken Mr. Shaw's mare from the marshes; upon enquiry at the turnpike gate they told me they had had no such message; and Hodges told me he had not had one in the marshes for some time past; he referred me to the marsh driver at Hackney, to know if any had been strolling about; the marsh driver said he had not seen any; and I got a direction to Mr. Dodd; the prosecutor swore to his mare and the prisoner was committed; when the prosecutor came up to town he gave me a description of a man he suspected, that had been at his stables, which answered to the description the prisoner gave to me of Shaw; and according to the description given when he came to town and saw the prisoner, says he, that is not the man I suspected; he then described a person that seemed to me to answer the description that the prisoner had given me of Shaw.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Dodd. What sort of a mare was your mare? - A black mare about fifteen hands high or better, two white feet behind, ten or a dozen years old, but she was past eight; there was a man came into the stable on the Tuesday night, before I lost the mare, and he asked my servant if he could tell him of a job, I was in the yard but he said nothing to me, but turned out of the stable again; he appeared to have a shortish white waistcoat on, about my pitch, I rather suspected the man, after the prisoner was taken I said to Mr. Dalton, this is not the man I suspected him to be; I have no other reason for suspecting the other man, he was a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find out a man of the name of Shaw that they talked of? - No, I do not know any such man; I have enquired, but not heard of such a man; I never saw the prisoner before.</p>

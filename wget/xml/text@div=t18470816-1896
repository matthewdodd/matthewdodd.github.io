                  </hi> I live in Queen-street, Seven Dials. I have known the prisoner for two years and a half, and cohabited with her for some time—we have been parted for the last ten months—on Saturday, the 14th of Aug., as I was standing in Newport-market, selling my goods, the prisoner came up to me and gave me a blow on the side of my head with her fist—I went away from my barrow, and left the boy Bradley in charge of it, to avoid any dis<lb></lb>turbance—I then came back and saw her following the barrow—I saw her speaking to Bradley, and I told him not to give her any money—on that she began to abuse me, and struck me with something that she had in her hand—I cannot say what it was—it must have been a knife, but I thought it was a key—I held up my arm to prevent her striking me, and it went into my</p>

                  </hi> I was by when the prisoner struck the prosecutor, I believe with her fist—he went away and left me in charge of his barrow—when he came back the prisoner was asking me for money—I said I had none to give her—with that Allen came running alongside, and said to me, "Bradley, give her no money"—I said I had none to give her—with that she ran over to him, and made several blows at him with her hand—he said, "You have got a key in your hand, have you not?"—she said, "No, I wish I had, for your sake"—he took off his coat, and said "Oh, she has stabbed me; she has cut me"—she ran away and cried out "Murder!"—the blood ran down his arm very much.</p>

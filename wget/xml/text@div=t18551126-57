                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 498). About 1 o'clock in the morning of 21st Nov. I was on duty near the tunnel of the Regent's Canal, in the neighbourhood of the Caledonian-road—I heard the cries of a woman in the water—I heard the words "Oh, dear!" several times—I immediately ran to the place from whence the noise proceeded, and turned my light on the water—the cries were still continuing—I could not see any object in the water—in a moment or two Pettit, another officer, came up—I went and roused the men at the house, and asked them whether there was not a skiff or some kind of boat—I returned to where Pettit was, in a few minutes—I saw a boat coming along with the two prisoners in it—I ran, and met them some fifty or sixty yards from the mouth of the tunnel, and called out to them that there was a woman drowning in the tunnel, and to save her if they could, and Pettit told them something after the same manner, when they got to where he was—they then went into the tunnel, and Pettit called out to know whether they had got her, and they said, "Yes"—I then went and met them at the other end of the tunnel—I then saw the body of a woman—she was being towed behind the boat some two or three yards—the rope was tied to the stern of the boat—both the prisoners were in the boat—constable N 478, and another man, assisted to pull her out—I saw her pulled out—the rope was round underneath her arms, with a slip noose—her arms were crossed, and the rope was enclosed in her left hand—her fingers were round the rope—it was about 5 minutes past 1 o'clock when the prisoners' boat went into the tunnel, and about 20 minutes to 2 o'clock when it came out at the other end—the tunnel is about three quarters of a mile long—the cries of the woman had ceased when the boat entered the tunnel.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 103). I heard Ratcliff calling for assist<lb></lb>ance, and went to the spot—I turned my light into the tunnel—I did not see the woman—I could see some white clothing on the top of the water very plainly—she was crying out, "Oh, dear! oh, dear!" and went down, and came up again—about a minute and a half afterwards I saw the boat in which the prisoners were, coming towards the tunnel—I spoke to the prisoners, and told them there was some one drowning in the water, and the body had gone down about fifteen or sixteen yards from the mouth of the tunnel—the boat went into the tunnel, and I called to them directly afterwards, "Have you got her?"—they answered, "Aye, I have got her"—the boat at that time might have been from eighteen to twenty yards in the tunnel—as near as I can tell, from the time I saw the white clothing going down into the water till they told me they had got her, was about a minute—I did not go to the other end of the tunnel—I returned to my beat.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 478). I was at the other end of the tunnel when the boat emerged from it—the woman was floating in the water, tied with a rope round underneath her arms to the stern of the boat—when the boatmen gave me the rope to pull her ashore, the rope was in her left hand—I called Ratcliff's attention to it—I am quite clear that the rope was actually in her hand—it was distinctly in between her fingers, as if she was holding it—the prisoners were asked at the station why they did not take her into the boat—they said she was dead, and they thought they had better drag her through, and give her up to the policemen when they got to the other end.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">—BRADFORD</hi>. I am a surgeon and physician, of No. 4, York<lb></lb>place, Islington<lb></lb>green. Between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning in ques-tion I was called to the station to see the body of a woman—life was completely extinct at that time—there was slight remaining warmth over the region of the heart, but that is no proof of existing vitality—in my judgment, she had been dead about half or three quarters of an hour—her death was caused by drowning—if she had been taken out of the water at this end of the tunnel, and proper means applied, I have little doubt but that she would have recovered—it is very rare indeed that life is restored after five minutes' complete submersion, but there are two or three such cases on record—there is hope after five minutes, but very little—from the evidence, I have formed an opinion as to whether she was dead at the time the rope was put round her waist—I will not go so far as to say that she had her faculties when she caught hold of the rope—it was an instinctive effort—I cannot say it would be evidence of mind to form a purpose—</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">expressed an opinion that this case hardly came within the rule of law which constituted the crime of manslaughter; in order to convict, the Jury must be satisfied that death was caused by an unlawful act on the part of the prisoners; no unlawful act of commission was alleged; but an unlawful act of omission, such as want of due care in driving, or gross neglect in the discharge of a duty, would render them responsible; he was, however, at a loss to see how those instances applied to such a case as the present; in his opinion, it was not a case in which to convict them of felony; and if the Jury concurred in that opinion, it would be unnecessary to call upon them for their defence.

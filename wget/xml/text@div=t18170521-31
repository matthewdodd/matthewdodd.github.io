On the 15th of May, the prisoner came into the shop and picked out the articles stated in the indictment, I tied them up and made out the bill, which came to 2l. 6s. 4d.; she opened her purse, as if to pay me, and then asked for some sarsnet shoe-ribbon, to get which I must go into the inner shop; suspecting her, I persuaded her to have galloon, and went to the other side of the shop for it, and saw her take up the parcel and go out; I followed, and saw her at a distance - She began to run - I came up to her in Newport-market, and took hold of her; she said if I would let her go she would come back directly; she said she was in search of her little boy, who had run down the court; she had the parcel in her hand. I took her back. I had not seen any little boy with her-there was no person with her.</p>

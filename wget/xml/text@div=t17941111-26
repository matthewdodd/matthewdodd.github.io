               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Newbank. Is this Mr. Richards hand writing? (shews the note) - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Have you been in the habit of transmitting bills or money to Messrs. Smith and Oldfield to the care of Mr. Whitely? - Yes, some years back.</p>
               <p>Q. You returned in this country on the 23d of July? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Whitely was taken up had you any conversation on the subject? - He has called on me at my lodgings before he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you arrived? - I had a letter from him dated the 27th of July, four days after I arrived, I am not certain as to the period, this letter is dated the 27th.</p>
               <p>Q. After you received the letter how soon did you see Mr. Whitely? - He called on me in a very few days, perhaps two or three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have any conversation on the subject of this bill of exchange? - I gave him home the account current addressed to Smith and Oldfield.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. You say you gave Mr. Whitely the account current? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You have for some years received propery for the estate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have been directed by the assignees to transmit the different accounts? - The direction was to direct the letters for Messrs. Smith and Oldfield to the care of Mr. Whitely, Jamaica Coffee-house, London.</p>
               <p>Q. How come you to give the account current to Mr. Whitely? - I thought I was doing right, I had not heard that he had made a failure, and I thought I was doing very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Newbank, had you any concerns with Mr. Whitely for his own affairs? - I carried a power of attorney, since he was a bankrupt.</p>
               <p>Q. That property belonged to a lady, who was a bankrupt in this country? - It might, but I knew nothing about that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Richards give you any money in Jamaica? - He gave me a bill for five hundred and sixty-nine pounds, and says, I assure you this matter would have been settled long ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Whitely has any claim on Richards in any other manner, as an estate of his own? - Mr. Whitely said so; but as he has been a bankrupt, I don't know how that is.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. I would ask you one question, were you ever desired by Richards to transmit any thing to Whitely? - Never; he told me he wished he was clear of the business.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever authorize the prisoner to receive the money on any bills? - We never authorized him to do it, but he did do it.</p>
               <p>Q. He used to collect the concern of his estate for your use? - No money ever was received by him, except the amount of one bill drawn by John Brown, and this money that he received out of this bill, I knew nothing of it, the other that he received with it was a bill drawn by one in Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on your knowledge? - I knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the letters came to you, directed to Mr. Whitely, did he open them? - Yes; he got the bills accepted, and then brought them to us.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you give him any power or authority? - No, never did; I was satisfied with what he did, I thought he was honest.</p>
               <p>Q. Respecting the bill in the present indictment, when did you first learn that any such bill had arrived? - I called on Mr. Newbank as soon as he came to England; in the mean time Mr. Whitely called, and he had the account current.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - On the 6th of August, I saw Mr. Newbank, Mr. Newbank had given him the original account current, and he had a copy of it, which he shewed to me, and I saw there were two bills missing, of which I knew nothing of.</p>
               <p>Q. Is one the bill which was produced? - Yes; it is a bill of five hundred pounds, drawn on Armstrong.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that Mr. Whitely called? - Before I saw Mr. Newbank, and he took away the account current; afterwards I saw Mr. Newbank.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days? - But a few days. When I saw Mr. Newbank, he shewed me the account current, which he had given to Mr. Whitely, and he said there were two bills sent to us that were missing, one was a five hundred pounds; I knew nothing of that bill till I saw him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Had you before at all learned that any such bill had been sent? - No knowledge of it at all, that it never was sent. I met Mr. Whitely in Change-alley, I told him I had just parted with Mr. Newbank; he was very much surprised at it; I asked him if he had seen them two bills, the five hundred pounds one, and the other, and why he had not given them to us?</p>
               <p>Q. You say this was on the 6th of August, what did he say to that? - He told me that he had given the bill or bills to Mr. Oldfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you mentioned both these bills to him? - Yes, both; I told him that Mr. Newbank said he had the account current; he said he would give it to me, he was coming the next day opposite to me, and he would bring them at the same time, if he had them at home<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110060"></xptr>he would bring them the next day about twelve o'clock; he said he would bring the bills, if he had got them at home, to me, the same time as he brought the account current.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did he ever bring the bills to you? - No, he never did, he did not bring the account current, but sent it in a letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got that letter about you? - I have; he mentions the bills, but he did not particularize them.(The letter read by the clerk of the court.)"8th of August 1794.</p>

               <p>Witness. These two bills must be that of five hundred pounds, and that of one hundred and ninety pounds, because there were no other bills come from the West indies but these.</p>

            Was it pledged in secret, or fairly and openly? - Fairly, openly, and honestly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether Mr. Whitely had any claim on Mr. Richards, in Jamaica? - I have heard so, but I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. If you thought it had been a bad bill you would not have done it? - No.</p>

            From whom did you understand this bill was for, for himself as his own bill? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as you understood it as his own bill, you lent him the money? - Yes, I lent him the money; I believed it to be his own bill.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood it was on his own account? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you discount it? Did he endorse it? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. It was not necessary for him to have it endorsed, he never asked him to have it discounted, he only lent him the money on the bill, and expected him to have it back again in a little time.</p>

I did not miss the goods till next morning between nine and ten o'clock; the young person, my assistant, Elizabeth Johnson, missed her cloak, which could not be found; there were about thirty dozen of tapes upon the counter, and upon examining them I missed four dozen and a half; I had just marked them when the prisoners came in, and I knew that no other persons, but the prisoners, had been near that part of the shop; I then got a search-warrant, I went with an officer, and found the prisoner, Elizabeth Price, who said, her husband was behind the bed; where we found the prisoner, Slithe, and in a box, we found a part of the tapes; the officer found some duplicates in a tumbler, and upon taking down the tumbler, the officer found a duplicate of a cloak.</p>
               <p>Court. The cloak is not in this indictment.</p>
               <p>Patten. We then went to Deptford, where we found the remainder of the tapes, at the house of the elder woman, Mary Price; there were fourteen pieces, and the officer brought them to town.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. There was another person, of the name of Nicholson, with them? - A. Yes; he was discharged by the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Slithe's house, the woman at once told you, my husband is behind the bed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They lived together as man and wife? - A. They were certainly in one apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the old lady's house, did she not tell you that you were extremely welcome to search all over the house? - A. That she certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you made a considerable search about the house without finding any thing? - A. At first we did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the old woman say, there is one room in the house that I have not been in since my poor husband's death, and you have not searched that room? - A. No; she said, to the officer, there is a room up stairs, but there has been nobody in it for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that the room in which you found the tapes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the old woman, herself, direct you to the room? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You found that she had lost her husband? - A. Yes; on the Monday as they came to our house on the Tuesday, I thought it a very shocking affair.</p>
               <p>Q. She paid you for all that she bargained for? - A. Yes; she bought a black bonnet and some black crape.</p>
               <p>Q.Articles which were necessary for mourning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That which she bought, I believe, exceeded in value what was taken from you? - A. Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not her daughter come in while you were in the house? - A. Yes; she said, she had had it from her sister Slithe, that she had given it to her; and the old woman said she knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q.In what state did you find the tapes at the old woman's? - A. In a paper which had my private mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no private marks upon those you found at Slithe's? - A.No; the papers were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the old woman bear a good character in the neighbourhood? - A. I have heard quite the contrary this morning, from a man that lodged in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were there in the shop at the time? - A.There was the young person, Elizabeth Johnson, my wife, and my son.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Lambeth-street; On Wednesday the 13th of February, the prosecutor came to the office for a search-warrant; I went with him to No. 1, Rupert-square, I asked the woman that kept the house what room Slithe lived in; she directed me up one pair of stairs; I knocked at the door, and Mrs. Slithe let me in, or a little girl that was there, I am not certain which; I asked her if she had a husband; she said, yes, he was behind the bed, dressing himself; there was a screen placed round the bed to hide it; he came out from behind the screen, and I knew him; I told him I had a search-warrant; he said I was very welcome to search; I then went round the bed to search the bed, but found nothing there; I then looked under the foot of the bed, and saw a trunk there, I listed up the lid of the trunk, and there I saw some tape; the prosecutor looked at it, and said, that is part of the tape, (produces it): I then looked round the room, and in a tumbler I saw some duplicates, I took down the tumbler, and took out ten or twelve; I laid them down upon the table to see if any of them led to any thing that I wanted; one was for a cloak pawned for twelve shillings; when I laid them down, Slithe took up that duplicate, with some more of them, and looked over them; I desired him to give me that duplicate; he did not consent to that, but put it into his mouth, trying to swallow it; I put my hand to his throat, and he put it out again; then I took him into custody, and desired the prosecutor to bring his wife, which he did, and they were fully committed.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are the numbers of my tapes, but they have no marks upon them, they are too narrow to be marked; here are two dozen of No. 13, and three pieces of 139.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Griffiths.) When these tapes were found, did Slithe say where he had them from? - A. He said they were his own.</p>

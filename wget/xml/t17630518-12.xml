I was abroad, carrying news-papers to my customers, and my wife was gone to look after my father's house, who was dead; I had fastened the back door with a bolt on the inside, and a double spring-look at the sore-door; I had put a great board up for a window-shutter and fastened it with two broomsticks a-cross on the inside; I went out on Sunday the 17th of April, and returned on Tuesday morning, I found the whole frame of a lower window was beaten into the house. I never saw the prisoner in my life till now. The other witnesses can give a farther account.</p>

            . I live about a mile from the prosecutor. (He produced a white linnen handkerchief.) This was delivered to me by John Appleton's wife the same night the prisoner was taken; I being constable, was sent for to take the prisoner in custody.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This handkerchief I laid upon a pair of chest of drawers when I went out, it is my property, I know it by two oilet-holes, I saw my wife make them, she used to wear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where there any other goods of value in the house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There were gowns and things of my wife's, and a great deal of linnen, and my wearing apparel.</p>

            . I was going by the prosecutor's house on the 18th of April, some of the neighbours said, they heard a man breaking the house, I went in and found the prisoner in a lower room; I led him out of the house, and saw him drop a handkerchief after he was out, it fell from his breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Whitmel. It was day light; a woman took up the handkerchief and gave it to me. I cannot say this is the same, it having been out of my custody. I searched him and found nothing upon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>The next morning I asked them to shew me the place. I was fuddled. If I was to die, I do not know any thing of it. The people wanted me to make my will and power to them, then they said they would clear me; then they asked me for half a guinea, and I had nothing to give them. I have nobody to speak for me but God Almighty.</p>
               <p>Q. to Whitmel Did you hear any such offer made the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Whitmel. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>The constable answered the same.</p>
               <p>Q. to Whitmel. Do you know which way he got in?</p>
               <p>Whitmel. I found the two doors open; the window was broke so that he might get in.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you reside at this house? A. Yes; it is full of lodgers - the copper was fitted to the place, and matched exactly.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE called -</p>
               <p>MRS. CLANCEY. I recollect a person employing the prisoner to take this copper on Wednesday week to Charing-cross; it was a tall man with a brown coat on - he met him in Theobald's-road.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know the prisoner before? A. No; I live in New Tothill-street, Westminster, nearly a mile from Theobald's-road - I had seen the prisoner before; I had been to meet a person in the King's-road - I then met the prisoner, and walked with him; the man came up to him about the middle of Theobald's-road - he wore trousers and shoes; I did not notice his waistcoat - he offered the prisoner 1s. to carry it; the prisoner said he would take it, if it was not very heavy - I did not see the copper then; I walked on, and left them together - I did not see the 1s.; it was between five and six o'clock in the evening - I cannot tell who the prisoner worked for that day.</p>

            . I live with Clancey. I was with her when the man came, and asked the prisoner which way he was going - he said towards Westminster; he said,"You are going all in my way, will you take a copper for me?" he said, "Yes, if it is not heavy;" he said, "It is in a basket, and I will give you 1s." - I then went home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you servant to the witness? A. No; I get my living by making knapsacks - I had never seen the other man before; he had a carpenter's apron, black trousers, and brown coat - I had been to Gray's Inn-lane to see Mrs. Clancey's sister; I had seen the prisoner before - he works for the same master as I do; I did not see the 1s. - this was near Gloucester-street, about the middle of Theobald's-road.</p>

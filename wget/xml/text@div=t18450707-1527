                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Uppingdale; we live at No. 16, South-place, Lower-road—it is our dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Mary, Islington. On the 28th of March I sent for the prisoner, whom I did not know before, but she was recommended to me, as I was without a servant—she was to stop with me two or three weeki, till I was suited, or she was called away—she came about eleven o'clock—she complained of the toothache in the course of the day, and at a quarter before seven she said she would go and have her tooth drawn—she left, and as she was going out at the door she said she would not be any longer than she could help—she did not return, and about twelve o'clock that night I observed my keys lying on the drawers in my bed-room—I usually kept them in my pocket, but I had not put on the same dress that morning which I had worn the day before—I had left them by mistake in the pocket of that dress upstairs—I had thought of them in the morning, and had sent my little girl up stairs for them whilst the prisoner was there, but she could not find them—I kept my drawers locked, and there was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a purse in the drawer—I had seen it safe a few hours before—I unlocked the drawer where the money had been—I found it locked as I had left it, but the purse and money were gone—to the best of my know<lb></lb>ledge there had been five sovereigns, thirty half-crowns, and one or two shillings in it—I misled it directly I opened the drawer—next morning I missed a shawl, a small pair of trowsers, and a brooch—I think the trow<lb></lb>ers had been in the bed-room—the brooch was in a looking-glass drawer in the same room where the drawers were, and the shawl in a large chest in the same room—they were all my husband's—the shawl was worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the brooch 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the money was in a steel purse lined with blue silk—the prisoner had asked me what she should do, and I said, "You had better go up stairs and clean the bed-room," and I saw her there.</p>

               <p>daughter about fourteen, a boy ten years old, and another eight—I had no person in the house beside my own family and the prisoner—no one but the prisoner had been in the bed-room—my mother might have been there—I think she was in the parlour, but not in the bed-room—my father-in-law might have been in the shop, but not up stairs—my husband had been home to tea—he and my little girl went after tea to the theatre—I had gone up into the bed-room whilst the prisoner was cleaning it, I suppose about an hour after she came—she was at work—I did not then look to see whether the money was safe—I did not observe anything sus<lb></lb>picious—I thought she might have done more in the time—the room seemed to have been dusted, and she was just about wetting it—this rob<lb></lb>bery was on the 28th of March, and I did not see the prisoner again till she was in custody—the journeyman baker had recommended her as a hard-working person, and she had been nursing his wife—I made no further inquiries.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 211.) I saw the prisoner in custody at the station, on Monday, the 23rd of, June—I heard the inspec<lb></lb>tor read over the charge—he said to her, "You have no occasion to say anything without you like, you are charged with stealing"—there was a baker there who said that was the person that he had recommended, and who stole the sovereigns—I brought the prisoner to the police court, and as she was going she said a great many lies had been told about her, that there was nothing near so much money as 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and as to the brooch she knew nothing about it—at the police court she said she must have been out of her mind when she did it—and at the court, and before she went to the court, she said that the pair of trowsers that there was so much fuss made about, were a boy's pair of trowsers—I said I thought they were men's trowsers—the boy was in the court.</p>

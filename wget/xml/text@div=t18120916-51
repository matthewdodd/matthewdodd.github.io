               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you tell her she had better confess - A. No. I said, I must search through the house. I sent for a friend, a Mr. Blundle, and proposed to search her box, to which she agreed. When I went to search her box, she told me she had the sarsnett, and she would give it me. I searched her box. In her box I found ribbon and some grey sarcenet, which I had lost three weeks before. The lace was found in her linen, and afterwards fifteen yards of ribbon in her box, and the muslin I found in her dirty linen. The prisoner said they were mine.</p>

            . I live in Bishopsgate-street. I am a haberdasher. On the 22d of August, Miss Collis came to my house. I accompanied her home. I saw the prisoner. Miss Collis told her, she suspected that she had robbed her; it was necessary she should search her box, as well as every other box in the house. In my presence the prisoner's box was opened. The prisoner produced the key. We found some figured sarcenets and ribbon. The prisoner said to Miss Collis, that is your's. We then sent for the officer.</p>
               <p>MISS GREGORY. After the prisoner was taken to the Mansion House I found some lace and ribbon. The officer has them.</p>
               <p>- DRINEWATER. I am an officer. I searched the prisoner's box. I found a bit of blue silk, and this bit of grey sarcenet. The prisoner and Miss Collis were present.

               <p>in upper Manor-place, Chelsea. I have the charge of the vaules under the New Church at Chelsea, and keep the keys—there are three public vaults—a person named Hillyer is the constant grave-digger—the prisoner assisted him occasionally—Hillyer was often intrusted with the keys to get matting out, to cover the graves over, when he was going to dig a deep grave—he had only to go to a place just at the entry of the vaults, which was separated by an iron railing from the vaults—on the 23rd of March, there was to be a funeral in one of the public vaults at two o'clock—all the arrangements were made for it—the place had been previously selected where the coffin was to be placed—there was nothing to do, as to looking for the coffins of the relatives or anything of that sort—I gave the key to John<lb></lb>son, the gate-keeper, that day—he went down to sweep the place up, about an hour or so before the funeral took place—the prisoner had no business in the vault at all—he was not employed by me—there was nothing for him to do there—after the funeral, in consequence of something that transpired a search was made in the vaults, and we missed some handles and plates from the coffins—there was a brass plate gone from Mrs. Lucy Goddard's coffin.</p>

About one o'clock on the 23rd of March, my father sent me to the vault where the funeral was to take place—I did not find any one in the vault the first time—the second time I went, about half-past one, I found the prisoner there in among the coffins, with a candle out of a candlestick—I asked what busi<lb></lb>ness he had there—he said he was looking at the names on the coffins—he did not say what for—the candle then touched something, and went out—I do not know whether it was done by accident or for the purpose—the place was then dark, and I could not see what was going on—I went to fetch a light, and was gone five or ten minutes—he got out, and went to a flue to warm himself—he was not in the vault when I came sack.</p>

                  </hi>. I assist Clarkson occasionally. On the 23rd of March I was at his place, and saw the prisoner come there with some brass and lead—Clarkson bought it of him—I forget what the amount was—it was weighed—Clarkson went out, and while he was gone I said to the pri<lb></lb>soner, "You have been shaking the dead, have you not," (I had looked at the brass on a former occasion, and saw what it was)—he said, "It is a perquisite I and my mate have, we belong to the churchyard, and we dug it up"—I afterwards saw the plate unfolded, and saw the name of "Lucy Goddard" on it—I sold that with other brass at Mr. Frost's, a large dealer, who buys it for melting.</p>

The prisoner came to our shop on Saturday evening last, about eight o'clock, and asked to look at some ribbons - I showed her some - she said she wanted narrow white ribbon - I placed the drawer on the counter, and she ordered one yard and a half of one, and two yards of another, to be cut off - she had not asked any price, which made me suspect she had taken some - there was another person in the shop, at a distance - I turned my head, and when I looked round I missed one of the ribbons, and charged her with it - she immediately pulled a piece from her pocket - I think I had said,</p>
               <p>"You have got a piece of ribbon in your pocket;" she had not gone from the shop - I then said,</p>
               <p>"How many more have you got;" she was putting her hand again to her pocket, and I got over the counter and took her to the end of the shop - she said she had laid two half-crowns on the counter - it is very unusual for women to come into a shop and take ribbons without asking the price - no other person served her - I saw her come in; and as soon as I took her to the end of the shop, she said she had put two half-crowns on the counter, which I had not seen before - I went and found one on the counter, and one in the drawer.</p>

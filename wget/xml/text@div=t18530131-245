                  </hi>. I live in Neptune-place. On 11th Jan. I was standing at the bar of the Cock and Neptune public house, about 7 o'clock in the evening—the prisoner stood talking to me at the bar, and he took the money out of my pocket—he is the man—I had seen him before in houses where I have been—while I was standing at the bar, be came and took the money out of the frock that I had on—he took three shillings, a sixpence, and twopence—I am quite sure I had the money safe before, but I was in liquor—I did not see him take the money out of my pocket, and I did not feel him, but a little boy did—I did not know the little boy's name—I missed the money out of my pocket when the little boy told me—the prisoner was near enough to hear what the boy told me—he said, "Young woman, the money is taken out of your pocket;" and he showed me the young man—directly the prisoner took my money, he went out of the door—I saw him go out, I followed him and overtook him—I asked him for my money; he bit me, and knocked me down—there was a young man standing outside—I did not see the prisoner give the man anything—I did not see him give anything to any man—I gave ray evidence before the Magistrate—it was read over to me—this is my mark to it—(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition stated</hi>—"He went out, and I saw him give another man some money.")</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Mr. Turner's-buildings, about five minutes walk from the Cock and Neptune—I am employed near the Cock and Neptune—on the evening when this woman says she was robbed, I was standing at my employer's door—the prisoner and another man came along almost on a run in a direction from the Cock and Neptune—directly they got opposite where I was standing, the prisoner opened his band, and said to the other man, "Silver by G—; so help me Christ, let us go back"—and I think the remainder of the sentence was, "for more"—he went back, and I followed him—I saw this woman, and heard her charge him with taking money out of her pocket—I then turned back.</p>

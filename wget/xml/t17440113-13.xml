The Prisoner's mother unfortunately came to my house, and desired me to assist her, for her daughter was accused with taking these things; I went according to her mother's desire to see whether it was true, and I lifted up her coats and apron to see whether she had the things; she untied her petticoats and the things fell to the ground; I never asked her how she came by them, for I was in a very great fright; Mrs. Reynolds said they were her things; the Prisoner lay with me some time before, at her mother's desire, and was very just and honest to me, I lost nothing; I have not a lock upon my drawers, and there are things of great value in them. <rs id="t17440113-13-verdict72" type="verdictDescription">

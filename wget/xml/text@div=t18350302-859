                  </hi>. I keep a cheesemonger's shop in Thomas's-street, Woolwich. On the morning of the 6th of February, I was called by my servant, at the request of John Montier—this is my bacon—it was then on the counter—I know it to be mine, by some marks on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gunner in the horse artillery. About eight o'clock that morning, I went to the prosecutor's shop—I saw the prisoner come in—she asked for half an ounce of coffee—the young man did not leave off serving me to serve her—I saw her go to where the bacon was—she made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at one piece, but did not get it—she then <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> a second piece, and got that, and came again to the counter—I said to the young man, "You may serve this good woman, I am in no great hurry"—he then served her with coffee, and she then called for one pennyworth of butter, and I saw her go and take another piece of bacon—she came to the counter again, and gave one shilling to pay for what she bought—she got her change, and when she got to the door, I said to her, "My good woman, I want you," and I took her by the shoulders—she then said, "I am <hi rend="italic">done</hi> "—I called the young man from behind the counter—I took this bacon from her lap, and asked if he knew this, bacon—he said he did—I put it on the counter.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner handed in a petition, representing herself and family to be in great distress.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am the last witness's daughter, and the prisoner's sister—I am blind—I live with my parents—I remember my brother being taken in custody—the night before that he came home at 6 to his tea, and did not go out afterwards—he went to bed at 10 o'clock—our family gen<lb></lb>erally sit in the same room, and take our meals together—I usually sit with my mother, and did so that evening—we can hear Mandslay's bell ring from our house at twenty minutes to 6, and again at 6, morning and evening, and we can hear <hi rend="italic">Big Ben,</hi> and have a clock which keeps time with it—I therefore know that my brother went to bed about the time I mention—I went and fetched his candle down, and bade him good-night—I am able to go about</p>

               <p>the house without assistance—I do for my poor mother, who is an invalid—I said, "Good-night, <hi rend="italic">Sam;</hi>" and he said, "Good-night, <hi rend="italic">Till"</hi>—he was then in bed, judging from my hearing—I sleep with my mother, on the same floor as my brother and father—from the house being small we are able to hear any noise readily of persons moving—my mother frequently requires assistance in the course of the night, but I do not recollect whether she did on this night—she has been an invalid for years, and I have waited on her, and have become a very light sleeper—to the best of my knowledge, from the time my brother went to bed, there was no person moving in the house, till between 5 and 6, and next morning I heard him jump out of bed when my father called to him—I know my father's voice and my brother's distinctly—I heard my brother dressing himself, and heard him leave the house, but heard no conversation—that was about a quarter to 6—the bell was ringing when he was dressing—if he had got out of bed in the night he would have disturbed me, and he could not have got back again if he had gone out—I was examined before the police Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do I understand you to say that no one moved in the house between 10 and half-past 5? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I heard—my father was in bed—I heard him come home about half-past 10, and I called, and said, "Is that you, father?"—he said, "It is."</p>

LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might it have been later than half-past 10? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but I cannot say to a few minutes—I hear the clock strike nearly every hour in the day—no imputation was ever cast upon my brother's character before, to my knowledge—he has always borne an honest character, as far as I know, and has always been in employment.</p>

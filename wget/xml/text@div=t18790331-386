                  </hi>. I am attached to the Missing Letter Branch of the General Post-office—on 18th March, in consequence of instructions, I went to the Eastern District office and made up a test letter; I put in it two half-sovereigns, two sixpences, and 53 penny postage stamps, and addressed it to Mrs. S. Bouts, 10, Park Street, Church Street, Stoke Newington, London—I fastened it, and posted it about 1.45 the same day in the Eastern District</p>

               <p>office, having previously called the attention of Mr. Maloney, the overseer, to it—I saw the prisoner at the office that day from about 1.30 to about 2.30—I saw him stamp the letters, among which this one had been placed; I had seen Mr. Maloney place it with those letters, and I saw him withdraw it from the others and place it by his side—he took it up with two other packets and walked round the office, endeavouring apparently to force the coins out of the letter; he was pulling the letter about—he took up a basket and covered his left breast with it; it was a shallow basket used for carrying letters in—he placed the letter underneath his tunic under his left arm; he kept his arm very close to his side, then threw down the basket and the other two packets and left the office; he was out about two minutes—on his return he was taken into a private room upstairs, and I said to him, "I am an officer from the Missing Letter Branch; did you stamp the inwards letters this afternoon from 2.15 to 2.30"—he said "Yes"—this was an inwards letter—I said, "Did you see a letter addressed to Mrs. S. Bouts, 10, Park Street, Church Street, Stoke Newington?"—he said "No"—I said, "I posted that letter; it was placed with those you say you stamped, it is now missing; do you know anything about it?"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—shortly after that I told Moore to search him; he put his hand in his pockets, but could not find the letter—from what I had noticed I told the prisoner to take off his trousers—he demurred at first; he then took them off and threw them on the floor—Moore took them up, and the letter fell out of the left leg of the trousers—I said, "This is the letter I have been asking you about; have you any explanation to offer?"—he said, "I have nothing to say"—he afterwards said, "I must acknowledge it now"—I then gave him into custody—this is the letter; it is still unopened.</p>

I am overseer at the Eastern District office—the prisoner was a sorter there—on Tuesday, about 1.45, from instructions I received from Mr. Bradford, I went to the letter-box and took from it this letter—I placed it with the letters which the prisoner had to stamp—I did not see him stamp it—shortly before 3, by Mr. Bradford's direction, I told the prisoner to follow me, and I took him to Mr. Bradford—I was walking before him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector at the Eastern District Post-office—on Tuesday, 18th March, the prisoner was taken into the private room—as he was going along in front of me I saw him place his hand underneath his tunic and apparently put his hand in his left-hand trousers pocket, partially draw it out again, and place it back again, as if he was anxious to conceal something.</p>

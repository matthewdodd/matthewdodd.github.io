I was coming along, and saw 'Squire Poyntz's Servant with her, but he ran away and left her; so she and I went to this uninhabited Place together. I am sure I had it when I first went thither, for I pull'd it out to tell the Fellow that ran from her what it was a Clock; but then this uninhabited Place is a Quarter of a Mile from the Place where I pull'd it out. We staid in this uninhabited Place together till Four o'Clock in the Morning; I miss'd it indeed half an Hour after I got there; and I told her I had lost it, but she knew nothing of the Matter. At last I heard it click in her Bosom, and then I struck her, and she cry'd out Murder; yet still she deny'd it, and so the Prisoner and I came together about Four o'Clock into the Town, and meeting with an Hostler that formerly belong'd to the Duke of Ormond, I told him of my Loss, and we all three went back to this uninhabited Place to look for my Watch, but 'twas not to be found; we hunted about in the Stable, (where we had been together) but we could not find it. She deny'd it all this time, and while I was talking to the Hostler, she ran away; but she was taken on Sunday Night following, and I went to her at a publick House at Kensington; there I heard the Watch was pawn'd at the Three Bowls, in Old Soho, and at that Place I found it. When I came out of the Justice's House with her, I asked her - how she could be so cross, as not to give me my Watch? And she told me, she would have given it me, if I had not beat her,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, at 249, Upper Street, Islington—on the 8th February, the prisoner came to my house and said he had called from Mr. Kendall, of 17, Armour Road, to pay an account that was owing—I had supplied goods to that house to the amount of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner gave me this cheque for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave him the change, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">The cheque was on the East London Bank, Limited, S.E. Branch, Tooley Street, dated</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">th February,</hi> 1871, <hi rend="italic">and purported to be drawn by John Powell pay<lb></lb>able to Mr. W. Kendall or bearer</hi>)—I had supplied the goods on the 2nd February, and sent them to the house—the cheque was afterwards returned—I then went to the house and found it empty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been serving the house for about a fortnight—the lady of the house came first and ordered goods; she said she was Mrs. Kendall—I never saw Mr. Kendall—I did not ask the prisoner where he got the cheque from—he did not say his uncle, Mr. Kendall, had sent him to pay the account—he did not represent himself as Mr. Kendall—I asked him to write on the back of the cheque, and he wrote "Chas. Kendall"—I supposed he was writing his own name.</p>

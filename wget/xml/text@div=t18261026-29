            . I am patrol of Cripplegate. On the 24th of October, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner passed me, with a bundle under his arm; I followed him into Philip-lane, and there stopped him; I asked what was under his arm; he said, wrappers - he had ten canvas wrappers; he said they belonged to his master. Mr. Charlsworth, of Milk-street; I took him to the Comp<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260020"></xptr>ter, and took them to Mr. Charlsworth next morning. I knew the prisoner before, but knew nothing against him.</p>

The prisoner was in our service; these wrappers are ours, and are worth 5s. - we never allow them to our servants. I had advanced his wages in November last, and stated I should have no wrappers taken - he lived two years with me, and I had a good character with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When I have sorted up the wrappers, have you not allowed me a few odd ones? A. I have allowed him brown paper, but not wrappers. He had said the wrappers were the perquisites of some warehousemen - I said I would rather advance his wages.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had the care of all his property, and could have robbed him if I had chosen; most porters think these things their perquisites; I sorted up some when I had been with him three weeks, and he gave me some small bits.</p>

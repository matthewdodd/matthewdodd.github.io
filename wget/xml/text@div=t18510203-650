                  </hi>. I am a licensed driver of carriages; I live in Cole-street, Dover-road. On 1st Feb., between one and two o'clock, I was going home, and just at the commencement of the Dover-road I met the prisoners—they both asked me to treat them—I walked with them down Swan-street to the corner of Swan-court—two men came past, stopped, and repassed, and then went round the corner of the court—I felt Scott's hand in my pocket—the men stood round me—I got alarmed, and at that moment was struck across the head with some iron instrument like a can<lb></lb>dlestick—I fell on my back, the men were then close by, and the women too—I believe it was Scott who struck me—I became insensible directly—I had had something to drink, but was not drunk—when I came to myself Scott's hand was in my pocket—I had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. there, five gold keys, and a gold seal, in a leather bag—I missed them, and called for assistance—they all left me—the things were worth about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was struck from behind; it was so instantaneous I could not see who struck me—my wife was at the door waiting for my coming home—I did not see her before I was struck; but she heard my voice and came to me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 285.) I was on duty in Swan-street, on the right-hand side. I saw two men come round the corner of the Dover-road into Swan-street, on the opposite side of the way—just after that, Wray and the two prisoners came round the corner—they went the same way as the men—Scott and Wray went into the court and Wesboro followed behind—I went up to the end of the court, and could not see the men—about three or four minutes after, I found Wray lying down in Swan-court—I had not heard the cries of "police!" or "murder!"—I saw Scott and took her in custody—I told her the charge: she said, she knew nothing about it—Wray had been drinking rather freely; his nose was bleeding, his forehead was a little swelled.</p>

               <p>Edward Hickin. I let the prisoner at the bar a ready-furnished lodging about a year and a half ago. The things mentioned in the indictment were part of the furniture. I missed them all out of the lodging-room, but never heard of them again.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to miss them?</p>
               <p>Hickin. The prisoner's wife was such a drunken extravagant woman I thought she spent more than her husband could bring in. So I went into the room on the 11th of November, and found they were gone. Then the prisoner and she went away. He came again on the 12th, and wanted to make a debt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did I not offer you, before I went away, that, if my wife would not tell where she had pawned the goods, I would make you satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Hickin. He did; but then I thought I should be never the nearer; for his wife spent his money as fast as he could get it, and it was impossible for him to get out of debt, or pay me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two people to his character; who had known him 15 years, and gave him the character of an industrious honest man.</p>

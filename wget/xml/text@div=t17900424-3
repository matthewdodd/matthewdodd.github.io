I know the prisoner; I remember his coming to my shop on Monday last; he asked me if I did not remember buying a pair of buckles of him a fortnight before, which were his wife's; says he, she has been very uneasy ever since; I told her not to make herself uneasy, and I would go to Mr. Stephens, and buy her another pair; he asked to see some buckles; I shewed him one pair; he did not like the pattern; I shewed him another pair; he did not like them; he wanted to see a pair that was larger; I shewed him a larger pair; then he pointed with his fingers to another pair, that was in the window; and I shewed him them likewise; then he said, let me see that green handled knife and fork; these buckles were on the counter, by the door; while I turned round a little to the left; when I turned back again he was run out of the shop, with all the buckles; I saw him go off the step of the door, and went after him; it might be a quarter of a minute; I just shut the door, and called stop thief; I did not lose sight of him till he was taken.</p>
               <p>What is the value of the buckles? - About four pounds.</p>
               <p>You knew him before? - I have known him some years; he has been a customer many times, which took off all suspicions<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240116"></xptr>from me of his attempting any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How many years have you known him? - Several years.</p>
               <p>You knew his family likewise? - Yes; I knew his mother these forty years.</p>
               <p>He bore a very good character? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did not you think he might be going to shew them to his wife? - No, Sir; no.</p>

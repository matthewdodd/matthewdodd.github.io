                  </hi>. I am the wife of Levy Samuel, of New Gravel-lane, Wapping. About two months ago I was at the door with my husband—the prisoner came and said he had come to London and was about to emigrate to Sydney, but he had been unfortunate, and they would not take him—my husband had known him, and he gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get a supper and bed, and invited him to dine on the Sunday—he then came to and fro to our house for about a month, and on the 16th of Dec. he went out and said he would return in five minutes, but did not—I missed these articles, which I had seen safe about five minutes before he went out—these now produced are them—they were entrusted to me on commission, and were is my custody—I did not give him authority to pledge them—I did not see him again till he was, in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Chatham. I went to the house of Solomon Harris, in Chatham, and apprehended the prisoner—Harris said he had received a pledge ticket from him, and it was gone to London—the prisoner said, "I did pawn the things"—I took him to the station, and the next morning he told roe that Mrs. Samuel gave him the things to pawn—I asked him who she was—he said she was a poor woman—as we were coming to London he said he would show me where be pawned them, and where Mrs. Samuel lived, and he did so.</p>

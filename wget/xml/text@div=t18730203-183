                  </hi>. I am a banker, at Naples, one of the firm of Thomas D'Agiout, Père et Fils—in March, 1871,. I knew there was a firm of Bowles Brothers &amp; Co., carrying on business as bankers at 449, Strand, and we were desirous of entering into business negotiations with them for the convenience of drafts—we communicated with them, and received finally this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in consequence of that We transmitted to them 300 obligations of the Lombardo-Venetian Railway Company—we afterwards withdrew 100, so that, in fact, only 200 were left—these are the bonds (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my father brought the bonds over, and made the arrangements with Bowles Brothers &amp; Co.—we never authorised them to deposit or pledge those bonds with the Union Bank—in November, last year, I heard that the firm of Bowles Brothers had stopped payment, and I came to London from Paris for the purpose of making inquiries about the bonds—on 18th November I saw the defendant at the banking-house, in the Strand, and I asked him for the debentures—the first time I saw him he said he must ask his manager where the bonds were, but I had seen Mr. Keith, the manager, before, and he had said they were pledged at the Union Bank—it was after that I saw the defendant, and he said he must ask Mr. Keith where the bonds were—I saw him afterwards on the same day, and he then said he had asked Mr. Keith, and the bonds were pledged at the Union Bank—he said he did not know anything about the business of his house, and only had to do with the luggage and reading-rooms; the luggage of the Americans—I said I was not satisfied with his answer, and that I would come the next day to have an answer, and if he did not give me a good answer, I would go to the justice—I called the next day, and saw the defendant again—he said the same thing, that he had nothing to do with the business of his firm, and that he did not know where the bonds</p>

               <p>were; that his brother Charles and Mr. Appleton had left him in a bad position; that Mr. Appleton's property would be sold, and then I should be paid—he swore to me that he never had anything to do with the business of his house—I answered him, "Mr. Bowles, I do not believe you, because you are a man of forty-three years, and are the chief head of the house, and it is not possible that you do not know the business of your own house"—he became a little angry, and said "Well, it is a felony that has been committed, but you may be sure you will be paid"—I asked him how and when, and he said "I don't know anything about that"—I said "I don't believe you; I will go before a Magistrate"—I obtained a warrant through my solicitor to arrest him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My father made the arrangement in England, and brought the bonds over with him—he made the arrangement with Mr. Charles Bowles and Mr. Stetson—my father has not come over now, because it was not necessary—I had seen some of the parties in Paris and in Italy before I came over, after the stoppage—I had an account with Mr. Charles Bowles at Nice, and Geneva, and Paris—that was with Charles Bowles alone, in my own name, not in the name of my firm—I knew him personally, and saw him very often—our firm had no transactions with Charles Bowles alone; those transactions were between firm and firm—I knew Charles Bowles about the summer of 1871—there are still unsettled accounts between him and myself—I don't know where he is now—he owes me money—we have not had advances from the London firm, or from the Paris firm, but I drew upon them—those claims are not settled yet—we are not indebted to the Paris house, independently of the bonds; nor to the London house; not at all—when Mr. Robert Bowles said it was a felony that had been committed, he said "I know nothing of your bonds; I had nothing to do with them; but it is a felony that has been committed"—when I came to London I saw Mr. Sullivan first—he is a manager also—I did not ask him about the bonds, because I did not know he was a manager in London—I knew he was manager in Paris—I asked him where I could see Mr. Keith, and I went and saw Mr. Keith—I asked him about the bonds, and he said they were at the Union Bank—I said "But how have you done that?"—he said he was a poor man, and he was obliged to do what his master directed, and I must go to a lawyer; it was not necessary to see Mr. Bowles—I saw Mr. Robert Bowles about ten minutes after that—I asked where my bonds were, and he said "I know nothing about the bonds, but I will ask Mr. Keith"—when I saw him the second time, he said "I have spoken to Mr. Keith, and I find you are right; Mr. Keith says they are at the Union Bank," but I don't recollect whether I had told him what Mr. Keith had said to me—he said "My brother has left me in a bad position; I don't know what is to be done, but I will ask Mr. Keith if something can be done to get your bonds back"—there was a reading-room at the place in the Strand—I found Mr. Keith in the reading-room—I found the defendant on the third floor—I don't know that there was a warrant to take Mr. Keith up; that was after—I have heard that since, and that he cannot be found—there was one for Mr. Sullivan also, but I knew he was gone away, because I saw him in Paris.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I applied for the warrant against the prisoner, Keith and Sullivan were still in London; I heard afterwards they had gene away, and could not be found, and after that I saw Mr. Sullivan in Paris—I had not known the firm previous to the transaction on 18th March, 1871, when my father came over—that was the first transaction we had with the</p>

               <p>firm, it was made by my father, and embodied afterwards in this document—it was in 1871 that I opened an account at Nice between myself and Charles Bowles, after the transaction in March—the negociations that I had with Charles at Nice, Geneva, and Paris were private transactions between him and myself—I don't owe him or the firm at either of these places a shilling—the second time I saw the defendant in November he said he would telegraph to America, and he could get an answer the same night, and I said "I will call to-morrow and have an answer"—he told me the second time the securities were pledged at the Union Bank—he used the word "pledge" to me—he said that ours was a credit of honour, and that he would pay us, he did not care so much about the other creditors, as ours was a credit of honour—I had seen Robert Bowles in Paris at the banking-house previous to my seeing him in London to inquire about these bonds—I saw him every day—I did not transact business with him, but I spoke with him about the business—that was the month that I took away the hundred bonds, February last year—I spoke with him and with Mr. Appleton—I said "As I am in Paris now, we don't want to have 300 bonds with you in London, and I will take 100 with me back to Naples—that was part of the Lombardo-Venetian Bonds—I got the 100 bonds in Paris and took them away—I have never transacted business with Robert Bowles, but I have spoken to him of business.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow—I did reside in Ebury Place, Pimlico—I had known the firm of Bowles Brothers previous to June, 1872—I had done business with Mr. Keith and the prisoner previous to that at the banking-house in the Strand—I had generally seen the defendant in the reading-room—the business I have done with him has been with bills of credit, and I got him to sell a bond for me at one time—in June I had in my possession some bonds of the United States Government for 6,000 dollars, also some Massachusets bonds for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling and ten South Lombardo-Venetian Central Italian Railway obligations; altogether my bonds were worth nearly 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—towards the latter end of June I took them to Mr. Keith and placed them with him for safe keeping—as he was managing clerk I gave them to him—he asked me to bring the bonds there; he said it was unsafe for me to carry them about with me, and he would place them in an iron safe for safe keeping—this is the receipt he gave me, signed by Keith for Bowles Brothers &amp; Co.—I did not give him, nor any one belonging to the firm, any authority to deal with those bonds in any way; merely for safe keeping—when I was in France I had 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in their hands—when I came back I went and asked Mr. Keith to give me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as I was going to Brighton—he offered mo 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he said he was very busy at the time, and I had better take the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and when I came from Brighton he would settle our account—he gave me 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to Brighton—I was there about ten days, and I saw the failure of Bowles Brothers &amp; Co. in the paper—I came up immediately, and went to the banking-house, and saw Mr. Keith—he said ho was very</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe the bank was first formed in Paris, and there were branch banks, one in the Strand, one in Boston, and one in New York—they had no house in Geneva—Mr. Stetson and William Bowles were in Paris—Mr. Appleton lived at Boston—I don't know how much money he brought in—I believe that Charles Bowles was the originator of the whole thing, and that the powers of attorney and authorities to sign emanate from Charles Bowles to the different members of the firm—there is a letter to the Union Bank notifying the signatures, I believe, which is signed by Charles Bowles—all the signatures are notified by that letter, I believe, except Sullivan's—I have not investigated anything beyond the state of the London house—they have transacted business the one house with the other—there is a claim by the London house against the Paris and Boston houses, not against the New York house—you can't get at the state of the whole thoroughly until they are-investigated—the claim which the London house has against Boston is. 88,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if that be a genuine claim that disposes of the 80,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. liabilities in London, but it is impossible to say until you investigate the whole—the figures stated are according to the London books—I am not aware that the claim against the Boston house of 88,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has any effect upon the liabilities that appear in the London books—it would furnish assets if the Boston house is a solvent matter—Mr. Appleton, the Boston representative, is said to be a man of very large property and inquiries have been sent out—it would be necessary to ascertain his condition before you can say what the assets are—that has not yet been ascertained—I only know from hearsay that he is a wealthy man—I believe Charles Bowles took an active part in the financial part of the business when he was in London—I find in the London letter-book financial accounts sent off frequently to Mr. Charles Bowles by Mr. Keith and Mr. Sullivan keeping him in full information of the state of the business—those accounts are referred to in the letters; they are not copied in the letter-book—I believe such statements were sent—I believe there are also letters from him giving them directions as to the financial matters—I believe Mr. Keith was the person who chiefly conducted that part of the business when Mr. Charles Bowles was away, except when Sullivan was there—I find from the books and papers that Mr. Keith went over to America in the early part of the year, and Sullivan acted in his absence, and Sullivan did what Keith had done before, and made communications with Mr. Charles Bowles, I believe—the ground floor of the premises in the Strand was occupied by other people—you immediately go up stairs on to the first floor and enter what is called the reading-room, and partitioned off there is a small banking-room with a window looking into the reading-room—the reading-room is the larger of the two—it is a corner house at the corner of Adelaide Street—you go up a flight of stairs to the room</p>

               <p>where the books are kept—the clerks' office is on the second floor; of course there were some clerks down stairs in what is called the banking-room—that was where the cash transactions were carried on, and where the cash-books were kept, I should think, because the safes were there—the registers and such things were up stairs—the manager's room was on the second floor—there were also rooms on the third floor—they were private rooms; there was one sitting-room—I can't say who that was for—there was a large number of clerks, about twenty, and most of them were on the second floor—a few were of course on the first floor—there were some adjoining premises, where luggage was deposited, but latterly I believe that has not been conducted by Bowles Brothers &amp; Co.—I believe many people did leave their luggage there—I did not know the business till after the stoppage—I have not gone into that part of it—I believe there was a large business of that kind conducted requiring an additional staff irrespective of those I have spoken of—I could not say how many—none of the letters depositing these securities of D'Agiout, Mrs. Gates, and Mr. Gardiner are in the handwriting of the defendant—I have not seen any writing of his in connection with those securities at all—Keith deposited D'Agiout's and Mrs. Gates and Charles Bowles deposited Gardiner's—the letters we have been referred to are about acceptances, discounting acceptances—that would be in the ordinary way of business—those two letters of his which speak of deposits don't refer to either of the three deposits complained off, and in the one which withdrew securities I find that loan was discharged altogether—I have not ascertained that the one where the securities are deposited were properly deposited—I have not found that there were securities deposited which had been placed with them, and permission given to cash the securities—on 14th February, Aaron &amp; Matini were debtors to the firm for 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that is not deducting the bonds—the bonds don't appear to their credit at all—on 14th February their indebtedness was 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know whether the bonds were held by them to liquidate the bill—that account had been closed altogether on 14th February—the account of Van Toile is closed altogether in the ledger, but I am not aware that those securities have been paid off altogether—I have not had any claim made by Aaron &amp; Matini—I believe they have since been returned—I have not had any claim made for any of the securities mentioned in the letter of the 14th—the 9th was the date of the stoppage, and I received the books shortly after that—I last saw Mr. Keith during the time the case was before the Lord Mayor—I believe he attended on two occasions while Mr. Robert Bowles was under remand, and the examination was going on against him—I did not see Sullivan at the Mansion House at all—I saw him at 449, Strand once, within a few days after the stoppage—they have since disappeared—I heard Mr. Keith had gone to Paris first, and from there he went away—I was not aware he was brought to the Mansion House as a witness for Mr. Robert Bowles—he was not brought there on the part of the prosecution, that I am aware of—I put myself into communication with Mr. Robert Bowles when I received the books, and he assisted me as far as he could—Mr. Young was present then—I believe that we received every assistance that Mr. Robert Bowles could give us, and when we came to the financial part of it he referred us to Mr. Charles Bowles, and for many things connected with the accounts, saying that he knew nothing of the financial part of it—I don't know that he referred me to Mr. Keith also—I did communicate with Mr. Keith also on the matter—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187302030043"></xptr>
               <p>he knew more about the customers' accounts than the defendant—Mr. Keith assisted to prepare a list of the bonds—the information was in various books—I don't know that they were under Mr. Keith's charge—I. believe they were under the charge of the clerks down stairs—Mr. Keith knew where the bonds were deposited—I did not see Mr. Gilbert there—I believe I have since seen him—I have been told that some portion of the letters signed by Robert Bowles are written by Gilbert—he was a clerk—I don't know his handwriting myself—Sullivan and Keith both drew cheques, but they were drawn <hi rend="italic">Per pro</hi> Bowles &amp; Co.—I believe all the money that they drew has been traced, but I am not aware.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There were no cheques by Keith and Sullivan, except per procuration—the firm first started in London at the beginning of 1870; the firm had existed in Paris I should say five or six years before that, or perhaps more—the English firm owes the English creditors 80,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they are not all English people, but creditors of the English department—I am not aware that the Boston house is in liquidation yet, not legally—it has stopped payment at New York, a receiver has been appointed, that is the distinction I wish to make—enquiries have been sent, but replies have not yet been received—88,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. appears against the Boston house in the London books; the Paris house is debited 54,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—but as regards the Paris house they have sent a summary of their accounts, but I have not tested their accuracy—there is no handwriting of the defendant with regard to the deposit ef any of the securities that we have been enquiring into to-day—Charles Bowles signed the letters which deposited Colonel Gardiner's securities at the Union Bank, but the-other letters he did not—the other securities are signed by Keith and Sullivan—there is one letter I believe signed by Henry Stetson—I am not aware that Van Toile's were at any time securites upon which advances had been made by Bowles &amp; Co.—they were pledged at the Union Bank by the letter of the 14th February—they were not at the bank at the time of the stoppage.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a retired commissary-general of the army—I deposited with the firm of Bowles Brothers &amp; Co. some Virginian bonds; 20,000 dollars of the old issue, and 10,000 dollars of the new—the value varies according to the market; they are worth now between 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never authorised them to be pledged with the Union Bank, or to be dealt with in any way, and I did not know of their being dealt with in that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I took the lot of 10,000 dollars to the Strand myself; I gave them to Mr. Sullivan, he was in the bank where the glass partition was.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had the management of the loans on securities of Bowles Brothers under my care—I am not the general manager; Mr. Milfond is—he opened the account on loans—he is at the bank to-day, I believe—he has been out of town; I have not seen him for ten days—I believe he is there to-day—Charles Bowles opened the account—generally the transactions took place by letter; I have all the letters; I believe they are the letters of which you have had the press copies—there are two letters depositing the bonds in Gardiner's case, one is signed "Charles Bowles, "and the other "Bowles Bros. &amp; Co., T. R. Sullivan"—the letter of 2nd July, depositing Mrs. Gates' United States bonds is signed by Keith; and also</p>

               <p>the letter depositing her Massachusets and some Lombardo Venetian bonds—the 300 Lombardo-Venetian of D'Agiout is signed by Charles Bowles—they were withdrawn, and 200 were re-deposited by Keith—Charles Bowleg opened the loan account at the beginning of 1871—the account generally was a transfer from an old account of Bowles, Dreve, &amp; Co.'s—Charles Bowles opened that account also, on. 5th June, 1866—he authorised us to honour Mr. Roger's signature first, and on the 8th January, 1868, Stetson was authorised to sign <hi rend="italic">per pro</hi>—W. B. Bowles is authorised to sign by a letter of 29th January, 1868, the signature of which is in the handwriting of Charles Bowles—on 29th April, 1870, in a letter in the handwriting of Charles Bowles, Keith is authorised to "sign for us all cheques, drafts, &amp;c., necessary to the transacting of business with you or through your bank"—April 14, 1871, is a letter authorising the signature of T. R. Sullivan, that is signed "R. C. M. Bowles": "Please note signature of our Mr. T.R. Sullivan, at the foot, who from this date is authorised to sign for our house by power of attorney in all transactions with your bank"—we have not had the powers of attorney—Robert Bowles was authorised to sign for Bowles Brothers &amp;Co, on 15th April, 1868, by a lithograph circular signed by Charles Bowles—that is the first intimation apparently that we have of Robert Bowles—I only saw Charles Bowles about this matter—I may have seen him in the office altogether perhaps fifteen or twenty times, but the majority of the transactions took place by letter—Mr. Milfond opened the transactions with him; but a very few of the subsequent ones would be transacted by him—I am next to him in the service of the bank—I should decide for myself—I should not refer to him—I know that Mr. Milfond occasionally saw him; and I believe he occasionally saw Sullivan and Keith also—I never saw Mr. Robert Bowles until the bank stopped, to my knowledge—he came to me at the bank—he said "I have been disap-pointed on the part of the firm as to the receipt of some money which we had expected to obtain from Mr. Morgan, the American banker, and have not sufficient to meet our engagements falling due to-day; our acceptances amount to two or three thousand pounds beyond the funds in our hands"—I asked him if he could place in the hands of the bank security, in the event of our paying the acceptances—he told me he could not undertake to do so—it was then a late hour for business—I asked him if he would undertake that the bank should have the security the next morning, if I ordered the acceptances to be paid; he told me he could give me no such promise—I asked him if he knew what the consequences would be if the acceptances of his firm were returned unpaid—he said, "I am aware of it"—I repeated, "Do not misunderstand; if you do not pay to day, your credit is damned"—he assented to that, and went away upon my telling him that, under those circumstances, I could not agree to pay the bills—he said, during the conversation, that he was left alone to manage the financial part of the business, which he did not really understand, as it had not been his depart-ment—he said he had seen Mr. Morgan, and he had hoped that a telegram that he had to receive from America would enable him to make the advances, but he had not received it.</p>

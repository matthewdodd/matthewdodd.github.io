               <p>My wife opened the door that leads into the shop, with one hand, and had hold of that woman with the other; she said, here is a pretty jade for you; she said, do not you see she has stole your breeches; I looked then, and saw the breeches drop; then it struck me immediately about the bank note, which was sent to me just before I went to bed; I looked for the note, and pulled it out; I said, you jade you would have had a nice Christmas if you had got this: we took her to the Rotation office; then I missed my stock and stock buckle, which I found upon her.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the note here? - Yes.</p>

               <p>(The note produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I do no not imagine that she knew any thing of this note, being in my breeches pocket when she stole them.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know any thing of the woman? - I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>What might the value of the other things be? - Under 10 s. I believe it is.</p>

               <p>They never took them from me; I was going up the street, and I met a woman, she asked me where I was going, I said, up the street, she said, would I go with her; she said there was a servant maid owed her a little trifle of money, and I went down there with her; when she came out again, she came in a great hurry, says she, keep that stock and stock buckle, and stay till I return; I staid there about two minutes, and then this gentlewoman came out immediately: I am entirely a stranger in London.</p>

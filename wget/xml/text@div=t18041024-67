             is an infant. I am a carpenter; I left my house about half past six o'clock in the morning, and returned about a quarter before twelve at noon, in consequence of an alarm; I found the room-door broke open upon the attic floor, I had left it locked; I sleep in the room, I am sure it was locked; I first missed the money out of my breeches pocket - two half guineas, two dollars, a crown-piece, a one-pound Banknote, a seven-shilling piece, and some silver, altogether about three guineas and a half, as near as I can guess; I then missed a sattinet waistcoat, and a great coat; the coat cost me 1 l. 18 s. and the waistcoat 1 l. 8 s. I had not worn them more than ten times; I had left the waistcoat in the room that morning, but the coat I cannot say where I left it, I saw it in the room on the Thursday morning; I have seen the prisoner many times about the neighbourhood, but I do not remember to have seen him for three or four months before this happened; he is a plasterer's labourer, and did work for a person who lived in the same street, at a house in Russell-square; I found the prisoner the next day, with the coat and waistcoat on his back, in the Coal-yard, St. Giles's, at a public-house next the watch-house; I had been in pursuit of him the whole night; he said he had bought the coat and waistcoat on the Saturday; I told him, if it was my coat, there were no pockets under the flaps, but one inside at the breast; in the great coat pocket I found part of a sawyer's bill of mine, that I had paid, and in the waistcoat pocket I found a knife which I can swear to be mine; I had used it the Sunday before; the room door appeared to be broke open by a chisel; there is the mark of a chisel about an inch and a half.</p>

             sworn. - I am the wife of William Moreton, I had the care of Mr. Gee's house, my husband and I lived in the house: On the 27th of October, I met the prisoner about ten o'clock in the morning, at the foot of the stairs, I am sure the prisoner is the person, I saw him four or five different times; I was up stairs making the beds, I knew I had fastened the door, I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180410240045"></xptr>down and asked him how he got in; he said, at first, he knocked at the front door, and afterwards he said they had let him in through the stables; the front door was shut with a spring lock, but not locked; he then went up stairs, with a bundle of laths in his hand, I had a child in the room below, his name is William, he is four months old; the prisoner went down stairs into the area, and up the area steps; in a few minutes afterwards he came in again, and went up stairs, I heard him hammering; I asked him what he was about; he told me he was come to repair the water-closet; the water-closet is on the second floor, and the cistern that supplies it is on the attic story along-side Mr. Gee's room, that took away all suspicion; I told him I wanted to go out, I should not be gone long, and asked him to watch the house while I was gone, and if he should go before I came home, begged him to shut the door after him; after I had been gone some time, I had a suspicion, because I had been robbed before; I returned, and found him gone, I had the child out with me; when I went up to him he left off hammering, and met me on the landing-place, he turned from the door and faced me; I am sure he was hammering, though I saw nothing in his hand but the laths.</p>

             sworn. - I lodge in the same house, in the laundry part, adjoining the stables; the prisoner knocked at the door, and I let him in; I did not know him before, I am sure he is the man; my father is a slater, and I thought it was one of his men; I asked him if my father was coming, and he said he did not know; I asked him how the man was that fell from the top of the house, and he said very bad; it was about half past ten o'clock; he said he wanted to repair a water-closet in the front of the house, No. 17, Mr. Gee's is No. 17; I did not see him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Gee.) Had you given this man any directions to repair the water-closet in your house? - A. No man whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it want repair? - A. It does in the plumbing business.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BLACKMAN sworn. - I am a constable belonging to Bow-street: On Saturday, about eleven o'clock, Mr. Gee came to me, and told me he had been robbed; I went with him all Saturday evening, and all night; on Sunday morning we appointed to meet at eight o'clock; we heard he was about drinking and dancing with some tambarine girls, I knew where they resorted, and I went and took him; I found upon him a coat, a waistcoat, and a knife, which Mr. Gee said were his; and in the great coat pocket a part of a sawyer's bill. (The property produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I met a plumber, who gave me those laths, and told me to go there and repair the water-closet, and stay till he came; I went up stairs and took the laths; a young man came out of the room with the coat and waistcoat in his hand, and asked me half a guinea for them; I bought them of him, and was about the neighbourhood all day with them upon me.</p>

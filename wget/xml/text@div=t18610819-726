My husband, Charles James Stewart, kept a beer-shop in Elder-road, Lower Norwood he is dead—I was there on 10th August—on that evening the prisoner came there with another man who remained outside—I saw them come up to the house—I served the prisoner with some beer, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shilling—I put it in my teeth—it was soft—it bent easily—I told him it was bad, and he gave me a good shilling—I gave him a sixpence and fourpence in change—I laid the bad shilling on the bar, and he took it up—when he came in he had not his jacket on, but across his shoulder—I watched him as he went from my door—he went down a turning to put it on, towards Mr. Gidner's, the baker's—I did not see anything of the otherman—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not the shilling I bent—it was not so much bent as this.</p>

I am a baker at Lower Norwood—on 10th August, at half-past 5 o'clock, I was in my shop—the prisoner came in, and asked for a penny loaf—he put down a shilling on a loaf of bread—the counter was strewn with bread—I said, "You vagabond, this is a bad shilling"—that was in consequence of information I had received—he had a good penny in the other hand—I tried the shilling in the tryer, and found it was bad—I kept him till the policeman came, and then gave him in charge with the bad shilling—this is the shilling—here is the mark, T. G. that I put on it when I gave the prisoner in charge—it was a good looking-shilling when it was offered to me—I did not notice that it had been bent—I bent it.</p>

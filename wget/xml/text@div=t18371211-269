                  </hi>. I am mate on board the <hi rend="italic">Holly,</hi> of South Shields. On the night of the 5th of December, I was in company with the two prisoners and another man, at the Prince Regent public-house, Ratcliff highway—I pulled out my watch to see the time, at a quarter before ten o'clock, and about ten o'clock I missed it—I went for a policeman but could not find one—I am sure I put my watch back into my pocket—when I came back from looking for the policeman the prisoners and the other man were gone—I knew where one of them lived, but not exactly—I did not take the policeman there, nor to any lodging in Brunswick-street, nor to any lodging——I gave the policeman orders, and a description of my watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then is it true that you knew where Miller lived, and took a police man to his lodging in Brunswick-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is not right—I did not do that—this is my signature (<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—it was net read over to me that I recollect—it was written, and I signed my name to it afterwards—I do not think it was read over to me.</p>

On the night of the 5th of December I saw the prisoners in Princes-street, Ratcliffe-highway, about a quarter to eleven o'clock, about a hundred yards from the Prince Regent—there was a third man in company with them, called <hi rend="italic">Sailor Jem</hi>—they were in close conversation, and when I came up to them, Miller made signs, which made me conceive a felony had been committed, or was in contemplation; at half-past one o'clock I came round my beat, and heard that an officer had Miller in custody—I then went in pursuit of the other prisoner, about half-past two, or a quarter to three o'clock, to Brunswick-street, and in a brothel there I found George Piatt in bed—I charged him with felony—he denied all knowledge of it—I asked him if he had a watch in his possession—he declared to God he had not got it, and knew nothing of it—I put my hand in, and inside his jacket pocket, which hung over the door, I found a watch—he then said that in the Fir Tree public-house, at the corner of Commercial-road, Miller gave him the watch to take care of till the morning—he had before declared to his God he knew nothing about it.</p>

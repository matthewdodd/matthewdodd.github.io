The prisoner was at my master's five or six months doing the work, because I was ill, but she did not sleep there—I remember giving her a table-cloth, at the beginning of September, to put on the table for master—I was in the habit of serving out the linen, and I thought one table-cloth was not enough for a week, and I gave her two—she went by the name of Knight—when she should have returned me the two table-cloths, she only returned me one—I asked her for the other, and she said I did not give it to her—I missed a drinking-glass at the same time.</p>

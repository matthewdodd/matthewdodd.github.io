I recollect the prisoner going on his Kent journey, in August—Mr. Buchanan, of Dover, was indebted to me, on 19th May, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; Mr. Isaac Ratcliff, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 18th Sept.; and Mr. Robert Gay, of Ramsgate, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on 20th Sept.—the prisoner has never accounted to me for those sums—Mr. Ratcliff, and Mr. Gray would be on his Kent journey—he came back on 27th Oct., and presented this account to me (<hi rend="italic">produced—This contained an entry of </hi>4<hi rend="italic">l. from Mr. Gay instead of</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and no entry of any money from Mr. Ratcliff</hi>)—7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. appears to be due on this account—he said that he would pay me that at the end of the week, and in con<lb></lb>sequence of his not coming, I went to his place, and at once dismissed him—I beckoned him out of the public house, he followed me 200 or 300 yards, and asked me for an account of all that he was to collect, and all that he had paid me for the last three yeans—I said, "Yes," just to pass it off—in consequence of this, I called on several customers, and communicated, among others, with Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Ratcliff, and Mr. Gay, and in consequence of that gave instructions to have the prisoner taken into custody—on 8th Nov. I received a letter from Mr. Bussell, a solicitor, asking for the account—on 23rd Nov., in the afternoon, I received another letter from Mr. Bussell, on my return from the police court—it was not there at 11 o'clock, when I left.</p>

About six months ago I began to suspect him: in August last, I went to France, the prisoner had access to the outer cellar where the wine was kept for daily sale; but the store cellar was locked with a padlock, to which he had not access. When I returned from France I brought a boy with me, I gave him, and my clerk orders to watch the prisoner; my cellar is at the bottom of the Hay-market; I hire a coach-house near Golden-square, which I keep for washing bottles. On the 16th of December, I asked the boy what the prisoner had been doing; he said, he and the prisoner had been at the coach-house washing bottles, and that they had been in the cellars. I asked what they did there; the boy, after some questions told me that the prisoner brought some soul wine out of the store cellars. I then asked the prisoner if any person had called for any wine; he said, no; I asked him if he had prepared any wine to be carried out the next day, he said, no; then I asked him what wine it was he had removed from the store cellars to the other cellars; he said, it was wine upon the lees. I then asked the boy in what part of the cellar this soul wine was, and whether it was standing, or together in a heap; he said, it was in two or three different places in the cellar, and that there were both red and white wine. I supposed it must have been both Burgundy, Claret, and Champaign, and none of the foul wine is in the store cellar. I sent the boy for the key of the little cellar, but the prisoner was gone with the key: I set out to go to the cellar, and one of the clerks followed me. I found the prisoner at the cellar door with some empty bottles and a hamper, he was putting the bottles into the hamper; he said, they were all empty bottles. I made him take them out, he took out about a dozen empty bottles, then there was a wad of straw, I put my hand under the straw, and took out a full bottle, which appeared to be Champaign; then the prisoner made a motion to kneel down and ask my pardon: I told him I must take him before a magistrate, he made no scruple at all; we then went to the office, and the magistrate asked how many bottles there were, I said, I could not tell, for I had only touched one: the prisoner then said, there were only one or two that he was taking to the coach-house for his drinking, while he was washing the bottles. The Justice ordered somebody to take an account of what was in the basket, and the clerk was sent with the key, and brought an account of five bottles of claret, two bottles of Champaign, two bottles of Maderia, one bottle of old hock, and two bottles of sweet oil. During the rest of the time he lived with me, till within these last six months, he always behaved honestly: about six months ago he fell into bad company, which I am afraid persuaded him to do wrong things.</p>

            . I am clerk to the prosecutor. On the 16th of December, my mistress desired me to follow my master down to the cellar; my master was out before me; I overtook him before he got to Charles-Street: we met the prisoner at the coach-house, and there was some empty bottles on one side, and a three dozen hamper on the other: my master asked him what he was about; he said, he was going to take some empty bottles to the coach-house to be washed: the basket was put back into the area; we locked the door, and gave my master the key. I went back to take an inventory of the wine, which was the same as mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Joackim Lienel. The wine that the prisoner removed on the 16th of December, he said, was foul wine: he took two bottles in the bottom of the cellar, which was Champaign; he took out some other bottles from the bottom of the cellar upon the right hand side, which appeared to be Maderia, from the seal.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called several witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

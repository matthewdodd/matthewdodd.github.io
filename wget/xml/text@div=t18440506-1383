                  </hi>. I live at No. 91, Tower-street, and take in mangling, which was done at Mr. Devey's cottage, near East-street, Stepney. I left the cottage at one o'clock on Saturday, the 20th of April—the articles stated in the indictment were then safe—I locked the door and left nobody there—I returned between six and seven, found the door open, and the articles miss<lb></lb>ing—these now produced are mine—I rent a room in the cottage for my mangle—I only use it once a week—it is more like a summer-house than a cottage—Devey does not live there entirely; he sleeps there occasionally.</p>

I know Mr. Devey's cottage at the bottom of East-street—I have seen the prisoners in Stepney—on the Saturday before I went before the Magistrate I saw them go into Mr. Devey's garden, not into the house—Harriet walked all round the garden, and tried to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> the back door open, then went to the pigeon-house, and got the key—she went out of the garden to the corner of the street by the new police-station—I bade her good bye, and went home—she said she should be there in three hours, or else on Monday afternoon—I went in three hours, and again on Monday, but did not see her—she gave me a chain and a little watch, because I hallooed out for' Mr. Devey, but he was out, and no<lb></lb>body came—she said the dress-maker owed her some money, and would not pay her—it was the door of Devey's cottage she <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi>—I do not know what she did with the key—both the prisoners were there—it was the boy handed me the watch—I said, "Is that a watch?"—he said, "Yes"—Harriet said, "Give it to her, it is no use to you"—I did not know her before.</p>

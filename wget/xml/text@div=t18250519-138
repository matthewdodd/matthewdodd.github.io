I met the prisoner on the 1st of May, about six o'clock in the morning, in Church-street, St. Giles's. I had been up all night; I was quite sober - the prisoner accosted me and I went with her to her lodging, and sent her for some gin; I remained in her room about five hours - I went to bed, and was partly undressed: I put the watch on the table, and desired her not to touch it; I awoke between ten and eleven o'clock, when I missed my watch, purse, and money - I asked if she had taken it - she denied it - the door was open and she was walking about the room; she went out - I followed her - she did not get far away from me; she was never out of my sight; I gave charge of her to a watchman, but the watch was not found: the purse was found in her bosom. Upon my oath I was sober and had not given her any of these articles.</p>

I lost my mutton on the 19th of January, I was in the shop at about seven o'clock in the evening; I turned round, and missed two breasts of mutton; they were in the window; I went out directly, and saw the man that I supposed had taken them; and I followed him into Bow-lane, just round the corner; he threw them down, and ran as fast as he could, and I called out stop thief; the patrole caught him; but another man came up, and hit the patrole by the side of the head, so that he was obliged to let him go. He was followed into Milk-street, and taken there, and I am sure he is the man whom I saw with the mutton; I had seen him about in the neighbourhood.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper. On the 10th of January, about a quarter after seven in the evening, I heard a cry of stop thief; and I saw a man running through the yard; I immediately pursued him, and when I got into the court which leads into M-street, I found he was stopped by two gentlemen. After going a few paces towards the watch-house, something dropped from the prisoner, and on picking it up, it was an iron instrument there in crow.</p>

            . I am a patrole. Going along Bow-lane I saw three men, of whom the prisoner was one, whom I suspected. They separated while I was watching their motions. I heard a cry of stop thief, and seeing the prisoner run. I secured him, though but slightly by the collar. As soon as I laid hold of him, I received a violent blow on the back of my neck, which forced me on the payment; by that means the prisoner escaped, but was afterwards apprehended.</p>

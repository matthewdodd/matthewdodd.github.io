I live at West Houghton, near Wigan—about 7.30: on the morning of the 25th January I was with a female in Porter Street—I remember seeing the man at the bar—I was going up Porter Street and the prisoner came running by and slipped down in front of me, and then got up and popped his hand on my shoulder and snatched my watch from my pocket—he put his legs between my knees and began to kick and threw me down and used me very roughly—the female who was with me screamed "Police," and the police came and assisted me—he kicked me several times on the legs and belly—I had to lean against the wall till I got round—someone came to his assistance and he got away—the prisoner was not intoxicated or he could not have used me as he did.</p>

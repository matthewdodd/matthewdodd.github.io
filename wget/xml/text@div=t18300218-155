               <p>GEORGE BURBURY. I am in the employ of the prosecutors. I saw the prisoner between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, on the 28th of January, he came into the cellar, and took a bottle of wine - I was placed there, as we had missed several bottles of wine; there were two or three casks there, and the wine had been drawn from them - no one could see me; the prisoner took up one bottle - I followed him, and took him up stairs into the warehouse, with it in his hand; Mr. Brass had some work doing at the back of the premises - the prisoner was in his employ.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HERMAN. I took the prisoner, and have the bottle.</p>
               <p>MR. BEATER. This is the bottle; it is Madeira - I have tasted it; the prisoner has been employed by Mr. Brass six or eight months.</p>

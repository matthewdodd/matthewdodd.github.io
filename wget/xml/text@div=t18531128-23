                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Messrs. Coster and Co., general warehousemen, in Aldermanbury. On 26th Oct. Mr. Dennant called my attention to the prisoner; he was down stairs, in the entering room, adjusting a parcel on the floor—I continued to watch him—Mr. Dennant told me something, and I went to the portico, outside the door, to seize him when he came out—he came out with the parcel under his arm, with an imitation invoice under the string; it turned out to be a blank piece of writing paper, but when folded up it had the appearance of a regular invoice—I said to him, "Well, my good man, how do you do?"—he said, "Very well, Sir, I thank you"—I said, "What have you got here under your arm?"—he said, "Some goods"—I said, "Whose are they?"—he said, "Mr. Jones's"—we have many customers <hi rend="italic">of</hi> that name—I asked him what Mr. Jones—he said, "Mr. Jones, of Islington"—we have no customer there of that name—I then took him by the coat, and said, "Just let me have a look at them," and turned him into the warehouse—he turned round very quietly with me, and gave me up possession of the parcel; but the moment I got it he turned and threw away two small parcels which he had, and ran away—I ran after him, and caught him—the parcel contained two pieces of satinet, worth about 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one of the parcels he threw away contained a piece of old common coarse canvass, of no value; it was about twelve inches square, and two inches thick; that also had a similar piece of paper under the string like an invoice—the other parcel was about the size of my hand; it was in silver paper, and contained a lady's silk tie, or handkerchief, and also a small piece of figured silk—those were no doubt <hi rend="italic">blinds</hi>, to give him access to the warehouse.</p>

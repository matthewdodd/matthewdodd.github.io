                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's husband—we have been married four years. On the 28th of February I came home about half-past six o'clock from work—I found her drunk, and said, "You have been drink<lb></lb>ing"—she said she had not, and got up to scratch my face—I said, "You have scratched my face many times, if you do it I will knock you down"—she sat down for half a minute, and seized the poker with her right hand—I saw it, and having had it twice before, I tried to get out at the door—she went round the table, and knocked me down on the sofa with the poker, which she held in both hands—she struck me over the head with it, and said, "Take that, you b——"—I was insensible for several mi<lb></lb>nutes, and when I came to myself she said I had better go to the doctor's—I opened the door, and got down somehow or other, and when I got to the bottom the landlady said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "My wife has struck me with the poker"—she put me on a chair, and bathed my head with some water—it bled violently—I afterwards went to Mr. Healey, the surgeon, who dressed my wound—I had given her no provocation but what I have stated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. The prosecutor was brought to my house on the night in question by his fellow-workmen—he had a wound on his head to the extent of about three inches, and quite to the bone, he was labouring under concussion of the brain—I judge had the blow come in a direct line it would have fractured the skull and caused death—it was such a wound as would be made by a poker—he was in a dan<lb></lb>gerous state for about a fortnight.</p>

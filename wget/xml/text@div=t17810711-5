Lumley gave me a leg and an arm, and threw me into the middle of the street. I came up to him, and asked him what that meant? he drew something from under his coat, and cut me on the head: then the other two came up to me, and struck me again; I had four or five cuts on my head. I set off, and went up Field Lane to Saffron Hill. I went into a woman's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178107110103"></xptr> house; the three prisoners followed me. I bolted the door to save my life; they broke the door, and came in after me.</p>

               <p>Did they break the door? - Yes, and two windows. They brought me out, and Fitter put his hand in my pocket, and pulled 7 s. 6 d. out of my pocket. Lumley pulled a silk handkerchief off my neck, which cost me 3 s. they cut and hacked me, and bruised me, so that I was frightened out of my life, and they left me a dead man in the street.</p>

               <p>What did they beat you with, when you came into the street? - Sticks, or whatever they had.</p>

               <p>They left you for dead? - Yes; they left me a dead man.</p>

               <p>Where did you see Bolton first? Did you see him before you began to run away? - Yes; he was with the five.</p>

               <p>Did Bolton do any thing to you? - Yes; he struck at me with the rest before I ran away, and after I went into the house.</p>

               <p>Had they all got sticks? - Yes.</p>

               <p>When did you see them again? - On the Wednesday night after that.</p>

               <p>Where did you see them? - At my lodging. I was not able to go out; they were brought to me in a coach by Dinmore and some others: they brought them to the bed side.</p>

               <p>Are you certain to the persons? - Yes, I am: they owned before the justice that they were the same persons; I am certain to their persons; I ought to know them very well.</p>

               <p>Fitter. Whether there was not 200 people about the place where he says he was robbed?</p>

               <p>Court. Were there many people about the place? - No.</p>

               <p>Was you before the magistrate? - Yes, I was present when the prisoners were examined.</p>

               <p>Did you know the other two men? - No.</p>

               <p>Have you had any conversation with them since? - No. Justice Blackborough came to my lodging: I was so bad I could not get out of bed; the prisoners came to the bed-side: he asked me if I knew those three? I said I did know them very well.</p>

               <p>What did either of them say? - Lumley said, You b - r, I wish I had the killing of you.</p>

               <p>Did they say any thing else? - I did not hear them say any thing more.</p>

               <p>Did he say why he wished he had the killing of you? - No.</p>

               <p>Did either of them say any thing to you when you said you knew them? - Only the middle one was going to put his hand in my pocket; I laid hold of him; he had a bit of his thumb off.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On the 11th of June I received an information, and the prisoners were apprehended on another account. The next morning I heard Bryan had been ill used; I went and found him in bed. I asked him if he should know the persons? he said he should. The justice sent a surgeon, who came and made a report that he could not attend the justice: the fever was higher the next day; and the justice's clerk went, and we took the prisoners to him, left he should die.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoners say any thing when he said he knew them? - Lumley said he wished he might not live till next morning. The prosecutor said it was a pleasure to him to think, if he should not live till next morning, they would not have it in their power to serve any body as they had served him. Then Lumley made this reply, B - st your b - g eyes, or d - n your b - g eyes, God send you may not live till morning! or words to that effect.</p>

               <p>Did either of the others say any thing? - I can't swear they did.</p>

               <p>Did Justice Blackborough attend? - I did not attend with the magistrate; the clerk attended and took the examination, and the justice attended afterwards to swear him to it. The prisoners were afterwards brought before the justice: he asked them how they came to use the man so: they laughed at it; and, as they were going away, Lumley

             sworn.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of Clerkenwell. I heard this person had been used ill; I went to him: finding him in a dangerous situation, I went and reported it to Justice Blackborough: a surgeon was sent to him; he reported that he did not think the man could live, and somebody should attend him: then we made application to a gentleman in Rosoman's-street, and they did attend him. I was along with him at the taking down the examination by the clerk, and at the justice's; the prisoners were there: he then declared he knew them, and he said he had a secret satisfaction, that if he should die, they should not serve any body else the same, as he thought he should die.</p>

               <p>What did the prisoners say? - Lumley d - 'd him, and bl - d his eyes, and said, if he had the doctoring of him, he should not live till morning. As for Bolton, he checked them for their ill behaviour. Lumley d - n'd his eyes, and said he would never come up any more between two; for, d - n their eyes, he would cut some of their bloody guts out before he would go. They behaved so extremely bad and rude, that they were obliged to be fastened all together.</p>

               <p>Did Bolton say any thing? - I do not remember that he did. Coming out of the office, Lumley took out a knife: he threw it at me, and knocked my wig on one side, and it grased my ear, and stuck into another man's arm. A woman very indiscreetly took the knife up, and threw it among them. Bolton took it up again, and said, D - n my eyes, this shall never be an evidence against any body; and he threw it upon or over Justice Blackborough's house.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I know no more than has been mentioned by Mr. Dinmore. I saw the knife thrown, and laid hold of Bolton as soon as I understood that Mr. Isaacs was cut; and Lumley called for a knife to cut my bloody guts out. A knife was thrown; Bolton picked it up, Dinmore ran up to him, and Bolton threw it over an house.</p>

               <p>FITTER's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>As I was going up Saffron-hill, I saw a mob there; the mob dispersed, I went home; that is all I have to say.</p>

               <p>BOLTON's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>I was coming down Chick-lane; I saw a parcel of brickbats thrown; I followed the mob, and came away; I never saw this man that swears to me.</p>

               <p>LUMLEY's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>I was coming up Field-lane; I heard the cry of Stop thief! Some man run up Saffron-hill, in a blue coat; there were a hundred people running after him: they were pelting brickbats at some man that was dressed in black clothes: there were fifty people, I believe, ill using some man: then I went away; I saw them take a man into an alehouse.</p>

               <p>Fitter. They would make it up for three guineas; my friends laid it down: then they would not make it up for less than six: they treated him with liquor to 12 s. then he said he would not make it up under 50 l.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I never offered to make it up. Some friends of his came to me, and desired me to make it up; there were two of them came to my lodging, and three women: I was afraid of my life; I did not know but they might have a pistol or something to kill me directly: I went with them to the Hole in the Wall, a public-house; I put the landlady just by me, where I lodge, and a man on the other side of me, in going along with them, because I was afraid of my life. His friends said they would give me three or four guineas; that it was not worth my while to have their blood; they would have me go to my own country. I said, Come with me; meet me to-morrow in such a place, 2nd may-be I will give you an answer. When they came the next day, I said I would not; but would prosecute them, if they gave me 500 l.</p>

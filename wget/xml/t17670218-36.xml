            . Last Wednesday was fortnight, about half an hour after six in the evening, I was coming along the back lane to go home; I had a shoulder of mutton, a piece of Cheshire cheese, six pounds of butter, and some red herrings in my lap: the prisoner came out upon me, I think from same bank just under the fourth lamp in the lane; he said, Madam, your money; I said, I have no money, upon my word; he said, you have; I said I had mutton, butter, and cheese, if he would name them he was welcome, and go about his business; he said he wanted some money: I put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out a penny, and looked at it, and gave it into his hand; I believe a halfpenny slipped through his fingers, and fell upon the ground; I had but 5 s. in all about me; he was very much in liquor; he held me by my pocket-hole, while he stooped to take the halfpenny up; he said, Madam, this is not all, you have more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you put in fear?</p>
               <p>E. Woodroof. I was very much affrighted, but he did not offer to use me ill or strike me; there was another woman with me, she went to go away; he said, Madam, you must not go, I want your's too; she put her hand in her pocket, and throwed down, she said, about seven farthing; and while he went to pick that up she went away; there came a little boy past me, and he called a man; I believe there was a very tough struggle between the prisoner and that man in the road, for about three minutes; I had not seen the boy, till the boy said he saw the prisoner stop me.</p>

            . I was 15 years of age the of last January; I was going to Shadwell about my ter's business; I saw two women by the going the same road; I was glad of that for company; I went behind them till we came about half way between the Angel and the turnpike; the prisoner jumped out of the ditch and took hold of this woman, and said, Madam, your money: the other woman ran away past me; I went up to Mr. Orme, who was coming with his wife, and told him there was a man robbing a woman; upon which he let go his wife's arm, and ran up to the prisoner who was then stooping; he asked him what he was about; the prisoner said, picking up money, what do you think; he engaged the prisoner the space of three, the prisoner tried to run away, two or three times, then I called the pattole. He was secured.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner do any thing to the woman</p>
               <p>Tod. He took hold of her breast.</p>
               <p>- Orme. I am a bricklayer's labourer, and work for Mr. Milnet in East Smithfield; I and my wife were coming towards London; this lad came running up to me, and said there was a man robbing a woman; I loosed my wife's arm, and ran up; the prosecutrix desired me in the King's name to assist her; I asked the prisoner (who was stooping) what he was doing; he said, picking up money; I went to take him by the collar; he struck at me, and ran away. I called, stop thief; he turned again, and offered to fight me; my wife said, strike him with the patten, you do not know what weapon he may have about him, I struck him with my wife's patten; he ran away again; I followed, and struck him with the patten again; then I took hold of his collar, and assistance came up, and he was secured.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself?</p>
               <p>Orme. He did not say a great deal.</p>

            ; it was Sunday night; I had a pint of porter there; I had two half-crowns in my pocket; I saw the prisoner there; I did not know him before; he was in company with some men and women; he did not join our party; he put his hand into my left hand trousers pocket while I was there; I felt him do it, and caught hold of the collar of his coat, he struck me and knocked me down, and jumped on me and four or five others; he had not taken the money from my pockets at that time; the half-crowns were in the pocket in which I felt his hand; I put my hand into my pocket and felt them there about three minutes before; my pocket was not buttoned; there was nothing else in it; I was knocked down after catching hold of his hand; and after I got up, I was looking for my my shoes, and two policemen came up; I felt in my pocket after I found my shoes, after the prisoner was gone- I found my money was gone then; I did not give the prisoner in charge for the robbery at the time - I charged him with an assault; I did not know my money was gone when I gave him in charge - I was looking after my shoes at the time - I found my money was gone three or four minutes after the policeman had gone, I went down to the station-house thinking he was in charge, and he was not; I gave information at the station-house of the robbery, and he was taken the Saturday following; they could not find him before; I had only one pint of porter that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. On your oath had you only one pint of porter? A. Only one pint the whole of the day; I was quite sober at the time; Moss saw me with two half-crowns that day; I mentioned my loss about five minutes after the policeman was gone; I told the two witnesses of it; I did not say it openly in the room; the people in the room did not hear that; we looked for the prisoner at all the public houses round the neighbourhood; I don't know where he lives on my oath- he does not live in the same street with me,; I live in Foster's-buildings; I had never seen him before I found him on Sunday after, at the Spread eagle, and he was taken to the station-house for being riotous, and I preferred my charge on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him in charge at the Spread eagle? A. I went out to the station-house directly I saw him there- it might be a minute or two; I drank with his brother before he came in; I took nothing after he came in; I said nothing to his brother about having a fall out with him, his brother said something to me about it; I cannot say what it was; he offered me the pot to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say "You and my brother have had a fall out?" A. Words to that effect; I drank with his brother that evening, but not after the prisoner came in; I did not see him come in - the half-crowns were the wages I had on Saturday night; a man in Oliver-row paid me; I cannot tell his name; I had worked for him; he is a master carpenter, and has a shop as there; I worked for him about three days; the prisoner jumped upon me and knocked me down after I found his hand in my pocket; we had no words before; I had not been mocking his Irish method of speaking; I met Moss first that evening at his own house; I went with him to the Spread eagle, and I showed him the five shillings at the Spread eagle door; he did not ask where I got it - I showed it him because I intended to take it home, and I had just enough halfpence for a pint of porter; I did not strike the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear there were only four persons in the house when you lost your money? A. I can't swear to one - I will swear there were not twelve; I saw the servant of the house there - I did not complain to her of my loss - I did not see the prisoner during the week - I did not know his brother till that evening - he said he was his brother - he had come down to me several times - I never went down to him - I was perfectly sober that evening - the floor was examined - I cannot say whether the people in the house were searched.</p>

            . I went to the Spread eagle on the Sunday in question, with the prosecutor and my daughter - just before we entered the door he put his hand into his left hand pocket, and pulled out two half-crowns, and said,"These are for my wife;" we had a pint of porter between us three - I saw the prisoner strike the prosecutor - I did not see whether the prosecutor had hold of him at the time, for the prisoner was at my back, as I was standing - I was going to turn myself round to know what the blow was given for, and before I could get the word out of my mouth, I was knocked down myself by some of the party, and three or four were jumping on me - I had my face dreadfully cut - two policemen came in and took them off me, and cleared them out as fast as they could.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did the prosecutor tell you that he had lost his money? A. Soon after I got up - the policemen were gone - they were clearing away the mob - there were about nine or ten in the house at that time, and many came afterwards - there were only two or three in the house when he told us he had lost his money, except the landlady and servant at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem surprised at finding his money gone? A. I did not take notice, for I had lost my shoes and ninepence out of my pocket - he said, "I have lost my two half-crowns;" everybody in the room might have heard it - they might have heard him at the bar - he did not say it privately - he did not whisper it to me - I went with him to the station-house, as soon as I got a pair of shoes to go- my back was towards him when he struck the prosecutor - I turned my head round and saw the blow come from him - the prosecutor stood nearly alongside of him - there had been no quarrelling before; I heard no remarks about the Irish - there might be as many women in the house as men; the prisoner's wife was not there - he is a single man - I know he lived with his mother, in Little Leonard-street, Shoreditch; I never was in the house - I know he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040048"></xptr>lived there - I went to look for him during the week, but did not go to his house; I knew where his father lived.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prosecutor ask you if you knew where the prisoner lived? A. No; I did not know it myself; we found him at the station-house - the prisoner did not live in Shoreditch; I thought you were asking about the prosecutor - I did not know where the prisoner lived- there was a general row in the room; I believe only the prosecutor and I were knocked down; if I had had money in my pocket very likely it might have fallen out - I was not at the Spread-eagle on the night he was taken; we went to Bunhill-row station-house; I don't know how long the prosecutor had been drinking - I had been backwards and forwards - he had been at my place all the day; I did not see him have any drink.</p>

            . I was at the Spread-eagle with my father and the prosecutor - I saw the prosecutor with two half-crowns, just as we were going in at the public-house door - he had them in his hand; I don't know why he produced them - he said he was going to take them home to his mother - I saw the prisoner strike him in the public-house - I did not see the prosecutor's hand on the prisoner's coat before that - he was knocked down, and four or five jumped on him - they were the prisoner's friends; I can't say whether the prisoner himself jumped on him - it was done in the scuffle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know it was the prisoner's friends? A. Because they were all drinking together - I can't say how many women were among them - they were all cleared away after the scuffle, except me and my father and the prosecutor - when the prosecutor missed his money, he said "I have lost my money out of my pocket;" he said it publicly, not very loud - he said it so that anybody could hear him, but there was nobody else in the room, except the landlady - I heard him tell the landlady that he had missed two half-crowns out of his pocket, he said so to the person in the bar.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he complain of being robbed of them or losing them? A. He said he had lost them out of his pocket.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother, and a shoe-maker. I was at the Spread-eagle on the 12th of May, there was a row there - The prosecutor came in after the prisoner, he was drunk to my knowledge; he was cross in the house and insulting everybody, and insulted the prisoner's wife - he offered her some beer and made free with her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you mean by making free, did he do more than offer her beer? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did he say anything to the prisoner? A. Yes; as the prisoner was going home out of the public-house, he called on a man named Mike, to come home, and with that the prosecutor took him out, and the prisoner turned in and put his fist in his mouth, and said, if he came out again, he would make him kiss his fist; with that the prosecutor raised his first and struck the prisoner, and so the row began, and then there was a regular row.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner said he would make the prosecutor kiss his fist? A. Yes; the prosecutor struck the prisoner directly, and cut him in the nose.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. That was after he made free with his wife? A. Yes; then the row began directly, and the policeman cleared them all away - I was there on the Sunday week after, and the prisoner was with me, we went in together - the prosecutor was in before us; another witness came in with us and called for a pint of beer, I said, "You are the man that had the row with my brother;" he said, Yes, "Well, said he, if you fell out with him, I will fall in with you;" and they had a pint of beer and drank, and we all three drank out of one pot - he made no charge of robbery at that time; we remained together about an hour I suppose.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You staid an hour in company with each other drinking together? A. Yes; he did not say a word about his having lost five shillings at that time - he made that charge on the Monday; my brother (the prisoner) was taken by a policeman and locked up, and on the Monday morning he went and gave charge against him for felony - my brother was locked up about nine o'clock on Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the charge then? A. A policeman was shoving my sister, and he gave him a tip on the umbrella on the back - on that Sunday no charge was made about taking the five shillings.</p>

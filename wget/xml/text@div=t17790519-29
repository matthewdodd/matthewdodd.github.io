               <p>I live in Leather-lane, next door but one to the King of Prussia. These two pint pots, and a quart, were in my passage. I saw them there, about five minutes after eight in the morning. I saw the prisoner at the foot of the stairs, with his hands in his pockets. I asked him who he wanted; he made a trifling excuse, and turned out at the door. I turned back, and missed the two pint pots. I want after him, and cried stop thief! I followed him as far as Baldwin's gardens, and stopped him. He had the pots in his pocket. I showed them to the people in the street.</p>
               <p>To Pugh. What is the value of the pots? - One shilling and eight pence a piece.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went to that person's house. My foot founded on the threshold of the door. She came and asked me who I wanted. I said one Mr. Brown, a tailor. She said no such person lived there. I went away; she came after me, and said she missed two pots out of the passage. I said I was willing to go back. I had none of the pots.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to William Henry Fourdrinier, of Sherborne Lane, wholesale stationer—the prisoner had been in his service more than twelve months—his duties were to collect orders for stationery—Mr. Izacki, of Edgware Road, a customer of ours, owed 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this receipt for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., attached to this invoice of 8th July, for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is the prisoner's writing—I remember his coming to the counting-house on 28th or 30th July, and Mr. Hunt asked him in my presence whether he had received 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Izacki—he said that he had not, but that he had received 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and had paid it in—he was asked if he had received from Izacki 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said, "Yes;" and that he had it in his pocket, and he took out 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and ten or eleven shillings, and said, that when he had his salary he should have paid the remainder—he was given in custody.</p>

            . I attended the Prisoner in the Cells when he was under Sentence of Death; he broke out of Newgate the 16th of August last, between twelve and one, and we took him again about a Week afterwards, at Hoxton - He broke out of a Place called the High Hall, almost as high as the Top of the Goal, and got down by a Scaffolding Rope. <rs id="t17431207-78-verdict398" type="verdictDescription">

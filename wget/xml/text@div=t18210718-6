On the 29th of June, between two and three o'clock, I saw the prisoner walk up and down by Burn's door, two or three times, watched him. I saw him open the door, go in, and come out again in about a minute, with the time-piece under his left arm - I ran over, and told Mr. Burn, he went after him. He crossed over Fleet-street into Shoe-lane.</p>

            . I rent a house in Salisbury-court, in the parish of St. Bride's. I saw the time-piece on the mantle-shelf of the counting-house, on the ground floor, about twelve or one o'clock. Between two and three Salter came in - I was in the one pair front room - she called out that a man had run away with the time-piece, and was gone up Shoe-lane. I pursued, and saw the prisoner in Shoe-lane with it under his arm - he was running as fast as he could. I cried Stop thief! and gained ground on him - he dropped the time-piece in the street; I followed him into a house, where I laid hold of him; he was then dressed quite respectable. I said I was surprised at a man of his appearance doing what he ought not to do. I think he said he was not the man; but I do not exactly know what he said. The time-piece was brought to me half an hour after. I sent for a constable, and gave him in charge. I went into the counting-house, missed the time-piece, and knew that brought back to be mine - it was worth 5 l. - it cost me 10 l.; I have had it eight or nine years; the glass was broken, and the hands were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180007"></xptr>lost by its falling. He said he had been out of work for some time before.</p>

I am a pawnbroker, and live in High-street, Shore<lb></lb>ditch, Davis was my apprentice, but it was no part of his duty to take in pledges or to give them out—I have a private-door and an iron gate, which keeps the people from the private door—on the 1st of September, about eleven o'clock at night, I thought I heard some one at the gate—I went and saw Davis give three pledges out through the bars of the iron-gate—I said, "What are yon at?" and the person who received them ran down the court with them—it was a female, and a short person, about the figure and the height of the prisoner I—Davis had another pledge in his hand*—before the ticket off it, and threw the pledge away—I desired him to pick it up—I afterwards obtained one of my own duplicates from him, and on asking him I obtained one more—in consequence of what he said, I went to I lodgings in Crown-court, Curtain-road, not a great way from my house—I had known her as coming to pledge for years past—when I saw her she implored me very much to forgive her, and said if I would the would pay me every farthing—I asked her how many times she had done that—she said, "Several times, and I hope you will forgive me, for when I received them of Henry I was ready to drop"—Davis was brought there—she still continued to implore me to forgive her—she said there was a necklace she had paid for—after we had been to the station-house and retuned, we found some other things—these are pledges for which 2 have had do money.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Webb, of West-street. The prisoner and prosecutor came to my house with another man and woman; I showed them into a room with two beds, and bolted all four in - I was called in about two hours, to let them out; the prosecutor had gone to bed in his clothes - I saw his watch when he went into the room; they were in the parlour - I opened the door when the women wanted to go, and asked the prosecutor if his clothes were all safe - he said they were; I asked if he had got his watch - he said, "Stop, don't let them go till I see if it is safe;" on my mentioning the watch the prisoner pulled it from her bosom, and put it between the bed and mattress - she said nothing; I sent for the Policeman, and delivered it up to him - he took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor delivered his watch to the other woman to take care of. Witness. She was several yards from the bed.</p>
               <p>JOHN SHACKLOCK. I am a Police-constable. I was called to the house in West-street about four o'clock, and took the prisoner and watch.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was not in his company, but with the other man; the other woman got up, and came out with me; the witness asked if his things were right - he said Yes, but he had left his watch with his companion; he was very tipsy.</p>
               <p>ANTONIO MATTERI. I gave my watch to nobody, I had it in my pocket - I was rather in liquor; I am sure I did not give her the watch - she did not undress.</p>

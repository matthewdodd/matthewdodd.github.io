                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Stockwell-street, Greenwich.

Sir, I have taken the liberty of writing to you, to tell you I am very sorry for what has taken place, and to assure you I will not wrong you of sixpence, if you will not proceed against me, for the sake of my wife and child, as I have a place in view in London, and I will pay you half my wages every week. I have sent you an account of what money I have received, as near as I possibly can; and I hope you will be merciful to me, as I expect my wife to be confined every day; and if you will be so kind as to let her know your determination, as I shall send to her by the same post, for she does not know where I am at present. I am, &amp;c. <hi rend="smallCaps">W. DEAN."</hi>

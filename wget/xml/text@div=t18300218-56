Near nine o'clock in the evening of the 8th of February, the prisoner came in for half an ounce of thread; I had occasion to go to the other end of the shop for change, and when I came back she was very busy adjusting her dress - I served her with the thread, and followed her about twenty or thirty yards from the shop, where she joined some of her associates; I looked at the prisoner, and saw the end of the jean - I called the watchman, took her back, and delivered her to the watchman; there are twenty-three yards of the jean.</p>
               <p>JAMES PLACE. I was called, and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, denying having been in the shop, and stating that Orme described her as wearing a bonnet, but she was without one.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN ORME. I am quite sure she is the person - I never lost sight of her till I took the jean from her; she lost her bonnet from falling down - she had no opportunity of giving it away - it has my shop-mark on it; the thread she purchased fell from her. <rs id="t18300218-56-verdict305" type="verdictDescription">

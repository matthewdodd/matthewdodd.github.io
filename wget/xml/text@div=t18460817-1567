                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Augustus William Gads<lb></lb>den, junior—we are sugar<lb></lb>refiners in Crispin-street—Mr. David Gads-den is the uncle of Augustus William Gadsden, and is an agent for our house as colonial broker—Williams, Deacons, and Co., are our bankers—they are also the bankers of James Gadsden and Son—which son is the same gentleman as my partner—the prisoner was in the service of David Gadsden—I was in the constant habit of asking him to do little services for us when he came to our house from his master—he was not in our service at all—on the 22nd of June we had an account with Trueman and Cook, and another with Simpson and Scott, and wished to pay them for some sugars—one was a transaction of the 3rd of June, and the other the 5th—payment at the end of two months is called prompt, and if paid before, a discount is allowed—we wished to pay these-accounts before the prompt—the prisoner called at our office, and I drew the two checks—all except the amounts, and signed them—I produce them—the one which is filled up for 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was crossed "and Co."only, that was for Simpson and Co.—the other which is filled up for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was crossed "Glyn and Co."—I told him to go to Simpson and Co., and if he could get the invoice of the sugar bought on the 3rd of June (which date he wrote on the back of the check himself), he was to fill up the check for the exact amount, less the discount, and pay it to them for their parcels of sugar, but if he could not do that, he was to fill it up for 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and give them the check on account of the sugar—he had no authority to fill it up for any sum whatever, without first going to Simpson, and endeavouring to get the invoice—he had no other authority whatever—the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. check was under exactly the same circumstances, that was to be paid to Trueman and Co.—I saw the prisoner frequently after that—he told me next morning he had filled the check up for 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and paid it to Simpson and Scott, on account of the sugar—I think he said be could not get the invoice, but am not certain of that—the checks were returned to us in due course as paid—I have since paid Simpson and Co. the 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

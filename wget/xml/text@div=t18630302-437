I am the husband of the last witness—on 27th January, I went down and asked her for change—she gave me sixpence and fourpence out of the till—I took the sixpence up stairs to a gentleman, who said that it was bad—I bent it, and next day threw it in the fire; it melted readily—on the 31st I was brought down stairs, and found the prisoner in the shop—my wife handed me a sixpence, and, in consequence of what she said, I ran round, seized the prisoner, and sent for a policeman—my wife said that she was a very wicked woman, having been twice to the house, and each time brought bad coin—she said she was not there on Tuesday.</p>

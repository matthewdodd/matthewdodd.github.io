            . Q. You are high constable of Finsbury division. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some information from Mr. Robins did you search the prisoner's box. - A. I did; on Friday the 8th of January, at Mr. Robins house, I searched a box.</p>
               <p>Q. Who shewed you that box. - A. The prosecutor; Mr. Robin's; in his box I found a small piece of silver, which is in this little box I have now in my hand; I found this box in the prisoners box; the prosecutor and the prisoner were both present, they both said it was the prisoners box. I then took Whiston to Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Was any thing said to the prisoner by the prosecutor. - A. I did not hear it; at the time I searched his box, he shewed me these two seals; he said he had them of Roberts. I apprehended Roberts the next morning; upon him I found this silver.</p>
               <p>MR. ROBBINS. Q. Before the prisoner said any thing on the subject had you said any thing to him. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At any before did you. - A. In July, when I had my house robbed, I told him if he would confess, I would forgive him; at this time, I never mentioned a word to him till he was going to Newgate; then he asked for half a crown, I would not give it him.</p>

            . - Mr. Walford. Was the prisoner brought to Hatton Garden office for examination. - A. He was. I am clerk there.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you tell us what he said, can you recollect what the magistrate said. - A. The magistrate told the prisoner that what he was about to say, he must consider that it would most likely be made evidence against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your hand writing. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You reduced what the prisoner said to writing, and that is it. - A.Yes, this is it; it is not signed by the magistrate nor the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot read it, you may look at it to refresh your memory. - A. He said, that the several pieces of silver that are now produced, he took at different times, from his master's work shop, and gave them to Roberts to sell for him.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

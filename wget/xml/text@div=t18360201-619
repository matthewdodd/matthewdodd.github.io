                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the Surrey Canal Company, as a constable. On the 19th of January, I was on the premises between eleven and twelve o'clock—I saw Dinsdale just inside the gate, coming out with a horse and cart—the cart appeared loaded with lath wood, but on examination, I found it contained staves and deal ends, which had been taken from the bonding-yard—I had asked him what he had got beside lath wood, and be answered, "Nothing"—when I found these other things, I asked him how he came by them—he said a man gave them to him; that he did not know his name, but he should know the man if he saw him—I took him down to the bonding-yard, where there were four men at work—I pointed to one man and said, "Is that the man?"—he said, "No"—I then pointed to Lloyd, and said, "Is that the man?"—he said, "Yes"—Lloyd is a deal porter—he works for the company occasionally—I asked Lloyd if he had given Dinsdale any staves or deal ends—he said, "No;" he did not know any thing at all about giving it—Dinsdale said, "You did give it me, <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, you know you did, and I promised you some beer"—I asked Llyod to go with me to the Superintendent of the Dock, and he went directly.</p>

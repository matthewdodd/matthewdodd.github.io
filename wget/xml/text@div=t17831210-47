               <p>I am servant to Mr. Williams; on the 20th of last month my master ordered me to kill three beasts and six sheep, I did so, and left the place about ten, and in the morning between two and three the officer informed my master that the slaughter-house was broke open, I went down and found the windows open, and the carcass gone, I saw it at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you swear to the carcass? - Yes, here is a shoulder of it now in Court.</p>
               <p>Can you swear it is one of the sheep you killed? - Certainly, Sir, every man has a different mark to the sheep he kills, my master knows this to be my mark, there are nine cuts.</p>
               <p>Does no other butcher mark them so? - Yes, but there are different ways of marking them, I can safely swear this is my own mark.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100085"></xptr>How have you preserved it from the 20th of November till this time? - By hanging it up in the air, it has never been touched since, I cut it off in the Rotation-office, Justice Staples desired it might be kept.</p>
               <p>It was marked before it was cut off? - We cannot mark them after they are killed.</p>
               <p>Court to Columbine. Was you present when this good man cut off that shoulder? - I was.</p>
               <p>Is that the shoulder he cut off? - Yes, I can be upon my oath it is.</p>

               <p>This young fellow (Weston) is innocent; as I was going home between ten and eleven at night, I met a young fellow, and he asked me to go to Shoreditch, and in Buckle-street he said he was tired of the sheep; this other prisoner was not with me, that young fellow that I met, said, follow me, and when he got round the corner I missed him, up came the watchman and took me to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court to Columbine. You told me before that the prisoner Weston parted company with Solomons, and you lost Weston; when did you take Weston after? - I took him out of bed the next morning, I had information where he was.</p>

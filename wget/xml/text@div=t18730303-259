                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 19). On 27th February, about 10. 30 p. m., I entered a passage at the rear of Mrs. Cato's house, and found some skirts tied up in a bundle, at the rear of No. 103, close to No. 105—I saw the prisoner on the leads, which is a flat roof, over the kitchen, and level with the first floor—with assistance I took him in custody—these are the things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were tied up in a skirt, and there was also a canvas bag—I told the prisoner the charge was entering the house, and stealing these things—he said "What things? I know nothing about it"—I took him to the station—I afterwards got on to the leads, and found that access to the house had been gained from the wall—there were marks on the wall and on the window-sill—there were no marks of violence on the door—it closes with a latch—I went inside, and found myself in the hall—I spoke to Mrs. Cato and the inhabitants, who came out, and I showed them the property—the prisoner was quite sober, but he pretended to be drunk.</p>

I am assistant to Thomas Cato, of 105, Newington Causeway—I identify this property as belonging to Mrs. Cuto and Mrs. Morgan, a lady stopping with her—there is a skylight to the flat over the leads, and we were assembled in the room below—all the articles were in Mrs. Cato's bedroom, and there was no one there but the baby, who was asleep—the door was shut—it opens with a latch—I heard a noise about 10. 30, and found the police there.</p>

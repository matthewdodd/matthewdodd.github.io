                  </hi>. I am in the band of the Royal Artillery. On the 29th of March, about ten minutes past eight o'clock, I was on Woolwich Common, in company with a female, on the public footpath, going from Woolwich towards the Cadets'-barracks—I saw two men pass me on the right—after they had passed a considerable distance, they turned back, and opened out, and I felt a rope round me very soon—I extracted myself from it, and pulled myself towards the one that held it—I had hold of it—then the other one, in company with two men, came on me behind—I did not see them previously—they pulled me down, and ill-used me in a shameful manner, they kicked me, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Gag</hi> him, give it him"—they allowed me to get up, but, I think, through fear; for when I got on my feet, I observed a gentleman at a short distance, and they ran away—when I got up, I missed a black glazed uniform cap, and a pair of gloves which were inside—I did not know any of the persons then—I can identify the prisoner—I am quite sure he was one—it was rather dark—I had seen the prisoner several times before, but never knew who he was, or what his name was—he must have been one of the two who passed me—I think he was the one that had the rope—I am quite sure he was one of the four.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Jackson's-lane, Woolwich Common. I was not on the common on Wednesday last—about half-past eight o'clock, as I was coming up from the barracks towards the White-gate, I met the prisoner, with a cap on his head—it was like a soldier's cap—the top was torn off—it was glazed round the peak—I had known the prisoner by sight before—I am quite sure he is the person I saw with the cap.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Woolwich—I have been in the Artil<lb></lb>lery, and was discharged through a hurt. The prisoner lives next door to me—last Thursday, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw him in the barrack yard fronting his father's house, with a lightish-coloured cap on his head—I looked at it—it appeared to me to be the cap now produced—it was similar to it—when he saw me he took the cap off, and put it under his arm.</p>

I apprehended the pri<lb></lb>soner on Thursday afternoon, between two and three o'clock, at his father's house—his brother and sister were also in the house—he was concealed under a bed—the windows were all barricadoed up, the shutters and door fastened—I got in by taking two or three tiles off the roof—I told him I apprehended him on a charge of assaulting and stealing a cap from Mr. Magee, one of the bandsmen—he said there were others concerned as well as himself—I took him to the station—next day I searched a privy in front of his father's house, ten or fifteen yards from it, in the yard, where the prisoner was at work in the morning, and there found this cap.</p>

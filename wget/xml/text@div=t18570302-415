                  </hi>. I live in Agar Town, and am a labourer. I knew the deceased Richard Cotterell well. On the morning of 31st Jan. I was with him—we had been in the City, and were returning from it in a direction to King's Cross—we were at the railway station, King's Cross, about a quarter past 1 o'clock—there was a pie shop open; I went into that shop, and left Cotterell outside, and he walked on—I went into the shop, and called for two pies—when I found that Cotterell had walked on, I returned to the door, and called "<hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>" two or three times—I then saw three men on the opposite side of the way—they were the prisoner, and Hughes, and Moore—the prisoner made use of foul language, and said, "Who the b—hell are you calling to?"—I said I was not talking to them, or calling them, but I was calling a friend of mine—the prisoner said he would learn me how to call <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>—he did not appear to be sober—he struck me in the chest, and I very nearly went backwards, but I kept on my legs—I asked him what he was doing it for—the other two came up, and surrounded me; I pushed the prisoner aside, and rap away towards King's Cross, and the three followed after me—I overtook Cotterell at the corner of King's Cross, close to the railway station—when I was with him, those persons overtook me, and Hughes struck me twice with a stick—I saw the prisoner at that time stand<lb></lb>ing close by Cotterell, and Moore close by him—I saw the prisoner strike Cot<lb></lb>terell on the breast, and I saw him fall backwards against the kerb stone; Cotterell had not done or said anything to the prisoner before he struck him on the breast—when I saw Cotterell fall, I ran towards the Great Northern</p>

               <p>hotel, and they all ran after me—I saw the Great Northern policeman take the prisoner into custody, and I went back to where Cotterell was—another policeman was fetched, and I gave all, the three into custody—when I came back, Cotterell was lying as if he was dead; there was no sense in him—he bled very much—the three men were taken to the station, and the Great Northern policeman raised Cotterell up, and led him to the station—after the charge was booked, I and the constable conveyed Cotterell to University Hospital—his head was dressed and bandaged up and I led him back home to his mother, in York-place, Agar Town—we got to his mother's between 3 and 4 o'clock—he was sober.</p>

On the Saturday morning on which this matter happened I was on duty at King's-cross—I saw the deceased standing in the middle of the road—I saw the last witness run up to him, and heard him say, "They are coming"—I stood in a gateway, and the last witness and Cotterell ran towards me, and the prisoner, and Moore, and Hughes followed them—when Cotterell was coming towards me I could see him plainly—the three men followed; they got within ten yards of me, and struck at him—Cotterell turned round to face them, and he said, "Save me!" or words to that effect—there was a blow struck by each of them—the prisoner was on the left side—he struck the last blow, and Cotterell fell, and his head came in contact with the kerb stone—he fell just as a dead man would fall backwards—Hughes and the last witness were engaged on the left of me—they had a bit of a scuffle, and the other two ran off, and turned up Western-street—I followed them, and called one of our men—we went, and overtook the prisoner—I told him I wished him to go back with me—he said, "I suppose you intend to take me into custody?"—I said, "I will tell you what my intentions are when I see what injury the man has received who was knocked down"—I went back, and saw the deceased in the same position as before, and the blood was run<lb></lb>ning—I asked some stranger to fetch a metropolitan constable—one came belonging to the <hi rend="largeCaps">E</hi> division—he said he did not like to have anything to do with it—after that another came, and he took the prisoner into custody—when Cotterell was insensible, the last witness and I took him to the station—Cotterell did not do anything before he was struck—he and the last witness were running towards me—I do not think Cotterell uttered a word except "Save me," or something of that kind—the prisoner was drunk; he could not walk steady, and Hughes was drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the resident medical officer of University College Hospital. I saw the deceased on 31st Jan.—he was in a semi-conscious state, suffering from concussion of the brain—I was told it arose from a blow in a drunken brawl, and I considered he might be suffering from drink—I admitted him into the hospital, but he went away in an hour or two—he came again in the evening of the same day—I saw him on the Sunday morning—he had recovered his consciousness; he was perfectly conscious—he remained in the hospital till the following Tuesday—I assisted in making a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination after his death—I discovered a bruise on the back of the head, and blood on the surface of the brain—the membrane was inflamed, and the substance of the brain, and the front of the brain, exactly, opposite to the blow—there was a wound on the scalp, rather, more than one inch long, extending upwards three-fourths of an inch—the appearances were exactly what I should have expected from a fall backwards against any hard substance—I attribute his death to depression of the brain from the blood—it was such an injury as might be occasioned by the blow—the internal injury would result from the external injury.</p>

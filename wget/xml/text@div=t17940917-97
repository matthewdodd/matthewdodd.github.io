               <p>I am a pawnbroker's servant; I produce a calico shawl; the prisoner at the bar brought it to me on the 12th of September, between the hours of one and two.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen her before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. In what name was it pawned? - In the name of Ann Hall, her own name.</p>
               <p>Tiers. Between one and two o'clock, nearly about two, on Friday, the 12th of September, the prosecutor came to me, and informed me he had lost a shawl, and he strongly suspected a person whom I knew; and I went to the lodging of the prisoner, and found her on the bed; I awakened her, and told her she was suspected of stealing a shawl.</p>

            What time did you go to her? -  Nearly about two. She said she had never been out of the room that day. I took her into custody, and searched her, and found the ticket on her; and that led to the pawnbroker. This is it.</p>
               <p>Pawnbroker. This is my duplicate.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my shawl. She did not cut it from the other shawls at the door; it was tore off; I left it hanging at the door; I see it there about eleven o'clock in the morning. There is a space left between, to cut them with the scissars; and she tore it, instead of cutting it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think she did it at the door? - Yes, I think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it easily done? - No, it is not; I have brought one shawl here to compare with it.</p>
               <p>Q. From the circumstance of that being the same pattern, can you swear that to be your's? - I have no doubt about it; not in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any shopman in the shop at this time? - Yes; there were two shopmen, but they don't know who took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going along Golden-lane about three o'clock in the afternoon, a woman comes up to me, and asked me to buy an handkerchief; she said I should have it for two shillings and three-pence. I said, I had no money but nine-pence in my pocket; says she, will you go and pawn it for eighteen-pence, and you shall have the duplicate for the other nine-pence; and I went and pawned it for eighteen pence; and came out and gave her the duplicate. The pawnbroker see me; and I gave her the other nine-pence for the duplicate, not knowing that it was stole, or else I would not have done it.</p>
               <p>Jury to Williams. Did you see the prisoner give a woman eighteen-pence? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any woman with her? - There were two women with her.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you loose your watch? - A. I was discharged from the guards the seventh of last month; my friends got two substitutes for me; I had been making a little merry with my friends; we were going home; I was rather intoxicated in liquor; going home about nine at night to my lodgings in Westminster, the Three Tuns, I happened to call at a public-house, the sign of the Blue Bell; it was in my road home I met with the prisoner at the bar there; she seeing me rather in liquor, inticed me to go home with her to her lodgings; she asked me, and I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was her lodgings? - A. I do not know property; I am rather a stranger to that part of Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. What countryman are you? - A. I am a Yorkshire-man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in London? - A. About five months since I came up; I went to her lodgings and stopped about an hour, and during that time I fell fast asleep; they waked me, and wished me to go home to the barracks; they did not know that I was discharged; I set off to my lodgings; it might be between ten and eleven; as I was going along I missed my watch, and being rather unacquainted with the place, I could not find the way to get back; I run about the streets till morning; nothing occurred, and in the morning I went to my lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Has this watch since been found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were getting quite drunk; are you sure that is the woman? - A. I am sure that is the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from your lodgings to where she lived? - A. About half a mile; I do not know property the distance.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of the place where she lived? - A. I do not know the name of the street properly.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a Yorkshire-man you say? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with her before? - A. I never saw her before that night.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you laid down on the bed, and took asleep? - A. I was not in the house above in hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were in the room with her, of course you laid down in bed with her? - A. Yes, and fell fast asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Never missed your watch? - A. No; it was taken one of my pocket, and the watch-glass was broke, and one of the pieces of glass was left in my pocket.</p>

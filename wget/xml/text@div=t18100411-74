            . I am the wife of James Healey. On the 26th of March I had a one pound Bank note, two guineas and 18 s. in silver in my pocket. I went into the Three Tuns to have half a pint of beer, the prisoner was there, and when I came out he followed me. I went with him to the Crown in Chapel-street, he called for half a pint of gin, it came to eight pence; there were two more men with him. I opened my purse, he took out a shilling, and put the four pence change in his pocket; he called for another half pint of gin, and said I should pay for that, I said I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you partake of the last half pint - A. Yes, I drank two glasses in his company; I was wrapping up my money, he took it out of my hand; the landlady came in, took it from him, wrapped it up and gave it into my hand. When I came out of the house the prisoner took it out of my hand; he went into the house again, he said he would return it to my husband the next morning; he sent the one pound note, but did not return the other.</p>

            . I am a soldier as well the prisoner. The prisoner sent me the one pound note home. I asked the prisoner what he had done with the money, he said he had lost it.</p>
               <p>MRS. PERRY. I am the landlady of the public-house. On the 26th of March the prisoner and the prosecutrix and two women came into my house. When first the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110048"></xptr>prisoner took the money from her the woman sat down to take out the money for the gin. I said he had no business with the woman's money; I took it from him, counted it, and wrapped it up and gave it the woman; he forced it again out of her hand and dragged her out of doors. I did not see her again till the next morning. He came into the house and said, by G - d I have got her money, she shall never have it any more, I will return it to her husband.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She followed me out of the house, she said she would not go home to her husband any more.</p>

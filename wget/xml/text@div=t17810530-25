Then he clapped his left hand against my breast, and forced me down upon the ground, against the pales: he then put his left hand into my right-hand pocket, and took some money out. I looked him full in the face. He said, Blast your bloody eyes! I will cut your head off if you look at me: he got from my side, and unbuckled one of my shoes. I told him, they were plated buckles, but he was welcome to them; but begged he would not use me ill. He then came towards me again, with the hanger: they said, he would cut me if I looked at him; and they endeavoured to force my hat over my face, but it only covered my left eye. I kept looking at him; he stood up, towards my left foot, and I saw him receive the cloak from the other prisoner, who had robbed my wife: he clapped it between his knees.</p>
               <p>How many of them were there? - At first there were three. The prisoner Boys was the first that came up upon the path to me, and

               <p>Do you know the other man? - No; I only know the one that came first up to me: it was quite a bright moon-light night; the moon shone directly against the pales where I lay.</p>
               <p>How long might they be with you? - Five or six minutes; I cannot say to a minute, but thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner Errburrill before? - Never, to my knowledge. I gave information the next morning; and he was taken on the Monday evening, the next day. I was with them when they took them; they were taken within 3 or 400 yards from the spot where I was robbed. I pointed out Errburrill to them, and said, he was the man that came up to me with a cutlass.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300023"></xptr>Who was with you? - Redgrave, Dinmore, and Kipping. There was a ring and some money found upon him. He had a cutlass under his coat; the other had a sword, which he dropped from behind him; the constable clapped his foot on it, and I picked it up. I pointed to Errburrill, and said, he was the person that robbed me, and held the cutlass over me. Errburrill said something about having been in company with some common-councilmen overnight. I heard nothing more.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You had been at different houses? - Only to one. I drank a glass of ale. I was not worse than I am now.</p>
               <p>Perhaps better. - I was, perhaps, more in spirits to make a just remark; I was not in liquor; I never was drunk in my life. I cannot say but I was a little in fear at his holding a cutlass over me.</p>
               <p>You were not quite so cool as you are now about it? - Yes, I was. I lost about 2 d. out of my right-hand breeches pocket: two or three of the halfpence, I am positive, were good. When he was before Justice Blackborough, he said he found the cutlass.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - At Battle-Bridge. I was going home.</p>
               <p>Did you know the other prisoner before? - I have seen him in the neighbourhood before.</p>
               <p>Did not you drink with him on the Monday morning, at a public-house? - No; at the time of the robbery I knew nothing of him.</p>

               <p>Did you take notice of his clothes? - I cannot justly say; I know they were a dark colour. He had a round hat.</p>
               <p>You knew Ives at the time? - I said, as soon as he was gone, I knew his face.</p>
               <p>From Ives.

               <p>On the 7th of this month the prosecutor called on me, in the morning, and told me he had been robbed over-night. In the evening two more constables, myself, and Mr. Johnson, took a walk over the fields; we went down what they call the New Cut, that goes across the two roads: the prosecutor was before me some distance; I and Redgrave were together; there was another constable behind us. The two prisoners crossed over to me and the other constable: I passed Errburrill, who was first, and laid hold of Ives; I clapped my hands on his sides, and said, Holloa, young fellow! what have you got here? I felt the handle of this (producing a sword) under his coat; it was drawn; it dropped down by my foot; I put my foot upon it, and after that he dropped this sheath. I called out; they came up, and Redgrave laid hold of Errburrill; the others came up, and we secured them. As soon as the prosecutor came up, he said to Redgrave, that is the man that robbed me last night, and had the cutlass. Redgrave said, he has got a cutlass now, for I felt it under his clothes. The prosecutor came up to me, and took the sword from under my foot, and stood by while they were tied together.</p>

               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>Had Johnson described the clothes the men were in before? - He said, dark-coloured clothes. He said, he should know the person again that stood over him with a cutlass.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect seeing Boys Errburrill at your house? - Yes, on the Sunday night, the day before he was taken up, he came to my house, about half after seven; he did not come in; he asked for my daughter. I told him, she was not at home. He asked, whether she was gone down towards Fleet-street? he said, he would go and try to see her. He returned in five or six minutes; he said, he had not seen her: he went away, and came again exactly as the clock struck eight. The girl was come home, and he came indoors with her, and went out with her a little before nine; and returned, as nigh as I can recollect, about a quarter before ten o'clock. There was a young man sat facing my door, in liquor; he went with him up into Hatton-garden, to assist him home. The prisoner, and a Mr. Roberts, the master of the young man, came back to my door again; he staid then till about three-quarters after ten, or near eleven o'clock; it was past ten when he came in.</p>
               <p>Did Roberts stay any time with him? - He went away directly: my daughter was at home all the time.</p>
               <p>Which way did he go? - Towards Fleet-street: he lives beside the Fleet-market.</p>

               <p>I am daughter of the last witness. I came home a little before eight on the 6th of May; the prisoner met me at the door, as the clock struck eight; he came into the shop, and gave me a nosegay out of his bosom; I put it in water. We went to take a walk, and returned about a quarter before nine; then he went home with this drunken man, to his master's; afterwards he came back, and sat with me, by the fire, till St. Paul's and St. Sepulchre's went three-quarters after ten; I counted them both.</p>
               <p>Court. He came frequently to you? - About a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Did you take particular notice of the time he came on the other nights? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>How came you to count the clock that night in particular? - I was sitting at the door; I asked a person, what was o'clock? she said, she did not know; and immediately I heard the clock strike.</p>

               <p>My husband is a watch-maker; he is Errburrill's master. I let him in on the Sunday night before he was taken up, at about a quarter before eleven, I believe; we generally go to bed about eleven. I bid him go to bed. I locked the door, and took the key; I chained the door, and bolted the windows; just after, I heard St. Paul's strike eleven. I had the watch in my hand, and looked to see if it was right, before I hung it up.</p>
               <p>Was your husband at home at the time? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>BOYS MAY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watch-maker; Boys is my apprentice; he was christened after me. On the 6th of May he came in before eleven. Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300026"></xptr> May had a watch in her hand; she said, the clock was striking eleven. I was smoking a pipe; I put it down, and went to bed immediately. He has lived with me five years last April. He is very honest; I have trusted him to take large sums. I always found him very honest.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Before Justice Blackborough, this witness said he knew nothing of his coming home; that he went to bed at half after eleven. - [May. I said no such thing. On the Monday night he had staid out all night; on the Tuesday morning, going by Clerkenwell-church, I saw my boy, with a parcel of men, that, I supposed, had taken him up. I was greatly surprised, and very much flurried. I went with them before the justice, who asked me if I could say what time he came home? I said, I could not tell whether it was eleven, or half after eleven; but my wife let him in, and could tell particularly. I was so flurried, I could not tell what I said, or did. I had not had any intimation that he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Kipping. When he saw the lad, he said, This is no wonder at all; I told you what you would come to, when you lay-out four or five nights at a time: now he says, he never knew any thing amiss of him.</p>
               <p>Counsel. I ask you again, was he an honest boy? - Yes; I would trust him with untold gold, if I had him home now.</p>

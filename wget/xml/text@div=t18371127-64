                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and live on Primrose-hill, Salisbury-square. At six o'clock in the evening of the 10th of No<lb></lb>vember, the prisoners came for two 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worths of gin and peppermint, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Hall gave me a half-crown in good money—I was about to give him change, and the other said it was not worth while to change a half-crown, he had got a sixpence—he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> down a sixpence, as he pretended, but it was a half-sovereign, a very good one—Hall said it was a half-sovereign, and asked if he knew what he was about—Hall said, "Give it him back again"—Hall then gave me this half-crown, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and then they went away in such a hurry that I thought there was something amiss—I looked into the till, and it was a bad half-crown—there was no other silver in the till—I gave them the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of my pocket—I went to the door, but could not see them.</p>

I have got sixpence"—I gave the half-crown back, and Hall put his fingers into his waistcoat pocket, and threw down a half-sovereign—I said, "Are you aware this is a half-sovereign? "—Hall began to abuse his friend, and said, "It is your bother; you made me give a half-sovereign for sixpence "—he said, "Never mind, take the half-crown; "and Mortimer put down the half-crown—it was Mortimer gave me both half-crowns, and Hall gave me the half-sovereign—when I looked at the half-crown given me the second time, I said, "This is a very bad one"—I called for Mr. Reeder, and gave him the half-crown—the watch<lb></lb>man was called in, and they were taken.</p>

               <p>THOMAS SMART. I live in Little Ryder-street, St. James's, and am a watch-maker. A black man came to me on Wednesday evening, the 7th of June, between seven and eight o'clock - I think it was the prisoner, but cannot swear to him; he had a dirty blue jacket and no handkerchief on. He bought a second-hand watch for two guineas, and paid me with a 10 l. note. I gave him 8 l. in change, and he paid me 2 s. next day when he came for the watch. Mr Sams has the note - (looks at it) - this is it; it has my writing on it. He took the watch away next day, and bought a second-hand seal and gold key; he said his name was

            . On Saturday, the 10th of June, I took the prisoner into custody, told him he was charged with robbing his master, and asked him what money he had about him? he gave me his purse from his pocket, it contained a 10 l. and four 1 l. Bank notes, and 13 s. 6 d. I found a silver hunting watch, with a gold seal and key in his pocket. I asked him how he got the money? he said he found the big note in the shop two or three days back; he afterwards said it was on Wednesday - he said he found two notes together, and bought a watch with the other.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Sams. The money was missed on Wednesday. I did not observe the desk till Thursday evening, when Mr. Sams was out. I locked the desk, and lifted up the flap afterwards. I found the asp had been wrenched from the flap, and stuck in again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). Sometime ago I broke a window - my master said if I broke another I should be turned away. I had the misfortune to break another; the woman who cleans the shop said I had better take care of my clothes, as the last boy was turned away without clothes or wages. Thinking I should be turned out destitute, I determined to take what I thought due to me, which I thought was two 1 l. notes, but as I could not read I took two 10 l. notes. When they were missed, and I found they were 10 l. notes, I was afraid to acknowledge it. My former master, Colonel 
               <persName id="t18200628-16-person204">Nicholls</persName>
            , questioned me about it, and I told him the truth. According to the ideas in which I had been brought up I thought I might take a compensation for my services, but I now know that I have done wrong. I humbly trust that when a British Jury considers that I have not had a Christian education, they will recommend me to the mercy of my King, for whom my fathers have often fought against the American States.</p>
               <p>MR. SAMS re-examined. When he came to me I clothed him, but if he had asked for money I should have given him some. I believe a woman in my service may have misled him.</p>

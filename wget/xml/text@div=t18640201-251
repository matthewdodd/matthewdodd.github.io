                  </hi>. I am the wife of a coffee-house keeper, at 37A, Wych-street, St. Clement's—about halt-past 12 on Saturday night, 10th January, I was passing along Wych-street on my way home, when three men and a woman attacked me—one man put his arm round my shoulders, put his hand in my pocket, and took my purse—the prisoner is the man—I held him—he caught me by the throat, and told the others to run—he then knocked me down, turned my clothes over my head, and put them in my mouth to prevent my screaming—I still held him, and he tried to get away—I held him by his neck—he beat my hand to loose himself, and then hit me in the stomach—I fell back, and he got away—a policeman then came to my assistance—the prisoner knocked me down three or four times—he fell with me; I kept hold of him all the time—he ran away before the policeman came up—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man—I next saw him on the same night, about half an hour afterwards, at Bow-street police station, and identified him from several other persons—I had 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was taken from me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, F</hi> 111). On Saturday, 10th January, I was on duty near Wych-street—I saw the prisoner in the Strand about half-past 12, with two other men and two women—I was in private clothes—I watched them, and they went into Wych-street—two or three minutes after<lb></lb>wards I went into Wych-street, and saw a crowd of several persons—I saw the prosecutrix lying on the ground, and the prisoner running away—I ran after him some distance, and lost him in the neighbourhood of Clare market—I saw him again about an hour afterwards in a pie-shop by Temple-bar, with three others—I took them all to the station, brought the prosecutrix</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was in company with the others, and passed this constable talking to another in the Strand. We went into Wych-street, and there was a disturbance. I saw people run past me, and a female and another constable in uniform. The female said something about being robbed. I walked home towards Clare market, and afterwards came back again. Do you think, if I had committed such a crime as this, I should have come back to the place? I met my friends again, and went to the pie<lb></lb>shop with them, and was taken.</p>

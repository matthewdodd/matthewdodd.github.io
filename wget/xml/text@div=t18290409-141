            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I was at home, the prisoner came to see me - the watch was in the room; I went for some beer, and was gone about ten minutes - when I returned, he and the watch were gone; I am certain the watch was there when I went out; he said he had come with a parcel to the top of the street, and he thought he would call and see me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner? A. About ten years; he was one of six children who were left orphans; the watch was in this case on the mantel-piece - I had not had it in my hand that day - it was about half-past ten o'clock when he called; there are no lodgers in the house; it is a butcher's shop - mine is the one pair front room; a person coming into the shop could not see the stairs - they go out of a passage; as I was coming back with the beer I met the prisoner going out; I said, "Charles, where are you going;" he said, "I will be back in a minute;" I am sure he did not say he was forced to be back in a minute from where he had been sent to.</p>

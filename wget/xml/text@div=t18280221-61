The prisoner, Barry, often slept in my house- my former wife was his sister. On the morning stated in the indictment, the 7th of December, I missed 43l. in sovereigns and Bank notes, also a cheque for 8l. 14s., and sixteen silver spoons; my money was kept in a large box, in the front room, first floor; I had buried my wife that day - I used to sleep in that room, but did not wish till it was cleaned; I had seen Barry that day, at the house; when I returned from my wife's funeral, about half-past one o'clock, he was in the room where the box was, and I thought he seemed in grief - he went up stairs, to the top-room of the house, and I did not see him afterwards, till he was apprehended; my box was locked - I found, about half-past one or two in the morning, that it was brought down stairs from the first floor into the back yard, and broken open; the watchman called me up at that hour - I found my tap-room window let down; I was the last person up at night; every thing was secure when I went to bed, the doors and windows - the windows bolt, they have no bars; the watchman had come in at the tap-room window, and came up to my bed-room, and alarmed me; I got up, and found the box in the yard, and the cash which was in it taken out, also the silver spoons; I observed no marks of violence in any part of the house - the box had been broken open with a poker - the lock had been started - suspicion fell on the prisoner, as he never came to the house after.</p>
               <p>Q. Who slept in your house that night? A. My maid and man-servant, and two children, the eldest of whom is thirteen years old; I found the servants still in bed, at the top of the house, and the children were in bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You do not know where Barry was when you found the box in the yard? A. No, I do not know who took it down there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was the last time you saw him in the house? A. Half-past one o'clock in the day, when I returned from the funeral; I saw him going up stairs at that time; I thought he went up to go to bed, as he had been sitting up the previous night with me.</p>

            . The prisoner, Barry, lodged with me, at No. 5, Well-street, Blackwall, Poplar; he lodged with me one night, about three weeks before Christmas, and came back again after Christmas; I cannot tell on what day of the month he first lodged with me - it was only one night, and he came back about three weeks after he left - that was about a fortnight after Christmas; he had a bundle in his hand; he paid me 23s. for the fortnight he had lodged with me; he said he could not give me any more money at that time; he went away, came back again, said he had no money, and gave me a cheque (looking at a cheque of 8l. 14s., produced by F. Fagan) - I cannot read, but this is very much like it; I showed it on Monday morning, the day after Barry gave it to me, to the prisoner, Murray, who is a pawnbroker - I showed it him to tell me what it was; he said it was out of date, and offered me 5s. for it; I do not know whether he was aware that I could not read; he told me the amount of it; I did not agree to take the 5s.; he said if he was to cash it for me, would I take half; I considered a little - I wanted money, and next morning I agreed to that - he gave me four sovereigns and 7s., and the day Mr. Ross came to me about it, Murray sent me the remainder by a man - that was after Barry was taken - he knew the enquiry was going on.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you to have received any further money from him? A. No; I had agreed to take the 4l. 7s. - I have not had the cheque since; I did not see Barry afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. He lodged with you one night, then left, and returned a fortnight after Christmas? A. Yes - he owed me 30s. for board and lodging - 10s. for a bed, and 10s. for the time he was with me before; I gave him no change for the cheque - he told me the value was 8l. 14s., and said he had no money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he lodge it with you as security, or were you to pay him the balance? A. He said it was as good as money to me, in case he should leave, and go to sea, if he got a ship.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You took the cheque to a pawnbroker's shop, kept by Miss Wood, I believe? A. Yes; Murray is her shopman - there was nobody present when I gave him the cheque; there was nobody opposite to me - I cannot say nobody was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not represent to Murray that you had received it from a lodger who was a very honest man? A. I never named such a thing to him - I said I received it from a lodger; I did not say he owed me 30s., but showed it to him - he offered me 5s. - I said I would not give it him for that; I said I got it from a lodger, but said nothing about his being honest.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, did not you tell Mr. Ross, after, that you found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210068"></xptr>the cheque in a cook-shop? A. When he first asked me the question; I said so, as I was afraid I could not find Barry, but I went to Gravesend and found him; I did not say when I found it, or where, except that it was at a cook-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Murray over and over again, requested by you to give cash for it, before he consented? A. Never; he did not say he would give me half, and the rest when he had ascertained that it was good; I did not send a woman for the rest of the money - her name was not McCarthy; I never sent her to say I wanted the other part of the money to go to Gravesend, to apprehend the person who gave it to me.</p>

               <p>Q. After that, did he give her any money? A. He put the other half into a drawer, till further notice.

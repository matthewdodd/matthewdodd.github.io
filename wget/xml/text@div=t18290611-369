On the 8th of April, the prisoner, whom I knew, came to our warehouse between five and six o'clock, and asked for Mr. Burbidge; I said he was gone home - there were ten shawls lying in the warehouse they had been marked by me for a particular purpose - he staid about a quarter of an hour, and when he was gone, I missed two; I sent our apprentice after the prisoner - he came back; I asked him to walk in the counting-house, and taxed him with having the two shawls - he denied it; I told him I could not think of his leaving the place till he convinced me he had not got them - he told me had not; I wished him to take off his hat - he asked me the reason of that; I told him from a circumstance which had occurred some time before - he took off his hat, and gave me the two shawls out of it; he promised that he would return the next morning to see one of my employers, and I let him go, but he did not return - I did not see him again till Friday, when he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was be taken at his own house? A. Yes; by Mr. Burbidge - I believe Mr. Burbidge has known him ten or twelve years; I believe some of the female members of their families are related; I was not present at any interview between him and Mr. Burbidge - I know he came there with Mr. Burbidge; I was at the warehouse at the time; he was in the counting-house with Mr. Puzey, perhaps twenty minutes or half an hour - he was then given into custody; I am sure he did not say, "I have not stolen the shawls."</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is the prisoner in the habit of dealing there? A. No; he came backwards and forwards as one of the family.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received the prisoner at the prosecutor's house - these shawls were delivered to me.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a long address to the Court, stated that this prosecution arose from vindictive feelings on the part of Mr. Puzey; that Mr. Burbidge had signed an instrument, declaring the prosecution was carried on entirely against his will, and had ordered Wray not to appear; that he (the prisoner,) had the use of the prosecutor's counting-house for his business at all times; and having an order for shawls, took these, not thinking it necessary to name it to Wray, as he was on such friendly terms with them; he then stated that Mr. Puzey had told a Mr. White, that he would not proceed, if he received 40l.; and that he, the prisoner, was in good circumstances, and could have no motive to commit such an offence.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY to MR. PUZEY. Q.Have you had any conversation with any person? A. Yes, Mr. White and another gentleman; I never said if I could have the 40l. I would not prosecute - I said I believed my partner put Wray out of the way; I am satisfied he was very desirous of getting him off - he brought him, and said, "Here is Wall, do what you will with him;" I believe he has lent the prisoner 500l. at a time - he had a good opinion of him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was the drawer you put the notes in? A.

            . I attend from the Bank, and have produced two notes, which have been shown to the witnesses; they correspond with two of the numbers which the last witness has named.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you the person who pays the notes? A. No - they were paid in by bankers, one by Jones and Lloyd, and the others by Herries.</p>

               <p>Thomas Smith's Defence. On the 21st of February I went to my mother's house, and found Mrs. Phelps there, drinking - she asked me when I came in if I had any money; I threw down a shilling, and sent for some liquor - we remained drinking there till half-past twelve o'clock at night, and made an appointment to go and meet a party to go to the trial; in the morning, when I got up, I went out with my father-in-law - I had not made up my mind whether I would go or not: I went with him to the Caledonian Arms, and by; his advice came down here - I met Mrs. Phelps at the King of Denmark public-house: she said,"Let us go and have some drink;" I said she had had quite enough and persuaded her to stop till Mrs. Harbour came out of the prison, from seeing her daughter; after that Mrs. Phelps told me to go and ask the prosecutor if he would have any thing to drink - I did so, and we drank over at the Rose - we sat there from eleven o'clock till two, eating and drinking, both beer and spirits: when she came out she was intoxicated, and unable to walk - I said, "Let me conduct you, and I will get you a coach:" she had torn her gown - she had offered me money several times, but I made her put it into her pocket; I put them all into a coach, and I rode on the box - near Sobo-square she desired more drink; they sat in the coach, and had a pint of gin - I got on the box again, and drove them to No. 24, Hawkins-street, where they had more liquor, and being late, I led her home; she said, "Well, we have not had much dinner - I have got a bit of pickled pork, will you partake of it?" she gave me a sovereign to fetch a pint of gin - I gave her the change: as to the money she lost, I know nothing of it - I certainly put her on the bed, at her daughter's request, and left the daughter in the room.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave Elizabeth Smith a good character.</p>

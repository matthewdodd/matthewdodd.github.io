                  </hi>. I live at 18, Whitcomb Street, Leicester Square—I was tried and acquitted on a charge of stealing a cistern, in which a man named Wilson was prosecutor—I don't remember the date—I think it was somewhere about the 15th December last—I afterwards instructed my attorneys to bring an action against Wilson for false imprisonment, that action was pending at the time I was taken into custody on a charge of receiving a watch, knowing it to have been stolen—I know Sheldrake and Row<lb></lb>land—they were on and off in my employment, up to last September—since then Sheldrake has often been at my place in the ordinary way with his brother—on Monday, 7th May, the day before the policeman took me into custody, I saw Sheldrake—he had been in the habit of coming to me to borrow tools, and I have occasionally assisted him—on Wednesday, 8th May, about 8 o'clock in the evening, I was just coming home, entering my door, when I was accosted by the Detective Butcher—we went into the house together—we went straight into the shop parlour—I had a conversation with Butcher, in consequence of which I searched the pockets of the clothes I was wearing, and also the pockets of a coat that was hanging behind the door—during this transaction Mrs. Gowley, my housekeeper, came into the room where Butcher and I were, and in my presence she searched the coat that was hanging behind the door—she took out from that coat a small parcel, wrapped up in dirty paper, which turned out to be a little Geneva watch—that, watch was afterwards identified at the Middlesex Sessions by</p>

               <p>the prisoner Wallace as his—I was then and there taken by Butcher to the police-station, on the charge of receiving that watch, knowing it to be stolen—about 10.30 that night, I saw Wallace at the station—next morn<lb></lb>ing an examination took place, and I was remanded—at the second hearing Sheldrake was called into Court—then the trial followed—on Wednesday, 22nd May, when I was at the Sessions House, I saw the two Sheldrakes—I saw them again on Thursday—my trial took place on the Thursday—I heard the evidence of Samuel Sheldrake—it is not true that on 7th May, I went and had a pint of beer with him at Mr. Sewell's; it is true that I went and had a pint of beer with him, but not at Sewell's—it is not true that I asked him to buy a watch, or that I produced a watch and asked 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and that it would take half-a-crown to repair; it is not true that he said he would go and see if it was worth anything—I was not in the house with him quite five minutes—he had brought back a tool that he had borrowed—I had never seen the watch until it was produced from my pocket by Mrs. Gowley.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is not true that I have been in the habit of buying lead and other stolen property, or that for eight or ten years past I have been receiving stolen goods—I know that Butcher, the detective, has said so—it is not true what he has sworn—it is not true that I have employed thieves in my service, not many of them—I have employed one convicted man of the name of Bottom; he is a respectable man now—I have only employed one thief—I swear that—Bottom is the one—I have had him in my service off and on two or three years—he has been convicted several times—I have got him in my service now—I have employed a person called Griffin as an errand boy—I was not aware that he had been convicted of stealing boots to the value of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Opie &amp; Humby's, in Pall Mall—I did not know that he had only been out of prison a month when I took him into my service—I never sent Griffin to Mr. Reed's for employment—I gave him a character to a person in Regent Street, a French name; it is some years ago—Erhbroner is the name—I don't know that Griffin robbed him, I know it now—I did not have a sovereign for giving the character of Griffin as an honest man to Erhbroner; that is not true—I did not know Griffin when he was in Mr. Reed's employment, he never was in Mr. Reed's employment—I can't remember whether I sent him to Mr. Reed's to work for me, it is some time ago—Mr. Reed, of Great Pulteney Street, was a customer of mine—he did not at any time complain that one of my men, Griffin, had cut the lead off his premises—I never heard that—the police did not come to me about it—I knew a rag-shop in Norris Street, at the back of the Haymarket; it is not there now—I took the son of that man into my service as a little errand-boy, quite a boy—it is so long ago, I can't remember whether I took him about the time Mr. Reed was complaining to me—I had no intimation given to me that I should have till 8 o'clock at night to put back the lead—I never had a person named Bottomley in my employment—I have gone by the name of John Long for family reasons, which I can tell you—I went down to York at one time—I was away for three or four days to see my father—I dyed my whiskers and hair at that time—I did not go by the name of Long then—I did not go away to York because the police had been to my place—the dyeing of the hair and whiskers had nothing to do with the police—my place has been once searched for stolen property, that was some time ago, two or three years, all that—I was employed by Mr. Wilson to do some work there—I am a plumber and glazier</p>

               <p>—Sheldrake was not employed there by me—a man named Ayres was—there was a lead cistern there over the counting-house—I instructed Ayres to cut out the lead—I did not find that Ayres was not a skilful man, and I did not employ some one else to go at 5 o'clock in the morning to cut it out—I did not take Sheldrake at 5 o'clock in the morning and help him with a ladder whilst he cut out the lead of that cistern—I did not tell Sheldrake not to make a mess, either on the roof or on the pavement, because Mr. Wilson's men might see it; besides, the cistern was my own—I did not tell Sheldrake to put zinc there in place of it, it never was put there—I did not sell that cistern for a penny a pound at a shop in Whitcomb Street; I exchanged it for some lead with Mr. Pickersgill, it would not do to sell old lead for a penny a pound in the trade—a man named Scott was my partner at that time—a complaint was made by Mr. Wilson that the water was coming through the roof into the counting-house—I did not say to Wilson, in the presence of Henry Scott, that it was a b—thing of a squint-eyed bricklayer who had been drunk two or three days, who must have stolen the cistern; nothing of the sort; it was not stolen, it was my own property—Wilson did not say in my presence and in Scott's presence, that if ever he found out who had taken the cistern he would prosecute them—I did not say in Scott's presence that I was very sorry, but I could not account for the cistern being gone—I afterwards told Scott that I had taken out the lead according to contract, but not that I had sold it to any party—Scott did not tell me that he had seen the cistern in the marine-store dealer's shop, in Whitcomb Street; he told somebody else, not in my presence—I did not say "Yes, I sold it there"—Scott said "It is a good way of doing business to sell a cistern for a penny a pound when the value would be 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to us," but I told him quite different—he did not say that to me; I had no conversation with him about it; he was about leaving me, and he was vindictive—I did not beg Mr. Scott not to say anything about it to Mr. Wilson—Mr. Scott ceased to be my partner about five or six weeks afterwards, I think, according to my recollection, I can't tell you exactly—it was after that conversation I was prosecuted by Mr. Wilson for stealing the cistern—I recollect Butcher taking me on that charge about the cistern—I said to Butcher "What cistern do you mean?"—we had several of them, three or four—Butcher came and asked me about it; he said he was sent by Mr. Wilson—I should think that was four or five weeks after I had had the cistern cut out; it was in September, I think, that it was cut out—I told Butcher I did not know what cistern he meant, because I had repaired three; as soon as I remembered I told him "Yes, that was in the contract"—I had taken it away by contract and replaced another—I did not tell him that I had never seen it—I was committed for trial for stealing the cistern—I said then that it was under a contract, and I proved it—we took it away and repaired the lead flat on account of the water coming in—it rained tremendously, and of course we had not the means of getting it done; as soon as it was fair, we repaired it—between my com<lb></lb>mittal and my trial, Rowland called at my house; I did not request him to see Sheldrake, and beg him not to come to the trial; I knew too well what Rowland was—Sheldrake did not work at Mr. Wilson's previous to the time the cistern was taken away—I never went with Sheldrake with a ladder to Mr. Wilson's premises, and go up the ladder on to the roof—Sheldrake did not point out to me that the lead over the cistern had been partly cut; he had nothing to do with it—I said Dick, meaning Ayres, did cut it out; I</p>

               <p>had no conversation with Sheldrake about it; I never said to him that I wanted it done before 6 o'clock in the morning—I was present when it was removed, and Wilson was there too, at 10 o'clock in the morning, by contract—I never saw Wallace before—I saw him in Court and never spoke to him—the coat that was hanging behind the door I had last worn the night before, out of doors in the street; I think Mrs. Gowley took the watch out of the pocket, according to my recollection; I think she took it out and gave it to Butcher, it is not the fact that she went through several pockets, and after that Butcher went to a particular pocket and produced the watch; I went to several pockets, and could not find it; I did not dream about a watch—Mrs. Gowley felt and found it in a little pocket on the right-hand side; a tail pocket I think—I was represented at Marl borough Street by Mr. Froggatt, the solicitor, on this charge—I heard Mr. Froggatt ask Butcher who gave him information; he was asked some questions, but he did not think proper to answer—I think he was asked if he knew Sheldrake, and he said he did not—I think Sheldrake was then called in by my solicitor—I don't know that Butcher then said that was the man that gave him the information; I did not hear—Sheldrake was not made a witness against me at that time—I think Mr. Knox gave Butcher some little under<lb></lb>standing to the effect that he was not to disclose who gave him the infor<lb></lb>mation—I was out on bail—I saw Samuel and William Sheldrake at the Middlesex Sessions before the trial came on—I heard they were to be witnesses against me—I heard also that they were going to be witnesses in Mr. Wilson's matter of the action, but no witnesses were required, they were never there, and knew nothing at all about the transaction, not the slightest—I believe William Sheldrake was charged with these persons and all the evidence gone into against him—I heard him swear at the Sessions House that he was at a public-house where the watch was produced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I was tried for the cistern, I produced evidence in support of my allegation that it was a matter of contract, to the satisfaction of the Jury—Mr. Scott appeared as a witness against me—at that time we had dissolved partnership—the dyeing my hair and whiskers and going to York had reference to family matters which I could explain in a moment.</p>

I live at 18, Whitcomb Street, and am house<lb></lb>keeper to the prosecutor—I was at home on 8th May—the day before that Sheldrake came to the house and brought back a putty knife that he had borrowed—on 8th May, he came to the house after breakfast, in the fore<lb></lb>noon; I think it would be about 11 o'clock—he also came in the afternoon—we had some conversation; he was in-doors, at the centre door, the parlour door; he remained there between half and three-quarters of an hour; he remained just at the door—I did not remain in the room all the time; I was obliged to go up stairs to one of the lodgers just for a minute or two, and I left Sheldrake there, and when I came down again, I found him there, and he remained about ten minutes or so afterwards—Mr. Moorhouse's over<lb></lb>coat was hanging on the door; it was a coat that he sometimes wore over his house-coat—on that day, while Butcher was there, I heard a ring at the bell, and heard Sheldrake's voice asking if Mr. Moorhouse was in—in Butcher's presence, I searched three of the pockets of the great coat; I took the watch out of the coat—I searched the last pocket in consequence of something that Butcher said to me—on a Friday night, about 9 o'clock, about seven weeks before this occurred, I remember Wallace coming to the private door and asking if Mr. Moorhouse wag in—I told him he was not</p>

               <p>that must do"—I then left, and met him at the station at 10.30—Moorhouse was then charged, and Wallace signed the sheet—the watch was produced—he was asked if that was his watch, and he said yes—Sergeant McGilli<lb></lb>cuddy, who was the inspector in charge, held out the watch in his hand, and said "Is that your watch?" and the moment, before the words were out of his mouth, Wallace said "Yes, that is my watch"—next morning, as I was on my way from where I live to Vine Street, I met Sheldrake at the corner of Grafton Street, Bond Street—he said "Well, how did you get on last night, did you get Old Johnny?"—I said "Yes, and the watch too"—he said "I told you would, I was sure it was there"—he asked where I found it—I said it was found in a coat hanging behind the door—I then left him, and went to Marlborough Street—Moorhouse was remanded for a week—on the remand, on 16th May, I saw Sheldrake, and his brother William, and Wallace, at Marlborough Street—it is not true that Wallace pointed out the two Sheldrakes to me, saying "There are two young men who know something about the watch;" nothing of the kind—I had no conversation at all with Sheldrake at Marlborough Street—it was upon Sheldrake's information given to me at the Vine Street Station, that I went and took Moorhouse into custody—Wallace did not tell me that the Shel<lb></lb>drakes were coming to the Sessions—I saw all three defendants at the Middlesex Sessions on Monday, 20th May—I went before the Grand Jury on the Tuesday, and a true bill was returned that day—the two Sheldrakes and Wallace were in company together on the Tuesday—the case was fixed for trial on the Wednesday, but was tried on the Thursday—I saw all the three defendants there on Wednesday, in company together—on the Thurs<lb></lb>day, shortly after 10 o'clock, just before the case was called on, Sheldrake said to me "My brother and me are come down to speak what we know about the watch"—I said "Are you going to give evidence?"—he said "Yes"—I then took him to Mr. Sawyer, the clerk to the County Solicitor, to take his deposition—it was a prosecution by the county—I left him with Mr. Sawyer, and went up stairs into the Court—while Wallace was being examined I and the two Sheldrakes were on the balcony, outside the Court, and Samuel Sheldrake said to me "What about if I am asked who gave you the information, must I say or not?"—I said "Please yourself," and turned away from him, and never spoke any more—he said "Then I shall deny it"—I was subsequently called into Court, and in the prisoner's presence asked from whom I received the information—I had known Rowland many years, ten years at least, but never spoke to him—I had not known Wallis or Sheldrake.</p>

He said, 'I wish you knew as much about my portmanteau as you do about Wilson's lead cistern job.' He was often telling me why I did not go up and speak the truth. I said I did not like to. I had not been in a Police Court, and I did not like to. I said if it came to a push I'll tell Mr.</p>

               <p>Wilson. I was at work with Mr. L. one day, and he said he'd got a job to do in the evening, would I help him and stop to tea. I finished the job. Mr. L. went out, and came back and asked me to go and have a drop of beer in at Clark's public-house, St. Alban's Place, where Mr. Wilson came into afterwards. He spoke to me, and I told him all about when I cut out the lead cistern. Mr. Wilson said to me that he had got a young man to introduce to me who had been in the employ of Mr. Moorhouse. That was Rowlands. From that time up to the proceedings connected with the watch case we were often together. When I was at work for Mr. L., Row<lb></lb>lands used to come and call me away often, and one afternoon said: 'I've bought a watch; this (showing me the watch) is going to be put into Moorhouse's pocket. I bought it of a young chap that sells coins. It will be a proper thing to have Johnny, as he's trying to get you into prison.' Two days after that he came and called me away from work, and showed me the man he had bought it of, and showed me a bad shilling he had in his pocket, and wanted some bad money to put in as well. He said, 'I am going to pay this young chap to put it in.' I was playing at bagatelle at Barnell's public-house, and he came and told me I must go and give infor<lb></lb>mation to Mr. Butcher that the watch was in Mr. Moorhouse's pocket, or else he'd give us five years. I've been in company with Rowlands and Wilson several times in connection with this matter. He (Wilson) told Rowlands in my presence that he would give Rowlands 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if the case against Moorhouse came off. The same night I gave information to Mr. Butcher, and he (Rowlands) said, 'Something must be done for Bottom; you go down there (to Moorhouse's) and try and get him (Bottom) into Saint James' Square,' and showed me a key and said, 'Look, this is what will do it; we can do it with this.' I said, 'I won't have anything to do with it; you can do as you like about it.' Rowlands asked me one day to ask Ludbrooke if he had a coat to put into Johnny's (meaning Moorhouse's), and I said no, I wouldn't. Rowlands gave me the watch, and said, 'Show it to your brother,' and I was to show it to my brother and tell him that Moorhouse had offered it to me for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I showed it to my brother in Sewell's public-house; the same day I saw Moorhouse, and had beer with him. I gave the watch back to Rowlands, who was waiting at Surrage's public-house. Moorhouse never had the watch. I did not put the watch into Moorhouse's pocket; it was put there by the man of whom Rowlands stated to me he had bought the watch. My brother knew no more of it than that I did show him the watch as directed by Rowlands. I make this statement without any hope or inducement being held out to me to do so by any one <hi rend="smallCaps">S. SHELDRAKE</hi>. Witnessed, Hy. Hambling, Insp.

I was at the police-station at Vine Street on 4th May, when Wallace came and made a complaint of being robbed of his watch—he gave me a description which is in the book that I produce, the number was given the following day to another sergeant who was on duty.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Wallace told me he could get the number—he stated that as he was standing in the street two persons came up one after the other and asked him the way, going in different directions—he said the watch was severed from a common black chain, and he showed me a portion of it—he did not say where he got the watch from—the name of Brown was not mentioned to me—I took his address and statement in the usual way,</p>

I took the prisoners on a warrant—Rowland said "Yes"—Wallace said "It is quite right, the watch was stolen," Sheldrake made no remark—while they were in prison Sheldrake made a communication to me—he said he wished to see Mr. Froggatt, to make a statement—in consequence of that I communicated with Mr. Froggatt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I took Wallace I told him the charge would be for conspiring with reference to the watch—I read the substance of the warrant, and then it was he said it was quite right, the watch was stolen—he did not say that he had been no party to anything wrong in the matter—I copied his words down at the time.</p>

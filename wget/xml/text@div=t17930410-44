               <p>My husband is a shoemaker. On Wednesday morning the 13th of March, about eleven o'clock, I came from market and my husband came to me, I live in White-cross-street, about a mile from Leaden-hall-market; Poll, says he, they are cutting up leather next door; says he, Mrs. Jackson has been in and said so; I went and looked into a place called a hay lost, and I saw two of them cutting up leather; the prisoner was one, but who the other was I cannot tell, they were cutting up the leather into square pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in where they were? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so curious to look into their room? - Mrs. Jackson mentioning it to my husband and he mentioning it to me. I saw them afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100057"></xptr>with some bundles, he went down past my window with a knot.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a porter? - I cannot tell; I saw him with a knot and leather on his shoulder going down the court, Plaster-court, it is the court where I live, I live next door to this hay loft; he took the leather and carried it into Playhouse-yard, and put it into his cart, from that he went back again; I went to Arthur's, who had been a constable, and Mr. Foxon was in the place at the time, and I told them I thought there was a man in the court had got some stolen leather, and I went and shewed them where the cart was with the leather, and he stopped till the prisoner came with the rest of the leather, I stopped till he came, the constable then charged him with stealing the leather, and he was taken to Worship-street; I cannot positively swear to the leather.</p>

            , and took the leather, and have kept it ever since; I am a constable; when I detected the prisoner he said, what is that to me? I pulled out my staff and said, I am an officer, I have an information that you have some stolen property; he said, he was going to take it to his master, Mr. Cox, in Chick-lane, and desired me to go to his master and then I should soon know whether it was stolen or no; I told him I should not go to his master, I should take him to the office in Worship-street and if it was his master's property he might send for him, and his master would come forward. (The leather produced and deposed to by Mr. Dyster having lost three hides, one out of a parcel of eight hides and two of a parcel of twenty two hides, and having seen them complete the night before; I know it by the hammer mark.)</p>
               <p>Court. Can you tell it to be your's by the hammer mark? - I can, one was tanned in Poulton in Lancashire.</p>
               <p>Q. As to this hammer mark that is the officer's mark? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not more tanners in that district whom the officer marks with the same hammer mark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you prove that to be a bit more your's than any other person's in the district? - None had been up from this place I suppose this three months, they only come up now and then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am a bone jeweller by trade, and it is very slack; I porter in the morning; I had an order for a gross of diamond scutcheons the Tuesday before this happened; I made them and carried them home, and while I was gone this here parcel was brought to my place, bag and basket, by a knock at the door to know whether there was a porter lived there? my wife was laying in at the time; there was a woman who came to see her, and she asked her to stop and have a drop of caudle, and while she was there this here man came and my wife sent this woman to me, to the Three Mariners at Fore-street, for at the time the East India company's ships sail, Mr. Newbank, in Grub-street, kills for them, and I am a swabber, I wash the hogs down; my wife sent this woman to find me and before I went with her I found they were going to kill on the Thursday following, and I asked the woman to come back to my wife and I gave her 2 s. to take to her, and told her to tell my wife I would come back as soon as I could, when I came home it was too late to carry them that night, and I went and took it in the morning; the woman can tell more about it than I can.</p>

I answered yes, he asked if he would carry that load? his wife said, where was it? he left the load; I desired him to carry the load back into the yard, it was carried back into the yard so far, as that the child went into the yard after, that and see two or three pieces lay and brings it in, and said, mammy here is some bits of leather; the man asked the wife if the husband would carry it to Mr. Cox's, Chick-lane, the husband was not at home, the man who brought it begged it might be taken care of, as there was a great hole in the bottom of the bag.</p>

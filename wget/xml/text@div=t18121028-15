            . Q. Are you sworn - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Caley - A. I do. I have known him since the 4th of June last, and since that time I have had transactions with him. The first meeting I had with him, was at the <placeName id="t18121028-15-crimeloc101">Noah's Ark public house, in Oxford-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Have you been in the habit of meeting him at public houses, or at private houses - A. Public houses in general.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner's residence - A. No, I never asked him; he always kept it a secret.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he inform you his mode of dealing - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. In the respect of the things that you purchased of him - A. He stated to me, on the 4th of June last, that if I was beginning to act upon his principles, he would serve me with forged notes, at half price; he, at that time, served me with twelve pounds worth.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not want to hear that, I want to hear what he said - A. He said, in disposing of these articles he always acted with the greatest caution, and that he never carried these notes about him. That he had always had a person attendant upon him, to avoid detection. That person was to attend to carry the forged notes, and taking away the money that was paid for the forged notes, so that, in case of detection, neither the forged notes, nor the money that was paid for them, could be found upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, about the beginning of September, you were taken up yourself - A. Yes, on the 6th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell what past on the 12th of September - A. On the 12th of September, I met the prisoner at the Lord Nelson public-house, Trafalgar-street, Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Previous to your meeting him there, had you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181210280040"></xptr> been searched - A. Yes, I had been searched by the officers of Shadwell Police. I was searched from top to toe, entirely; and, previous to my being searched, I had nothing but a few halfpence of my own. The money was given to me tied up in a handkerchief. I did not know exactly the amount; it was tied up in a handkerchief by the officers of Shadwell Police.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of your receiving that money - A. For the purpose of procuring forged banknotes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you met the prisoner at the Nelson public-house, had any appointment been made - A. Yes, it had by the prisoner, with me. We proceeded to the Lord Nelson public-house, where I met the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Who accompanied you - A. The officers of Shadwell Police. When I came I found the prisoner sitting in the tap-room of the public-house. I went in by myself; the officers were at a distance. I found the prisoner sitting in the tap-room. After sitting there the space of ten minutes, the prisoner told me to get up and follow him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to him before he desired you to get up and follow him - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any thing with you - A. I had the marked money, nothing else, it was in an hankerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the manner in which you carried the money upon former occasions, when you transacted business with him - A. Yes, it was. The prisoner told me to get up and follow him; I got up and followed him. We had proceeded about thirty or forty yards from the Lord Nelson public-house. He there asked me for the money that I had about me. He told me to wait near the spot where he took the money from me, and he would return in a few minutes. The prisoner asked me what quantity I would have. He said he had the usual quantity, which was 20 l. worth 40 l. of nominal value. He took the money from me in the hankerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. This was about thirty or forty yards from the public-house in the street - A. Yes; the prisoner then left me, and told me to wait near the place where he took the money from me, but I, knowing the important business that I had to transact, followed him to know where he got the forged notes. I followed him about fifteen yards further; the prisoner turned the corner, and I lost sight of him. I waited at the corner of the street where I missed him, and the prisoner came out of a public house, situated at the corner of that street; I think it called the Golden Key, in Church-street. The prisoner came out of this public house and gave me the notes, two small parcels tied up in brown paper. We returned back to the Lord Nelson public-house, from whence we came.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been absent from the Lord Nelson - A. About five minutes, from the first going out to the coming back with the notes. We there sat down. I called for six-penny worth of gin and water, to drink. After calling for the liquor, I went to the door, to give the appointed signal to the officers, that I had purchased the forged notes. One of the officers came up and apprehended the prisoner. When he was apprehended, the prisoner cried out, take that monster out of my sight, or else he would murder me.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the prisoner made this expression, had any thing been said - A. Nothing whatever; he was not charged with any offence. The prisoner was secured, and taken into custody; I was likewise taken into custody. I was searched by the officer, and the notes that I had purchased were found in my left-hand breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these parcels in the very same state that you had received them - A. The very same; they were the very parcels that I had purchased of him, and in the same state.</p>
               <p>Q. Previous to your meeting at the Nelson, had you mentioned to any person the place that he resorted - A. I could not, I did not know. I pointed out the corner house to the officers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You were taken in custody and searched, and forged notes found upon you - A. I was, after the prisoner was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you had been in custody before, under a charge respecting forged notes - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. You began to think your valuable life would be lost to the community - A. I did not give it a thought.</p>
               <p>Q. I shall not waste much time with you, what had you been before this - A. A boot closer.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been no other occupation for the last two years - A. I have been no other occupation.</p>
               <p>Q. Not a soldier - A. I have not been a soldier.</p>

               <p>Q. Have not you been a militia man - A. I am not a militia man.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, of course, you have not been in two regiments of militia. Were you never in the West Middlesex militia - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I am going to ask you a question that you may object to if you like, your having received bounty in one regiment of militia, did not you enlist in the second - A. I shall object to that question, it is not properly put.</p>
               <p>MR. WESTWOOD. Q. I believe you have been for some years in the office of the solicitor of the Bank - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of Faggard being in custody, and from some communication that you had from him, did you see him searched - A. I did, on Saturday the 12th of September, between ten and eleven in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he remaining upon him before that search - A Only a few halfpence; he had no other metal.</p>
               <p>Q. Or paper - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was then any thing delivered to him - A. I delivered to him two 1 l. notes and four 2 l. notes, which I had previously marked. I also took an account, in writing of the dates and numbers of the notes, also the names by whom they were signed. I also delivered to him 5 l. in silver; it was all marked by me. Twenty three shilling tokens, each piece marked. Twenty eighteen-penny tokens, and ten shillings, in shillings. In paper and metal I delivered to him 15 l. altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him after that - A. He went from the office with the officers. He was searched of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181210280041"></xptr> the office. I left him with Hewit and Butler, two officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give it to him in any handkerchief - A. I gave it to him tied up in this handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon, after he left the office, did you see the handkerchief again - A. I think I saw it on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you examined that handkerchief which is now near you - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that exactly alike, in all respects, what you gave him - A. It is exactly the whole of what I gave him in the handkerchief.</p>

            . I am an officer of Shadwell office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the 12th of September last, being in company with Butler, and seeing Faggard - A. Yes, I do. I searched Faggard all over, very minutely Mr. Westwood was present at the time. Mr Westwood delivered to Faggard 15 l. in money and notes. I put my mark upon it as well as Mr. Westwood. The notes and the money were given to him in a handkerchief. After the money was given to him, I accompanied him to the Lord Nelson; when we got to the Lord 
               <persName id="t18121028-15-person414">Nelson</persName>
             I left him. Then Faggard went in; we were about. He had been in about ten minutes before he came out of the door, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body with him when he came out - A. I did not observe any body; he gave a signal to me, which we had agreed on. I then ran up to the Lord Nelson public-house. I saw the prisoner, Caley, sitting there. He was alone when I went in; Butler was with me. Faggard went in with me. Upon my securing him, he said, take that monster out of my sight, he wants to take away my life. I searched Faggard, and found upon him two bundles of notes, in his left-hand breeches pocket. I afterwards marked them before I parted with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these notes, and tell me whether these are your marks upon these notes - A. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your finding these notes, you then went to Crane's, did you not - A. We went to Cranes, in Red Cow-lane, in Bow-lane; it goes into Mile-end Road. It is a private house. After we had been there some time, a young woman, which turned out to be Crane's daughter, came. Mr. Hope, my brother officer, went to the door and let her in; he laid hold of her, and took a little bundle from under her arm; he took a handkerchief from her. I saw what was in the handkerchief; it contained silver and notes. It was the marked silver and notes that Mr. Westwood gave to Faggard. I accompanied them to the Lord Nelson. Faggard went in before. I came up, and saw the prisoner come out of the Lord Nelson public-house; they walked down the street, to near where I was standing. Faggard gave me a signal to stand back, and in about two minutes after that, Faggard gave me a signal, at the door, to come forward. I went into the Lord Nelson public-house, and secured the prisoner. He made a strong resistance. I desired Faggard to assist me, which he did. Hewitt came into me. The prisoner then said, take the monster out of my sight, otherwise I will murder him. He said he would swear his life away; he was come to swear his life away. He asked what he had done, for us to secure him in that kind of way; he was told, he would answer that another day. Faggard was searched then. I saw Hewitt take from Faggard them bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Faggard went into the Lord Nelson, had he any such notes upon him - A. Certainly not, I had searched him myself. After that we went to Crane's.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there when a girl of the name of Crane came home - A. I was; she had a bundle taken from her.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever seen any person come out of that house - A. I had, the prisoner. On the 11th I watched that house, in consequence of an information I received from a woman, a friend of Faggard's.</p>
               <p>Q. This girl came home - A. Yes, she had a bundle with her; I saw it taken from her. I examined it, afterwards. I saw it marked before Faggard had it. It exactly corresponded with the marked money that Mr. Westwood gave to Faggard, and it was in the same handkerchief.</p>
               <p>MRS. EMSON. Q. In the month of September last, did you keep the Lord Nelson public-house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the 12th of that month, any person being at your house, that you have seen since - A. Yes, two persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the prisoner, Caley - A. Yes, and I know the person of Faggard. These two persons were in company at my house on that day. When I first saw them they were in the tap-room, both together. They had been in my house about ten minutes before the officers came in. I have seen Caley and Faggard in company together at my house before, about four or five times, within a fortnight of the time of Caley being taken up, I have seen Caley and Faggard together.</p>

She was in the back parlour, and I remember the prisoner coming to my house on that day. She stopped a good bit before he came. He came and went into the back room, to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner, Caley, at your house before - A. Yes; he did go to her in the back parlour. He did not stay there many minutes, and then went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any except these two in the back parlour, while they were there - A. No. I have seen the prisoner at my house, several times before that, and

             coming into your master's house, on the 12th of September - A. Yes, on Saturday. She had nothing with her when she came into the house. Afterwards I saw the prisoner, Caley, come into the house; he went to her, in the back parlour. The prisoner brought a handkerchief in his hand, it was such a looking handkerchief as that, but I cannot swear to the handkerchief; it was like that. The handkerchief was tied up, as if something was in it. The prisoner did not stay above two or three minutes. He did not take away the handkerchief that I saw him bring. I saw him come out of the parlour; he had no handkerchief in his hand. After he was gone, I saw the handkerchief in Susannah Crane's hand. She was opening it, and I saw some three shilling pieces fall to the ground, as she was opening the handkerchief and looking in it, to see what was in it. She staid about half an hour after the man was gone away, and when she went away, she took the handkerchief under her arm. I have seen the prisoner, Caley, and

               <persName id="t18121028-15-person425">A. John Crane</persName>
            , he lives in Devonshire-street, Globe-lane, Bethnal-Green.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived there - A. Better than a quarter of a year.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner, Caley - A. Better than a twelve month.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the public-house that Mrs. Lazarus keeps - A. I do; I have been there two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you taken refreshment there, what is called lunching - A. Yes, I have done that. I have been in company with other people at that public house, and I have been there with the prisoner, Caley.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there on the 12th of September, and what time was it - A. In the forenoon; I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. On that day, where had you met Caley - A. I met him in Brick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you went to the Golden Key - A. No great length of time. He asked me where I was going; I told him I was going into Bishopsgate-street, to take a walk, not upon any business at all. He desired me to go to the Golden Key, and there to wait, and he would come to me. I had been at that house before. I went accordingly, and went into the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the room that you resorted to before, upon former occasions - A. Yes, I had been in that room before, and I might have been in the room a quarter of an hour before Caley came. Caley did not remain in the room any time. He said, you stop a bit, I will come again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring any thing with him - A. Not as I know of, he came to me in that room.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he bring with him, have a care what you are about - A. He brought nothing with him as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you remain in that Golden Key after he came in - A. I remained something near an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry any thing away from that Key when you went to your father's house - A. I took in with me that bundle contained money, notes and silver tokens. I opened the bundle, after the prisoner left me, the bundle was a handkerchief, there were notes and tokens in the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open it, and while you were opening it, did you drop any of the tokens - A. No, I did not, sir. I carried it home with me. He told me he would come to me again; he did not. I waited near upon an hour, and then I went from that public house to my father's house, and when I came to the door it was opened by a stranger, and my bundle was taken from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, ma'am, where did you get that bundle - A. I had that bundle given to me by a man just beyond Bethnal-Green workhouse, in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man - A. Why, I had seen the man before; I did not know his name, nor where he lived. I had seen the man by being out in company. I fell in his company.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in company with him and and the prisoner together - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what business this stranger carried on - A. I do not know what business he carried on. I had not known him long; I had seen him two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the nature of your business that you transacted with him before - A. I never transacted any business with him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been accustomed to meet him in the street - A. Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. You had better tell the truth, it will do no good to any body. What was the business that you transacted with the prisoner - A. I never transacted any business with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you to do with him, how came you to be meeting with him, and taking a lunch at public houses - A. By being acquainted with him; by knowing him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181210280043"></xptr> Q. Where does he live - A. I know not.</p>
               <p>Q. Used he to be at your father's house. Now take what time you like to answer that - A. I have seen him at my father's house, and at public houses. I may have drank with the man at other public houses, but I cannot particularly point them out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that the Golden Key was the only public-house that you met - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the nature of the business that you did for him upon former occasions; had you carried any bundles for him upon former occasions - A. I never carried any bundle for him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that man say to you that gave you the bundle at Bethnel-green - A. He desired me to take care of it for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where to find him - A. No, only on the Sunday. I should have met him there if had not been taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to tell us, as you did not know the prisoner's place of residence, nor the business that he followed, and as you had met him frequently at this public-house, what was the purport of your meeting; what did you suppose he desired you to wait there for - A. I cannot say for what. I have spent different hours with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the stranger that you met at Bethnal-green that gave you the parcel - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you many acquaintances of these sort of gentlemen whose occupation you do not know - A. I have no more, only these two gentlemen.</p>

I called for a pint of porter, and sat in the same room. I saw her with a bundle, containing some kind of coin, as I supposed, by the jingling in her lap; she was alternatively changing it from one side of her lap to the other, which caused it to jingle.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. I am perfectly innocent of this offence.

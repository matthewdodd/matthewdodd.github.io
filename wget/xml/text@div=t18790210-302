                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Edwards and Son, 49, Great Marlborough' Street, stove manufacturers—on 28th August last the prisoner called at our place of business and asked to see some kitcheners—we had some little conversation about them, and he gave mean order for one of the value of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave the name of Savory, 19, Ledbury Road, Notting Hill—I pressed very strongly that I should send up to his house to take all the particulars with respect to the fixing; he consented, but I think with a little reluctance—it appeared to me he was not quite' willing that I should send to his house—at that time Mr. Fishbourne came in, and the order was taken at his desk—it was arranged that I should send up next morning at 9.30—having ordered the kitchener, he began a conversation with reference to our neighbours, Messrs. W. and A. Gilbey—he said "I have an interest in their business and draw 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year from it, and I have two sons there"—we had some further conversation with regard to the nature of Messrs. Gilbey's business; he seemed to be well acquainted with the firm, and spoke of the wonderful way in which the firm had risen; that all their business seemed to come to them, that they had not much trouble to look after it—he was dressed as a gentleman, most respectably, not as he is now—I let him have the kitchener entirely in consequence of what he said about Messrs. Gilbey, and his interest in the firm, and that he was drawing 900/. a. year—I made no inquiries in con<lb></lb>sequence of what he said—I have had dealings with three or four members of Messrs. Gilbey's firm, and have supplied them with stoves and various things—I sent Mr. Fishbourne to take particulars for fixing the stove, he brought back a report to me—the stove was delivered about a week or two later—I have never been paid for it—several applications were made for</p>

               <p>payment after the bill was sent in—it was a cash transaction as a matter of course—I first knew on 30th December that the prisoner's representations about Messrs. Gilbey were not true, and next day a warrant was obtained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. You were in our shop about a quarter of an hour—I don't know what brought up the conversation about Messrs. Gilbey; you spoke of it—I did not say that I should not be able to put in the stove for a fortnight or so, as I had to put one in at Mr. Blyth's house, a partner in Gilbey's—we have done something for Mr. Blyth—I should not have made the slightest allusion to Messrs. Gilbey's but for you—when you mentioned their name I mentioned Mr. Blyth's, for whom we were trans<lb></lb>acting some business—I don't remember your saying that Messrs. Gilbey were very good to their relations, and allowed several of their sisters to draw 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I came to the conclusion that you had a large amount of capital in the business, although you did not say so—I sent in my bill to you some time in October.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Edwards—I was at the office on 28th August; when I came in the prisoner was there in conversation with Mr. Edwards; I went to the desk; I heard the prisoner say that he knew our neighbours the Gilbeys very well; that he had an interest in the business; that he had fortunately invested money in the business some time ago, and he was receiving from them a sum of money yearly, but I did not catch the amount—next day I was sent to Ledbury Road to take the measurements for the stove—it was a very poor sort of house, a kind of house that I should not think a kitchener of that sort ought to have been fixed in.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. James Benson, jeweller, 25, Old Bond Street—on 23rd December last the prisoner called there and saw me—he asked whether we sold small quantities of electro-plate—I told him we did—he said "I want some to complete my service; he then ordered the plate as in this list: 12 table-forks, 12 dessert-forks, 12 dessert-spoons, 6 table-spoons, 6 egg-spoons, 6 tea-spoons, 1 gravy-spoon, 1 salt-spoon, 1 mus<lb></lb>tard-spoon, 1 sugar-spoon, a pair of sugar-tongs, 1 butter-knife, and 1 mustard-pot, the whole being of the value of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said, "If you will send them up to-morrow I will give your man a cheque; my name is J.

Savory, 19, Ledbury Road—I have the goods here—they are, as nearly as possible, in the same state as when they were pawned—I wrapped them up in this brown paper; they were in the tissue paper when pawned—I think they had not been used; they looked new to me.</p>

On 31st December I apprehended the prisoner on a warrant at his house, 19, Ledbury Road, Bayswater—I had some difficulty in getting into the house—we waited out there from 9 p.m. till 2 next morning, and had to get up a ladder 12 houses off and walk along the balconies—I got a policeman to knock at the door and tell them there was a man in the area, and when Mrs. Savory came to the window to see what it was, a policeman who was on the balcony got through the window before she could close it again—when we got into the house the prisoner was there dressed—I told him the charge—he said nothing—we had posted con<lb></lb>stables round, so that he could not get out—we searched the house, and found the bill relating to the stove, some pawn tickets, and letters of application for payment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I never anticipated cheating Mr. Edwards the least in the world. As to the other things, it was to make up a set of things that I had at home, but being very ill and pressed I pledged them. I was not at home when the things were taken in. When I went to Mr. Edwards I had 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket, and if he had applied for the money he would have got it, or a portion of it, at any rate; but Mrs. Savory's father fell ill, and died on 16th December, and I paid every shilling I could out of my pocket to meet the expenses.</p>

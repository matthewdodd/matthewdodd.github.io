The prisoner is my brother—in the beginning of this year Mr. Bratt, in whose service I had been many years, opened a shop for me in boots and shoes—my brother had been a boot and shoe maker, and in consequence of that I took him into my service to manage the business—he was in great distress, and out of employ, and told me he was starving—except in managing the business he did not in any way add to the sales—owing to his conduct the business did not prosper, and I was compelled to give it up—on 24th April I went to the house several times, in order to in<lb></lb>duce the prisoner to quit possession, but could not get in; and he threatened me with the knife and hammer, and to break my head—I then went with a possession-man from the County Court—I sent him to knock at the door, because I knew if my brother saw me he would not let me in—he got in, and I followed him—directly we got in my brother took up a boot tree, and threatened to break the man's head with it—the man was turned out, and I was left—my brother then took a ball of wax that was lying in a tub of dirty water, and said, "Look here, you b—y w—e, I will make you eat that for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I sat down in a chair, and said I should stop till I got some one to assist me, and then he swore again at me, came behind me, and took hold of me round the arms and shoulders to thrust me out—his wife was present hallooing out very bad language, and encouraging him to turn me out—he then took hold of me very violently, and threw me on the floor on to a lot of shoemakers' lasts, where I fell, and was very much bruised—I got up and sat down again, and he took my shawl off me, and threw it out into the road, and at last he took hold of me again and thrust me out into the street, he kicked my bonnet, and he bruised my arms very much.</p>

On 24th April, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I was in New Cross-road, a female, who I believe was the prisoner's wife, came to me, and I went with her to this house—I found them talking together very loudly, and the prosecutrix requested I would put the prisoner out of the house, and the prisoner requested I would put the prosecutrix out—finding it was a dispute as to right of tenancy, I would not have anything to do with it, and went out, and fearing there might be a breach of the peace in the open street, I remained a short way off, after waiting a little time I saw the prisoner put his sister out of the house, and I told her she had better consult her solicitor, and get possession by other means—she was then evidently the worse for liquor, and I told her so at the time—the prisoner had his arms round her waist when he put her out—there was a summons taken out by the prosecutrix, and I attended, and gave the same evidence that I have to day—there were one or two adjournments, and it was ultimately discharged or dismissed—I was not present myself, but there was no committal.</p>

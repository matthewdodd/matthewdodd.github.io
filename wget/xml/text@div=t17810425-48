               <p>I lost the things charged as my property in the indictment, on the 30th of March. I went out about nine o'clock in the morning on the 30th of March, and left them, some in my box, and others on my bed. When I went out, I locked my room, and left no person in it. The prisoners lodged in the next room to me. Between five and six in the afternoon, I was fetched home by Mrs. Harvey. I found my door unlocked, and my box was broken open. I had the key of the door in my pocket. Every thing I had was stolen, except what I had on my back. They were the same night at the White Swan, in Whitecross-street. Virtue Wicks had my bonnet, cap, and shift on; and

               <p>Wicks. She has a right to be sure, because she stole it. All the spite Jaques has against us is because we would not let him have a watch that was stole some time ago. Please, my Lord, to ask her where she bought the lace and mode. - I bought it at my basket, on a Saturday, of a gentleman's servant who buys oranges of me.</p>

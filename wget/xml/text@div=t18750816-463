                  </hi>. I live at 20, Holloway Grove, Deptford, and am a. grocer—on Saturday evening, 3rd July, about 5 or 6 o'clock, the prisoner and two other men came into my shop—they bought some biscuits and some other trifling things—they then went outside and stood against the side door; mine is a corner shop—I went out at the private door to take the blind in, leaving it open—it opens into a passage opposite the back parlour where I had a watch and chain—the other two men came into the shop again, and were looking at some goods drawing the girl's attention—I had called her in to serve them while I was taking in the blind—I then stood and watched them and caught sight of the prisoners going out at the parlour door; I immediately called out "Harriett, see if my watch is there"—she said "It is gone"—I threw down the blind and ran after the prisoner and collared him, and said "You scamp, you have stolen my watch"—a policeman came up to the corner, and directly the prisoner saw him he said "Here is your watch," and put it into my hand and made off—he ran into a turning where there was no thoroughfare and was caught—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

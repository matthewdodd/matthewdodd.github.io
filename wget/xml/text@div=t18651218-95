                  </hi>. I am one of the senior clerks in the General Post-office—the prisoner was employed as clerk at Mr. Hollis's receiving house in Mount-street—in consequence of receiving some information respecting him, on 13th December, about twenty minutes past one o'clock, I enclosed 120 postage-stamps in a letter, addressed, "Miss Eliza Collins, 5, Roupell-street, Lambeth"—I secured the envelope with an adhesive gum seal and handed it to Mr. Clare to post at the Mount-street receiving house—that letter if posted before two, according to my instructions, should have reached the Western District office, in Vere-street, at twenty minutes past two—I then went to the Vere-street office, and was there when the collection was brought in—I examined the letters, but did not find this one—I waited at the Vere-street office until the three o'clock collection arrived—Mr. Clare was with me—I examined that collection also and it was not there—I afterwards went to Mount-street with Mr. Clare, and Rumbold and Bingham, the officers—I there saw the prisoner—I showed him the letter bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), that is the two o'clock dispatch from Mount-street, and asked him if he had made up the two o'clock collection—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Did you have any one to assist you in clearing the letter-box?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Then you made up the collection entirely yourself?"—he said, "Yes"—I told him that a letter containing postage stamps addressed to Miss Eliza Collins, Roupell-street, Lambeth, was missing, and asked him if he knew anything about it; he said he did not—I then asked him where he kept his postage stamps—he partly drew a drawer from out of the desk in the office—I took possession of that drawer, and requested the prisoner to accompany Rumbold, which he did, to a private room, belonging to the letter receiver—I then said to the prisoner, placing my hand on the drawer, "Where did you get all these postage stamps from?—he said, "I received them of Mr. Hollis this morning"—I said, "All of them? now be particular"—he said, "Yes, I received them from Mr. Hollis, except half-a-crown's worth, which I pur<lb></lb>chased of a person who presented them at the window"—I said, "About what time?"—he said, "About half-past twelve or a quarter to one, as near</p>

               <p>as I can guess"—in the drawer were thirty-two pieces of penny postage stamps of the value of one shilling each, and some smaller pieces of sixpence each—I examined those thirty-two pieces, and selected from them seven pieces, value one shilling each, as those I had enclosed in the letter in ques<lb></lb>tion—there were 120 in all—in another portion of the drawer I found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of loose stamps—I told the prisoner that all those stamps had come out of the letter addressed to Miss Collins, and asked how he ac<lb></lb>counted for the possession of them—he said, "Well, sir, I cannot account for them"—I then requested him to accompany Rumbold and Bingham to his lodging, and went myself to the district office in Vere-street—they returned with the prisoner in about half an hour, and Bingham produced ten penny postage stamps—I said to the prisoner, "These postage stamps have been found at your lodging by the police-officer, where did you get them from?"—the prisoner replied, "I bought six of them from the till at dinner time, and left sixpence for them"—I said, "What time was that?"—he said, "About ten minutes to two o'clock"—(this must have been about five o'clock)—I then examined them, and identified six of them as those enclosed in the letter; those made up the number—I told him they had come out of the letter, and asked where he got them from—he said, "I can only account for them by buying them before I left"—he was then given into custody.</p>

I have been in the habit of corresponding with a gentleman at Liverpool, in whose service I was for three years, and I used a great many postage stamps; I took the stamps, but, of course, I paid for them. On my return that afternoon I commenced my duties again, and in case any postage stamps are presented at the window it is my duty to buy them; whether it is my duty or not I have done it, and have paid the money out of the till; that is the only way in which I can account for these coming into my possession; if I had taken the stamps out of the drawer and appropriated them there must have been so much money over. I can account for every penny that I had in my pos<lb></lb>session; I had received 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on account of the gentleman at Liverpool, out of which I had expended 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. leaving 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; only 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of it was my own money, it was what I had to account for to the honorary secretary of a society, held at 22, Berners-street.</p>

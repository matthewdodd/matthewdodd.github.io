                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Moulin; we keep a shop at Stratford. On 3rd June I saw the prisoner going out of the shop about 12 o'clock in the day—I was at that time in the parlour behind the shop—I went in the shop and went out after the prisoner; I followed her, and she hid herself in the doorway of the police station next door—I went up to her and asked what she wanted in my shop—she said she wanted to go in the back yard—I went back to my shop, and directly I went back I missed my tea-kettle—I went after her again, and she was then sitting on the step of the station—I said "You have stolen my kettle;" she said "No, I have not"—I raised up her shawl and took this kettle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from under it; it is mine—I know it by the mark inside the lid—I had seen it safe about five minutes before—it had been on the floor about two yards inside the shop.</p>

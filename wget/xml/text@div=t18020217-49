Yes: On Tuesday last, the 16th of this month, I went into the warehouse about a quarter past eight o'clock in the morning; I went backwards into the dwelling-house, and then I came back into the yard again, and saw the prisoner in the yard with a porter standing by him, the porter's name is John Eyles; the truss of woollen cloth was lying down between them with a direction on the outside; I asked what was the matter; William Brown, my servant, said, in the hearing of the prisoner, that the prisoner had stole that truss; he did not say any thing to that; I had the prisoner detained, and have kept the truss ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do? - A. I endeavoured to find out the man; I heard of him at several public-houses where he had been, but could not get the sight of him till last Sunday, when my son and I walking through Bow-lane, between Bromley and Bow, met him; I said, is that John Green; he re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250056"></xptr>plied, and said his name was John Green; I said, you are the very man I am looking for; I asked him then if he knew the youth standing there, which was my son; he told me he did not; I asked him what he did with his chest and bedding that he took out of the ship Walthamstow, at Blackwall; he told me he had bought a bit of a chest of a soldier on board that ship, and gave half a guinea for it; and what of that, says he; my son said directly, father, those are my clothes he has got on, he has got on my trowsers, my waistcoat, and my handkerchief; he asked him then whether he would swear to that; he told him he would; I took hold of him immediately, and said he should go with me; he up with his fist, and knocked me down upon the road immediately; I had a stick in my hand, and to prevent his running, I knocked him over the shins, and he kept knocking me about, and I kept knocking his shins till I brought him from Bow-lane to Poplar watch-house, then I furrendered him to an officer; I could not get one before; the officer took those three articles from him; on Monday, I went with the officer to the prisoner's house, and saw the things found there; he lives opposite the White Horse, Bow, he rents three rooms on a floor there.</p>

               <p>Q.She is the wife of the other prisoner? - A. She said she was, and afterwards she said she was not; she said before the Magistrate that she was not married, that her name was Morro; she came with the man to the Office, she was not brought in custody; I took the woman, and went to Mr. Farmer's, a pawnbroker, at Bow, and found two shirts and one handkerchief, in three different pledges; I went afterwards to the Coach and Horses, where the woman told me the chest was, and likewise the man told me before I went away; there I found the chest; she said, the other bits of rags were in it; I asked the woman of the house if she knew John Green; she said, yes, very well; I asked if he left a chest there; she said, yes; I searched the chest, but found nothing in it; I then went with her to her lodging, about ten or twelve doors from the Coach and Horses.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the man and woman lodge together? - A. Yes, I was told they did; the woman went with me; I searched two rooms, and found nothing; I then asked if they had any other room, and a person told me they had the whole floor; there was a room, with a padlock on the door; I desired her to open it, or I would; she pulled a key out of her pocket, and opened it; I found this quilt on the bed; I searched a chest, and found various articles the lad said were his; in that chest I found a pocket-book, with three duplicates in it; one for a pair of boots, another for a pair of breeches, pawned at Mrs. Harvey's, Mile End, another for two jackets and a waistcoat, seven shillings, at Mr. Dexter's, Whitechapel; I told the pawnbrokers to attend at the Office; they attended, and brought the property.</p>

             sworn. - I keep the Coach and Horses, at Bow: On Friday week, in the morning, the chest was brought into the passage; on enquiry, I found it belonged to John Green, the prisoner, he owned it himself in my hearing.(The things were all produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>John Green's defence. The one half of the things there are my property that he has robbed me of; the quilt is my property, he took it off my bed; I went down to the Walthamstow to work the ship from Gravesend, the men were all pressed; we worked there for nine days; there was a woman there, and the chest was upon the table she had her grog on; she said her husband was pressed, and I said I would buy the chest of her; I bought the handkerchief and white jacket of a soldier there; I paid fifteen shillings for the chest and the old rags in it, there was nothing but old rags in it; they put my property in the chest when they found it, and this woman was taken into custody for nothing at all; she asked me, when I came home, how it was I was so short of money; I said, I had bought the chest, and if she wanted money, she might pawn some of me things, and she went to pawn them; he wants to hang me before my face; when Brown took the things off my back, the young fellow said they were not his property.</p>
               <p>Ann Green's defence. I have nothing to say; I pawned the things by his direction, because I wanted money.</p>
               <p>Smith. The quilt is an East-India article; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250057"></xptr>bought it in the East-Indies, and brought it home with me.</p>

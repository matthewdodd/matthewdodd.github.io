               <p>Mellior. No, he had not. I said I had nothing to give him. He walked along with me, and said, d - n it, I must have something, snatch'd my hat off, and ran away with it. I took him three days after, being Shrove Tuesday, at the Cheshire-Cheese alehouse, near Mount Pleasant, in Little Gray's-Inn-Lane, with my hat-band in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the hat-band?</p>
               <p>Mellior. The constable has that, but he is not here. I am a Frenchman, and do not know how to proceed in these affairs.</p>

            . On Shrove Tuesday, about seven o'clock at night, the prosecutor's wife came, and told me she believed the man that had rob'd her husband was at the Cheshire Cheese; I went there with the prosecutor, who asked him if he remember'd seeing him on the Sunday night. He answered no. The prosecutor said, you are the person that rob'd me, but he denied it. The prisoner took out some tobacco, which was in a hat-band.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175802220009"></xptr> The prosecutor took it, and said that was his property, and on his hat when he was rob'd of it. Then we sent for a constable, took him into custody, and the hat-band was delivered to the constable, but he is not here.</p>

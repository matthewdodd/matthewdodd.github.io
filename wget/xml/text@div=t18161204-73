               <p>JOHN HALTON. I am servant to the prosecutors; I had the saw not five minutes before it was taken; I went out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040035"></xptr>to look for the prisoner, but could not find him. I saw him in the warehouse; I knew him; he had worked in the warehouse some time before; I know the saw to be my masters.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Had you seen the saw before the prisoner worked for your master - A. Yes; I bought it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the saw taken before the partnership commenced - A. No; the bills were made out in their names on the 21st.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COX. I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner, on the 26th of November, at Hoxton; I asked him what he had done with Mr. Clarke's saw; he said he had pawned it, and gave me the duplicate; it was pledged in the name of Richards, at Flemming's, in Newgate-street. He said Richards had pledged it for him.</p>

             was with me, and nobody else, till I came to Chelsea, then we alarmed Mr. Graves a waterman, and he came to our assistance, but in the mean time there were two or three more, and I desired them to man a galley, for that the galley which contained these five men, that I took particular notice, came from Hammersmith, I called up our butcher, Mr. Hammond of Hammersmith, to get a horse, and when we came opposite to Chelsea waterside, we saw the same boat and persons, I immediately manned a boat, and sent four men after them; I took such particular marks of the boat and of the men, as near as I could by the time in the morning.</p>
               <p>Should you know the men again? - No, I know so far as to their stature , but I never swore to the men. I have a suspicion that these are the men, I can swear to the marks and colour of the boat and the clothes of the men, but not to the men's persons; the colour of the boat was the inside painted green, almost new apparently to me, and the sculls painted lead colour.</p>

             the man that got away, said, there is a man on horseback, and from thence we rowed down opposite to the willows, and the other man stood up and said, by God there is a galley coming after us, I do not know what they want, and he desired me to put him on shore at Nine Elms ; and he stood up, whether he chucked anything overboard I could not tell, by the flushing of the oars, but the basket was in the boat empty afterwards; as soon as ever I landed my boat's head on the ground, the people in the galley hallooed out stop thief; and they went to Sir Sampson's, and I followed them.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any search made for these things? - Yes, I understood they did, they were thrown out below watermark; my boat was painted green, and black oars, and the lower part of my boat was red, below water-mark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Williams. Whether he saw any of us bring anything into the boat? - No, none of you three, but the tall man that run away.</p>
               <p>That man was in the boat before we took you? - No, you all came down together.</p>
               <p>Court to Pearson. What is the value of this repeating clock? - It was 10 l. I believe, they valued it at 6 l.</p>
               <p>Do you believe it is worth 6 l. - Yes, it was a spring repeating table clock.</p>
               <p>Allen. It was a good clock, and went well.</p>

               <p>Court to Pearson. Were the doors all fast at night? - Yes, I went last to bed, and was first up in the morning, and I found them broke open.</p>

               <p>There is nobody here speaks positively to the value of the clock? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER MOORE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>We are really innocent, we hired this waterman to go up the river, we went on shore at Chelsea, and got some liquor, and some bread and cheese, we then rowed up to Chiswick to my cousin, we were all very much in liquor, we went on shore there and could not find my cousin out; we went to the public-house, and we stopped, then we all returned to the boat, and bid the waterman carry us home, going on shore at the Elms , to get something to drink, we heard the cry of stop thief, the man that was with us, whether he was in liquor I do not know, but he ran away, we stopped, so they took us; the man was a stranger to us that got away.</p>

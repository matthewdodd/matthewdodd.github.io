I said, "yes," he said he had a letter for him, and asked if he was up, I told him he was; he appeared to be going from the door; I asked him if he would wait for an answer, he said, "yes;" he came inside the passage - I shut the street - door and took the letter into the parlour, to my master, shutting the parlour-door after me, leaving the prisoner in the passage; my master opened the note, and said he knew nothing of it, and desired me to tell the man so; I went out, and found the prisoner gone and the coat also-the door was ajar. I am positive the prisoner is the man - I saw him three days after.</p>

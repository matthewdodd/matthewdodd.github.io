               <p>The prisoner brought a bit of lead to me on the 21st of August, about eight or nine in the morning; he asked me to buy it; he said he had one hundred and a quarter more; and said, he had had it by him six months; there was eleven pound of it; I gave him thirteen-pence halfpenny for it; here is the lead.</p>
               <p>- SACKVILLE sworn.</p>
               <p>I only produce the lead; I did try to compare it, but could not find it would fit any part of the gutter; it is milled lead, the same as the other.</p>
               <p>Court to Buck. Did you see the prisoner upon the premises? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Thurston. I saw the prisoner upon the premises, with his head and shoulders out of the window, upon the gutter; says I, you villain, this is the hundred and a quarter of lead I was to have had; but I went to Mr. Buck and shewed him the man, I supposed had stole the lead; upon searching the house we found this lead beat up together; it had been cut with a saw.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

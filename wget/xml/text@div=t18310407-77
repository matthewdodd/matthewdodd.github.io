               <p>Q.After the prisoner was in custody did he send for you? A. Yes, and in consequence of an answer I sent, he came to me in the office, before the Magistrate came; he asked me to forgive him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you promised to forgive him? A. No; I had had no conversation with him - I cannot swear to the flour or the bag - I believe it is mine.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Repeat, as nearly as you can, the words he used? A. He came into the office, and said,"Master, I hope you will forgive me;" I said, "Richard, how can you expect that after the hundreds of pounds you have robbed me of?" he then turned about, and made no answer.</p>

            . I am a horse-patrol of Bow-street. I was stationed at Enfield, and in consequence of information, about ten o'clock in the morning of the 8th of March, I watched the prisoner when he left his master's premises; he had a cart with him - when he had got a short distance I took him into custody, and searched the cart; I found the bag of flour at the bottom of it, under some straw, where it appeared to be concealed - the prisoner did not say a word; I showed the bag to Mr. Jelly - I found a small piece of paper in it, with Mr. Jelly's name on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was going along the street? A. Yes, and seemed surprised when I found it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. JELLY. Q.Had any body access to this loft? A.Nobody had any busines there but the prisoner - it was over the stable; the door was not kept locked - I have trusted the prisoner to collect King's taxes, and was well satisfied with him.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Had you a servant named Rogers? A. Yes; he did not make any communication to me; my wife did the evening before, and in consequence of that the search was made. <rs id="t18310407-77-verdict440" type="verdictDescription">

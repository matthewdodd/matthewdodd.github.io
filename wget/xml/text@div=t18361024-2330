                  </hi>. I live with Mrs. Stacey, in Lower Sloane-street, Chelsea. The prisoner was in her service—on the 22nd of Sep<lb></lb>tember, at about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I went to break<lb></lb>fast, and as I returned, I heard the cry of "Stop thief," in Chelsea-market—I went up, and found it was the prisoner, taken by a man—I followed to the shop, and then asked the prisoner what he had been doing—he said, "Nothing"—I pulled his coat on one side, and there dropped out a pair of boots, which belonged to Mrs. Stacey.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner was in my employ about two years. I saw him take a pair of boots of the horse, and run out of the shop—I was in the parlour, and he was in the shop—I laid a trap for him, because I had missed them several times—he was not aware that I was watching him—I ran out and called after him, "Stop thief"—some of the neighbours stopped him—I fell down, and hurt myself very much—these are my boots—he had access to the shop—he was a journey-man.</p>

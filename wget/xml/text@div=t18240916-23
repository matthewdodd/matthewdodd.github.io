On the 2d of September, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening this shawl hung in the shop, near the door - I saw it safe just before it was taken; I did not see who took it, but on missing it I came to the door, and saw the prisoner (whom I had not seen before,) within two houses of the shop; he was running, alone - I came up to him: I did not see him drop the shawl, but I brought him back to the shop, and he was charged with having taken it; he said he had not got it. A witness gave it to me as I was bringing him back.</p>

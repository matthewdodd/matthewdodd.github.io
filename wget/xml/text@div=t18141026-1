            . I am the keeper of New Prison, Clerkenwell. I knew the prisoner very well; I was present when she was convicted in June sessions, 1813, of being a common utterer of counterfeit money; she was ordered to be imprisoned in New Prison Clerkenwell, one year, and to find sureties. She suffered her punishment. I have no doubt of person at all.</p>
               <p>AMELIA BAILEY. I am the wife of a grocer, in Gray's-inn-lane. On the 7th of October, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop, she asked for a quarter of an ounce of tea and half a quartern of sugar; it came to three-pence; she gave me a shilling; I looked at the shilling, and perceived it to be a bad one. I gave it her again, and told her to go away.</p>

            . I keep the Poacock public-house, in Gray's-inn-lane. On the 7th of October, between six and seven o'clock, the prisoner came into my house, she asked for a glass of gin; she gave me a shilling; I looked at it, and said, it was a bad one, and put it down by the side of her. My wife took it up. I am quite sure it is the same. My wife then said, that woman brought bad shillings one day last week. I then said, she is a smasher, she shall not smash no more here. She then attempted to run away; I catched her by the arm. She threw a shilling from her hand directly on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen what she did with the shilling that she took off the counter - A. She was never out of my sight. I saw her take up the shilling off the counter; I saw the shilling that she offered me in payment; I saw her hold it in her hand up to the time of her throwing it away. I saw the shilling that she dropped; that was the shilling she had offered to me. Mr. Loveday picked it up, and gave it me; I knew the shilling perfectly well; it had two marks, like C upon it. She had no other shilling then that, that I know off. I sent for Dickens, the officer. Dickens searched her before me. I delivered the shilling to the officer, after I had put a mark upon it. I told Dickens to search her mouth; he searched her mouth. She appeared to all that were present, to be trying to swallow something. She would not let him look into her mouth; she made a desparate resistance when he endeavoured to look into her mouth.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I was sent for on this occasion. I took the prisoner into custody. When I went into the bar, Mr. Kilsbey said, do you know this woman; I told him I did; I had taken her once before, and she had then a twelvemonth confinement. I searched her, and found on her one bad shilling in her pocket. This is the shilling I found in her pocket, and this is the shilling the landlord gave me; I have kept them separate.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the shilling that was picked up, and that she offered to me. I put a W. upon it; I was going to put W K upon it, I thought W would be sufficient.</p>
               <p>Dickens. She fought a great deal to prevent me from taking her. I put my finger in her mouth; she had something in her mouth, that she swallowed; I tried to make her bring it up; she would not. I know the prisoner well; she knew me as soon as she saw me. I also found three shillings and five pennyworth of halfpence all by themselves in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bailey. The tea and sugar came to three-pence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kilsbey. The gin came to two-pence. The Peacock public-house is about one hundred and fifty yard apart.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Three Compass-court, Glass-house-street, Rosemary-lane. The prisoner has been lodging in my house ten months—I have known her two years off and on—four months ago I told her to go out and get 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on my bed—she got 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and bought a petticoat out of it, and said she would pay me on Saturday, but she never did—she brought me back this ticket for it—I went to Mr. Fleming's shop with it to pay off part of the money, and from something I learned there I spoke to the prisoner about it—she told me to ask Margaret about the bed—she is a young woman who was stopping in my house—I told her I should look to her for the bed, as it was she I sent to pledge it—I spoke to her twice about it—she said, if she had a little time she would get me the bed as soon as she got some money from the country—that it was not sold, but a lady had lent her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. upon it—I gave her in charge.</p>

About the 29th of March, the prisoner came to our shop and said she had lost the ticket of a bed which she had pledged for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and asked me to give her a declaration for it—I ordered one to be given to her, with the counterpart of the ticket attached to it—I showed the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>

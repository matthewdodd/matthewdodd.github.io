On the morning of the 4th of April I met him on the stairs leading to my own room; I had received information, and took his jacket off - I shook his clothes, and a sovereign fell out; I had asked him if he had any money belonging to me - he said No, nor to any one else; I had sent my coat down by him that morning to be brushed, and my bunch of keys was in the pocket - one of the keys would open the desk in my counting-house; I found my desk unlocked - it had been locked the night before, and I had left four sovereigns in it and three half-sovereigns; the lock of the desk was always difficult to lock - a stranger could not well lock it, but I could; I could not lock it after that morning.</p>

I saw the prisoner about seven o'clock that morning brushing my master's coat; the keys were on the board where the coat was - I went down stairs, and when I came up again the prisoner and the keys were gone, but the coat was still there; I went into the counting-house, and saw the prisoner near the desk - I asked what he wanted there;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110039"></xptr>he said he had lost his pen - I asked him where the keys were; he said they were in the coat - I went to the coat, and they were not there; I told my master.</p>

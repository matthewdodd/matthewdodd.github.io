            . We lost oak I believe to the value of 4 or 5 l. and several fir-planks, inch thick. It was put in a house and locked up; we had not seen it from the first of October last till the 10th of this instant, February, then we found the door had been broke open; we do not know when it was done; the place was then stripped: we found eight or ten pieces, six of oak and two of deal and one oak plank, which the prisoner had made into a little cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Row. He is a labouring man.</p>
               <p>Q. By what do you know them to be Mr. Row's wood?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176902220013"></xptr>Row. The fir was sawed into feather edge, from round fir; none such was ever done in the country, as I ever heard of. I can take upon me to swear it was the prosecutor's, and the oak the bricklayers had used in scaffolding. He had made it up without planing the wood, for there was the mortar upon them; the cart was standing before his house, and his house joins to the prosecutor's orchard. The prisoner was taken up upon Shrove Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the oak and fir?</p>
               <p>Row. We value the oak at 3 s. and the fir at 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner's cart?</p>
               <p>Row. That will come out by the other witnesses.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and worked at Mr. Row's house. Some of that timber which was locked up we used for scaffolding. I left working there about the 10th of October. I saw the cart on the prisoner's premises a day or two before he was taken up. There were six pieces of oak scaffolding, two pieces of fir, and one oak board. It was the property of James Row.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you see him making it?</p>
               <p>Groom. I saw him making it in his house, and also in his garden. I was a labourer at the prosecutor's. I know we used the oak in scaffolding.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he making it in the day time or night?</p>
               <p>Groom. In the day time: Mr. Row's people might have seen him, had they been in their orchard.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the house of Mr. Row inhabited?</p>
               <p>Groom. No, it is not; we have been there several times, but not to work.</p>

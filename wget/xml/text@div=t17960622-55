               <p>Q. Do you know this to be a parcel of any yarn that was in the vat? - A. I am certain of it; I compared it, and it is the same kind of yarn exactly; I stood behind him a considerable time before I took hold of him, and saw him draw something out of the vat several times, and tuck under his coat, thought I did not see that it was yarn.</p>
               <p>Q. This is of very trifling value, I suppose? - A. The value is not more than 2s. but the object of Mr. Bolt in prosecuting, is, that we are repeatedly harrassed.</p>

               <p>Walker. This is the yarn that I delivered to the constable; that in the vat was of the same quality.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming across the wharf, and a great many people were standing by this vat; I was intoxicated in liquor, in passing through these people some of them hit me upon the head with this yarn, and told me it would serve my wife for a mop; and I told them to take it themselves, and then I was laid hold of; it is the first time I ever had any thing laid to my charge; my master has been waiting here ever since Wednesday morning, that I worked for four years; and my serjeant, that I have been in the regiment with six years, but we did not expect the trial to come on after six o'clock.</p>

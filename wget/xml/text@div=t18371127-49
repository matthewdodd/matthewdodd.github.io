                  </hi>. I am the wife Charles Cunningham Young, and live in York-street, St. James's. The prisoner was <hi rend="italic">my</hi> nursery-maid, and then my house-maid—she lived seven months with me—I missed various arti<lb></lb>cles of wearing-apparel, and sent for a policeman—my husband and my<lb></lb>self spoke to the other servants—all their boxes were opened—the prisoner delivered several things to me, and she was sent to her uncle—I found in her box the articles stated, which I afterwards gave to the policeman, who went next day, and took her—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the articles</hi>)—these are all mine.</p>

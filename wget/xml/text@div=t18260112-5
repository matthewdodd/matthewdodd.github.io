I had marked them with a brand mark, and have no doubt of them.</p>

            . I live in City-gardens, City-road, and know Collison. On the 17th of November, about a quarter past six o'clock in the morning, I was going from my house into a shop which I have in my yard - Loadsman opened the door, and I found eighteen sheep in a stable adjoining my shop; they appeared very much fatigued; about a quarter to eight o'clock I saw a man in the yard, dressed in a brown frock coat, a leather gaiter on his left leg, and high ankle shoes; he had no gaiter on his right leg, but a handkerchief tied round the small of it. I believe Collison to be the man. Nunn was there at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Collison is a neighbour of yours, I believe? A. I did not know him before. When I saw him at Worship-street I knew his features; I saw him through the window; they told me that was the man who claimed the sheep. When I saw him at Worship-street he had part of his whiskers taken off, and wore a flannel jacket. I verily believe him to be the man - I saw his side face.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You believe him to be the man? A. Yes, but he is altered as much as he could be, in dress and figure.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Wood. On the 17th of November, at a quarter past six o'clock, I saw eighteen sheep in my master's yard, and about six o'clock in the evening I saw the prisoner Collison take them away - two other men assisted him; I followed, and saw Collison and two other men put them into a shed in Howard's-green. I went in the morning, and spoke to Loadsman about it, and shewed him where they were put. Collison had a brown frock coat, ankle shoes, a galter on the left leg, and a handkerchief on the right. Howard's-green is about one hundred yards from master's. I knew Collisou before, by seeing him in a shop in Howard's-green, next door but one to the shed. I saw a stout tall man there when I went with Loadsman - it was not either of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Nobody was with the sheep when you first saw them? A. No. Collison is a butcher, and sells meat in this shed; he uses it as a shop; he drove the sheep into that shop.</p>

            . I live in Castle-street, Clerkenwell. On the 17th of November, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went with Nunn to No. 24, City-gardens, and saw eighteen sheep there - they appeared particularly tired; I went to Howard's-green afterwards, and saw a shed with meat hanging in front of it; I saw Collison in that shed about a quarter past nine o'clock that morning; he was dressed in a dark mixture coat, corduroy breeches, ankle shoes, and a handkerchief round his right leg. I got information and watched the premises, and saw Martin there from time to time, but never saw Collison there after the 17th; I never saw the sheep there myself - I saw Martin there on Saturday, the 18th, serving two customers with meat, and on Sunday and Monday, but never saw him there after Monday. I found Collison at Worship-street on Saturday; I had been to the shop early and late but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Martin is a journeyman butcher? A. I considered him the servant there, or I should have taken him.</p>

            . I am a wheelwright, and live next door to the shed where Collison's shop is. I kept a horse and cart at this time. On Sunday Martin asked me to let him have the horse and cart at five o'clock in the morn<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120007"></xptr>ing, as he wanted to take some skins into the country to bury - I did not lend it. I used to see both the prisoners in the shed - Collison's wife was often there - the shop is about ten yards from the shed where the sheep were put- I did not see Collison after I was asked for the cart, till he came into a public-house and struck me - he then wore a fustian coat and leather gaiters - I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might not the skins he corrupted and had? A. I asked him no questions - I thought it improper to lend him the cart at so early an hour - I saw a number of sheep in the shed - whether it was when he asked me for the cart, or a few days before, I cannot say.</p>

            . I am a Smithfield drover, and live in Bunhill-row. On Monday, the 21st of November, about five o'clock. I was at Howard's-green, and met Martin - he said "Will you do a good turn for me, and take these sheep to a green-yard, or otherwise loose them?" I said"Don't you know a green-yard after being all this time in London?" he said No; he went with me to the stable - some of the sheep were outside the door and some in - he said they had come astray of him four or five days ago- he went to the end of the street with me, and I took them to the green-yard in Whitecross-street - there were eighteen, and were marked W in the side, and some in the hips.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Green-yards are places of deposit for whatever is lost? A. Yes - I went and told Mr. Slocome.</p>

               <p>JAMES COKER. I lost a trowel and hammer, on the 29th of August, from a house in <placeName id="t18280911-300-crimeloc1542">Brunswick-street, Hackney-road</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I work for Mr. Pledge - I was walking up the street and saw a mob; I ran towards them, and a man came and asked if I were the thief - I said "I don't know what you mean," and as we were going along, a carpenter said "That is not the lad who dropped the tools, but I must take him back to Mr. Coker," who knows me very well, and has a spite against me.</p>

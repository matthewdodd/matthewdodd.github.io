            . I live in Redcross-street. On Monday, the 6th of October, about half-past ten o'clock, I was going through <placeName id="t18231022-140-crimeloc755">Golden-lane</placeName>

I felt my watch safe, and as I went to pay for the liquor, one of them said she would have her glass next morning. I came out, and was in their company a quarter of an hour. M'Donell stood talking to me a little while - Smith moved a little way, and then set off, using bad language. I missed my watch, and pursued, but lost them. I told Vann of it. I was sober.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 7th of October, Campbell complained to me. I went to Golden-lane, and found the prisoners at a public-house. I asked them if they were with a man at the Goat and Cherry Tree, public-house, the night before - they denied it - I took them there, and asked the landlady, who said, they were there with a man, who drank no liquor - that they had a glass each, but one of them left her's till morning. M'Donell had a new pair of boots, which she said she bought that morning for 9 s.</p>

            . My husband keeps the Goat, at the corner of Cherry Tree-court. On the 6th of October, about eleven o'clock at night, the prisoners came in with the prosecutor, and had two glasses of gin - one left hers till morning.</p>
               <p>SMITH'S Defence. This man followed us into the public-house - we said we wanted nothing of him, but he would pay for our gin. We left him, and next morning I bought a pair of boots in Newgate-street. Vann asked if I was not in Cherry Tree-court last night; I said, No - I did not know he meant the public-house. The prosecutor offered to make it up for 5 l.</p>

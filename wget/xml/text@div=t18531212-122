                  </hi>. I am a draper. On the night of the 4th Dec. I was going along Aldgate with my sister—in consequence of what she said I ran up a court; I saw the prisoner running there—the policeman was at the top of the court; the prisoner saw him, and he returned—when he came near to me he said, "There is your handkerchief;" and he threw it down—this is my handkerchief.</p>

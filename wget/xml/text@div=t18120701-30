               <p>Q. A public-house, is it not - A. Yes: Mr. Earle's. It is a place where the passengers generally stop, to go by the Greenwich-coach. It was a quarter after nine when I went into this coffee-house. The coach that I intended to go by was gone. There was a Deptford coach at the door. The coachman said, he should go at ten o'clock. I went into the coffee-room, and he was to call me.</p>
               <p>Q. You were so drunk you do not know any thing about the matter, how it was done - A. I cannot recollect any thing.</p>
               <p>MR. EARLE. I keep the George and Gate, Gracechurch-street. About half past nine the prosecutor came in, and the prisoner followed him. They seemed both in liquor. The prosecutor was considerably in liquor. The prosecutor asked for change of a ten-pound note. Seeing him in liquor I refused, and desired him to put the note in his pocket. He said to the prisoner, will you have something to drink: and when we get to Greenwich, if you want money, you shall not want for eight or nine shillings. They went in doors. In about a quarter of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010039"></xptr> an hour the prosecutor came, and said, the person that had been with him had robbed him of his watch. The prisoner then was gone out. A person in the bar said, he thought he knew where to find him. He went up the next inn, (the Cross Keys), and my friend laid hold of the prisoner up the gateway of the Cross Keys. He brought him back. We challenged the prisoner with taking the watch from the prosecutor. He denied it. I sent for a watchman. The watchman would not take charge of him, until I sent for an officer. The officer came. He took the watch from his waistcoat pocket, and laid it on a box in the passage.</p>
               <p>- IRVIN. I am a lighterman. I saw the watch taken out of the prisoner's pocket.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. That is my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give it him, or did he take it out of your pocket - A. The watch might slip out of my hand, or I might put it on the table. That is the watch I had. I was very drunk.</p>

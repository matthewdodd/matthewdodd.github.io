            . I live in Clement's-lane; my husband is in the employ of a master-tailor. I was in a gin-shop in Pickett-street, between four and five o'clock, on the 26th of March - the prisoner came in rather intoxicated; he said he had left Mostyn asleep; I knew Mostyn - there were several other persons in the gin-shop; the prisoner said to me,"Fan, will you have a drop of gin?" I said I did not mind if I did; he went to the bar, put his hand into his pocket, and brought out three sovereigns and three shillings; he changed one of the shillings, paid for the gin, and four of us drank of it - I went with the prisoner to a club to which he belongs, at the Rose and Crown, New-walk, Whitefriars, and there he took two sovereigns out of his pocket to give me some halfpence to get something to drink.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are married? A. Yes, and I have three children; I was not at the Sol's Arms at all - I saw the sovereigns in the prisoner's hand, but I did not touch them.</p>

I am the prisoner's landlady. - On the night of the 26th of March he came home very much intoxicated between eight and nine o'clock at night; I assisted his wife to get him up stairs, and when he got up he fell off the chair; I was present when his wife searched his pockets - he had a half-crown, a crown, and two bright farthings; he had no other money about him at all - I have one of the farthings here - it is very bright: by candle light, and amongst silver, a person might mistake them for sovereigns: he gave this farthing the same night to my little girl, and sent the other to buy some tobacco - this is a great deal duller than it was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner owe you any thing? A. Yes, 5s. 6d., for three weeks' rent, and his wife paid it me that night; I have known him carry bright farthings about him often.</p>
               <p>- LANGLEY (Police-constable M 117.) On the morning of the 27th of March I went to the prisoner's house, about twenty minutes past six o'clock; I searched every part for money, but I found none but 3 1/2d. on his person; I did not search his wife - he was taken to the station, and discharged.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I suppose these two women were not examined then? A. No; I saw Rickards - she did not produce this farthing to me, nor has she since - I was at her house this morning, and she did not mention it.</p>

             re-examined. Q. When did you first learn that the prisoner was seen with two sovereigns? A.When the officer came on the 27th to take him - I opened the door; he asked if Strong was at home - I said Yes; the prosecutor then went up stairs, and came down with the prisoner: the officer asked him what he had done with the gold he had been seen with the night before - he said he had no gold but what he had paid at his club; I did not say they must have meant the bright farthings, but I said I had seen his wife search his pockets, and she found no gold - I did not mention about the farthings, except at the solicitor's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I went from home I knew it was my club night; I brought a sovereign with me from home - the prosecutor and I had been at variance for five months, and when I got to the water side he pushed me about, and said he had got his money; at length he prevailed on me to go and drink with him at the Essex Head - he then took me to the gin-shop, where

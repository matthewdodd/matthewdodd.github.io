I went to my till on 16th June, and found only one shilling in it, which was bad—that was between 11 and 12 o'clock—on Monday, the 19th, I saw the prisoner in my shop; she came for some bread and cheese—she gave me a shilling; I tried it in the detector, and it bent—I told her it was bad—she said she never passed bad money, and she knew nothing about it—she offered lace out of her basket to the amount—I told her that she had come with a bad shilling on the Friday previous—she did not say anything at the time, but she said afterwards that she had not been there on the 16th—I gave the shillings to the policeman.</p>

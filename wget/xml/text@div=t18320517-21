            ; we had all five come from Boulogne - we left Spencer, Purchase, and young Charles Reynolds in the smack; old Reynolds engaged me - he came across the day before, in a French boat, to take the spot-note to direct the company to the particular spot where we were to be; that is the meaning of a spot-note - we weighed anchor about eleven o'clock, and pulled towards shore; when the boat approached the beach she struck, and filled with water; two preventive men, who were coming in from eastward, fired; one was tall, and the other a short man - the boat was filled with water; we were all five washed out, and all stood in the water - three preventive men came from the westward; I went over the full of the beach, and over the field - there is a bank on the coast there - the company got most of the tubs.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are the company? A. The men who came down after them - I saw them about five minutes after I saw the preventive men; we offered to give up the spirits; the preventive men told us to stand, or they would shoot us - the company might consist of one hundred altogether; they came down, and there was a great deal of firing, but whether it was on both sides I cannot say - I went over into the field, and remained there till the company went away; I went away with them - they had fire-arms; I did not see above three or four with fire-arms; I do not know what a hat is - there were two with sticks; I saw a man called Facey with them; he had no arms then - I saw

            ; I went with the company up to the Bell public-house, at Iden, and each had a pot of beer and a biscuit, or a pint with biscuit and cheese - that was their allowance; there was a large company; I did not know any of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at the Bell? A. He dined with us there on the Thursday, and he was there the morning after, but whether he was with the company I cannot tell - I saw him about nine o'clock in the morning; some of the company were there then; whether he was there the night before I cannot tell - I first saw him about four in the morning; he remained there all day, and dined with them - this was the day after the affair; the rum was landed on the Wednesday night; he was there next day, and dined with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not see him at the Bell till four o'clock on Thursday morning? A. No; I have been engaged in six or eight smuggling ventures - I began about three years ago, but have been in gaol thirteen months of that time for smuggling; I have never been with a company; I was never a tub carrier.</p>
               <p>Q. The company carry bats or sticks to carry the tubs with? A. Yes; a bat is a stick - the company are quite a different party to what is called the protecting party, who carry arms; the company only carry the goods, and have no fire-arms; we were fired upon directly the boat struck on the beach - we had done nothing then; no shots were fired at us; the preventive men fired to give an alarm - they were about twenty yards from the beach; two shots were fired - we did not return them; three other preventive men came to protect the other two - the row had began then, as far as I can recollect; the armed men came down - there were no shots fired into our boat; the firing of the preventive men was to make an alarm - nobody was killed in our boat; a man was killed on the beach after they were on shore - he was one of our party; it is impossible for me to tell whether he was shot by the armed party or the preventive men; they were altogether in a crowd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170041"></xptr>when the row began - he had been out of the boat about ten minutes when he was shot; we were out of the boat when we offered to give up the spirits.</p>
               <p>Q.What do you mean by the men being altogether while they were firing, were they in a crowd, all huddled together? A. Yes, they were all bustling about; one man was wounded, and one killed; it was one boatman, and one of the company - I gave evidence before the Justice about this; the prisoner was not present - I do not know the Magistrate's name: it was at the Custom-house - I was sworn yesterday - I was not sworn at the Custom-house, but at the office; I have heard of a reward of 500l. on convictions of this kind, and have seen a reward of 1000l. where death takes place - I have been on board the Stort revenue-cruiser since this transaction - she is in the employ of the Customs; I have been there as a prisoner, by order of the captain: I did not expect to be tried - I do not know what I was kept for - I never asked; I asked for liberty, and was told as soon as an order came I should have liberty - I am a prisoner now: I think my liberty depends very much on my giving evidence here.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q. Were you taken before a Magistrate to be sworn at Martello tower? A. Yes, that was the first time.</p>

            . In February last I was chief officer commanding at Camber. On the 1st of February, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was on the full of the beach, near Rose cottage, and observed an alarm-pistol fired; I immediately said to my men, "Come on my boys," and proceeded to the spot; we went down the beach, and perceived a boat full of water, and a number of tubs laying along the beach - I saw a number of persons on my left; they appeared to rise, as if they had been laying down, and when all had risen there appeared about one hundred of them: I presented my pistol, and said, "If you advance I will fire;" a discharge of fire-arms then took place - I returned the fire, and fell; I was wounded; the discharge came from under the full of the beach - I could not see the body of men from whom it came; I had been out from nine o'clock - this was the first firing that I had seen; I laid on the beach till I was taken up - I fell from the loss of blood, and on recovering turned to my men, to know why they did not fire; I then observed a man approach me with a large stick, in a position as if he was going to strike me; I was trying to raise myself, and when I saw him about to strike, I drew my pistol from my left breast, and fired at him; I saw no more of him - I suppose what that man had was a bat, but it was the only one I saw that night; a bat is generally a hop-pole, cut to about seven feet long, what we should call a bludgeon; I fired once afterwards, and a man came and took me up - five shots were extracted from my body, and I am now quite disabled.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You saw the alarm-pistol fired, what was the object of that? A. To acquaint the force on the beach that goods were about to be landed - I only saw one pistol fired; that was eastward, I was westward of the boat; the object was to bring all our force down to the spot - our station is on the sea side of the full of the beach, if the tide allows of it; we can assemble six or eight men by firing a pistol - our watch-house is not quite in the centre of the station; it is near Rye harbour - we have a principal station and a detached one; the men can come sometimes much quicker than at others - I cannot tell how many came up, as I was shot almost directly; they came from east and west.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether the firing came from the preventive men coming to assist you, you cannot tell? A. Yes, as I lay on the beach I saw one man loading a duck-gun - that was after I was shot; whether my shot took effect I cannot tell - that man never struck me at all.</p>
               <p>EDWARD WHITE. On Wednesday the 1st of February I was in the service of the Coast guard, stationed at Camber; at twelve o'clock at night a boat came on shore - there were some persons on the beach at the time; I was three hundred or four hundred yards off, but saw them after I went to where the boat was; there might be about one hundred - some were facing east and some west, and the rest were making a line between them and the tubs; they were carrying something in the open space - I never saw tubs carried with bats; I have heard they do so - the men forming the lines had guns in their hands; I saw ten or twelve guns - I heard firing, and received a shot in both thighs, shortly after the boat came in - when they were coming our people fired an alarm, and then the smuggling party fired, and shot me in both things; I do not know the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Could you distinguish the smugglers from the preventive men? A. Yes, because they sang out to me to keep off, and as I would not they shot me directly; I could see our party; they were not then huddled with the smugglers - there had been a good many shots fired before that; some smugglers carry tubs on sticks or poles, and some on their shoulders - I was not near enough to see how they carried these.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q.Did the smugglers and the preventive party continue separate? A. I did not see our party; they were eastward, and I was west with four or five others - they were on one side the smugglers, and I on the other; I was with another young man - the wound did not make me insensible; I remained on the ground about three-quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>HENRY BEST. I am a commission-boatman on the Coast guard service. I was on the Camber station on the 1st of February; I was on the beach a little before twelve o'clock with a man named Holtman - I saw a boat coming in rather to the west of us; I went up to her - when she struck the beach four or five men, who were in her, were washed overboard or jumped out; two swam eastward and two west - I saw tubs in the boat, and drove those men towards the boat again to prevent their landing; I fired a first and second pistol in the air for our men to come up, and the men who were with me fired one pistol - this was the first firing; I saw persons assemble on the beach - after I had drawn the men back they came right over the full of the beach; the full is much higher than below - there were about fifty persons - when I first saw them they were armed; five or six of them had muskets: after our alarm pistols were fired there was firing from the full of the beach, both east and west - Captain

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When you fired the signals, was there any body that you saw about except the boatman? A. No; the other party were not in sight - I do not suppose they could see for what purpose I fired; I was one of the first who went up to the boat -I went within three yards of it; Holtman was with me -I did not hear the men offer to give up the tubs; I heard nothing of the kind - there was a heavy sea running; I suppose about fifty men were carrying tubs away on their backs; I never saw them carry them on poles - I have been about five months in the service; I saw some of them with sticks, but what for I cannot tell; I do not know that I saw the prisoner there.</p>

            . I am a labourer at Rye. Some days before the 1st of February, I was applied to to get about thirty men, which I undertook; I do not know that it was said what they were wanted for; on the 1st of February the person asked if I would go and get those men, and order them to be at Gold's-hill-bridge by seven o'clock that evening; I went and told them to go, and every man appeared according to his time - the same person met them at the bridge; I went with them from there to a barn at Smith's farm - that is not near the coast; we were ordered to stop there till a man came to take us to where we were to go; we found some more people there - the man came and took us down to where the goods were run at the Camber station, within a few rods of the spot; we were ordered to lay down at some distance before we got to the coast, in the next place to the full - the full being between us and the sea - we laid there; I should think there were sixty or seventy of us; some laid down and some walked about - the full is higher than a man's head in some places; we laid there about an hour - and about half-past eleven o'clock I heard the report of a pistol or something; we were then ordered to go forward to the full to get the goods - there was more firing before we got there, and when we got to the full, there was a great deal of firing - a great many of us retreated; there were people behind us to keep us from going away, persuading us not to retreat - I knew the prisoner very well before that - I saw him that night two or three fields from the full; I saw him at the first place we stopped at; he had a bat in his hand - I did not see him on the full; there were other people with bats - the prisoner was with the men with bats, and took part in keeping the men from running away without the goods; he did nothing else - he kept his bat before them, and persuaded them not to go away without the goods; I did not see him strike any one - the firing ceased a little then; one George Booth said, "They won't hurt you, for the firing comes from our own people;" the company were not then so much afraid, and went on to the sea side - this was the labourers - I saw more than six men with guns; a great many tubs were carried away - there were a great many on the beach, and some floating in the water; the men took them up, slung them on their backs, and carried them away; the armed men fired, and kept the preventive men off, else they would have hindered them - after we delivered the tubs, the person who engaged me gave me an order to get refreshment at the Bell, at Iden, and we got it there.</p>

No; I did not know there was to be any firing or arms; the prisoner had no fire-arms - he was one of those to prevent the men running away; I did not see him go over the full at all - if the company had known they were to be armed they would not have gone near them; I have lived in the neighbourhood fourteen years -I have only been lawfully married once; I was married against my will when I was nineteen - the woman ran away; I do not know whether she is dead or not; I have since married again - I have gone by my mother's name, which is White, as I did not wish the other woman to know where I was; I am a labourer - I have not been a smuggler further than labouring; I have done that about six times - they gave me the nick-name of Christian, and I have answered to it; I have been in the army, but was never taken as a deserter - I was in Battle prison for fourteen days, charged as a vagabond; I was charged once with poaching, and paid 5l. for it - I was not in prison for that - I have been in prison at other times for drunkenness; I have not been in prison for any thing else.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL. Q. Were the parish officers present at your marriage? A. Yes, they took me there; I had a family born before I was married.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BASHFORD. I am a labourer, and live at Brook-land, in Kent. I know Thomas Hyland, who lived at Iden; he came on the 1st of February to ask if I could get him a few people - I engaged ten; the prisoner was not one of them: I met him and another about half a mile before I got to the sea; they had long bats in their hands; I had not engaged the other men - I went to the sea-side, and saw some tubs brought away; the prisoner stood there to keep the company from going over the sheep-pen fence; I was there about a quarter of an hour; when the company left (Noakes was with them) they went towards the sea; we stopped in the full a little while - we went to the sea-side for about three-quarters of an hour; the last place I saw the prisoner at was at the full; he got in before the company, with the bat, to prevent them running back; the bat was seven or eight feet long, and thicker than my wrist - I got some tubs, and carried them a little way over the full, but not far, as I got wounded in the knee, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170043"></xptr>went into the blue sheep-house, where people get shelter in wet weather.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where have you come from? A. From the prison; I was taken on the 27th of March, charged as one of the party; Piles was another; I was taken before a Magistrate, at Bow-street, on the 28th, and carried to prison; nobody appeared against me there; I was taken to Bow-street again on the 6th of April - they asked if I knew any of the people: I was produced as a witness, I suppose -I was asked by a man in prison if I would split; he did not tell me of reward; I have heard of such a thing, but did not know whether it was right or wrong - I saw no paper about it, and do not expect any part of it; I have done this to get my liberty, and to save being tried myself - I would not have gone if I had thought there was to be any firing; the company had no notion of it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FARMER. I am a bricklayer, and live at Iden. I was at the Bell on the 1st of February, or within a day or two of that - I cannot say the day; I remember about four o'clock in the morning, after I had been at the Bell, hearing some persons going by my house - I looked through my window to see who it was, in consequence of what I heard at the Bell; I suppose thirty or forty men were going by towards the Bell - it was too dark for me to see if they had any thing; I was at the Bell again two or three evenings after this, and saw the prisoner there - the landlord told him they kept coming for their allowance, and he did not know who should have it, and who should not; that John Stonham had been - Noakes said he was to have his allowance, for he went down and got his tubs like a man; about the 22nd of March I saw the prisoner again - there was a conversation about one another being afraid of being taken, and he said he himself had the biggest right to be afraid, for he called the fire-arm men, and went down with them and brought away a pair of tubs.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the landlord here? A. I have not seen him; I know of nothing to prevent his coming - I gave information of this conversation, on Friday last, at the Custom-house, and told a gentleman of it about a month afterwards; my reason for for doing so was, that this running of goods is getting to too big a pitch, and I thought it ought to be stopped - that was my chief reason; that and the fire-arms is my only reason - I have seen a reward stuck up; I do not know how much it is, as I cannot read - there were three rewards, but I cannot tell what they were; one was 200l., I think - I remember one of 1000l.; I heard this before I went to the Custom-house - I cannot say whether it was before I told the gentleman of this; I had 3l. given me to pay my expences up here, by the officer of the Customs at Rye; I have received perhaps 10l. at different times -I cannot say what it was for; if gentlemen give me money, I receive it - I will not swear he has not given me 15l. or 20l.; I swear it was not 30l. - I received 1l. or 2l. at a time; I have agreed for nothing - I expect my passage to be paid back, and no doubt they will give me a trifle.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Is all the money you received, on account of taking up this man? A. No, not all, I had given information about some goods.</p>

We found these articles between the bed and the sacking, in the room where the prisoner slept—I think it was on the 18th of Feb.—we found tome flannel and calico, a sheet and two dusters—it was after we had been to Cook's, and after the prisoner had taken her boxes away and was gone—no one has succeeded her in the employ at present—the house<lb></lb>maid slept in the room with her—she is not here—we made this discovery half-an-hour or an hour after the prisoner had taken her boxes away—I asked Dr. Bryan, the physician of the establishment, to go into her room with me—I lifted up the bed and saw these things which I left, and locked the door—it was merely a thought of my own, I had no information—the things served no use there—they were doubled in the sheet and put under the bed—if they were our property they ought to have been with the rest of the stores, in the store-room—we keep all the linen in that room—there were two sheets on the bed which she had to use—and these things were wrapped in a sheet and put between the bed and the sacking.</p>

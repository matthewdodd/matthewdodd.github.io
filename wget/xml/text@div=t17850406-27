               <p>How soon after this was you called upon to see him? - The same day, the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Where was that? - Let me recollect.</p>
               <p>By all means! - I cannot be positive whether I saw him the same day, but I know on the Wednesday I saw him again at Bow-street, but I cannot be positive for the Sunday; I am sure I saw him on Wednesday, I will not say any thing without I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>When you first saw him on the Wednesday, did you or did you not know the man? - Then he looked like the same man again.</p>

               <p>Did you take notice enough of his person, to be able to know the man again or not? - Yes, I think I should know him again.</p>
               <p>Then you can tell us one way or the other, whether he is the man or not? - He is in another alteration of dress.</p>

               <p>Is that your master's crest? - Yes.</p>

Now this is the time for you to make your defence, you hear you are charged by the two people from Barrahs, with being one of the persons that brought the plate that morning, in company with Steward, and Steward was afterwards found in your house that same day.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was a victualler, a publican some years, I have let my house lately; this Steward about a week or a fortnight before I was apprehended, lodged at my house; about one o'clock this gentleman came to my house; this Steward was out all the night before, and part of Sunday morning, he came and went up to bed; I know nothing of the affair, nor of the Barrahs, and they cannot say with a safe conscience I am the person, but they do not care what they swear, the Court may plainly see that I never was at Barrah's in my life.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Garrow. Have you any witnesses for him? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Now had you lived as you ought to have done, you must have witnesses to your character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not think about that, I have witnesses plenty, that know I kept a public house some years, they talked of putting it off, on account of this Steward, the Court may see that I know no more of what is charged against me than a child.</p>
               <p>Court to Morant. What became of that Steward? - He was sent to Tothill-fields, and by some means or other he was let out, or got out, they say he got over a wall by a rope.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts in the house did you find the crow and the other things? - The centre bits were in a closet in the parlour, where I found the prisoner, the crow was in the kitchen in the chimney.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They were not my apartments.</p>
               <p>Where did Steward sleep? - In Harding's bed, where Harding's wife slept, the prisoner's clothes were there, and his shoes, and the prisoner's things were there, it was in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that room the same parlour where the centre bit was found? - No, in the fore parlour the centre bit was found, where the prisoner and his wife were sitting by the fire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Botten, a brass-founder of Clerkenwell. This last lot of castings are hit—I was in com<lb></lb>munication with Mr. Phillips—these are not things which we are in the habit of selling—they are east ready for finishing, but we do not sell them till they are finished—no one in the house would have authority to sell them without Mr. Botten's or my sanction—I never gave any sanction—the weight of the whole that it produced it 77 lbs.—they are worth about 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb.—this second lot weighs 20 lbs—I marked several of these in the third lot—I find some which I had marked on 21st, and found on 23rd at Mr. Phillips's—I marked them with a very small punch(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and left them in the warehouse—I have made this scratch to show where the punch-mark was—some of them have Mr. Botteen's mark in fully "I.N.C.H."—I swear they are Mr. Botten's.</p>

On 8th May I went to the prisoner's house with Mr. Botten, Underhay, and another gentleman—he was behind the counter—Underhay produced three or four castings, and asked him whether he knew anything of those castings—he said, "Certainly not"—Mr. Botten said, "Don't be in a hurry; have you sold any of those castings? have they gone through your hands?"—he said, no, he never saw any of them at all—I was in plain clothes—I said, "I am an officer; if any one has said they bought those castings of you, they are telling a falsehood?"—he said "Yes, I have been in the line myself, and would not buy such castings; I should know they were stolen"—at the station he said be bought them of a marine-store dealer named Pole, of White-hart-yard, near Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>

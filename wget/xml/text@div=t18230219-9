Last Monday evening, this gown and coat hung inside the door; they were pinned together. The prisoner came and offered an article in pawn, but would not take what I offered, and left. In half a minute I missed the gown and coat, which she must have passed to go out. I looked up the court, and saw her turning the corner - I secured her; but before I got up to her, I thought she threw something from her lap; she returned to the shop with me willingly. I left her in Mr. Whitaker's charge, while I went to look for the goods - there was nobody else in the court. I found them on the very spot where I thought I saw her drop them. She said she was going to the other end of the town; but there was no thoroughfare in the court - she at first said she was going to call on somebody in the court, but nobody knew her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Could I not have gone away with case if I liked - A. No.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to pawn an article for 6 s., he offered 4 s. I turned down the court, and finding it no thoroughfare, I returned, and met him - he asked me to walk back, which I did; he examined my parcel, and then begged my pardon. Two women in the shop said, they saw it taken, but could not say it was me; he desired me to go about my business, and I was angry at being accused. The young man brought the things in, and said he would detain me for my impudence.</p>

When we left Newgate-street, we left property there to a considerable amount; Clayton lived there to take care of it. I know the prisoner; he never dealt with us to my knowledge; he lived in Wood-street, Cheapside, and, I believe, calls himself a straw-hat maker. I detected Clayton in robbing me; and on the 27th of May, in consequence of what he told me, I went to the prisoner's house, to see if any of my goods were there. I saw his wife; I waited, and in about half an hour I saw him, and asked him if he had not been in the habit of dealing with Clayton, who was present. He said he knew Clayton. I charged him with having dealt extensively with him. He hesitated, and said, "No, not extensively; he did not know that he had." I asked who he sold the goods to that he received from Clayton? He said he did not think it necessary to tell me. I said, if he was an honest tradesman, he would make no objection; but that he was afraid of saying too much. Ellis, an officer, who was present, said he would not suffer me to leave without giving the prisoner in charge. I had charged him with having in his possession a book belonging to Clayton. He hesitated; but at last acknowledged having it, but refused to give it up. I said I must have it, or I would give him in charge. He said he had not got it with him, but would procure it for me in the morning. I said that would not do; I must have it that night; and I threatened to send for the watchman. He consented to go and fetch it; he went out, returned in an hour and a half, and gave it to me. Clayton remained with me. Our house is very well known in the trade.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. I did not tell the prisoner he owed Clayton 10l.; I said he owed him 2l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not deny it - A. Clayton said he owed him 12l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not then say to Clayton, "You fool, did I not tell you, if you would mind what you was about, I would save your neck" - A. No, never; nothing of the kind passed. I do not believe he said the book was only given to him that morning. I believe he was taken into custody next morning.</p>

            . I lived nearly two years with the prosecutor. I first lived with him in Newgate-street; I was left in care of the premises in Newgate-street. The prisoner came to see me there several times. He came to see if I had any goods for him, either black chips or Leghorn hats. He knew very well who I lived servant with. He told me he had bought goods three times at Gatfield's.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 23d of May, before you left there, did he apply to you to sell him any goods - A. He came to my lodgings, on the 23d of May, at night, to pay me a former account, and asked if I had any goods. I said, No; but I was going to my master's house next morning, which was Sunday, and would get him some more. He urged me to get a great quantity of Leghorn hats in particular, and chips. He was to buy them; he knew that I was to steal them from my master. He said he would take any quantity that I could get. I went and got six Leghorn crowns, and three flats for fronts, and four dozen chip flats. They were worth 5l. each bonnet; the chip flats were worth 4l. a dozen; he gave me 22s. a dozen for them. I took them to Bull and Mouth-street, about a quarter before eleven on Sunday morning. I got them about ten o'clock. He came to me, and asked what luck? The goods were then on the table in my room on the third floor. He looked at the Leghorns; I told him he should have five of them; he was to give 12s. 6d. each; he was to make up the other for a person that I knew. He liked the chips. I asked him 2l. a dozen; he refused to give more than 22s., and said he would pay ready money. I took it. He paid me in all 7l. 10s. 6d., and took them away. I was taken into custody on the 27th.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening before that, did any conversation pass between you and the prisoner about the robbery - A. Yes, on the evening of the 26th of May, he called upon me, and asked me if I had got any thing more? I told, him my fellow-servant had detected me putting chip-flats into my bosom. He asked if I was sure of it? I said, Yes. He asked if my fellow-servant took them on my person? I said, No. He said, as he did not take them upon my person, he could not prove it against me. I asked if I should deny it? He said deny it to the last, as there is no proof against you; but, above all things, do not mention my name; and said he would call the next morning, to know how I got on. He came at nine o'clock on Wednesday morning, and asked how I got on? I told him my fellow-servant had asked me if I saw him down below? that I denied; and that he said he had seen me put the chips into my bosom, which I denied; but he should make the warehouseman acquainted with it, and he might do as he thought proper. I told the prisoner this, when he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170037"></xptr>called on me to breakfast; the prisoner then told me to deny it to the last, and if I was committed, he would call and do what he could to assist me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any accounts in writing between you and the prisoner - A. Yes; he took them away with him that morning. When I told him of my detection, he said, the first thing I must do, was to collect all my memorandums together, and destroy them. I had no fire; I told him he had better take them away, which he did. He often called on me in Bull and Mouth-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORTON. I kept a memorandum of the date of the proceedings. I have only dealt with two more persons beside the prisoner; they thought I got the goods in a proper way, and did not know that I lived with Mr. Gatfield.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first begin trading with the prisoner - A. On the 13th of November; he asked where I was, and who I dealt with? I told him I dealt with Mr. Moon, of Greek-street, Soho, which was false. I said I got the things from Mr. Moon; he asked who I sold things to? I told him to Miss Jones, of Grub-street, Mrs. Rogers, and Mr. Redcroft. The chips were very good. There might be a rotten one in one parcel. I believe I have received 40l. of him in two months. When I was detected, he owed me 1l. 11s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell Mr. Gatfield that he owed you 10l. - A. I did; but it was a story. Before my master went to the prisoner, I told him it was only 1l. 11s.; I told him the whole proceedings.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you tell the prisoner you was servant to the prosecutor - A. On Sunday, the 20th of January; I then was at Newgate-street. I came to live at Bull and Mouth-street on the 17th of March. My cousins, as I called them, came to see me there; I told the prisoner they were my cousins, but they were not. I never told the prisoner that my aunt left me 400l. I sold him Leghorns worth 10l. for 25s. He made an agreement with me to take one with the other at 12s. 6d. a bonnet. I never quarrelled with him about the balance. I often asked him to settle; but his reply was, get more goods, and I will pay you for them altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prisoner find out you was servant to Mr. Gatfield - A. He saw me there, and asked if I was not in his employ? I said I was. He then said, "give me your hand." He shook hands with me heartily, and said, "depend on me, keep your own counsel, continue to do as you have done, and I will stand by you." I told my master this.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You have done every thing to restore your master's property - A. I have; and have a book containing an account of 50l. of money which I have in the Savings Bank; most of it is the money I have received from the prisoner, for goods stolen; and he knew that; the book was given to him with my papers.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the amount of goods you have sold him - A. 120l.; the value of the property was about 500l.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor; the prisoner was in my employ about ten days. On 30th Aug., I missed a green shooting-coat from a drawer under the counter—it had been bespoken, and not sent home—my wife told the prisoner on the Sunday that she was very uneasy at missing the coat, and asked if she knew anything about it—she said, "No"—we were going out of the room, and she turned round to my wife and told her she had taken it before I was up in the morning, and had tied it up and put it into her bed, and in the evening she gave it to her brother—I gave her into custody.</p>

               <p>Was it drawn or in a scabbard? - When<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140023"></xptr> I saw it, it was not in the scabbard; they asked me for my property, I told them they should have it; I gave him a shilling, and he asked me if that was all, I told him I thought it was enough, says he, I must have more; he then rummaged one pocket, and found nothing, then he put his hand on the outside of the other, and took out a guinea; that was the prisoner Silvester; he then took three penny worth of half-pence out of my waistcoat pocket, and left one penny, and then rummaged every pocket I had, and finding there was no more, he had nothing further to say to me; he left me, and came to the other side where my friend was that the other man was robbing, who is not taken, and they took four plates that my friend had got in a little basket, and then they went away.</p>
               <p>How long might they stay with you altogether? - I suppose it might be five minutes, I discerned the men before they came to the chaise.</p>
               <p>Had you leisure to observe the men sufficiently to know who they were? - Quite so.</p>
               <p>Do you know which they were? - Yes, I am convinced these men are the men, I picked these men out of fourteen prisoners.</p>
               <p>Were they dressed as they are now? - Barnes was in a brown coat, and the other was in a drab coat; the one that is not taken put a handkerchief into his mouth, and I am not clear whether Silvester did or not, but I think not.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect which of them was in the chaise with you? - Silvester was in the chaise.</p>
               <p>When were they taken up? - The next day, I believe one of them was taken up in Wardour-street, in London, they went across the fields towards Hampstead as we understood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel. Did you ever see either of their persons at all? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You was considerably surprized? - No, Sir, I was not, I never met any thing with so much resolution; I paid my attention to the prisoner, I saw his face as clear as I see yours.</p>

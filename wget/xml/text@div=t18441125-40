                  </hi> I live in Marylebone-lane, and am a hairdresser. I dealt with Mr. Dell for blacking—I had given the prisoner an order for some which I received on the 6th of July—on the 2nd of Nov. the pri<lb></lb>soner called, and asked for any further orders for Mr. Dell—I told him I had no further orders; I supposed my little account was due, but it was not convenient to pay—he said, "Cannot you let me have part of it?"—I said, "Here is half-a-crown," which I gave him, supposing him still in Mr. Dell's service—he said Mr. Dell had a bill to make up, and the money would be of service to him—he said, "Let me have another 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," which I gave him—he said he would receipt the bill in full, which was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6d—he gave me a receipt, which I produce—it is his handwriting.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> A person named Muggeridge travelled for the pro<lb></lb>secutor; we left at the same time; I went to another service, and left there, and Muggeridge told me he had gone back to Mr. Dell, he asked me to collect the money from the old customers, and give him the money, which I did, for Mr. Dell.</p>

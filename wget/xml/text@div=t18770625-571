I live with my father at 5, Cricket Field Road, Clapton—on 12th June, about 2 a.m., I was awoke by hearing some one walk up and down stairs—I listened and heard the handle of the dining-room door turn—I screamed and clapped my hands—my parents and my brother came—and I went down with them and searched the house—the back door into the garden was unbolted and the wire taken off the little window, which was open, and it was large enough for a person to get through—from the dining-room we missed three coats, an umbrella, a violin and case, a tablecloth, and two handkerchiefs—these are some of the goods (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

I live with my father at 5, Cricket Field Road, Clapton—my father locked up the house and I went to bed a few minutes before he did—my sister called out about 2 a.m., and I went down and found the back door and the window open and the wirework of the window pulled away—I missed three coats, a hat, a violin and case, and other things—I called a constable and we searched the garden—I found the umbrella and two coats on a wall two or three doors away—the hat was afterwards found on the Downs, cut up, and a knife by it—I identified a coat and two hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs at the station, they were in the dining-room when I went to bed; the "handkerchiefs were in the coat pocket.</p>

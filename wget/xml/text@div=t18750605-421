                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Mabey &amp; Son, contractors and caterers, for the City Liberal Club and carry on business at Gresham House the prisoner was in our service as steward there—we contract with the club for the supply of the provisions, and provide the steward—about the 8th or 9th of April last, I received a letter from the prisoner which 1 have mislaid or lost—I have looked for it everywhere and cannot find it—it enclosed a doctor's certificate of illness to excuse his absence—he had the entire management of the club; his salary was 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, payable monthly—the goods for the service of the club were obtained through a printed form signed by the prisoner, a counterfoil of which was kept, they 'would be delivered to the kitchen clerk at the club whose duty was to check them and enter them in a book—the prisoner had no authority to order goods on his own account—he came Into the service, about November last year—I think he was engaged a little before that, but his duties to the club commenced about November—on 20th December, he applied to me for cash, gold and silver, to put in each till, so that when a member paid his account there should be change, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given him for that purpose that sum was always to be there in some form or other—it was for change, and nothing else—on 17th April, Robins, the clerk, applied to me for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more for change—in consequence of that my suspicions were aroused, and I made inquiry—the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should have been intact; I gave information to the police and requested their assistance—in Consequence of information received from the detectives I wrote to the prisoner; 1 received no answer—at the Mansion House I saw my letter produced by the prisoner's attorney—this is the letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read;</hi> "Sir—In consequence of your absence from the club we give you notice that we have made arrangements, and shall not require your services.

                  </hi>. I Was kitchen clerk at the City Liberal Club—I reside at 4, Swallow Street, Piccadilly—it was my duty to enter in a book all orders sent out to tradesmen before they went but-my duty was to copy from the chef's requisition book, and the steward signed them as a rule—I recollect having a conversation with the prisoner about a leg of mutton—I don't recollect the particulars, or the date; it was about <hi rend="italic">the</hi> middle of March the prisoner said if. the things did not come into the house I was to scratch off—this (<hi rend="italic">referring to a book</hi>) is not ticked, so I suppose I took them off—I did not speak to Mr. Mabey about it—I don't think I ever spoke to Mr. Mabey in my life—I have spoken to Mr. Liddell, the prisoner told me nothing about Boot &amp; Davis—I should know by the books that the things had not come into the house—I mentioned the fact to him and he told me to scratch them off—I had all the books in. my hand' at The time—he gave me those directions before this prosecution took place, at the dates or within a few days of the respectives dates—the prisoner would go out in the morning marketing; if he was catering for the establishment he would, of course, but I don't know what his terms with Messrs. Mabey were—it is a common thing to send out for things if they are wanted suddenly by members of the club.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Brentford. I was in the employ of Mr. James Montgomery, of Old Brentford, a timber-merchant—it was my business to accompany the driver of a timber-carriage—the waggon was loaded with deals to take to Eaton, about three weeks before the prisoner was apprehended, the waggon was sent out about five o'clock, as near as I can tell—there were two sacks of chaff, and corn, and beans, and two trusses of hay—it was Bolton's business to put up the corn and chaff—he was the carter—that was my master's corn and chaff, which he serves out to the horses—it was not usual to take out so large a quantity—we are allowed when we go out with six horses half a bushel of beans, one bushel of oats, and the sack filled with chaff—we went to the White Bear, at Hounslow, and had some beer there—the carter went in and I followed him—as we were com<lb></lb>ing out, he said he should like to have a pipe of tobacco—we had one apiece—Bolton then called Tyler out, and said he wanted to speak to him—he went out, what they talked about, I so not know—I followed to look after the horses, and saw Tyler take the sack off the carriage, and carry it into the yard—when it was full, the sack contains four bushels, but it was not</p>

               <p>exactly full—there was as much as three bushels in it, not more—Bolton then took a truss of hay off the carriage, and followed him into the yard with it—it was a much larger quantity than was usual to take out—we had two sacks, and we never had but one before—I do not know where Bolton left the hay.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 77). I apprehended Bolton in Mr. Monthgomery's yard—I apprehended Tyler at the White Bear, at Hounslow, he is under ostler there—he was pointed out to me by the prosecutor, who said, that was the man who had taken the sack—I asked him if he knew any thing of Mr. Montgomery's carter—he denied know<lb></lb>ing him—I asked if he took any corn off his carriage—he said no, he had done nothing of the kind—I said he should come with me to Brentford, and be exonerated from the charge; and as we went along, several persons met him, who knew him, and asked where he was going—he made no answer—I said, "You know whether you have committed yourself or no"—he said, on one occasion, he took one truss of hay off the carriage that was borrowed before by the carter, and he paid him one in return—he said nothing about the corn and beans.</p>

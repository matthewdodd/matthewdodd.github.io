                  </hi>. I live in the Old Kent-road, and am a cheesemonger. On 6th Feb., I went to the Bull public-house, in Wardour-street—I saw the prisoner there, and asked him what he wanted of me; he said he had piloted a vessel up from Gravesend that day—(I had known him four or five months before, and I believed him to be a pilot)—he said the vessel had come from China, and there was a sow and eight pigs on board that the captain had brought from China—he said he had asked from 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, and that he had got the captain to let him have them for me for about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him I did not want to have anything to do with them—he wished me to have them, as I had done a kind action to him, at I should be able to pay myself, and he should get a sovereign himself—he said a butcher had come to look at them at the Docks and offered 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them; but he wished me to have them, as he thought they would do me good—I said I would go with him, but perhaps he did not know the value of pigs—I took him to my stable, and showed him a sow I had; he said the Chinese sow was twice as big as mine, and that it was in a vessel at the London Docks—I then turned to a little one that I had in the stable, and asked him whether the little ones were anything like that—he said the little ones were about an inch higher than that one, and much broader in the back—I asked what he considered the value of my little pig—he said about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him I did not consider it worth so much—he said those were fine pigs in the Docks, and I should be able to get them—previous to this I had lent him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said the vessel was in the London Docks, and he was to meet me the next day at my house, at three o'clock, to go to the Docks—he called on me the next day, at half-past three o'clock—I said I had not got the money—he asked me how much money I had to take with me, bad I 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I said no, I had not, I had got about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I could not raise more that day, I would get it the next day—we went up into the Borough, and went into a public-house; he said he wanted something to drink—he asked me to drink—he called for a quartern of gin, and some water to put into it—while taking it I said I could not take mine, I did not know what was the matter, I could not take it—he said, "You are d—d childish"—I said, "Never mind" I could not drink it, and I said it was very late, we should not be able to get to the Docks—we came out and went to the Tower—I wanted to go through the Tower, but he said that was the furthest way, and he said he wanted to go into Rosemary-lane—I asked him what for, and he said he had to meet a captain, with whom he was going a long voyage—I then asked him again whether the pigs were in the Docks—he took his oath that they were in the Docks, and that he piloted a vessel up with them—we went to Rosemary-lane, and went into a public-house—he wanted some more to drink, and he had some more gin—I asked him why the captain was not come—he said he did not know—we came out of that house and went down a street—a butcher passed us, and he said to him, "Are you the butcher I saw last night?"—he said, "Yes; I am"—he said, "How about those pigs last night?"—he said, "I have just now bought them"—</p>

               <p>he said the captain had sent to him so many times, he had bought them—he said, "Are you not going to stand the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that you promised last night?"—the prisoner said, "I have not a right to pay the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. now, as you did not have them last night"—I then told the prisoner as the pigs were sold I should go home—he asked me to go into a public-house, which I did, and the butcher called for a quartern of gin, which we all partook of—another person then came in and called for a half-pint of old ale and some brandy; and while we were talking, the butcher proposed that we should have some mutton-chops; I said I did not want any, but he said I should have some—I said I wanted to get home, but the butcher said, "As you have had the trouble of coming over here, I will stand some"—thought that we were going to a room, but instead of that, they hurried me back into the skittle-ground; and there the butcher and the other man, who had called for the old ale and brandy, began to play—the prisoner after speaking to them went away out of the skittle-ground, and another party came directly into the skittle-ground, and he betted the butcher and the other man 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he played (the prisoner was not there then)—he won that, and then he betted a sovereign—the person who came in last then came to me and said, "I want a sovereign of you"—I told him I did not want anything to do with it—he said, "You had better give me a sovereign to play with"—I told him I would not have anything to do with it—at that time I was almost helpless from the things they had given me, the spirits and things that they had brought in, and I had had some drink at the bar—I was almost helpless; I was sensible; but I had no more power over myself than nothing—I did not bet, but the last man that came in took the sovereign from me to bet with the others—I do not know how I came to give him the sovereign—he was determined to have it from me whether or no—he then betted him again two sovereigns—he said he wanted two sovereigns of me to put with it—he got them from me—he then betted him four sovereigns, and he came to me for that—I told him I had not got any more money, and then he and the butcher came up and said, "You hare got more money," and they compelled me to put my hand into my pocket, and I pulled out another sovereign; then the butcher put his hand into my pocket, and said, "You have got more money," and the other man forced me to pull it from my pocket—he got 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from me after the sovereign—he gave the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the butcher—the butcher then put his hand outside my pocket, and he said, "D—n you, you have got more money;" and he made me surrender it to him—that was 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner was not there then—the butcher came to me again, and said, "D—d if you have not got more money now," and he felt my pockets—I said, "It is only my keys," and I pulled them out—he then put his hand into my pocket, and said, "D—n me, you have got more," and he made me surrender some 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-<hi rend="italic">bits</hi> and other silver—they fished out 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more—I did not get rid of every farthing I had before the prisoner came back—they took it from me—when the prisoner came back he brought two glasses of spirits, and said, "Drink away, lads"—he then turned round and laughed at me, and said, "What have they been doing?"—I said, "You know what they have been doing; robbed me of every farthing what am I to do?—he said, "The best way for you to do is, I will pay for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and you go home and get 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more"—I said I could not do that—he said, "Give me an I O U for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get it back?"—he got a piece of paper from the</p>

               <p>person who had the old ale and brandy, and gave it me, and told me to put down some strange name, living in Union-street, Berkshire—they then began to play, and the stranger who had the ale and brandy won the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the last person who came in the skittle-ground—the prisoner was there at that time; he Wanted me to go; I told him I should not go; and the prisoner and the last man that came there, caught hold of me and pulled me out of the skittle-ground, and pulled me out of the house—after I got out I wanted to get from them, but the prisoner held up his fist, and said, "You sha'nt go back"—he got me to Ratcliff highway, and there he left me, and then the other left me—I went back, and found the public-house where we were—I asked the landlady if there were any persons in the skittle-ground; she said, no; they had all followed out—the next day I went down to the Docks, and there were no pigs there.</p>

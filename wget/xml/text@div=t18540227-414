                  </hi>. My son is a die sinker, in Percival-street, Clerken. well. I have resided there forty years—on Wednesday, 18th Jan., the prisoner came—I saw him—he produced to me a piece of lead and a punch—the lead had the mark of a leopard's head on it——I could not discern it—he asked me if I could have them engraved; I told him I thought I could, but my son was not at home; if he would leave them with me, I would give them to him—he asked what time my son would be in; I told him I could not tell; but if he would leave them, and call again, I would tell him—he left them—I gave them to my son the next day—it was after 8 o'clock at night when the prisoner called.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a die sinker—I know the prisoner—I saw him about nine months ago, at my place of business—my mother gave me this piece of lead and this punch, and the prisoner called on 19th Jan. I produced this punch and piece of lead—the prisoner said he left them on purpose for me to see, to know whether I would do them for him, and the price—I told him the price would be 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was to engrave a leopard's head, which was the impression on the lead on the punch—it was to be done on the following Saturday—the prisoner did not call on Saturday, he called on Monday evening, and a person with him, whom I did not know at the time, but I afterwards heard his name was Groves—the prisoner wanted to know if it was done; I told him to come up because I did not exactly under<lb></lb>stand about the size—he said how he wanted it done, and I said it would be done between 1 and 2 o'clock on the following day—he said if I pleased him with this, there would be another to make of a crown—he did not show me a crown then, but it was to be a size similar to what he had shown me some months ago—he was to come the following day for this punch and lead—the prisoner and Groves both came on the following day—there was not time for them to ask if the punch was ready, for the officer was there at the time—on the Monday I made the excuse for the punch not being ready, that the die was hard, and the prisoner said his man had filed it up, pointing to Groves, who was with him, and he was not aware but that it was soft.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch case maker, and live at No. 4, North<lb></lb>ampton-buildings, North-road. The prisoner lodged in the same house, as near as I can say, between four and five years—some weeks ago he asked me if I would make some watches for him—I said I would make the cases—he told me he would find the frames—he asked me if I struck the Hall mark; I told him if I did, I should be under a heavy penalty—I did not agree to strike the Hall mark; I refused—the prisoner said he would strike them himself, and he would carry the punch to Mr. Porter.</p>

               <p>now; it was my father's—daring part of the time the prisoner was there, he was in a stationer's employ regularly, and statedly at work in a sta<lb></lb>tioner's shop—my father's business was a watch case maker—the time when the conversation took place between me and the prisoner is about eight or nine weeks ago from the present time—I had only one conversation with him about this matter—I dare say it was a fortnight after I had the conversation that I went with him to Mr. Porter's house; I cannot tell for certainty—I had no conversation with him in this case between that time and the day I went to Mr. Porter's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first see this punch which is lying before you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw it eight or nine weeks ago; the prisoner did not show it me—it was in my place—it is not my mother's; it was in my place—it is not a punch that had been used in my father's business—it had never been used at all by me, or in my presence—it was not a new punch; it was just as it is now—I first saw it up in the shop—it was not first shown to me by the prisoner; it was not shown to me at all; it was lying in my mother's workshop—I had seen it in the workshop before the conversation with the prisoner—I had seen this piece of lead before it was shown to me by the prisoner—I cannot say when I first saw it—it is a description of lead that my mother uses in the business—I thought it was a heavy penalty to counterfeit the Hall mark, and I told the prisoner so—I went with him to Mr. Porter's, because he asked me to go with him, and I accordingly went.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not yourself employ the prisoner to take this punch and lead to Mr. Porter's, and to represent that he was your master, and you his workman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—when the prisoner was taken, a sovereign was taken from him—I did not claim that sovereign as my property, nor did my brother—my brother was not at the station when I and the prisoner were taken into custody, that I am aware of; I think he was at the station when I came out—I did not tell my brother to apply for the money that was found on the prisoner, as it was my property, and I had given it him to pay for the die—I will swear I never told him anything of the sort—I was discharged by the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before you were discharged by the Magistrate, had you a conversation with the gentleman who conducts this prosecution, the solicitor, as to what evidence you could give? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only the party I employ; I cannot tell his name—the way I came to know this lawyer was, a person came to our house, as I have been given to understand—a person came to me in the House of Detention—he did not tell me, if I would give evidence against the prisoner, I should be discharged—he did not say if I could give evidence against Mackin he would procure my discharge; nothing of the kind—he asked what was the case, and I told him—he asked me if I would give any evidence—he told me if I was discharged I should have to go as evidence against the other prisoner—I do not know a person of the name of Cooper, an attorney—I know Mr. Levine; that is the man that I employed—I did not go to Mr. Levine's office yesterday, nor the day before, nor within two or three days; I have not seen him within the last week—I saw the prisoner yesterday—I was in conversation with him last night—I told him last night that I had been to the person who came to me at the House of Detention, and had given him a guinea to instruct me in what I was to say to-day.</p>

               <p>house—when I gave him the guinea, he told me to tell Mr. Prideux what I have stated to-day—I had not told Mr. Levine before that, I could state what I have stated to-day—I had told him when I was acquitted, that I could give the evidence which I have given to day—this lead and die are not things which I use in my business—my father did not use them—they were in the shop—the die was with other punches, and pieces of steel—we have plain punches—the lead is used for laying on our own Hall marks—this piece of lead was cut off from the other two, which were in the shop—we have the lead to lay on our own Hall marks, to bring the Hall mark up in its proper place, and then the mark will come on the lead.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How is it you get the impression on the lead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It comes by hammering this lead on the stamp on the stake, which is a piece of iron—the Hall mark goes down in a hollow, and we have to take some lead, cut in a square, or in an octagon shape, and lay it on, and strike it with the hammer to get the case in shape, and the impression will come on the lead—this punch was in the shop in my father's time—he died thirteen weeks ago last Thursday—I saw the punch lying in the shop with other punches before he died—we have our own private mark on punches similar to this, only the punch is square—when this punch was taken from my shop it was plain, and it is plain now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a newsvendor, living in Cannon-street—the prisoner was in my service from the middle of July—I am not quite sure of the date—he was paid weekly—I remember his coming to me on 9th Sept., at my desk, in the counting house—he told me that his child had been ill, and had died; he wished to bury it well, but was in difficulties, and could not afford it—I knew that he had been out of employ—I then, on the next morning, stated that I would help him—I advanced him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was an arrangement for its repayment; I was to deduct it on Saturday nights—I had a paper, but it has been destroyed; it was an I O U for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to be paid half a crown a week—he described the state of his family at that time—he said his wife was near her confinement; he was afraid that anxiety from the child's death would bring it on prematurely—I inquired from day to day for seven or eight days, or about a fortnight, about his wife; he told me that she had been exceedingly ill, and had been confined prematurely—on 28th Sept., he said his wife had died that morning of milk fever—I had previously given him half a sovereign to see Dr. Conquest—on his representation, I arranged for my own doctor to see her—on the morning on which he said she died, he said he did not know how he should bury her—I told him to go and inquire the expense of the funeral, and gave him a sovereign—he afterwards represented the expense—I am not quite sure what it was; I advanced him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more to bury her—I advanced the several sums I have mentioned upon his representations, believing they were true—he said his wife was to be buried on the Sunday—I received a letter from the prisoner; I am not quite sure of the date—(<hi rend="italic">A letter, dated Oct.</hi> 7, <hi rend="italic">was put in and read: it expressed regret that circumstances had induced the prisoner to tell so great a falsehood, but assured Mr. Dawson that it arose from the want of money; that having told one he, a thousand were obliged to be told to cover it, and that he should be most thankful to resume his duties, and pay his employers all they had advanced.</hi>)</p>

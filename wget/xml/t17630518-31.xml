            . On Tuesday in the Easter week at night the two prisoners at the bar, and one Morris, a sailor, came to my house and drank liquor to the amount of 3 s. 6 d. being short of money, they left me this coat and waist-coat. (Produced and deposed to by prosecutor.) After that the woman was taken up, and I was sent for, I carried the cloaths to Justice Fielding.</p>

               <p>I was sitting at the end of Russel-street, I heard a woman cry murder, I went up stairs into the woman's room, there lay a pair of breeches on the bed, Morris took and shook them, and out sell a shilling, he said he would knock me down if I spoke a word; he said, he had a good mind to rob the prosecutor and throw him out at the window; he took the cloaths and said, he would have something to drink upon them; we all three of us drank together, and he left the cloaths there.</p>
               <p>Q. to Boswell. Which of them left the cloaths?</p>
               <p>Boswell. I can't tell that, they had them amongst them.</p>

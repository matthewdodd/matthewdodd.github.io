On Thursday, the 6th of June, in con<lb></lb>sequence of having missed goods, I sent for two officers, to take all my establishment into the print-room—they agreed that the whole of them should he examined, and their boxes—I went down stairs—I was told something, and went back to the prisoner, and accused him of taking a brown paper parcel to Mr. Thorpe's—he said he had taken it there, and brought it back again—the parcel was examined, and contained three yards and a half of canvas—he had no business to take it there.</p>

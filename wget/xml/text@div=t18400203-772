                  </hi>. I live in Canterbury-place, Lambeth. The pri<lb></lb>soner was my servant—on the 31st of December my wife went out, and the prisoner wanted to go out, to which I consented—when I came home that night, I was informed of something—I went into my bed-room, and missed the property stated—this is mine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the articles</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, in the employ of Mr. Darling. I know the prisoner—on the 31st of December she came to Mr. Darling's office—I showed her and her sister some printing—we then went to her mother's in the Borough, and stopped till about half-past nine o'clock—when she first came to me she had a parcel, and when she left her mother's she had two parcels—I said, "Allow me to carry your parcels"—she said, "Take this little one"—I took it, and we went on to the Lambeth-road—I was then going to give the parcel to her, and she said "Keep it till I ask you for it"—I went on the Friday to her master's, and she came out—I went again on the Sunday, and she did not come—I went to her mother's—she had not been home—Mr. Walker afterwards came to my master's, and I gave up the parcel to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How old are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twenty years—the parcel was in brown paper, tied with a bit of hemp—I never had the curiosity to undo it till after Mr. Walker came to my master's—I did not think it strange that a young girl of about sixteen, in service, should give me a parcel to carry, and then say I might as well keep it—I have known her about two months—I became acquainted with her by meeting her in Lambeth-marsh, one Sunday evening—it was raining very fast—she had no um<lb></lb>brella, and I had one—it was somewhere about eight o'clock at night—I had been at work at my master's till lateish in the afternoon, and I was then going home to Kennington, and met her near the Victoria theatre—I walked with her to her master's door—I think we went past the door—I did not know her master's house then—I went after her again on the following Sunday, and met her near her master's house—I inquired if she was in the habit of coming out on Sundays—I think we went to chapel—I did not actually ask her if she would allow me to visit her, but I said I should come up on the following Sunday—I cannot swear whether she told me her mistress did not allow her to have visitors—I went to her very often at night, up to the gate—I never went inside—I walked about with her—the latest time was half-past nine o'clock—she could not get out later than when she fetched the beer—I do not recollect whether I asked her if she could get out to walk—she said she was going out on the Monday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you want money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I was not in debt—I never told her I was—I did not tell her to bring something with her for me to raise some money on, as I wanted some very bad—I never said that if the things were missed before I could redeem them, I would take the blame on myself—I never said such a word, nor any thing relating to it—I said, "If you come to the office, perhaps I may be able to get out a quarter of an hour before my time"—I told her to come to me, and she came with her sister—I came back with them into the Borough—she had a parcel when she came to the office, and when she came from her mother's she had two parcels—I did not carry the parcel when she went from the office to her mother's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you take her into a linen-draper's shop, and buy her a new gown? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I then went with her and her sister, to her mother's, and produced the gown to her mother—we played a game or two at cards with some friends there—when we left her mother's we went through St. Thomas's-street; it was then I asked to carry the parcel, and she gave me this one.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you stop under a lamp to see what was In the parcel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—she stopped when she gave it me—I do not recollect stopping under a lamp—I did not say that the paper the parcel, was in was not strong enough, and I would put it into a stronger—I do not recollect that any thing passed about the paper not being strong enough—I walked home with her to her master's, and there I bid her good night—I saw her on the Friday night after—I cannot recollect how long it was after I received the parcel that she was given into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WALKER</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>. I had a great deal of difficulty in ascertaining from the prisoner where Reddington worked—she never told me she gave the property to him—I questioned her about the dress that she brought home—I went and told Reddington's master as soon as I found him out, and Reddington brought the property to me on the Saturday after I had been to his master—I think it was on the 18th of January.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character, and Mrs. Young, of St. Thomas's, Broadway, engaged to take care of her.)</p>

I went to a public-house, where I saw Rodd the corner of Greenfield-street, in Fieldgate-street; I told him what I came for; he denied it, and said he knew nothing of it. While we was talking, in came Huff to fetch him out, upon which two officers took Huff into custody. He then said, if they would not use him ill, he would tell the whole of it; and that he had left the lamb in Charlotte-street, with the legs tied, and

In the mean time, in came Huff; I took hold of him, and he said he would tell all.

Huff gave me the orders; we went and had a pint of beer at the Swan, facing Old Gravel-lane; Rodd was not with us; I never saw him after I had the lamb; when we came out, I brought it back to Charlotte-street, and Huff said he was going to see where

Somerset bank-note, five sovereigns and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Mr. Lewis, who went down with me, was present at the latter part of the conversation, and said to the prisoner, "Have you any of my handwriting by you?"—he said, "No; I have not seen your handwriting for this six months; I have kept it well in my eye"—Mr. Lewis told him he had imitated his writing well—the prisoner laughed, and said, "Yes, I have; I can imitate any man's handwriting"—I searched a box which his father said was his, and found a purse with a duplicate in it of a gold watch pledged for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and forty-two medals, imitation half-sovereigns—I brought the prisoner to London, and on the way he told me he had taken a third check; he was not rightly sure about the amount; he thought it was about 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in the name of Lewis; he presented it, and the cashier told him that Mr. Lewis had not got the amount in the bank, and he came out and burnt the check at the first public-house he came to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, at the Slough station, on the Great Western Railway. On 14th May, I recollect a gentleman stopping at the station—he gave the name of Smith—I cannot call the prisoner to my recol<lb></lb>lection as that person—he left his luggage in my charge—after being there some time, he asked me for some writing-paper and ink—I gave it him, and saw him at the desk—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he went back to London, I believe—I showed him over to the other station—the luggage was sent to Bridgwater the next day, by the superintendent's direction.</p>

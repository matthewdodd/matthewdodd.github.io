                  </hi>. I am a watchman at St. Katherine's Dock. On the 7th of November, I was on duty at the letter E warehouse—the prisoner came running along with a catalogue and a pen in his hand—one of our labourers was running after him, crying, "Stop thief"—I ran and took the prisoner a few yards out of the gate—I found in his pockets and hat about four pounds of coffee—I went to the warehouse, letter F—I saw a bag of coffee that had been opened, and that found on the prisoner corresponded with it, in all respects.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer belonging to the F warehouse. Mr. McLean gave me instructions to conceal myself, and about ten minutes after twelve o'clock that day, I saw the prisoner come up—he went three times to the bag—the second time he had his head down, and seemed to be putting something into his hat, and the third time he put something into his pockets—he went down—I pursued, and cried, "Stop thief"—the watchman tock him, and asked what he had got—he said, "A little coffee"—this coffee was found in his hat and in his pocket.</p>

On the 9th of November, the prisoner came into the shop; he asked for an ounce of candied lemon-peel. We were making up five shilling papers of halfpence. I served him; he went out. The prisoner returned; he asked for another ounce of candied lemon. I turned round to get the glass, I heard a paper of halfpence fall. I turned my head round sharp; he had one of the papers in his hand. I took not the least notice of that. He went out of the shop. I went after him. He had not gone above twenty yards from the shop door before he was stopped. I received information that he had thrown them into a shop. This is the paper of halfpence. It is one of the papers that I had been making up.</p>

            . I am an officer. As I was going through Hanway-yard I heard the cry of stop thief. I saw the prosecutor in pursuit of the prisoner. A man coming in contact with the prisoner tripped him up. I searched the prisoner, and found the candled lemon-peel he had bought, and by the information of some people in the crowd I heard he had thrown the halfpence into a shop, as he run. I found this paper of halfpence in a linen-draper's shop.</p>

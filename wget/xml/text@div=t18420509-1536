                  </hi>. I am a linendraper, and live in Oxford-street The prisoner was my shopwoman—I gave ninepence in marked money to Mr. Wilkes to be given to his servant—it was to be sent to my shop to buy three yards of ribbon—I have since seen fourpence of the marked money—it was taken from the prisoner's pocket within five minutes of the time the money was given.</p>

I was sent for to Mr. White-house's—he said to the prisoner, "Have yon any objection to show me what money you have about you?"—she said, "No"—she took out one shilling in silver, eight pennypieces, and three halfpence—four of the penny pieces were marked—the three halfpence were not marked—when I found the money was marked I showed it to her, and she said, she had taken it out of the till, and put sixpence in silver back.</p>

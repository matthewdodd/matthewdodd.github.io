                  </hi>. I am a waiter out of employ—on 13th November, about 11.30 in the morning I saw the prisoner and another man near Westminster Abbey, going towards the bridge—they went on board a steamboat—I went on board with them, and got out at London-bridge—I followed them to St. Martin's-le-Grand, and the man not in custody went into a shop—I can't say whether it was a cigar-shop or a pastrycook's—the prisoner stood on the opposite side, by the General Post-office—when the other man came out he joined the prisoner—they went to Jewin-street, Aldersgate, where I saw the prisoner pass something to the other man—I was about 200 yards from them—I still followed them—the one not in custody went into a butcher's shop, in Noble-street—the prisoner remained outside—I went into the shop and spoke to the money-taker—they held one man and let the other man go—he went out of the shop, but in a different direction to where the prisoner was standing—I went out, and saw the prisoner standing at the top of Noble-street, but not in the same place as I had left the man not in custody—I went to him, and said that he was in company with a man who had just gone in—he said that he was a commercial traveller.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186511200028"></xptr>
               <p>and I had better mind what I was saying, as he would make me prove my words—a policeman came up, and I gave him in charge—I followed to the station, and saw a tobacco-pouch drop from the right leg of his trousers, in Fore-street—I picked it up, and handed it to the constable at once—it was opened at the station—it contained five bad half-crowns, and four florins, with tissue-paper between them.</p>

                  </hi>. On 13th November I was in Mr. Fisher's shop, a butcher, in Noble-street—the prisoner's friend, who was in there, went out, and I followed him—I saw a pouch drop from the right leg of the prisoner's trouser's, over an area—Bell picked it up, and gave it to the constable—I saw it opened; it contained five half-crowns and four florins.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How near were you to the prisoner when you saw it fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About half a yard—I said, "Here is something"—I will undertake to say that I drew the prisoner's attention to it, but Bell picked it up—the prisoner saw it, for it was handed over his shoulder to the constable—there were only one or two children about—I said to the prisoner, "This came out of the leg of your trousers"—I think I said that before the Magistrate—I am not a detective—I am a fancy-box maker, and have been thirteen years in one place.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 100). I took the prisoner, and told him it was for being concerned with another in uttering bad coin—he said that he could prove his innocence and respectability, and he should make Bell prove his words—I told Bell to keep behind him, to see if he dropped anything—the prisoner called out; I went to speak to him, and Bell stooped down and said in the prisoner's hearing, "Here is a tobacco-pouch come out of the leg of his trousers"—the prisoner said, "What is that you say? very likely you dropped it yourself"—it was handed to me—I examined it at the station—it contained five bad half-crowns, and four florins, each separately wrapped in paper—an imitation watch and chain, a shilling locket, a purse, containing a pawn-ticket and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. were found in his pocket—the outside part of the seam of his right trousers leg was torn away, so that he could drop the pouch down his leg without drawing his hand out of his pocket—his hand and all could go through—his hands were in his pockets till he got to Fore-street—he gave his address, "Westmorland-place, City-road," which is false.</p>

                  </hi>.I have been a master mariner for 16 years, and am at present marine superintendent in London for Messrs. Henderson Brothers' Anchor line of steamships, plying between London and New York—on the morning of Saturday, the 22nd May, I was at the Victoria Dock, on board the steamer Victoria, belonging to Messrs. Henderson, when the wife of the prisoner came to me and made a statement—the prisoner was quartermaster on board the Victoria—detectives were put to watch the prisoner's house, and they subsequently showed me the property they found there (<hi rend="italic">articles produced</hi>)—the prisoner had no right to take these articles from the ship—the property is marked with the company's flag—I heard the prisoner asked how he accounted for the possession of that property, and he said it got into his bag by mistake—his house was down at the Custom House, Victoris Docks—I do not know the street—the. company never sell any of the property—we have lost clocks of this description from the cargo.</p>

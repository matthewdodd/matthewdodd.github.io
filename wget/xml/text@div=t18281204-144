            . I live at No.8, Market-street, Fitzroy-market. I was anxious to know the truth respecting the stealing of the coat, hearing what was reported, and I called to Hawkins, who was standing with a lot more boys, and said "Is your name Hawkins?" he said Yes; I said "What is it respecting this coat, that my lodger has been said to steal?" he said "Yes, I have sworn to him; and my mother and brother say I must stick to it;" I said "The officers are after another person;" he said "I have only sworn to one, and I shall have 3l. 16s. for it; and one is enough to transport:" he said"I hear he has a sister, who is very well off, and if any body would give me a little money, I would be out of the way, and not appear against him" - this was in my own parlour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the prisoner lodging with you? A. Yes - I am his aunt; he has lodged sixteen months with me - I think it was on the Monday night - I was at my door and called this lad; I think he was throwing himself in my way - the coat was stolen on a Thursday, and I think this was Monday; he is a notorious character, and is about with bad boys at all hours - I never knew him in custody, and did not know him before; but I have heard of him, and knew his brother well; the prisoner was very unwell one day, and did not come down till between three and four o'clock - I said to him "John, how came you so late?" he said "I was not well;" he went out to go to his father's, and I saw him no more; but I heard the report, in a short time, of what had happened; I cannot say what day it was - Warren-street is about a stone's throw from my house. The prisoner works for his father, in the same market, within a few doors of me - his father pays his rent; I know nothing of the coat: I did not ask Hawkins who was to give him the 3l. 16s. - he said the officer told him so; his own brother told me he was an infamous character, and he would not be ruled by his mother or him, and he should give him up to himself</p>
               <p>ROBERT HAWKINS re-examined. Q. Were you in the parlour with Mrs. Wilday? A. I did not know that was Mrs. Wilday - I was in the parlour with her; I said somebody told me there would be 3l. 16s. for transporting the person, but I did not wish to have any money.</p>
               <p>COURT to JOHN BAKER. Q. How long were you absent? A. Not more than a quarter of a minute, or from that to half a minute; when I returned, the boy was there; I stood with my foot on the step, and inquired what there was to pay for the letter - I had the money in my hands; the lady told me what there was to pay; I paid in copper; I believe I asked as I stood at the door, and they said 4d.</p>

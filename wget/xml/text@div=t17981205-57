             sworn. - On the 19th of November, about half past eleven, or a quarter before twelve o'clock at night, I met the prisoner in Barbican.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. A scale-beam-maker, in Duke-street, Southwark.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a maaried man? - A. No. The prisoner asked me to give her a glass of something, she had another person with her, and I gave her a glass at the corner of Beech-lane; she had another person with her; she went with us to a house to drink; we came out again, and she asked me if I would walk home with her; I went home with her; there was a man in the room seemed very much in liquor; the man gave some halfpence, and I gave, I believe, five-pence halfpenny to send for two pots of beer, and while the person that I met her with, whom she called her servant, went for it, I fell asleep, and I might sleep about an hour; I did not feel my money go; but when my watch went, I waked, and missed my money; I then saw Mrs. Merritt.</p>

            Did you know her before? - A. I have known her a long time, but whether it was her home or not I cannot tell; there was a kind of a bustle in the room, I caught hold of her, and said, you have got my watch; she said, good God, Ned, how can you think so; she sat down, and I said, return me my watch, or I will call the watchman; she said, I have not got your watch; I then called the watchman, and he came in, and searched her, but there was no watch upon her, and I have never found it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was a man in the room? - A. When I waked there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he did not take it? - A. I cannot say. <rs id="t17981205-57-verdict307" type="verdictDescription">

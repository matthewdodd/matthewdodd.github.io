I asked him where he got the onions, he told me he bought them at Putney, he gave eighteen pence a sieve for them; he said he worked for Mr. Millett; I said Mr. Millett complained he had lost a great many onions. I asked him if he had any more, he said yes; he went up stairs, opened a drawer, and there were a dozen. I took them to Mr. Millett; he said they were his property.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at a skittle-ground at Ealing, at half-past five o'clock in the morning, on the 28th of June—the prisoner was there too—I could not get into my landlady's house to sleep, and was sleeping there I awoke, and found the prisoner's hand in my pocket—I had two half-crowns in my pocket—the half-crowns were in his hand—I said, "Do not</p>

I met the prosecutor at half-past five o'clock; he said he had been robbed of two half-crowns—I went to the Bell public-house, and saw the prisoner there—I laid my hand on his shoulder, and told him I wanted him—he said, "Do you want me, or does the man who was robbed want his money"—I said, "You seem to know all about it"—I went to the landlord, and asked if he had changed any money—he said, "Yes, half-a-crown"—but he could not tell which, as he had taken five that morning; but he laid them all on the bar, and prosecutor picked out this one—I found four shillings on the prisoner, but no half-crown—It was about seven o'clock when I came in.</p>

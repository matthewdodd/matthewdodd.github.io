             sworn.</p>
               <p>The things mentioned in the indictment were taken from my lodgings, between six in the morning and noon. On last Wednesday I went out to work about a quarter before six; I left my box at home; I cannot say positively whether it was locked or not; a handkerchief lay on the top of it. I locked my room door as usual, and heard the bolt of the door chink. I came home about twelve; I found the room door locked and the key in the same place where I had left it. I missed the handkerchief which had been lying upon the top of the box, that alarmed me. I then found my box upon, I cannot say whether the box was locked before; I missed every thing which I had left in the box (repeating the several things mentioned in the indictment) I am sure they were there in the morning; upon that I made enquiry. Suspicion fell among others upon the prisoner, who was <rs id="t17800628-70-deflabel356" type="occupation">journeyman</rs>

I immediately said the half-crown had a particular mark upon it if it was my half-crown. Upon its being shown me I saw the mark upon it and swore to it.</p>
               <p>( M'Donald, a constable, deposed that he took the prisoner into custody and confirmed the circumstance relative to the half-crown.)</p>

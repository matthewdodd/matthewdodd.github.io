                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe maker, and live at No. 5, High-street, Woolwich. I have carried on business there for some time—on 24th June last, I let the front shop to a person calling himself Neale and Co., at a rent of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for ten days, to sell coloured lamps and other things for the illumination—he paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I let it him for the next week at 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as he had not been successful, and he was to pay 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for so long as he remained afterwards—he remained that week and part of another, and I lent him money to the amount of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he left without notice before the end of the second week, and he came with six men to take bis goods, with<lb></lb>out paying the money, but I detained them—I went to the police court, and spoke to the Magistrate, and was referred by him to the County Court—as I left the police court, the prisoner Toner followed me out, and said, "I see that this Neale is trying to cheat you, you ought to take regular steps for it"—he said, "I am the broker that does the business for the parish of Woolwich; you get a form, and I will fill it up, and give me the notice, I will get the rent for you; I have several cases now in hand similar; I have got men in the houses, where I visit them every day"—he said "You get a blank form, and I will fill it up, and give Mr. Neale a week's notice to quit the premises"—I went with him to Mr. Edwards's, in High-street, and bought a printed form—he also called for a form of distress, a warrant—I bought that—I told him that one week's rent was due, and the other partly due—that was not due till the week was up, but Toner said, "Yes, you put it in; take it for both, for he has began for both; leave it to me, and I will transact the business for you, as I do for all the parish"—I am sure I told him that one week was due, and the other, I think, was wanting two days to the end of the week—I told him it was a weekly rent—he said, "Put the two weeks in, they are due to you if he has com<lb></lb>menced, and the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with it; I will put it all in"—I told him that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185610270150"></xptr>
               <p>Neale owed me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for money lent, and lodging besides—I said, "Don't do one thing that is, wrong, I want nothing but what is right and, fair"—I called in a policeman to ascertain that it was right; he did not know much about it—having filled up the warrant, Toner made the distress—he demanded 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for making the levy, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the man that he put in—he wanted me, to pay it down then—I said, "No, not until the business is settled; I never did in the country"—he said, "The law is different now"—I refused to pay him until it was completed, but, my wife did—Toner told me next day that she had paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the man—I do not know when she paid the rest, and I gave my man 10. to give him, as he said he was abort of money—I saw him take, it—this was on 18th July—the man remained in possession five days—my wife paid him—at the end of the five days, Toner came, accompanied by Graham and Mr. Campion, the appraiser, a police<lb></lb>man to swear the appraiser, and two other men—Toner came and said to me that the appraisers were come to appraise the goods, and I must pay 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. before they had right to work—I put down four, half crowns on the table, the halfpenny they said they would give me—Toner said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was for the appraiser, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the appraiser's clerk, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for, the stamp—Graham took the money up from the table, he was the appraiser's clerk—I said, "It is a great deal of money for, me to pay, this is 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that I have paid"—he said, "You can buy the goods, if you like, at the con<lb></lb>demned price"—Toner and Graham both said so—I said, "Please to make two lots of the goods, as Mr. Neale owes me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," which I wished Toner to take out off the warrant, and I thought I might be able to get that—"Hold your tongue," said Graham, "we have made it all right,"and he waved his hand, ordering me not to speak, and I walked away, thinking it was all right—Toner said it was all right, and told me not to interfere—Toner walked to the back garden, and called out, "Mr. Neale," three times to come and claim the goods, and three times at the front door—Mr. Neale did not answer, and he then said, "We must give the landlord the privilege of buying these goods at the condemned price"—he said that publicly at the table—he then called out twice, "Francis Marker, or any person in the, behalf of Francis Marker, to, take these goods at the condemned price"—(3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the price named)—the second time he called that out, I answered, "Yes,"—I said it loud, so as they could hear me—I walked close to the table, and said, "Yes," close to them—I said, "Yes, I take them at the condemned price"—I then turned to go through my parlour to the back part of the house, and my man followed me—Toner came into the parlour, and said to my man, "You must pay 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more for these goods, as there is another man will give a sovereign more for them;" that waste part between themselves—I called Toner, and said, "You please to settle the warrant, give me a regular receipt; you want a sovereign more, I understand; I don't mind paying you; I don't see that there is any occa<lb></lb>sion for it, I will run up stairs for the money, and settle it"—he said, "I am going out to have a glass of ale, and I will be in and settle the warrant for you in two or three minutes"—I did not promise to give him the other sovereign—I waited for him until night, he did not return—that same night Mr. Jones and three or four men came to take, the goods—I saw Graham there shortly afterwards packing up the goods—I prevented it—I went to the police station and spoke to the inspector—a policeman came—I said to Graham, "Who has sold these goods?"—he said "Toner"—I said "Where is Toner?"—he said, "He is over at the gardens having a bit of a pipe; it is all right; let the goods stop till he comes back with the money"</p>

               <p>—said, "If that is the case I will have him taken up for embezzlement, and selling the goods twice over—Graham insisted on taking them, and said it was all right to me—I said, "It is not right, for I have not got the money, and I have not sold the goods; I have lost 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., besides my rent"—Jones said." I will leave the goods, I won't take them; I don't wish to do anything that is wrong," and shortly after they all went away—between 11 and 12 o'clock that night, Mr. Jones brought Toner to the shop—he was drunk—I said to him, "You have sold these goods twice over, after I have bought them and paid you your experises, and I will have you taken up for embezzlement"—he said, I have not sold the goods;" and he turned round to my man and said, "You can take the goods to-morrow morning' at 10 o'clock"—the next night I put the goods down in the cellar, as I wanted to let the shop; a party was wait ing for it—Graham and Jones came for them next day—Graham' insisted on taking them—the man in possession told him he should not, until he had paid the rent, and they "did not get them—afterwards Jones, Toner, and another man came and said they came on account of Neale's goods—I said, "I shan't have anything to say to you"—Toner told me that Neale had taken out a Conty Court summons for 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the goods that he had condemned and sold to me—I did receive a County Court summons, and had to srrffer the loss, in conse<lb></lb>quence of Toner's making a false distress—they decided against me at the County Court, and I had to pay 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. expenses, and lost all the rent—it has almost ruined me—I am only a working man—I was obliged to give up the goods; it was decided against me on the ground that the half week had been put in—Toner said, "I have got the money (meaning Jones's money), and I mean to stick to it;" and he took the money otit in his hand—he said, "I did not sell the goods"—I said, "You took the money"—he said, I did not"—I said, "Who did?"—he said, "My clerk"—I said, "Who is your clerk?"—he said, Graham"—Graham was not present then—he then asked me to stand a pot of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale—I refused, and he said, "Very well, I have got plenty of money, and I mean to spend it"—on 9th Aug. Toner came again, with Graham—they came into my parlour door—my daughter was up in the parlour—I and my wife were down in the kitchen having our dinner—I went up on my daughter calling me—Toner said, "I have come about Neale's goods"—I said, "I have nothing to sayto you; I am just having my dinner"—I locked the parlour door, and went down stairs again (this was after I had been to the County Court)—I left them in the stop—before I got to the bottom of the stairs I heard the parlour door burst open—my wife ran up directly, and I heard a great noise—I did not go up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Marker. I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner at our place several times—I was by the side of them on 9th Aug when they came to appraise the goods—when the distress was first put in I paid Toner some money, that was about an hour after the distress was put in—I heard the conversation between him and my husband previously—he asked my husband for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and half a crown, and he refused—after my husband was gone out, Toner said to me, "You know this is a poor fellow (meaning Bevel), and he wants money, and it is not in my power to pay it him; I have got a great many men about, and I must go and visit them all"—I said I could not get 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. but I could let the poor fellow have half a crown before he went home—he said, "So do, and let me have it," and I gave him half a crown, he kept 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of it, and gave the rest to the man—next day I gave him 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that was for himself—he said he wanted a few shilling—in the evening I paid the man his half crown—next day Toner came and said he wanted a shilling of my husband—he said, "No, I have made a promise that I would not pay any, but if you are badly off and in want of a shil<lb></lb>ling," he gave our man one to give him—Toner had another half crown that same day from me to give to the man, I did not see him give it to him, he told me he did—I paid the man three half crowns myself, and Toner three half crowns and 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was present when the appraisement was mads—I saw Graham there, and saw my husband pay the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I would not say that Graham took it up, because I did not observe it, but it was taken up by one of them at the table that was doing the business—between 9 and 10 o'clock Graham came with Mr. Jones and two workmen with a donkey cart, they took the goods down from the window, and were packing them all up—Jones took out a receipt and said he had paid for it—I said, "Why, the other day my husband bought it"—Jones said, "Oh!

                  </hi>. I am a broker and lamp lighter. I attended at the sale, and bought the lamps—Graham and Toner sold them to me—I gave 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I only had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with me; I offered to deposit that; he objected, and wanted all the money down—I said, "If you will go with me across to North Woolwich Gardens, where I work, I will get the remainder for you, and pay your expenses"—they agreed to that, and went with me—I borrowed the money of my master, and paid it on the table—Graham picked it up, and Toner asked for it, and said he had a right to it; and he gave it over into his hands, and said, "Well, I know it is a usual thing for the broker to take the money, I must give it over to you"—my master then said to me, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, go and get your goods;" and I went and took two men with me—I did not see Toner after giving him the money, I left him in the garden—I found Graham over there—when I got there with a donkey and cart, I began to take some lamps from the window, and put them in the donkey cart, when Mr. Marker came in, and said, "What are you going to do with these goods?"—I said, "I have paid for them, and am going to take them over the water"—he said, "I have not received my money yet"—I said, "Well, if you have not, I will not go any further till such time as Toner brings the money"—Graham was there waiting to see the things deli<lb></lb>vered up to me, but he was not helping—I unloaded the cart again, and took the goods back, and said, "I will leave it till the morning;" and I told the man to stop in possession, and I would pay him for his night's work—I think Graham said he had left Toner on the other side of the water—I saw Toner that same night, after I had unloaded the cart—I told him I wanted the goods, and did not know what to make of it, as he was not there to give them up to me in a respectable way, and he had my money—he said he had stopped at the gardens to see something going on there—I was in such a way about it, that I gave him in charge to a policeman, and took him to the station house; but the inspector said he could not interfere in it, and Toner said he would meet me in the morning and have my goods delivered up to me—I went there next morning at 9 o'clock, and Toner was not to be found—Graham was there—I could not get my goods—I did not see Toner for two or three days afterwards—I think the next time was at the police court—I never got my money back, or the goods.</p>

Marker said, "I will take them, my young man will take them for me," and he then left—Toner then said, "Whoever pays the money down at the condemned price, shall have them," and Jones said, "I will have them"—that was after Marker had left the room—before Toner said that, he followed Marker into the parlour—Jones made an offer of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in part payment, and the rest after yauds—Toner said no, he must have all the money, and then they went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, Sussex-place, Plumstead-road. I am a broker and appraiser—I execute distress warrants for the parish of Woolwich, and have done so for years—I know Toner—he is not a licensed broker, to my knowledge—he does not do the parish business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is there a parish broker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not exactly, but the warrants are all sent to me, and I execute them with a policeman—I do all the business they hare to do—they send it to me, I do not hold any appointment as parish broker—I cannot swear whether Toner has a licence or not, I do not believe he has—a man may put in a distress whether he is a broker or not, because the landlord is his own broker, and can employ any one, but he cannot condemn—the same broker that puts in the distress cannot condemn, you must have a licensed appraiser—he puts the price on them that he thinks they will fetch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Toner. Q.</hi> During your presence, after the goods were condemned, did Marker make any proposal to buy them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Toner's Defence.</hi> This case originated out of the execution of 9th Aug. On 9th Aug., Mr. Marker applied at the Woolwich Police Court for a sum<lb></lb>mons against Graham; it was fixed for hearing on the 15th, when he called me as a witness, and Mr. Marker applied for a summons against me, and swore that I assaulted him; a summons was granted for me to appear on the 22nd; I did so; it was adjourned to the 29th, and on the 29th Mr. Traill dismissed the summons; on the 3rd of the following month, I was served with a fresh summons, charging me with assaulting his daughter; that is all I know about the affair.</p>

The prisoner snatched the bundle out of my hand, and ran away. I have known the prisoner from a child; he lived in the same neighbourhood where I lived. On the next day I was crossing the Dials when I saw the prisoner and the man that knocked me down, in company together. I went up to the prisoner; the other man ran away. I immediately collared the prisoner; he knocked me down and made his escape. In about an hour and a half after I was crossing the Dials, the prisoner came up to me and made a laugh at me taking him in custody. I took hold of him by the collar, and held him until Mr. Bennet came up and took him in custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Are you the gentleman in whose house there were found some housebreaking tools - A. No, never in my life, so help me God. I had six months for being out a late hour in the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sent you to the house of correction - A. The sessions at Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times since have you been in prison - A. About twice, upon charges of the same kind. I was committed, and referred to the sessions for the opinion of the Jury. I was tried on a suspicion of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150044"></xptr>burglary first; the second time on charge of a street robbery</p>

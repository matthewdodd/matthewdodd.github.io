                  </hi>. I am in the service of the Misses Wright, of Crouch End, Hornsey—I remember West coming to my mistress's shop on the 23d of September, about twenty minutes past 4—he asked for some patterns of some Welsh linen, and other goods—he said he came from Mr. Poulton, who kept the Compasses—he returned in about au hour with this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for a quantity of goods; he wanted to take the goods with him, hut Miss Wright said he could not take them with him, she would send them down, as they would take some little time to do up—he went way, and I followed him to the "Compasses"—about 300 yards from Miss Wright's shop I saw Gleed; he spoke to West—I then went and saw Mr. Poulton, and from what he said I gave information to the police—a piece of paper was found on Gleed, which corresponded with the order.</p>

I keep the Compasses public-house at Hornsey—I never authorized any one to write or present the order produced, or to go to Miss Wright's for goods for me—I remember the two prisoners coming to my house on the day in question, and having a pint of beer—they stood at the bar and drank it.</p>

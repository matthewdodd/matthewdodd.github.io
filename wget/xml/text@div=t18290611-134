On the 21st of April, between seven and eight o'clock, I was engaged in a room behind the shop; I was just coming into the shop when my niece screamed out, and said a man had run out off the shop with some rings - I pursued the prisoner with some other persons, and saw him taken - a person said he had thrown the property down in the street; I took up part of it, and part was down an area.</p>

A lady had been into the shop, and bought a gold ring- she had hardly got two steps out, when the prisoner came in, and asked for Mr. Johnson; I said I could not tell about any such person - I had my hand on the tray of rings - he snatched it up, and ran out; I saw him brought back, and am certain he is the man.</p>

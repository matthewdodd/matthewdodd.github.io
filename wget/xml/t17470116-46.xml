               <p>Jennings . In Gracechurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar.</p>
               <p>Jennings . Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to alledge against him?</p>
               <p>Jennings . I did not see him steal the Goods. I lost a Goose on Christmas-Eve.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a live one, or dead one?</p>
               <p>Jennings . A dead one.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time was it?</p>
               <p>Jennings . About Eleven o'Clock at Night.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sweedland . Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Sweedland. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to lay to his Charge?</p>
               <p>Sweedland . On Christmas-Eve, about Eleven o'Clock, I saw him take the Goose, the Property of my Master I followed him, and I took the Goose; he said, Here take the Goose, I said that would not do; I called my Master, and he sent him to the Watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any Instrument that he took it with?</p>
               <p>Sweedland . He took it with his Hands, and was got about two Doors before I took it from him.</p>
               <p>Q Had he the Goose in his Hand, or did he fling it down?</p>
               <p>Sweedland . He had it in his Hand; he said take it; but I said that would not do; and my Master immediately came.</p>
               <p>Q to the Prisoner. What have you to say for yourself?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I was going Home late at Night, and there was three Geese laid upon the Board; their Heads laid over the Board; I was very fuddled, and the Goose tumbled down; and I took up the Goose, and the young Man came up to me, and he followed me two or three Doors, busseting me with the Goose; his Master came out, and said what was the Matter; he said this Man had stole a Goose.</p>

               <p>Witcher . He is a Carpenter; he is a hard-working Man, but he is apt to drink too much. Mr Jennings I was with this Day se'nnight, he said to me, I will be very favourable; he said before the Alderman he gave him ill Names, or else there would have been little of it. There was a couple of Carpenters, his Masters, I went to them, but one of them was very ill, and could not come.</p>

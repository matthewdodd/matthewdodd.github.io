                  </hi>. I live with my mother, Maria Elizabeth Greening, who is a widow, and is a baker. The prisoner was in her employ, it was part of his duty to receive money for her, and pay it to me the same night—I keep my mother's accounts—I believe the prisoner keeps a memorandum-book which he takes out in the cart, but he does not show that to me—he tells me what he receives, and hands it over to me—he has not paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on Mr. Ponsford's account; or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Mr. Pember's; or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from a Mrs. Holford—"he never told me anything about them—the bread is counted out to the prisoner when he goes out, and we count it when he comes back—this is Ponsford's account, the amount he owes us is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the last week's bread was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; Mrs. Holford owes 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Mr. Pember 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I give the prisoner the bills to deliver every Monday—I did not ask him for these accounts, because I did not suppose they were paid—he has never said anything about them.</p>

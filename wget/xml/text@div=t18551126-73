I am stationed at Barking—on Sunday morning, 4th Nov., I was on. duty in the Barking-road, and saw the prisoners about a quarter past 2 o'clock, coming towards Barking—Lines had a bag on his back—I said, "Halloo! what have you got here?"—he never spoke, but dropped the bag, and <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> right off—I then caught Powell, and took him to the station—I took the bag with me—I examined the bag, and found in it the carcase of a sheep, all but the head, neck, and skin—it was still warm—the head, neck, and skin, and entrails, were wanting—I examined Powell's person—his hands were all over blood, and his trowsers and boots had blood on them—they were left on him—we had no others to put on him—I went with sergeant Milsted to Frederick Lines's house—I did not see him there—I went first about 5 o'clock the same Sunday afternoon—I did not see him—I went again about 8 o'clock in the evening, and found him in the house then—it is his own house—his dress was then different altogether—I did not apprehend him on the Sunday night—I was present on the Tuesday when we went before the Magistrate—I saw Milsted produce a shirt and a razor—I did not take Lines on the Sunday evening—I was not positive of him—he had got different clothes on, and was shaved and dressed—we took him on Monday, I think about half past 8 o'clock, in his mother in law's house, close on his own home—on the Tuesday, when Lines was there, I saw Milsted produce a shirt and a razor—I think none of the Magistrates were present—I think there was nobody but the clerk there—it was before the Magistrates took their seats—I could see little marks of blood on the shirt—when they were laid down on the table, Lines said, "That is the shirt that I had on on Saturday, but the razor I cut the sheep's throat with, I threw away"—when I apprehended Lines, he was in the very same dress he had on when he had the sheep—I was sure he was the man when I saw him on the Monday night in his working clothes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the reason of your telling him that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I told Lines on the Sunday night, "You had a smock frock on, had you not?"—he said, "No, I never had one in my life"—I said that to prevent his running away—I told him that for a <hi rend="italic">blind</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think it your duty to go to a man to tell him a deliberate lie? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have been reported to the Commissioners for my gross misconduct in this case—I have not been reproved by Mr. Cotton—I cannot say whether he complained of Milsted—I cannot say whether it is true or not—I cannot recollect whether I told Milsted that the man I saw with the sheep had a smock frock on and a cap, but the night was so dark I would not be positive.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, stated</hi>: "He was dressed just as he is now; he had not a smock frock on; I have said he had a smock frock on; I think I said so on Monday; I cannot recollect to whom I said so; I said so because he should not <hi rend="italic">bolt</hi>; I inquired of his wife where the smock was, that was a <hi rend="italic">blind</hi>; why I did not take him on Sunday was, because he was not in the same dress.")</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You swore before the Magistrates that you inquired of the wife about the smock, and it was only as a <hi rend="italic">blind</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I must have made a mistake about that—I did not made a mistake before the Magistrate—I spoke the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You swore here to-day that, before the Magistrate came in, Lines said, "That is the shirt I had on on Saturday, but the razor I cut the sheep's throat with I threw away;" why did you not mention to the Magistrates that he had confessed the crime? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sergeant Milsted did—I am not sure whether that was mentioned in the prisoner's presence.</p>

               <p>I was at work in my garret in White Hart-yard. I heard a noise. I came down; there were thirty or forty people round the prisoner. I heard the boy crying; he said he was robbed. I took her by the peak of the stays behind; I then saw her put a half-guinea into her mouth; I saw the edges of it; it rattled in her teeth. I tried to pull it out of her mouth, but she gave her head a toss back and swallowed it. I took her to the watch-house; the beadle found two shillings and a sixpence and a halfpenny upon her; when the money was produced, the next day, she said there was no more of the boys but two shillings.</p>

               <p>As I was going into Stuart's-rents this lad laid hold of me and said, I have seen you before, 3where are you going? I said do not trouble your head with me. I went home and left my door upon the latch, as I did not think to stay long; the lad came up stairs and said, now I have got into your room, what will you drink? He said, let us have a little drop of gin. He gave me twopence halfpenny, and Mrs. Smith's daughter fetched it; we drank the liquor and came down stairs together, and went up White Hart-yard; in less than half a minute he turned round and said, you have robbed me of the money out of my pocket. We came down, and he alarmed some people. I never saw but that two-pence half-penny.</p>

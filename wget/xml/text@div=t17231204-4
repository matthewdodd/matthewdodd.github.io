             deposed, As he was going through the Privy Garden between 12 and 1 a Clock, he was told by a Boy, That there were in such a Place, near the Duke of Richmond'd House, two Men a fighting. That thereupon he made up to them, and seeing them with their Swords drawn, making Passes at one another, and, that the Deceased made two or three Passes at the Prisoner; he called to them, saying, What are you doing? Have you a mind to be hang'd? That upon this the Prisoner dropp'd his Sword, seeming willing to desist. That then he went to the Deceased, and desired him to desist, asking him, If he had a mind to be hang'd? To which he answered, No; and desired that they might be let alone to fight it out. But he getting behind him, endeavouring to secure him from doing Mischief, he let his Sword fall, and it was taken up by the Prisoner, who returned it to the Deceased, and he put it up himself. And as they were carrying them to the Guard, the Deceased desired him, and other Persons that were there, to take Notice, if any Mischief came of it, that he forc'd the Prisoner to it. Mr. Wellbeloved deposed, That as he was Passing through the Privy Garden, being told that there were two Men a fighting, he went, and saw the Deceased stand leaning against a Wall, and bloody, and the Prisoner having the Deceased's Sword in his Hand; and the Deceased said, D - n you, give me my Sword. That he, this Evidence, bid the Prisoner not give him the Sword, lest he should do him some Mischief. That the Prisoner told him he would give him his Sword, if he would let him put it up for him. But the Deceased said, D - n him, he would put it up himself; and he did return him his Sword, but with great Caution, and he put it up. And as they were going away he turned back, and said to the People there, That they had quarrelled, and only went out to Box and that if any Mischief came of it, he forgave the Prisoner, for he forc'd him to it. And, that having gone fifty or sixty Yards he fell down. The Surgeon depos'd, That he going by at the same Time, went home with the Deceas'd, which was not far off, and search'd and dressed his Wound, which he found had penetrated below the left Pap about five Inches, into the Liver, and he believed to the Diaphragma, which he suppos'd was the Cause of his Death. And he died in about 28 Hours. The Prisoner pleaded, They having been drinking together, the Deceased, pack'd a Quarrel with him, and challeng'd him out to Box, and when they came to the Place he drew his Sword, and swore he would stick him if he did not draw. He also called some Persons to his Reputation, who gave him the Character of a quiet, peaceable Person. And the Prisoner likewise pleaded, That the Deceased was a quarrelsome Person, and had before Killed two Men: and for one of the Facts had been tried at the Old Bailey. The Jury, after a full hearing, found him <rs id="t17231204-4-verdict23" type="verdictDescription">

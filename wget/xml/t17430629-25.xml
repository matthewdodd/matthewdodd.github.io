            . I am Turnkey of the Poultry-Compter. Last Tuesday, between 5 and 6 in the Evening, the Prisoner came up to the Poultry-Compter Gate with this Bundle of Goods upon his Back; by his own Confession I find that he apprehended there was a a Mob pursuing him:

             told me the Boy had thrown them into the Lodge, for he had been with me about a Quarter of an Hour before to see a Prisoner in the Goal: I asked the Prisoner how he came by them, and he presently, owned that he had them from on board of a Vessel down at Billingsgate; I sent a Man down to the Vessel that he said he had them from, and he brought a Person to me who knew the Owner of the Things; and when he came on the Outside of the Gate, he asked the Prisoner how he could serve him so; but said, sooner than prosecute him, he would lose the Goods, so I thought proper to prosecute him. Said I, I thought you had been a poor distressed Boy, but now I see what you are. - I know of this Boy's coming after some loose Boys in the Compter.</p>

            . I know nothing farther of the Prisoner than his coming to the Poultry Compter to see some of those who are under Consinement there; he came with this Parcel of Things, and there happened to be a Mob at the Gate, which he imagined were coming after him, so he threw them into the Turnkey's Habitation; and I desired him not to let the Boy have them. for I thought he was not a Person likely to have such Things of his own, so I sent for a Constable and charged him, and I found that this Parcel belongs to a poor Miller in the Country, who has not a Farthing of Money to carry on the Prosecution; and before he could raise the Money to prosecute the Boy, the Goods must be lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They bid me bring the Things into the Lodge.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to ask the Boy to bring the Things up to the Lodge?</p>
               <p>Kingston. He is a loose Boy that comes after the Thieves, he brought them in, and being a little surprised, he threw them into the Lodge; so I told Mr Cox it was proper to stop the Things and the Boy too, till we could come at a little better Knowledge of the Affair, and in about a Quarter of an Hour's Time he confessed that he took them out of the Boat, and brought them away clandeslinely; they were taken out of a little one Mast Boat, and he said no Body was on board the Boat when he took them - I am an Under-Turnkey, my Business is to look after the Rats and Mice.</p>
               <p>Cox. When the Person who was the Carrier of the Goods came to him, he said the Prisoner went into the Boat with an Excuse to help a Man to gather up some Wheat, for he had burst a Sack, and the Man who was to carry the Goods, took him to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174306290014"></xptr> the other Man's Boy, and had no Mistrust of his being a Thief.</p>

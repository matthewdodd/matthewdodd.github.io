I am a lighterman, of 12, Charles Street, Old Gravel Lane, and was in charge of the Louisa, and saw the oats on board on the Tuesday—I went on board again on the Wednesday, and four sacks were missing—they had Mr. Hodges's name on them to the best of my belief—I loaded 12 sacks on the Tuesday, and there were only eight on the "Wednesday—I had some sacks at the side which I did not count.</p>

I saw three men in the boat—it was the David and Harp public-house, I believe, that Ditchett wanted me to go into—I didn't stop the men—I had no idea what was in the boat till I went to see, and when I came back the men were gone—I knew the prisoners previously.</p>

            . I am a traveller to a wholesale house in the city. On the 15th of June I came up Heath-street, into the Commercial-road, and saw three suspicious characters looking about; I took particular notice of their transactions; the prisoner was one of them - I never saw either of them before to my knowledge - I passed them, and on turning round, saw the prisoner cross the road, and go immediately to the side or private door of Mr. Levy's house; seeing the name of "Levy, silversmith and jeweller," over the shop window, I anticipated that they had gone to the synagogue, it being their Sabbath - not seeing a policeman on duty, I immediately went to the office in Arbour-square; the person who answered me at the office-door, wished me to apply opposite, which I did, and two policemen came out; I wished them to put on private clothes, they did so, and immediately followed me into the Commercial-road - before we got to the shop of Mr. Armstrong, which is nearly opposite Mr. Levy's, we passed by one of the men that I supposed to be on the look out; it was one of those who had been walking with the prisoner; I pointed him out to the officer - I and the policeman went into Armstrong's shop, and while watching there, the third person passed me, and I pointed him out also - we were not in the shop more than three or five minutes before we saw the prisoner come out of Levy's shop-door - I said that was the man; we were then in Armstrong's shop - the policeman immediately went over and secured him - I saw the prisoner go back with the policeman to the shop-door, and finding it fastened as I supposed, he took the prisoner to the private door and knocked - I saw the servant girl open the door to them; what conversation passed I cannot say, but I saw the girl close the door in their faces as if frightened, and immediately the policeman brought the prisoner across the road into Armstrong's shop where I remained - he searched the prisoner, and found the whole of the property on him, with five skeleton keys, and one picklock; he was immediately taken to the station-house in Whitechapel-road.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I went with Selth to Armstrong's shop, which is opposite Levy's nearly - while we were there I saw the prisoner come out of Levy's shop - I saw the door open when he came out, and he closed it too - I then went over and secured him - I endeavoured to take him into Levy's shop; I knocked at the shop door, and the prisoner told me to knock at the private door; I went to the private door, and a servant came; I asked her if the prisoner had just come out of there; she did not seem exactly to understand me, and being in private clothes, she slammed the door too - before I took him to the door, I asked him if he had just come out of Mr. Levy's; he said Yes, he had just been speaking to Levy; I said he must go back and see - we could not get in at the shop door and went to the side door - I did not knock very loud, and he said, "knock louder, the servant is up stairs, she won't hear" - when she came down, and I made inquiry, she appeared alarmed, and slammed the door in my face - I took the prisoner over to Armstrong's shop and searched him; I pulled off his hat and found that full of various him; I pulled off his hat and found that full of various articles; a silver milk-jug, silver boxes and thimbles, which I have here; I have had possession of them ever since - I went to Leadenhall-street; Levy came back with me to where I live and saw them - I have here a silver milk-jug, seven negligees, two spoons, twenty scent-boxes, twenty-eight brooches, seven coral necklaces, eight silver caddy spoons, and various other articles - I found five skeleton keys on him, and one picklock; one of them opens the private door, and a small one a passage door leading from the passage into the parlour; and the one which opens the private door, also opens the shop door leading into the street - the name of the parish is St. Dunstan, Stebonheath, alias Stepney.</p>

            . I was servant to Mr. Levy; on Saturday the 15th of June, I remember his going out about eleven o'clock to the synagogue; he went out at the private door, I shut it after him; I then went down stairs in the kitchen, and was at work; I heard a knock at the door, anI I went to the door and saw a man - (I have not seen him since) - the policemen afterwards came to the door with the prisoner; I did not let them in because I was frightened; I am sure the prisoner is the man the policeman had; I had not been up stairs but was at work in the kitchen; I had heard nobody in the house; I was in the back kitchen, which is a fight of stairs from the shop; a person might open the shop door and come in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040047"></xptr>without my hearing them; I have seen articles of this nature in the shop.</p>

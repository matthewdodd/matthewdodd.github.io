               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Ponblank; on Monday last the prisoner at the bar was at work in our warehouse, at about one o'clock on Monday he was at work, between three and four the prisoner at the bar went down twice, stopping rather longer than usual the second time I went down, I found the prisoner was coming up stairs; I took the keys and locked the door in the warehouse, the outer door; I went up again, and the prisoner at about half past four asked me to let him go out into Thames-street to receive a little money. The property was found on the prisoner in Tower-hill the next day; I never saw him no more that evening; I did not see any pimento was missing then; I went to the public house to enquire for the man to come to work; the man that keeps the house said that he was taken on Tower-hill with a bag of pimento on his back.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I met the prisoner on Tower-hill; I followed him and asked him where he was going to? he said, he was going to Stepney-causeway; I parted with him, and he went on a little farther into a cornchandler's shop, he carried it up to the upper end of the shop, and I went in and asked the man of the shop if he bought such things as these? he said, no; the prisoner was there, he said, it was odd for the man to bring it in there; with that I told the black man to take it up again, and I intended to take him to the magistrate, he brought it out of the shop and threw it down in the street knot and all, and ran away; I pursued him and took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090095"></xptr>him; I had sight of him all the way; I desired the man to take it into the same cornchandler's shop; I left it in the street; I saw it again in three minutes; it has been in my care from that time to this.</p>
               <p>(Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Last Monday I was at work for this gentleman a little before dinner; I went down to go to dinner and went to the public house; after I had done my dinner I came out a little before four o'clock, I went up to see if Mr. Jackson was come from dinner, he was not; as I was coming down the lane, there was a gentleman standing up in the tail of a cart with the bag; says he, blacky do you want a job; says I, yes, but I have not got my knot; so I carried the bag into the public house till five o'clock; after that Mr. Jackson came from dinner, I went twice down and went backward, but I was not down three minutes any time; then I told him I had a little way to go, and by that time you have finished sewing these bags up, I will be back again, I told him I would be back in half an hour; he unlocked the door for me; when I came to the man, he says, my lad I have been waiting for you these ten minutes; says I, where am I to carry it to; to Stepney-causway, says he; what will you give me, says I; says he, 18 d. and he says, walk on it seems as if it would rain, and if it should, and you come to a grocer's shop in Rosemary-lane, pitch it down and stay there till I come; I went on and meant to pitch it there, and Mr. West came up and asked where I was going with the bag of pimento; I told him, I then stopped a while and did not see the man I had it of; I took the bag up and walked along a little, but did not see him, and did not notice the cornchandler's shop from the grocer's shop; I goes into the cornchandler's shop and throws it down; Mr. West made me take it up again; I thought it very hard to be taken with another man's property, so I thrown it down and made off, and he hallooed stop thief. I here is a good many can give me a character from the water side, but there is none here at present.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. On the whole he bears a very good character; I had a great opinion of him.</p>

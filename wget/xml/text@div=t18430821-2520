                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and live in Hoxton Old-town. On the 15th of August I left my jacket on the table where I lodged—I missed it the same evening—I went to the Britannia saloon in search of the prisoner the next day, and accused him of stealing it—he said if I would keep him from trouble and out of the policeman's hand, he would make the jacket right to me, and told me to go further up the street that the crowd should not know what was the matter—I walked up about half a mile, then stopped, and asked him about the jacket—he began at high words—the constable came up and asked what was the matter—he said there was nothing the matter—he then told me if I went up a little further he would tell me all—the jacket has never been found—after I gave him into the hands of the police he told something.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner came into my room and asked if the prosecutor, who is my brother, was at home—I said no—he took a book and began to read—I went into the next room—he was in the room two hoars—I afterwards heard him go—I then went into the room and missed the jacket off the table—there was no one in the room but my little sister—if any one else had come in I should have heard them.</p>

                  </hi>. I remember the prisoner coming on the 15th of August—he was there two hours—I went out of the room for two minutes, and when I came back the jacket was gone—I had put the book which I had been reading, on the jacket on the table—the book was still left—this was the prosecutor's jacket.</p>

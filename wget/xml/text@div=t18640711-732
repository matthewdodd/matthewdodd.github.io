                  </hi>. I keep the Timber Hoy inn, Deptford-creek-road—between 10 and 11 on Friday night, 10th June, I saw the prisoners—Lock came into my house, and asked for a glass of stout, which was two pence—he tendered a counterfeit shilling, I gave him change—I did not like the look of the shilling when I took it, but I was busy at the time, and I laid it on one side; when he had gone I looked at it again, and found it was a bad one—I put it in my pocket, and followed him; I saw him going up the right-hand side of the road, and when he got a little way up he made a noise with his mouth, and Johnson, the other prisoner, came across the road from a female to him. I then followed close after them, and they went into Mr. Mashin's house together, I went in; they had just called just called for half-a-quartern of gin, and Mr. Mashin was looking at a shilling which they had tendered for it, and talking to them about it—when I came in he sent for the police, and the prisoners were given in charge—I gave the shilling Lock had given me to the constable, Belcher, before I left Mr. Mashin's.</p>

               <p>barmaid took it, and said, "Is this a good one or a bad one?"—I said to the prisoners, "This is a bad shilling," and I think I made the observation, "This is not the first time you have been here"—they said they had not been there before—Lock wished me to give him the shilling back, and offered to pay me a good half-crown—Mr. Ford came in just about that time, and said, "Oh! these are the men, what have they been doing here?" I said, "They have just attempted to pass a bad shilling here"—he said, "They have just passed one at my house"—we then sent for a policeman, and gave the prisoners in charge—I bent the shilling they had uttered at my house, and gave it to the constable.</p>

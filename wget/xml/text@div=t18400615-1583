                  </hi>I live in the Strand—the prisoner was my errand boy—in consequence of suspicion, I marked 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3½<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the 14th of May—we had missed money on repeated occasions—we put the money on the drawers, and at night we missed it—we supposed the servant had taken it—we went and looked in the servant's box, and then went into the pri<lb></lb>soner's room, we found a box in which he put his things, and found in it a stock, and a pair of gloves—we came down and asked if he knew any thing of them—he said, "No"—I asked Mm if he knew of the money we missed—he said he did not—I asked him to take out the whole of his money—he did so—I said, "Is that all you have? "—he said, "You see, my pockets are turned inside out"—I said, "Allow me to see"—I felt in the corner of his waistcoat pocket, and found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more—I then looked over the money, and found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and¼<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which were marked, we found he had bought a pair of boots, and I said I would go and see if he had paid any marked money for them—in going up Drury-lane, he said, "I did not take any money, but I admit having taken the stock and gloves"—I said, "Did you take the money? "—he said, "Don't you think the other lad did it? "—I said, "No, I believe you have taken it"—I then gave him in charge, and when he came home he admitted taking the money—I made him no promise or threat—I told him there were other things I missed, if he would tell me about them, I would recommend him to mercy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Moseley, who keeps the Fortune of War public house in King's-road, Camden-town. On 16th March,' about ten minutes or a quarter to 10 o'clock in the evening, I came into the bar, and paw the prisoner there, drinking some brandy—my husband had served him—my husband left (he bar—the prisoner asked me the price of a bottle of the same brandy—I told him, and he left the house, saying he should very likely return for a bottle—he did return in about ten minutes, and I pre<lb></lb>pared a bottle for him—before I gave it him he tendered me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I asked, him his name and address—he said it was all right—I said, "You are a stranger to me, I require your name"—he again said it was all right, it was for Mr. King, the butcher, who is a neighbour, he lives in College-street, near us—my son had by that time entered the parlour, and I went and spoke to him, and showed him the note, leaving the prisoner at the bar—we then went to the bar to speak to the prisoner, but he was not there, he had left the house—I saw no more of him till he was brought back by my son and Mr. Tapp, nine or ten minutes after—my son said to me, "Mother, is this the party that produced this note?"—I said it was—the prisoner said, "You are lying under a mistake, I never was in your house before"—I took quite sufficient notice of him while he was in the house to recognise him again—I knew him instantly—I had given him no change.</p>

                  </hi>. I assist my father and mother. On Thursday evening, 16th March, I was in the skittle ground, and was sent for by my mother about 10 o'clock, or a few minutes after—I went into the bar parlour—I saw two persons at the bar, Mr. Tapp, a neighbour, was one; I could not swear to the prisoner being the other, I should imagine he is the man by his size; I believe he is—my mother handed me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note; I looked at it, and thought at once it was a bad one—I went to the bar and then found only Mr. Tapp there—I then went outside the outer door, and saw the prisoner standing outside—I said to him, "You want change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note I believe; if you will wait I will get it you?" he made no answer—I am, quite, sure the prisoner, is the man I saw outside—I returned in. doors to Mr. Tapp, and requested him to keep his eye upon the prisoner—I then returned to the, skittle ground with the, note in my hand,; I returned to the house again in about; two minutes; I saw Mr. Tapp at the bar, and we went out together—we, went up the King's-road, and into Georgiana-street; and when we came to the gateway of Mr. Ingram's yard, Mr. Tapp turned down the gateway, I went on further to, the corner of the next street</p>

               <p>—I then returned; and as I passed Ingram's yard, Mr. Tapp called me—I went down the gateway, and found him talking to the prisoner—he said, "Here is the man"—I asked the prisoner if he would walk back to the Fortune of War with me, he said, "Yes"—he went without any hesitation—when we got there I asked my mother if that was the man that gave her the note—she said, "Yes;" the prisoner said it was estate wrong, he had never been in the house before; I then sent for the officer, Woodrow—I kept the note in my hand all the time—I accompanied the officer with the prisoner to the station, and there put my name on the note—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a broker, of No. 27, Pratt-street, Camden-town. On 16th March, I was at the Fortune of War, about 10 o'clock in the evening; I sow the prisoner there—I did not know him before—Mrs. Moseley and her son came in, the son had a piece of paper in his hand—the prisoner had then left the bar—Mr. Moseley said something to me, and went into the skittle ground—in consequence of what he said to me, I watched the prisoner; he ran into a neighbour's yard in Georgiana-street, at least he walked at a mid<lb></lb>dling pace—I walked down the yard to him—Mr. Moseley came to me—the prisoner was round the corner of the yard, behind a dead wall; I asked him what he was doing, he said he was down there for his own convenience—I asked him to be kind enough to step along, with me, and he refused to do so—I told him he had no business down there, that he was a trespasser on the property of a neighbour of mine—he said to hoped he was doing no harm—Mr. Moseley came up, I asked him if this was not the man that was in front of the bar, and he said it was—Mr. Moseley asked him to step along with us, and he did so—when we got to the house, Mr. Moseley said to his mother, "Is this the man that gave you the note?" she said, "Yes; it is"—a policeman was then sent for, and the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

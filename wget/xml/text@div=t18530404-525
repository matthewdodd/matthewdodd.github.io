                  </hi>. I am agent to Mr. George Hallet, a sulphuric acid manufacturer, of Rotherhithe. On Tuesday morning, 29th March, I missed some sheet lead from the carpenter's shop, which I had seen safe on the Saturday night previous; it was about three feet square, and weighed about 60 lbs.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is part of the piece that it was cut off, and here is another piece which corresponds with it—it is cut quite uneven, and the unevenness corresponds, as well as the mill work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Jones; we live in Sarah place, Rotherhithe. On Tuesday morning I was looking out of my bedroom window shortly after 9 o'clock, and saw the prisoner, who I did not know before, place a basket on the bridge, which was hardly a stone's throw off—I then closed my window, and saw him kick the basket, and throw it into a pond—I went out, and said, "You are young Wright?" he said, "Yes"—I said, "You have thrown the basket into the pond"—he said, yes, he knew he had, was it anything to do with me—I turned, and walked away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lamplighter of Rotherhithe. I saw the basket in the pond, and a little boy trying to get it out with a stick—I pulled it out; it had this lead in it—this is it—I took it to the station, and left it.</p>

I was at the station when the prisoner was brought—Mrs. Jones afterwards saw him there—I said I supposed he did not think he was seen; he said it was of no use denying it, he knew that he took it, and a woman who knew him saw him throw it into the water—he afterwards said he took it from the waste water-pipes which were lying in the street.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>YOU only have one man in the passage? - No, and that was Williamson; I lost sight of him about a minute, he ran away, it was light but not moon-light, there is a vacancy comes into the middle of the passage and gives light.</p>
               <p>What from the heavens? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If it is dark in the street it must be dark then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which way was the man's face when he dropped from the window? - Towards the window, I saw him on the ground and looked at his face.</p>
               <p>Court to Taylor. Were the sashes in the first floor shut or open? - I believe they were open.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was sitting at home in Holywell-street, in the evening, I heard cry of stop thief, I ran down stairs, and saw a person running on the other side the street, crying out stop thief, I saw Wimckle look frightened and cry stop thief, I caught him, not seeing anybody else, he said he was running after the thieves, I told him as I saw nobody else I should stop him; I should have let him go soon after, but he plunged out of my hands and fell in the kennel, I clapped my knee upon him and then struck him or pushed him, I know not which, there was a person stood by said, well done, sir, says I, why the devil do not you take hold of him, then he assisted me, I do not know him, he lives in our street, I saw the boy, Taylor, soon after, in a few minutes he said, that is the man, we took him to the Watch-house.</p>
               <p>JAMES TALBOYS sworn.</p>
               <p>At half past eleven o'clock I searched M'Carty, and found nothing on him, in searching Williamson, alias Wimckle, I found this property, most in his breeches, but some in his pockets, and this picklock key.</p>
               <p>(The things produced and owned by the Prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Pinder. I believe these buckles are only of the value of old silver if they were to be disposed of? - I cannot call them old silver.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jones does, is he here? - No.</p>
               <p>You do not know what they weigh? - No, sir, I gave 45 s. for them.</p>
               <p>I do not dispute it, I say if they were to be sold? - I do not want to sell them.</p>
               <p>I know that you have put a value on them as old buckles, that is your idea of them, now the plated buckles, I believe, old plated buckles, are not worth eighteen pence a pair? - I do not call them old.</p>
               <p>But I do? - I know them to be new.</p>
               <p>You know you had such sort of things as these? - People that have things in common use they commonly know them, I know my hat from another, I should know those two hats that I lost if I could see them, they were worth twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>You do not know what became of these hats, sir? - No, I wish I did, sir.</p>

               <p>Court. There is no evidence respecting Mills, as to burglary, the law considers it of so high a nature, that if no property is stole, it is still a capital offence, if committed with a felonious intention; here the charge is of a complicated nature, and the general indictment for a burglary, involves in it several lesser charges; it charges the breaking and entering the dwelling-house in the night, and stealing in the house goods of a certain value, so that on that indictment, the verdict of a jury may be found five different ways, you may find them generally guilty, which includes the whole of the offence, the breaking and entering in the night, and stealing the property, or you may find them not guilty of breaking and entering the house, but guilty of stealing in the dwell-house, to the value of forty shillings, or under forty shillings, or you may find them guilty of stealing but not in the dwelling-house, nor of the breaking and entering but of the single felony only, or you may generally acquit them; in this case the first that of the burglary is not supported, because there must be breaking as well as entering; it is clearly held to be law, that if persons get in at an open door, or window, though there is an entering of the house, there is no breaking to constitute the burglary to find them guilty, there must be actual proof that the doors and windows were shut; I think you must clearly acquit both the prisoners of the burglary; if they are guilty of stealing at all, there can be no doubt that it was stolen in the dwelling-house from the circumstance of the case, if you find it forty shillings or upwards it will be capital.</p>

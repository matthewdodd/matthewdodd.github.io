I keep the Rose and Crown, Acorn Street, Camberwell, about 150 yards from the British Queen—on Saturday evening, 16th June, between seven and eight, the prisoners came there together, and asked for a pint of half-and-half—the female gave me a bad shilling in payment—I gave her the change, but kept the shilling in my hand—somebody called my attention aside, and when I looked again Sanders had pulled the till open and got his hand in—I told him of it—his mother, the female prisoner, said, "What is he doing?"—I said, "Trying to rob my till," and then I said, "You have given a bad shilling, and are not satisfied without trying to rob my till"—I discovered it was bad before I let it out of my hand—she offered me a good one for it, but I refused—they went out—I told two or three men to follow them, and I went to look for a policeman—I found one and gave the boy in custody for trying to rob my till—the female was walking by his side at the time—as the boy was being taken along I saw him put his hand in his breast pocket and drop a black bag not half a yard behind him—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I picked it up and gave it to the constable, and the shilling I gave to the inspector at the station.</p>

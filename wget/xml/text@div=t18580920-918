I was in my own house on this night, and heard a disturbance in the street—I ran out in my shirt sleeves, and saw Thompson, who was very drunk, and was going to fight everybody—Frusk tried to persuade him to go away quietly, as he wanted to go to sleep—Thompson immediately set on him, and said, "I don't care, I can <hi rend="italic">leather</hi> forty b—policemen," and immediately began to fight—Frusk was attacked by three or four of them—I went up and said to one of them, "You had better not interfere with the constable"—Thompson immediately seized my finger in his mouth, kept it there three or four minutes, bit it quite to the bone, and tore the nail quite off—I requested Frusk to take out his truncheon, and said, "For God's sake, hit him on his head," and he then opened his teeth and let go of my finger—he then kicked me by my thigh, but it missed me, only grazing it—I was immediately thrown to the ground by seven or eight of them—they were all on the top of me—just about that time Neale came up, kicked me once on the shoulder, and struck me with his fist on the chest—I am sure he is the man—I was assisted by Frusk—I got up, and we had brickbats, stones, and glass bottles thrown at us; they were flung about in all directions—we went on some little distance—there were 200 or 300 people round the two of us, and we were attacked again by Fitzgerald and Sheen—there were quite 200 people when I came out of my house—my shirt was torn—it was all gone but the waist-band.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Knott's-terrace, Tanner-hill. On 7th August, between half-past 12 and 1 o'clock, I heard a disturbance; went out and saw Neale running down from his own place; he lives in Knott's-terrace also—that is not far from where the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was—he did not stop there; but one policeman told another to take a woman in custody—he struck the woman across the shoulders three times, and a man ran up and hit the policeman, and knocked him down, and he struck John Neale with staff—Neale used no violence to the police; he stood with his hands at his sides—I am sure I saw another man knock the policeman down, and kick him—there was not much crowd going down.</p>

                  </hi>. The first thing I saw was Neale being taken to the station; his face was covered with blood—there was a noise, but I did not go there; they were hallooing out, "Murder!"—I did not hear cries of "Shame!"—I saw Thompson, and then I said, "Is that you, <hi rend="italic">Johnny</hi> Neale?"—he said, "Yes;" and the policeman hit him across the nose with a staff, and attempted to strike me.</p>

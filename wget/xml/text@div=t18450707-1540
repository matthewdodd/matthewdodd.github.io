                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live in High-st., Shoreditch—the prisoner was in my employ a year and ten months—he boarded and lodged in the house—he was entrusted to receive money—on Monday, the 16th of June, Jane Whatley called me, and said in the prisoner's presence, that he had taken 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that he had received from a customer, and put it into his pocket—he said, "I believe 1 have taken it, I hope you will forgive me, I am very sorry for it, I will endeavour to do better"—I said that after what had occurred in Jan. last I certainly should not think of looking over it, but I should prosecute him for it—he begged me to forgive him for the sake of his mother—I went to his mother's in the evening—I let him continue in my service till the Wednesday morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live with the prosecutor—on Mon<lb></lb>day, the 16th of June, I was in the shop and saw two ladies come in—the prisoner served them with some thread lace—I was not near enough to we what the price was—I saw what the ladies gave him—it was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a six<lb></lb>pence, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he put the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the recess behind, where we usually place money when Mr. or Mrs. Noble were engaged, or out of the way, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I saw him put into his right hand trowsers-pocket—as soou as the customers were gone there was no one remaining but him and me, and I directly accused him of having put the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into his pocket—he denied It—I called Mr. Noble and accused him before him—he then begged Mr. Noble to forgive him, and he would try to do better—Mr. Noble said that after what had occurred in Jan. he should not think of forgiving him, he should prosecute him, and I said it was not the first time I had seen him do it—the prisoner then said ho had taken altogether about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper, and live in High-street, Peckham. the prisoner was in my service for two years, within four days—she was a milliner-Moody told me something on the 7th of July—I went to his house and found a brown paper parcel containing three yards of linen-cloth, and the other articles stated in this indictment—these are them—I can swear to all but the flowers, the net and three remnants of ribbon—this gimp is a pattern that we had at the time, and we have missed such—I then made out an account of articles which the prisoner had had, and gave it to her—I asked her if she had had any other articles to enter, either herself, or from any other person—she told me she had not—that she had entered everything up—I asked her to read over the bill</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184608170224"></xptr>
               <p>in my presence—which she did, and she said she had no doubt that bill was correct, she had no other articles to enter—I then asked her if she had purchased any gimp—she told me she had had six yards of gimp that morning—I said, "Then show it to me"—she said it was on her polka—I asked her to show it me, and then she said it was not on her polka, she had sent it away—she had no business with these articles.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the value of the whole of these articles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she was at liberty to have articles if they were properly entered—she could not serve herself—she ought to have gone to a second party to have got the goods, and had them properly entered—she might go to any other party, or to myself—she had been in my service about four days short of two years—I think she became of age about a week after she was taken—I did not pay her any salary—she was an improver or apprentice, articled for two years as an improver, without salary—before I put this question to her, Moody had told me that he had seen her take a piece of silk out of the shop that morning—I only know her sister—I had a cha<lb></lb>racter with the prisoner—I felt it my duty to prosecute her.</p>

I went out this Day fortnight, between one and two, in the Middle of the Day; when I came home, the House was broke open. I came in at the Fore-Door , the Lock made a great Noise, and he run out at the Back-Door. I am sure the Back-Door was fastened both with Pin and Bolt, when I went out; I followed him, and found the Things in my Way; these are the Things. I followed such a Man in a red Coat out of the House at a great Distance. I did not see any Body throw them down. - It was a Back Window that was broke open; he had taken the Glass out, there was just Room enough for him to get in, when his Coat was off; these are my Husband's Goods that I picked up by the Way, as I followed him; my Husband's Shoes were dropped before the other Things. All these that were in the Bag were together.</p>

I found him in one Place, and his Coat in another, he was lying under a Bush in a Ditch, and his Coat was about 2 Yards from him: I did not charge him, but I told him I believed he was the Man I wanted.

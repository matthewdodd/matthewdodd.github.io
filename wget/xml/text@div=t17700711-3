They had broke six locks, and I lost a small looking-glass; to the best of my remembrance there were seventeen guineas.

            , in Mutton-lane, about twelve o'clock. Slight and Jones were just gone from there; we found this tea-chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took them?</p>
               <p>Lee. A brother officer took them in Clerkenwell. I found the pocket-book before we went to search this room. The accomplice went with me to shew me the house he had broke open. I think he went with me to the place where the pocket-book was.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Can you swear that tea-chest is your property?</p>
               <p>Parker. I can; I have had it thirty years. I can also swear to the spectacles and the glass.</p>
               <p>- Blower. I am a watchman; I watch at the watch-house on Clerkenwell Green. On the 12th of June, about two o'clock in the morning, I saw three men, Jones was the first; the next was Slight, alias Holtham; and the last was Price; they were walking one after another, and talking together. I knew Holtham, alias Slight, some years ago. I never saw Jones before, as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know Price?</p>
               <p>Blower. He had a scarlet waistcoat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see them?</p>
               <p>Blower. Opposite the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Mrs. Parker's house?</p>
               <p>Blower. Almost a mile. I pursued them all three.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to pursue them?</p>
               <p>Blower. I knew Slight to be one of the wrong sort. They were all three loaded with goods under their left arm. I took Price with this looking-glass. I threatned to cut him down; I had a cutlass. He begged for mercy. I told him, he should have it if he behaved well. I found a steel spectacle-case, with spectacles in it, a box, with some pins in it, and a pair of gloves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to search Slight's lodgings?</p>
               <p>Blower. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Pinnock's room, did you find any thing there?</p>
               <p>Blower. Yes, a tea-chest, another looking-glass, a dark lanthorn, and a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon might you pursue them, after they had passed the watch-house?</p>
               <p>Blower. They had just got a-breast of the watch-house when I attacked them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think Jones was one of them?</p>
               <p>Blower. I do; he had the same clothes on when my brother constable took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he dressed the same as when you pursued him?</p>
               <p>Blower. He had the same hat and clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a man of the same size and make?</p>
               <p>Blower. Yes, he is. I am sure Slight was one, and I believe Jones was another.</p>

               <p>Q. How was the window fastened?</p>

               <p>Cohen. The window-shutter was bolted and the window shut down; the window-shutter was on the outside the window, and bolted within.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bolt pulled back, or wrenched off?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Slight and Jones?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. Yes, I have seen them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they not lodge at your house?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. Nobody lodged in the room with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing either of them at your room in the month of June?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. Neither of them, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that tea-chest in your room?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110005"></xptr>Pinnock. Two young men and William Price brought it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know them?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. Yes, I should if I saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners at the bar; are they, or either of them, the men?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. No, neither of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be acquainted with them?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. I have seen them at Field-Lane, a drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of the prisoners been at your house within twenty-four hours before the tea-chest was found there?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. No; if they were, I was asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they not a liberty to resort to your house when they pleased?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. Many people resorted to my house. I am an unfortunate girl of the town; I did not see them at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. Was you drinking with the prisoners in Field-Lane?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. I was not drinking with them more than with other people.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the dark lanthorn belong to you?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. It was in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought it to your house?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. I bought it at Hockley-in-the-hole; the knife was brought in by Price.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time of the night or day were they brought into your room?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. That is impossible: you say, you recollect its being brought in by Price and two men; you must know whether it was day or night?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. It was in the night; I was in bed, they waked me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it ago?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a quarter or half a year ago?</p>

               <p>Pinnock. It was not so long ago as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a month ago?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. It may be, very likely.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know who the men were?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. I should know them if I saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. Price said he had got more goods; he was going out, and would come back again.</p>

            , and myself, agreed to go out and rob; we attempted several houses in Islington. We were disturbed at one house, and we broke open none but Mrs. Parker's house that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get into Mrs. Parker's house?</p>
               <p>Price. By forcing open the shutter; we put a chissel to the shutter, and then forced it open with a crow.</p>
               <p>Q. Do inform the court what method you take to force open a window?</p>
               <p>Price. If there is any place we can get a chissel in at, we make a little room, and then we put in the crow, which has such power, that it will force any window open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open this window that way ?</p>
               <p>Price. Jones and Slight broke it open that way.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it?</p>
               <p>Price. Between one and two o'clock. I was without side, to give notice if any body came. They gave me a tea-chest and this looking-glass, and a cannister full of sugar; that was all they gave me at that time. I was sent in afterwards, and I brought out two coloured aprons and several other things, and a bottle of brandy or rum.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any money?</p>
               <p>Price. There might be money, I did not see any of it. There were two or three check aprons, and this pair of gloves, and I took the spectacles; this book was thrown over the bank.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That is my book; my name is in it.</p>
               <p>Q. to the constable. Did you find the book where the prisoner directed you?</p>
               <p>Lee. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Price. Where did you go afterwards?</p>
               <p>Price. We came down a narrow path, and so across Clerkenwell-Green. I had a glass under my arm, a bottle of brandy in my pocket, and they a handkerchief tyed up, with some of the things in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had both of them things under their arms?</p>
               <p>Price. No; only one had the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you pursued by the watchman?</p>
               <p>Price. Yes, and I was taken by him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Jones dressed in?</p>

               <p>Price. She was kept by Slight; I have known Jones frequently lie there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you yourself ever been with him there?</p>
               <p>Price. I was in the same room with them once or twice; I saw them take a dark lanthorn there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Pinnock's that night all of you?</p>
               <p>Price. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she up when you got there?</p>
               <p>Price. I can't be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Slight generally lodge there?</p>
               <p>Price. He always kept her company; I can't say he lodged there.</p>
               <p>Q. to Blower. How soon did you see Jones after he was taken?</p>
               <p>Blower. About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a coat on or no?</p>

               <p>Blower. He had a coat on then; when they saw me a coming up to them, they turned round short.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a coat on when he passed you?</p>
               <p>Blower. I am certain he had a red waistcoat on; I will not be positive whether he had a coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not the next day?</p>
               <p>Blower. The next day at two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. It struck you that he was the same man from his dress, did it?</p>
               <p>Blower. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a coat on then?</p>
               <p>Blower. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of his dress struck you at that time?</p>
               <p>Blower. A red waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lee. What constable was it that took Slight and Jones?</p>
               <p>Lee. They ran away from me, and a brother constable, Mr. Bishop, took them.</p>
               <p>Q. from Jones to Price. Did you ever see me break open any house in your life?</p>
               <p>Price. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where?</p>
               <p>Price. The house of Mr. Mott, at Ball's pond, and he also helped to break open Mrs. Parker's house.</p>
               <p>Q. from Slight. Did you ever see me break open any house?</p>
               <p>Price. Yes, Mr. Mott's and Mrs. Parker's. I had only been with them seventeen days when I was taken.</p>

            . I am a constable. Mr. Rooper came to my house, and said Slight and Jones were gone by at the top of our street; I desired they would pursue them immediately; I also joined them. We overtook them, I believe, in the space of a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they running?</p>
               <p>Bishop. They were making the best of their way; they every now and then turned round, and one had a knife in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them?</p>
               <p>Bishop. Holtham, alias Slight, I believe.</p>
               <p>Slight. That knife I cut my bread and cheese with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them make any resistance when you took them?</p>
               <p>Bishop. Slight was taken first; Jones jumped over a ditch. Mr. Rooper bid him come back, which he did, and he took him. We took them to Bridewell, there we searched them; there was nothing found upon them. The keeper of the prison took a piece of linen out of Slight's pocket, which Mr. Mott claimed.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said you were concerned with them in breaking open Mott's house.</p>

My house was broke open on the 11th of June in the night; the window was fastened over night, with a bolt in the inside. When they got into that room, they could not get into any other part of the house without going out of that room, and breaking in afresh. It was a very windy night; there were large trees before the house, and we heard a noise, but thought it was the wind among the trees. When I got up at six in the morning, I found the window with the bolt broke, and the staple wrenched off; the drawers were taken out of the bureau, and laid some in one place and some in another. There were six locks to the bureau, which were broke; there was a closet at the upper-end of the room; they could not break the lock open, so they broke the pannel of the door; they took the wine from that closet. I lost a great many other things besides those mentioned in the indictment; they were taken up, I believe, on the Wednesday following.</p>

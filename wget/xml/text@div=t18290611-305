            . I am a painter, and live in Holywell-street, Shoreditch. Between eight and nine o'clock in the evening of the 4th of June, I was in Shoreditch, and saw three people together; I do not know who they were, but they went to Mrs. Wilkinson's shop, and took a bag of coffee - they went with it to a chandler's shop at the hack of Shoreditch-church; I went and told Mrs. Wilkinson's people of it - they went to Worship-street; the last witness is her foreman - the officer found the coffee on the stairs.</p>
               <p>JAMES OSMOND PHILPOT. I belong to Bow-street. On the night of the 4th of June, I went near the Loggerheads public-house, and saw the prisoner come from his own house, which is near there; I went after him, down a passage, took him by the arm, and said I wanted him - I took him to his own house, and asked if he was the owner of it; he said, Yes - I said I had suspicion there was some stolen property concealed there; he said he knew nothing about any - I went with him into the back room, and shut the door; I searched, and in about a quarter of an hour, I found the bag of coffee about half way up the stairs - I believe Best was at the door, or in the shop; it is a chandler's shop, at the back of Shoreditch-church - I took the coffee to Worship-street, where the foreman owned it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The prisoner is married? A. I do not know; I saw a person I understood was his wife - I believe my expression to the prisoner was "Stolen goods," but I allnded to the coffee; he said he had no stolen goods that he knew of in the house.</p>
               <p>JOHN BEST re-examined Q. Did you say you saw some persons take some coffee from Mrs. Wilkinson's to a shop at the back of Shoreditch-church? A. Yes - it was about half-past eight o'clock, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the prisoner at that time? A. No, Sir, I cannot positively say I did; there was some one in the shop - there was a woman there, but no man except the one that took the coffee; Mr. Wilkinson's two shopmen were in the shop; I did not observe any other persons - I was before the Magistrate on Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q.And now you state you did not observe any body else? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to the Magistrate - the same as you have now? A. Yes, Sir, to the best of my recollection; I saw a woman in the prisoner's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. No man? A. Not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you recollect whether there was or not? A. I believe not, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you do not recollect seeing any man but the shopmen and the thieves in Mrs. Wilkinson's shop. and no men but the thieves in the prisoner's shop? A. No.</p>
               <p>RICHARD FICKRIDGE. I am a Bow-street patrol. I went with Philpot to a house that I have understood since is Mr. Cauch's, in Virginia-row - the prisoner was there, without his coat, and his shirt sleeves tucked up; I asked him for half a pint of small beer, which I paid him for, and he said it was right; I turned to speak to my conductor, and the prisoner rushed by me, and ran up a passage - I ran and caught him by the right arm, and said, "This won't do;" I handed him to Philpot. and I stood there while my conductor and Philpot went to search the house; in twenty minutes I was called into the house, and there was this bag of coffee and a roll of cloth; I took the coffee, and Philpot took the cloth - the prisoner was gone then; he went out while I stood in the passage - the next morning I took him at the toll-bar near Shoreditch church.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did you look into the shop? A. Yes, when I had information from Best; I saw the coffee in a bag that night, but not in the same bag it had been in; I believe it was Philpot showed it me- I did not go up stairs; it was brought down: this is the bag the coffee was in, not this bag; this is Mrs. Wilkinson's bag.</p>

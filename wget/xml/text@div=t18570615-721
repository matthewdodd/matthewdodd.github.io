               <p>Square, Minories. I know the prisoner—he was formerly in their employ<lb></lb>ment, going out with a cart—he has left from nine to twelve months—on Tuesday, 5th May, I went out with the van, delivering goods, from Haydon Square warehouse, at about half past 2 o'clock in the afternoon—I had a lad named Dicks with me—I had, among other things, to deliver a box for Morrison, Dillon, and Co., of Fore Street—as I went out I saw the prisoner sitting against the gate—he asked me where I was going—I said, "Into the City"—he said nothing about getting into the van, and I drove on to my first place, in Houndsditch—on stopping there, I turned round, and saw the prisoner in the hind part of the van, with Dicks—I took no notice, but went on to several other places delivering goods, and at the end of Alderman<lb></lb>bury, Dicks gave me a parcel to deliver in Fore Street—the prisoner asked me if he should take it to Messrs. Morrison's, and deliver it for me, and then I could call and get the signature—I said, "Yes"—I had not observed him interfering with the box, but when the boy was giving it on to his shoulder I noticed a breakage in it, which I had not noticed before—I saw no more of the prisoner after that till he was in custody—I called at Messrs. Morrison's about three minutes afterwards, but heard nothing of him or the box, and they refused to sign my book.</p>

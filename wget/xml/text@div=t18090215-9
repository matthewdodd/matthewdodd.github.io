            . I am shopman to Mr. Cole. On the 4th of February I saw the prisoners come into the shop; they asked for half a yard of long lawn; after I had shewed them that, I shewed them some worked muslins, I then shewed them some plain muslins, they bought the eighth of a yard at four shillings a yard, and then went away. Having lost muslins before, it induced me to number the pieces, and put it down on the wrapper; after they were gone out I counted the pieces, I found a piece missing, I told Mr. Cole; I followed them and brought them back; when they came in the shop I saw

There were seventeen pieces in the wrapper when I counted it before, and when they they were gone there were only sixteen. I examined that particular piece that day, before they came in.</p>

I am cashier to Lynch and Co., 171a, Aldersgate Street, wholesale druggists' sundriesmen—the warehouse is in Trinity Court—on Saturday, 8th March, I closed the premises at 2.20, and was the last clerk on the premises—I locked the safe and my desks in my office and the strong-room—there were no marks on the strong-room door, the locks were in perfect order, and the doors were safe—there were valuable securities in the safe—I went back on Monday morning at 9 o'clock, and found my desk broken open, and these three pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) broken off the safe, but they had not succeeded in opening it—this is a fourth piece which was broken off—the strong-room was open, and a piece was broken off the door, but there were no marks on it—there were no valuables there, except the safe and the ledgers—the key hung in my office—the prisoner was in the employ about four months in 1877, and again afterwards—he was discharged a fortnight previous to this—the safe was on the floor which he was employed on—he was assistant to the stock-keeper—we keep such tobacco pouches as these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but there is no mark on them—when I left there was nothing to lock but the outer doors.</p>

I am stock-keeper to Lynch and Co., and the prisoner had been assisting me for a fortnight or three weeks previous to this burglary—on Saturday, 8th March, I left the warehouse about 2.45—I was not the last person there—I saw the prisoner opposite the premises and spoke to him at the bottom of Trinity Court in Aldersgate Street for three or four minutes—that was 20 or 30 yards from the door of the premises—I went up the court to get some keys, and locked up a truck which was standing there, went into the warehouse, hung the keys up—I saw the prisoner follow me nearly to the warehouse door—I went down to put my hat and coat on, and when I came back I missed him—I do not say that he went inside the warehouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a packer in the employ of Lynch and Co.—I was the last person to leave the warehouse that Saturday—I left at 2.50 p.m.—the doors and windows were all locked—there are two cellar-flaps in front of the warehouse; I locked one inside and one outside—the keys of the com<lb></lb>municating doors of the warehouse hung up in the warehouse—I went there on Sunday morning at 10 o'clock, in consequence of a communication made to me, and found one of the cellar-flaps open and a desk in the strong-room broken open, the strong-room door broken open, and the safe tampered with. Cross-examined. I do not know that you did anything wrong while you worked there—I saw you outside on this Saturday, and asked you what you were doing—10 minutes after I locked up, and I think you said that you were at work for your brother-in-law.</p>

               <p>the 26th of Feb. I was going down Distaff-lane about a quarter to seven o'clock, and noticed the prosecutor's shop door five or six inches open—I saw it gently closing from the inside—I stood at the corner next to Old Change for about ten minutes, and then saw Reeves come out with something under her cloak, I followed her up Distaff-lane into Friday-street, round St. Paul's-churchyard, to Ludgate-hill—I there asked what she had got—she said, "I have got some beef"—I said, "Where have you brought them from?"—she said, "From No. 24, King William-street"—I said, "I mutt detain you, I know where you have come from"—I asked if she had been anywhere else with them—she said, "No"—I found a piece of mutton, beef, and pork, a bottle of beer, a jar of dripping, a piece of suet, some potatoes, a bundle of wood, and the cloths the meat was wrapped in—I took her in charge then—I went to the station, left her there, and went to inform Mr. Pocklington—it was then about half-past seven—when I got to the door Parsons was going up Distaff-lane with her clothes in two bundles—I took her into cus<lb></lb>tody, and told her she must go with me—she appeared as if she was leaving her situation—I cannot say that she was at home when Reeves came out of the shop.</p>

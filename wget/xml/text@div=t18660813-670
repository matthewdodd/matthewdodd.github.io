On Saturday, 7th July, at half-past two in the afternoon, I was on duty in Houndsditch, and noticed the two prisoners—I followed them through several streets, through Bevis Marks, St. Mary Axe, to Fenchurch Street; in Fenchurch Street I saw Giffard hand something to Lyons—just outside the door of 186 1/2, Fenchurch Street, a tea dealer's, she handed a basket to the male prisoner which she was carrying—it is here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she then went into the tea dealer's—Giffard crossed the road, saw me, went round the corner, and ran away—when the female came out of the shop I went in—I saw this five-shilling piece—when she came out she went over to the corner where the male prisoner went round—I went over to her and told her she had been to 186 1/2, Holliday's, the tea dealer's, and passed a bad five-shilling piece—she said she had not been there—I took her back to the shop, and the shopman identified her—she had the tea in her possession—I took her to the station, where she was searched—while there Giffard was brought in—he was charged with her—I said, "This is the man who was with her"—he said he didn't know anything about it—Lyons denied having been with him—I found 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 41/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—Lyons was searched by the female searcher—a half-sovereign, four shillings, and three halfpence were found on her—I don't know whether there is any mark in this purse—Giffard said he had never seen Lyons.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Hounslow—on 9th October, Miss Gasner was brought to my surgery by her mother—I examined the wound, and found a shot about half an inch from where it had entered, it had traversed along the plate of the bone—I extracted it—I afterwards examined the garden wall—I found six or seven little aper<lb></lb>tures where shots had entered, in about the position where Miss Gasner said she was standing with her back against the wall—consequently the shot must have entered in front—it was flattened by striking the bone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Look at that model (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is that correct? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, the window is wrongly placed, it should be on the other side—this is the shot I extracted—it is slightly indented—it might have been so indented by striking against a wall, and it might become indented by hitting the bone of the temple—the bone of a child of Miss Gasner's age would not be soft—if the shot was fired point blank it might glance off the bone, it would not of necessity penetrate—if he aimed straight I should expect to find more than one shot penetrate—I should say it was not a rebound.</p>

On 10th October, I went to Mrs. Gasner's garden, and examined the wall—the spot was pointed out to me where the little girl was standing—this model is not correct—I found shot marks on the bottom wall, rather more than four feet from the ground, and about three yards from the party wall of Mr. Lugar's garden ground—the shots appeared to have scattered—I measured the distance from that spot to Mr. Lugur's window, it was about nineteen yards—I went several times to the prisoner's house before I could get admission—I received this gun from his housekeeper on the Wednesday following—it is not an air gun, it is a common trigger gun—I have tried it since, it is a very good one—it had been recently used, the nipple was quite black—I found four shots on the path on examining the ground.</p>

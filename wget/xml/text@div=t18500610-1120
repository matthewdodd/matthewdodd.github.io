                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Francis Gorham, a watch-maker in High-street, Kensington. On 18th Feb., the prisoner came to the shop dressed in a very gentlemanly way, and he had moustachios—he pre<lb></lb>tended</p>

               <p>to be a Frenchman—he wished to see something which I did not understand—he asked if I understood French—I took a case from the window, and showed it him—he said, "No, no"—I put the case in the window again, and while I did so, he came round the counter to show me what he wanted—he pointed to a chronometer in the window—I told him the price was thirty-five guineas—he made signs for me to write it down, and I did so—he then said the captain would call—there was a boy in the shop, and he asked for the boy to come with him, and he would show him where he lived in the town—I gave him a card, and he went away—the boy went with him, and returned in seven or eight minutes, and brought a card which the prisoner had given him of Mr. Curtis'—I looked about our shop, and missed a gold watch, worth about five guineas—it had been brought on the Saturday, and I had seen it two or three times on the Monday, the day the prisoner came—I went to Mr. Curtis' after the prisoner—I found he did not live there—the watch had been hanging on the partition of the shop—the prisoner, was within six inches of that place while he was pointing to the window with his right-hand—from the last time I saw the watch safe, no one had been in the shop but myself, the shop-boy, and the prisoner—I saw the prisoner again at the House of Detention, a fortnight or three weeks ago, and knew him at once—he had not moustachios then, but I picked him out from half a dozen others by his features.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shop-boy to Mr. Gorham. I was in the shop on 18th Feb.—I believe the prisoner it the person who came, but he was then dressed very respectably, and had moustachios, to all appearance a gentleman—I remember his going behind the counter and pointing with his right-hand to a chronometer—there was a glass-case, in which there were watches—his left-hand was near the case while he was pointing to the chro<lb></lb>nometer—he had a card of the shop given him—he spoke broken English—he had a deal of action, and made out his meaning partly by signs—I went with him to Mr. Curtis's—he told me to remain outside—he went in, and came out, and brought me a card of Mr. Curtis's—he said he lived in the sixth room, and his name was Farquhar.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a draper's shop, in Kensington. The last witness came to my shop with a man about the prisoner's height, about six o'clock in the evening—the man asked for a card of the shop, and knowing the boy, I gave it him—the man had moustachios—the prisoner never occu<lb></lb>pied a room in my house.</p>

I am a labourer, of 12, Crispin-street, Bethnal-Green—I am sorry to say that I am the prisoner's father—he does not live with me, but my daughter does—on 15th December he came into my sitting-room—my wife and daughter were present—I asked him what he wanted—he said, "You old b—, I will knock your brains out; turn that b—out"—that was my daughter—he went into the back garden, and came back armed with this pickaxe handle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and swore he would dash my brains out—he held it in this way, and I closed with him, and got the stick away, but he got me down and struck me on the head with it, saying, "I will kill you; I will knock your brains out; I will be hung at Newgate for you and your daughter"—my wife ran into the street and screamed "Murder," and as I got up the prisoner struck me on the mouth with his fist—I think it was a policeman who dragged him off me, or the neighbours, I do not know which.</p>

I am a physician and surgeon, of 2, Spital-square—I was called to the police-station last Sunday, and found the prosecutor there, with a lacerated wound on the scalp, about an inch and a quarter long—the tissues were broken up right down to the bone, and the bone was exposed for half an inch square—a stick like this would produce such a wound—it was a dangerous part for a person to be struck in, by a strong muscular young man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 90). I was called by the daughter, and saw the prosecutor outside the door, bleeding from the head—I went into the backroom, and found the prisoner standing there talking to two men, and asked him why he struck his father—he said, "Because my brother had a large knife that he was going to use upon me."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went home, and my father asked me what I wanted. I said, "What is that to do with you; all I want is some clean things." He said, "You b—, I have got you here, and I mean to pay you;" and he stood up to fight me. I laughed at him, and went into the back yard. My father came with a poker, and my brother with a dagger-knife eight inches long, and said, "If you attempt to touch my father I will run it into you." I went to a man who keeps a butter shop and said, "What am I to do?" He said, "It is a family affair; I will have nothing to do with it" I went in, and was struck a blow with the poker, and then I struck him with my fist in my own defence, not with a stick; and my brother made a hit at me, but instead of hitting me, as we were struggling, he hit my father. Two men saw the blow struck, and I asked them to come as witnesses; they said "No," but the policeman saw me talking to them. This is not the second or third time my father has ill-used me. One morning, when I lived at Ely-place, because I was a little late he struck me with a ginger-beer bottle, and I laid in a pool of blood. I am driven into the streets by him and my sister.</p>

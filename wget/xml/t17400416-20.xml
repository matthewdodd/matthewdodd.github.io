The third of March, she lay out all Night, and we having lost a Fan, and finding she kept loose Company, I taxed her with having taken it, and she owned it, and that she had first pawned it for 18 d. and afterwards had sold it outright for 4 s.

               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say against my Master. To be sure, he has spoke the Truth. I lent the Fan to a Creature I was acquainted with, who promised to bring it me again the next Day; but she did not: and the Fan not being asked for, she perswaded me to sell it outright. When my Mistress taxed me with it, I told her I would speak the Truth, and she promised to do me no hurt; I accordingly informed her where the Fan was, and said, I was afraid I could not get it again, because it was sold. I never had but one Half-Crown from my Master in my Life, and never wronged any one of a Pin's-point before. <rs id="t17400416-20-verdict118" type="verdictDescription">

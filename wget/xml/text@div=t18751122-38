I live at 11, Commodore Terrace, Commodore Road, Stepney—I am employed at the Civil Service Supply Association, 136, Queen Victoria Street—it is a different association to the one we are speaking about—I was at Bow Lane on 6th November about 2.30, when the prisoner accosted me—he asked me if I would like to earn 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said "Yes," and he told me to take this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to the New Civil Service and they would give me a parcel—I did so, and brought the parcel back to Cannon Street, where he told me to meet him with it—he said "Would you like a glass of beer?"—I said I should not mind, and we went into a public-house—while we were there the prosecutor, Mr. Webster, came in and said to the prisoner "Where are those receipts for the parcel you got from the boy just now"—the prisoner pulled out two papers and gave them to Mr. Webster, which Mr. Webster said had nothing to do with it, as they were several days old—the prisoner said afterwards that a gentleman had promised him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if he would get the parcel, which he was to take to Cannon Street station—I saw a gentleman about 6 yards off from the prisoner when he sent me for the parcel, but I did not see him speak to the</p>

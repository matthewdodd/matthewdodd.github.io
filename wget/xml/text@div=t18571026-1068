                  </hi>. I carry on business at No. 18, Fetter Lane. I have a house there, and sleep there; it is in the parish of St. Dunstan's—I am a bootmaker, and have a shop—on the night of 19th Oct I looked up the place, at 10 o'clock; I did not lock the street door; it was fastened, but not locked—no one could get in without a key—it was closed when I went to bed—there is a door leading from the passage to the shop; that door was, fastened with a padlock and another lock—I had some boots in my shop—two pairs of boots were afterwards shown to me, which were found on the, cellar stairs; they had been in the shop window—I was disturbed by the, policeman about half past 2 o'clock in the morning; I found the door wide</p>

               <p>open leading from the passage to the shop; that was the door which had been fastened by the padlock—the padlock was on the floor; the officer picked it up—the officer had the prisoner—these boots are mine; they were safe in my shop window.</p>

I was on duty in Fetter Lane that night; I found the prosecutor's door fast at half past 2 o'clock; I tried it, and went to the end of the court—I then heard a noise in the shop window; I waited half a minute, and I heard a second noise; that roused my suspicion; I looked through the key hole, I could see no light—I went to the private door; I pressed it, and it flew open—I turned on my light, and I saw the door in the passage wide open—I looked into the shop, and saw no one; I went-in and sat down, and I saw the prisoner come out of the cellar—I said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, what do you do here?"—(I knew him before; he lives in West Harding Street)—he said he had been to the water closet—(I should think it would take about a quarter of a minute to get from there to West Harding Street)—I saw these two pairs of boots close behind where the prisoner was—I called Mr. Milburn, and told him the shop door was open—I found no one else on the premises—I had seen the prisoner about a quarter of an hour previous to this, after he came out of his own house.</p>

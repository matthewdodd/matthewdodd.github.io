He reply'd, That he had it from, or it was owned by, one Johnson, and must be so endors'd; and he being a Clerk in the Lottery-Office it would not be so well for him: That he thereupon did go and sell it for 52 l. 3 s. and endorsed Johnson, according to his Direction, and carried the Money to the Prisoner, and he did lend him 20 Guineas of the Money.

             depos'd, He bought the Certificate of John Cog . The Commissioners of the Lottery depos'd, It was a false Certificate: That the true Certificate, No. 72, in the 68th Course of Payment, was for 202 l. to one - Curson. That as to the Names with which the Certificate was signed, they were not written by them, though they were artfully counterfeited. Other Evidences, who were Fellow-Clerks with him in the Office, depos'd, That they did believe the filling up of the Certificate was the Prisoner's Hand-writing. The Prisoner in his Defence alledged, That he bought the Certificate in Exchange Alley, but did not know who he bought it of; and that George Robinson had sworn before the Justice, that he bought it of one Mr. Parsons. But it was contradicted that he swore it positively, but that he did verily believe he was the Man he bought it of. The Jury <rs id="t17241014-42-verdict212" type="verdictDescription">

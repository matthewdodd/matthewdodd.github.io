I had permission of my master to go out about three o'clock. I went out at three o'clock, and returned again a little before eight; I went out again at half past eight; my master would expect me home at eleven o'clock. I went from my master's house to Charing-cross, and from there to Whitcomb-street. I proceeded up Rider-street, into Oxford-street; I then went up Berner-street, as far as Middlesex hospital. I went with intention of calling upon Mr. Terry, of Northumberland-street. I returned into Oxford-street again, and went to the bottom of Oxford-street, towards the park. I went down Park-lane, and then I went into the park at Grosvenor gate. This was about half past ten at night when I went into the park at Grosvenor gate. I proceeded through the Park. I went almost out of the carriage road, and went into Rider-street walk. When I came into the foot path, I met Maroney; he was stooping at his gaiters; he said the gate was fast.</p>

               <p>Q. What gate - 
               <persName id="t18140706-4-person89">A. Hyde Park</persName>
             gate, that comes into Piccadilly. He was swearing at the porters for having shut that gate. I told him if I could not get through that gate I could go through Grosvenor gate, the gate that I came in at. I directly turned, and made towards Grosvenor-gate. Maroney followed me. I got into the carriage road; I got over the railings to get into the carriage road, immediately two soldiers sprang upon me. Ashton was the <rs id="t18140706-4-deflabel18" type="occupation">soldier</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18140706-4-defend85 t18140706-4-deflabel18"></join> that attempted to knock me down. That is the man now at the bar. The other man, I saw the blow coming, I stooped my head, and in stooping<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060006"></xptr>I fell. Ashton directly collared me; he called me a b - y sod, and said he would take me to the guard-house.</p>
               <p>Q. He called you a sod; did you know what he meaned by that expression - A. I know now; I did not at that time. He said he would take me to the guard-house; I told him I was very willing to go whereever he chose to take me, if he saw anything of the kind by me.</p>
               <p>COURT. You said you did not understand what he meaned; what do you mean by saying, if he saw anything of the kind - A. I said if he saw anything that was bad of me, I was willing to go where they liked, so they both -</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Whom are the both - A. Ashton, Maroney, and another. They took me down the road until I came to the Serpentine river. I told them I was certain what they wanted, that they wanted my money, and the property I had about me. They asked me how much I had; I told them I had two crown pieces. Ashton asked me how much I had. I gave 
               <persName id="t18140706-4-person90">Ashton</persName>
             the two crown pieces that I had in my pocket. I told them I would give them all the money I had if they would not use me ill.</p>
               <p>Q What induced you to give two crown pieces to Ashton - A. I was afraid they were going to murder me. One of the other men felt my smallclothes pocket; it was not Ashton; he had hold of me; with that, they said I had more. I pulled out the third crown piece; I am not certain what crown piece it was. I had two old crown pieces, and one French one; two were English. I am not certain which crown piece I gave to Ashton. I had three one-pound notes and three crown pieces. That was all I had to the best of my knowledge. I had a watch, a chain, and seal. The watch was a gold repeater.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon you having parted with this third crown piece, what happened then - A. The men let me go. Maroney came up; he catched hold of both my arms: he let go one arm, and felt for my watch; the instant he felt for my watch I cried out murder. A hand was put before my mouth; with that, Maroney attempted to knock me down. I did not receive the blow. I fell down, and struggled; I could not cry out. When I fell down, there was a knee upon my head, a hand upon my mouth, and another pressed upon my throat. My fob pocket was very tight. I had hold of my chain before I fell; I kept hold of it at the time I was down, and then I had the key and seals in my hand. The watch-chain was broke. I had one part of the chain and seals in my hand, the small part of the chain; the other part was gone; my fob and my pocket were gone; the other part of the chain, the watch, and pocket, and fob, were all taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the fob and pocket were both gone. Was the bank notes in your pocket - A. They were to the best of my knowledge. The instant they tore my smallclothes off they left me.</p>
               <p>Q. What had become of your hat - A. I do not know; that was taken away from me in throwing me down. I had it when they attempted to knock me down.</p>
               <p>Q. When they took your fob and pocket away had you your hat - A. I had not. I had a walking stick with me; that was left likewise. I had a pair of gloves; one was left; the right hand glove was left, to the best of my knowledge. They left me directly I got my head up.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did they go away - A. Two went to the left, and Maroney went to the right. Maroney ran away; the two others I cannot say how went away; I did not observe them. I continued they hallooing out murder from the instant that they left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pressure so much upon you that you could not cry out - A. When the hand was upon my throat pressing me, I could not cry not. I followed Maroney; he went to the right. I never lost sight of him at all. I saw two gentlemen of the name of Beechy; they asked me where were the fellows. I directly pointed to Maroney; I said, there is the rascal that robbed me. They pursued Maroney, and overtook him; they struggled together. When I came up to them they were all three down; one of the Mr. Beechy's said, why do not you come and assist us. I said, I do as well as I can. Then I saw two more persons; I ran to them. I ran back again, and when I came back I picked up Maroney's grenadier's cap; Maroney and the Mr. Beechy's were standing up, and Maroney was with his bayonet in his hand. I took up the cap, and made the best of my way home.</p>



               <p>Q. Now, that cap; had it a plate on - A. It had not. When I got home I examined the cap; it had no name in it, and there was no lining to it. I shewed the cap to my master when I came home. I took the cap afterwards to the Horse Guards, and wrote my name in it. I shewed that cap to my master, and informed him every thing that passed. He accompanied me the next day to the Horse Guards, and I took that cap with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the Horse Guards did you prefer your complaint there - A. Yes; in consequence of that, six or seven soldiers were brought forward. I selected Ashton and Maroney out. Maroney was brought in first. Maroney and Ashton were taken before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any part of your property since - A. Yes, I saw at the Horse Guards part of my chain, a glove, my hat, a stick, and two pockets.</p>

            ; we had been to dine at Chiswick with a friend. In coming home, we came through the Park, we heard the clock strike eleven as we came into the Park I saw not any one until I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner, Maroney; the prosecutor was crying out murder. I mentioned to my brother, there was the cry of murder. We instantly ran, crossed the road, close by the Serpentine river; I saw the prisoner, Maroney, running from the prosecutor; I heard the cry of murder, four times. When we saw him running, the prosecutor said, I have been robbed by a soldier, there is one of them, who has robbed me. We immediately ran, and came up with him. Marony then turned, presented a bayonet, and swore he would run the first man through that came up to him. We immediately attacked him, endeavoured to get his bayonet from him; we were down on the ground more than once, and in the scuffle he stabbed me in the hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say thing - A. Not after the expression. When he presented the bayonet, he said, by Jesus, I will stab the first man that comes forward. When we were down, there were two boys or men, we were engaged, I cannot tell which. The moment before that, I had lost my shoe, which I named to my brother; he endeavoured to find it, and picked up the plate of Maroney's cap. My brother came up, and said, I have got your shoe, and the plate of his cap; now, we will follow him. We went up to him, and told him, we were determined to take him to the barracks; he said, he would go if we would suffer him to look after his cap. There was no cap to be seen. We took him up to the barracks, a prisoner. He had no cap at all at the time we had the scuffle to that period we took and delivered him up at the guard-house, and informed the serjeant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he prefer any charge against any body at the time - A. Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see 
               <persName id="t18140706-4-person95">Ashton</persName>
             that night - A. No. The serjeant assured me if we would attend the orderly-room, he would bring Maroney forward We attended the next morning, I and my brother. I was there when the soldiers were brought in. I saw Milsom pointed him out a short time after he was in the room, and he pointed Maroney out. He first pointed Ashton out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any conversation made by them against Milsom - A. Not by them at that time.</p>

            . I am a soldier in the Staffordshire militia. On Monday morning, the 13th, I was in Hyde Park; I was on Magazine guard at the time, about thirty yards from the Serpentine; I found a glove and a walking-stick. This is the glove and walking-stick; I gave it to Gillmore, the officer. I found them about five o'clock in the morning</p>

            . I am a serjeant in the Coldstream guards. On Sunday, the 12th of June, I called the roll-call at ten o'clock; Maroney and Ashton were my men; they were absent out, without leave At eleven o'clock at night, I was called up by two strange people; I am positive Mr. Beechey with the stab in his hand was one of them, and his brother the other. When I got up, Maroney was without his grenadiers cap.</p>

            No, he did not. This is the cap that was brought to the orderly-room the next morning, and this plate is the same as is worn by the grenadiers of our regiment. This is such a cap as Maroney ought to have had on; this plate fits the mark of the cap where a plate has been.</p>
               <p>Maroney. Was not I coming off guard - A. It was your duty to be in readiness to go on the Queen's guard; that guard was not wanted. The guard was dismissed a little before. It is possible that Maroney was on the spot; he ought to have been present at roll-call or a few minutes afterwards.</p>

            . I am a corporal in the Coldstream guards. I was on guard on the 12th of June, at night, in the barracks, two persons came in, and complained of having been used ill; I can swear to the man with the stab in his hand. I took the belt and bayonet from Maroney. This is the bayonet; it was bloody at the time.</p>

            . I was sent for, in company with Green, another officer; I took the prisoners into custody; Martoney was in the guard-room and Ashton in the privy, he was a long time in the privy. I at last, said to Ashton, I hope you are throwing nothing down the privy; he said, no. He then said, he did not knock the man down; he knew who did He said, he should say all he knew when he came before the grand board. I handcuffed him to Maroney, and another of the name of Davis.</p>

            , ESQ. I reside in Adelphi-terrace. On Sunday night, the 12th of June, the prosecutor came home near twelve o'clock; he was out with my permission; I expected him home at eleven. He came up to my bedchamber; he had- the appearance of a man wild, a frenzy appearance; his breeches were torn by violence, the fob-pocket completely rent from the garment; he brought a grenadier's cap with him on Sunday night. On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060008"></xptr>the next morning, I went with him to the Tilt-yard, the commanding officer was not there, Afterwards, the prisoners were brought before Colonel

             asked the prisoners if Milsom had been guilty of any thing improper; they answered, no.</p>
               <p>Maroney's Defence. This night, I met this gentleman in the Park; I was buttoning the knees of my gaiters; I told him the gate was locked. He said, have you got a woman; I said, no. He said if I would come along with him, he would get me one; I replied, that, I did not mind. He took me across the path-way, to the grove; he stopped there: he opened the flap of his smallclothes, took out the flap of his shirt, he then pulled out what he had; he asked me whether that would do for a woman; this man and his comrade came up, and boned him, called him a b - y sod; he immediately made a dart to get away; one of them knocked him down. He got up, and said, all the money I have, I will give you to drink. We said, we do not want your money, we will take you to the guard-room; silence, he then said, you want to ruin my character. He then said, he had got six shillings, I will give it you to drink. He put his hand into his pocket, pulled out two pieces, and said, it is ten shillings I have got; he gave it to one of the soldiers to let him go, I cannot say which. I was in the rear all the time, and never laid a hand upon him all the time. He then said, I will give you another crown to let me go. I walked in the front of them then, and these two men said, they would take him to the guardroom, and when he thought they were taking him to the guard-room, he screamed out, murder; they then were walking up the Park towards the Magazine barrack. These two gentlemen came up to me, they said, they wanted me to give them my side arms; I said, I could not give them my side arms; I will go wherever you want to take me. They said, I wanted to rob the man. Two men got hold of my bayonet; they asked this man to come to their assistance. Two of the men held the bayonet, the third man fell; in falling, this man's hand got down, and the bayonet got in his hand, and in pulling the bayonet from me, they cut me here; it is my blood that settled on the bayonet. I went myself to the Magazine barrack. I stopped to look for my cap, and in looking for my cap, I found the gentleman's hat, and took it with me, and left it at the barrack door. If they brought me a prisoner, how could I be in the rear of them, and how could they he up before me if they brought me a prisoner.</p>
               <p>Ashton's Defence. As I was coming home, about half past ten at night, I got into the Park, there are some very large trees; on the right hand side of walk I saw a person walking to and fro on the green. Some men came up to me that had been upon guard, and asked me what I was doing there; I told them I had seen a man in the Park that I thought was at no good. They went by me. On my turning back in about four or five minutes afterwards, up came

            , who belongs to the same company as I do; he asked me where I was going; I said, home to the barracks. We agreed to go together. As we were pursuing our way home, he said, he had got leave of absence for all night; I said, so have I. With this, we agreed to go into town again. In returning back to where I saw the person before, I do not say the prosecutor, but where I saw the person, I saw the person and the prosecutor standing together; we made towards them. When I got within ten yards of them, I saw the prosecutor with his smallclothes down. Strange went up and collared him. The prosecutor made a spring to get from him; he said, will not you come to my assistance; I went and took hold of his right arm, and Strange held him by his left breast. He said to us, soldiers, what are you going to do with me; we said, we will take you to the guard-room. He said, do not take me to the guard-room; I have got some money I will give you to get something to drink; we said, it is not your money we want, but you shall go with us to the guard-room He then said, do you want to expose me; I said, you deserve exposing to the public at large. He then cried out, murder. Maroney was in the rear of me; he said, let him go. I said to Strange, let him go; Strange said he would not. I left him with Strange.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to Prosecutor. Have you heard what these men have said - A. Yes, it is all untruth; the money was given for fear at first, and by force afterwards. I did not give it to hush up this business. It is all untrue what they have said</p>

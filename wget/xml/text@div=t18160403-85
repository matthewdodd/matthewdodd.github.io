On the 17th of February last, I sent the dial and the frame of a watch to the prisoner's to have a gold case made to it. I received it back on the 23rd of February; this is the case and the dial; I have no doubt it is Jackson's work; I have frequently seen his work before, and this has his mark. When I received it back, I sent it to the motion maker, Mr. Warren, Susannah-row, Curtain-road. I received it back in about three days; I found it was not deep enough for the works, and I sent it to Mr. Hayford, the springer, ordering him to get it raised at Jackson's, it was to have been raised before Hayford could have put the springs in. I should think Hayford kept it three or four days; I then put the works in it. A gentleman came after that from Goldsmith's Hall, and wished to look at it, and ordered me to come to Goldsmith's Hall the next day at eleven o'clock; I did so, and left it with Mr. Ayres and Mr. Lane. When I received it home from Jackson's at first, I received a bill of parcels with it for the watch.</p>

            . I am a spring-maker. Mr. Nadauld brought that watch-case to me to be secret springed and polished, and to get the bow exchanged, and the bottom raised at Jackson; I can't say whether he ordered me to get that done; but when I looked at the plate, I found it wanted it. I sent it to Hemmet to get the bow exchanged; I am not certain whether I sent it to Jackson's or Hemmet's first. When I had it back, I did what was necessary for it then, and then sent it to Mr. Greenwell's; Mr. Greenwell said it was not one of his joints, and the man then took it to Jackson's to have it raised. Greenwell did not work upon it at all; it was brought back to me by the man I sent it out with; his name is Bacon. I then sent it to Ellsworth's to be printed up, and on receiving it back from him, I finished my work; I had only the case as far as I was concerned; I sent it home as it was sent to me; but not as it is now, because it is much altered; I know Jackson's work by the marks. I have remarked one thing; his work used to be shut wires, but this is flat edges. When I looked at the marks, one of the customary ones was not in it, because it was a customary thing to put the first letter of his name in it; but this had not; that made me look at it, and that made me think he had got a new workman. That mark is mostly put into the middle of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030050"></xptr>bottom; and in the trade every man can tell his own mark, if they put their mark and letter; but it might be possible for another person to do it.</p>

            . I am a watch-case maker. In the month of January last, I engaged in the service of Messrs. Jackson; the prisoner superintended the manufactory, and his brother attended to the books. About the 21st or 22nd of February, I received directions from the prisoner about a watch-case; he put into my hand a dial and a frame. That is the same. He gave me directions to make a case for it, and he told me the case was for Mr. Nadauld; I was then in the counting-house, and he told me when he came into the shop, he would give me a Hall marked bottom; accordingly I took the frame into the shop, and he called me again, and gave me the gold for the wires, and mentioned that it was No. 1 gold; the edges are what are termed wires; these wires all together would be the greater part of the watch-case, and consequently would be heavier than the bottom. He said, he was going to give me a Hall marked bottom, and I might use No. 1 gold for the wires, as they were not going to the Hall. I always considered No. 1 gold, by the working, to be rather inferior, from the stubbornness of the metal; the more alloy, the more stubborn the metal. While I was working these edges, they appeared to me to be No. 1 gold, 16 carat gold; while I was working the edges, Mr. Jackson came into the shop to me, and brought me a Hall marked bottom, with all the wires to it, except the wires which shut down; a watch-case opens in the middle, consequently there would be wires both above and below. The case he brought me had been to the Hall, and was stamped, it was one of three which I myself had made shortly before; he told me to cut out the bottom, and put it into the wires which I was then making of No. 1 gold. When I had formed the wire for it, he came to me, and told me that it was a pity to use that case, as it was a large thick bottom-was too thick, and would do for a heavier case, if he should have occassion to make one; he brought me another Hall marked case of lighter and thinner gold; he brought that with the wires also to it; that was another of the three which I had made a short time previous. I cut the bottom out of it, and placed it in the wires which I had formed out of No. 1 gold he had given me. While I was at work upon it, Mr. Jackson came in again, after I had cut the bottom out of its own wires, and put it into the other; it was lying on the work-board, and he took it up, and looked at it. I gave the wires of the Hall marked bottom to Mr.

            , the prisoner; I saw him weighing it, and he stated, it was lighter than the order stated, and than the orders he had given me. In about a week afterwards, or rather better, I saw it again, a young man brought it from the springer's, and said the case was too low for the frame, and consequently wanted raising, and I raised it while he was waiting for it; the one he produced to be raised, was the one of which I have been speaking. I disclosed this transaction about a fortnight after it had been done, hardly as long as that after it came from the springer to be raised; I first directed a letter to the Goldsmith's hall, and after that went and saw Mr. Lane.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. POOLEY. I served my time with a Mr. Mansell, of Goswell-street; I had been about a twelve month out of my time, when Mr. Jackson proposed this to me, I did not consider it right, but I did not know it was a felony. I never proposed the same thing to any master I ever lived with. I never said to any master that I was surprized he did not do such a thing, because a great many persons in the trade had done so, and made money by it; that I am sure of, and that I can swear. I never told any master that a former master with whom I had lived had used a stamp, and that I could make one like it; that I am sure of, and am positive of. I had never any quarrel or misunderstanding at all with the prisoner. He used to give me quantities of gold to work up into wires, and watch-cases. Upon those accasions he delivered tickets of the quantity of metal to be worked up; he never had occasion but once to suppose that I had not returned the proper quantity of metal, and the reason of that was, that he could not find some gold which his brother had taken down in a bowl, and after a search, we found that this bowl had been thrown under the table in the countinghouse, with some empty ones; I mean to state that that is the only occasion that he had ever found fault with me on that head; his brother stated that he had placed the bowl under the table in the counting-house among some empty ones, thinking that they were all empty. I had lived with him about five or six weeks when he put the dial I have in my hands to make a case to it; he had about a dozen servants besides myself; about nine worked in the shop in which I worked; there was not any particular time for us to come to work, that depended on the urgency of the business we were doing; some times all the men were working in the shop, and at times there as been only one. There were seven or eight besides myself in the shop, which is capable of holding fourteen men; at the time the prisoner gave me this dial, the nearest man to me was about as far as from me to you, and the shop in length is about as far as from that pillar to this, (alluding to the brass pillars at the respective Sheriff's box in court.) It was from twelve to one in the day when the prisoner brought it to me; other persons in the shop saw it; a young man of the name of Atkins took it up in his hand, and observed the dial when the prisoner gave me the instructions, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030051"></xptr>he gave me in the shop. he spoke in his ordinary tone of voice. I don't know whether it must have been heard by other persons in the shop, because ours is very noisy business, in which there is a great deal of hammering; and unless a person a tends particularly to what is said to him, he will not hear it. I cannot say that the hammering was so loud at the time the prisoner was speaking to me as to preclude the possibility of any one else hearing it. I sat as far from the man next to me, as I am from you sir. I never counted the benches; we sit opposite the light, all of a row.</p>



               <p>Q. Then if there were eight or nine persons besides you in the shop, and the shop is no longer than from one of those brass pillars to the other, how is it possible that they can all sit as far asunder as from me to you - A. I did not say they all sit as far as from me to you; but if they men whose places would be in that distance in the shop as long as from me to you, were not in their places, nobody else would take them, and therefore that space would be empty; each man sits at his regular place. I said, I should know this case from a thousand. I mean to say that because there is a particular mark, which I accidently made with the cutting tool when I was working this case. In about fourteen days I gave information of this; I left the prisoner's service about a week after I gave information. I never understood I was to have any reward for my information; it was never proposed nor told me that for the information I gave, I should be paid; I was never told that if this prisoner was convicted, I should be rewarded; I always gave the same account of this transaction. I said, I received the case and the wires seperately; I did not say on a former occasion, that I had received them both together; I stated that Mr. Jackson followed me up, and gave me the bottom. I might have said directly, but I cannot say it was exactly at the same time; I have worked for Mr.

The parts the company would put their marks on are the bottom, the cover, and the exterior cover, if it have one. This case has no stamp in the cover; the Hall mark in the upper part may be sometimes worked out. I have assayed this case in its present state; an officer named William City scraped it for me; the assay of the wires in their present state is two carats and one grain worse than the standard of eighteen. The bottom produces half a grain better than the standard of eighteen. On account of the inferiority of these wires, they could not have passed the Hall; the Hall mark would not be fixed to any thing less than the standard of eighteen.</p>

            . I am drawer of the plate to the Goldsmith's Company; I draw all the watch-cases that come to be assayed. I have lately scraped this watchcase for the purpose of Barrow making his assay; in the whole we scrape five parts of a watch-case which is to be assayed; four from the wires and one from the bottom. After it is assayed, the Hall mark is put on it.</p>

            , ESQ. I am Prime Warder of the Goldsmith's Company. I in company with Mr. Lane, received that watch-case from the hands of Mr. Nadauld.</p>

               <p>MR. ALLEY. On the part of the prisoner, objected, that the prosecutors had mistaken their road with respect to the first three Counts of the Indictment, because the prisoner was charged with "transposing and removing," and not with "cauing to be transposed and removed," which allegation was not borne out by the evidence.</p>

               <p>COURT. But I am of opinion that what a man orders his workman to do, he does himself.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If the case was in the state that it now is when it left our house, it has been done for the purpose of bringing the present prosecution. With regard to that part of the evidence which fixes the certainty of its not having passed the Hall, it is the presumption of my mind, that it was done by the witness Dalton, for the purpose of bringing the present charge; we had a quarrel some time previous, and that was the occasion of this; I know nothing of this case whatever.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called the following witnesses.</p>

               <p>

            . I am a watch-case maker, in Sinnot-street, Clerkenwell. The witness Dalton offered to come into my service some months ago; he refered me to Mr. Mansell for his character; I did not go to Mr. Mansell for his character; I was induced to take him without that. After he came into my service, he frequently addressed his conversation to me, with respect to the marks on watch-cases; the conversations on that subject always originated with him; he said Mr. Mansell had realized a great deal of money by using a forged or false mark; that was the Mr. Mansell to whom he had refered me for his character. He recommended me to do the same; and said, he could make a mark. I in part laughed at it, and in part treated it with contempt, and denied the possibility of his making a mark. With respect to wires, he advised me to send a rough case to the Hall to be marked, and then to return the Hall mark, and put inferior wires to it. He made this proposition more than once, seven or eight times, a continual conversation upon the subject whenever he had an opportunity of bringing it up; he seemed anxious to induce me to do it. During the time he was with me, I thought I had an opportunity of forming an opinion of his varacity, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030052"></xptr>he is not a person whom I would by any means believe on his oath.</p>

             served his apprenticeship to me; he was with me about twelve months before this happened. From all I have known of him, I certanly would not credit him on his oath.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Because he was so notorious a liar at the time he was a boy, that I could never put any confidence in what he said; a systematic liar; he was with me fifteen months as an errand boy, before I took him as an apprentice; he staid with me three months or rather more, after his apprenticeship had expired. He continued for that time working with me as a journeyman.</p>

               <p>Q. From his commencement as a boy you could not depend on a word he said - A. I did not discover it until he had been with me two or three years. I was continually detecting him in little tritling lies. In hopes of reproving him, and out of respect to his father, I kept him. I did not turn him off as soon as his time was up; I took him as a journeyman. As a journeyman, it is not material, so long as he does his work well, if he be a liar.</p>

               <p>COURT. It is quite immaterial to you then whether your journyman is a liar or not - A. Yes; my lord.</p>

            . I am clerk to the Goldsmith's Company. In the course of the last month the witness Glanny was examined before the Wardens of the Hall, in my presence.

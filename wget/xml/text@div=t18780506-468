                  </hi>. I am the Governor of Newgate—since the prisoner's apprehension, and during the examination before the Magis<lb></lb>trate, and after his committal, he has been under my charge—I received this letter; he sent it to me—I read it, and saw him—I told him I had read his letter, that it was impossible I could assist him in a matter of that kind, that I had sent it to the authorities, and if I heard anything from them I would let him know—this other letter he also sent to me on 11th April—I put the date on it.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">These letters were read as follows</hi>:—"28th March, 1878.—Governor,—Pardon the liberty I am taking in addressing you, but really you seem to be the only man I have met since coming to this country who seems to have mind enough to grasp an idea of some magniture, which I am about to present to you as briefly as possible. Some years since I made the acquaintance of a noted forger, the one, in fact, who did the most of the work for those people McDonald, Bidwell, &amp;c., who are called the great Bank of England forgers. Through him I became acquainted with others, who, knowing me as a sporting man who was ' all right, ' did not hesitate about talking in my presence. In fact, I admit that I assisted them in various ways, both as a chemist and as a man who thoroughly understood business matters of all kinds. About a year since my friend whom I have mentioned came to me and said that he was sick of the business, and wanted to leave it altogether. He therefore proposed that I should communicate with the banks and bankers of the city of New York and with the Treasury Department at Washington, offering for a certain yearly sum (about 10 per cent. of the average annual losses from such causes) to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060006"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">utterly prevent all forging and counterficting</hi>. The parties with whom I communicated were very much taken with the idea, and it seemed at one time as if it was a certainty that it would be taken up, but unfortunately the Government detectives got wind of it (and they are all more or less in collusion with the counterfeiters), and they were able, through their backers in the Treasury and in Congress, to prevent an appropriation being made. In New York city we also were disappointed, for we could get no <hi rend="italic">concerted</hi> action; each man we saw was pleased with the idea, but when it came to patting his hand in his pocket it was another thing; therefore it fell through—at least for the present. When I was sent for to come over here (which I will explain to you at some future time), I fully intended to try and make some arrangement with the authorities here of the same kind. I have had no opportunity of doing so until now, and let me make the offer to you. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> make all the arrangements, and I will guarantee that for 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum we will prevent <hi rend="italic">professional</hi> forgers from plying their vocation in <hi rend="italic">London</hi>; for another 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we will prevent them from working in <hi rend="italic">England</hi>, and for a third 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from swindling any bank or banking house in <hi rend="italic">Great Britain</hi>. This may seem to you an impossibility, but let me assure you, upon my honour, it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi>. You would be surprised were I to tell you how many professional forgers there are. Why, if you will believe me, all the forgers, counterfeiters, engravers, photographers, and chemists (who are connected with crooked business) in the <hi rend="italic">world</hi> can be counted upon your fingers. Therefore, you see how easy it would be for me, for instance, with the assistance of say two men in London, three men in the States, and one in Paris, one in Berlin, and one in Rome, to have timely notice of whatever was coming off and <hi rend="italic">prevent them from working on our territory</hi>. In fact, we would act as lightning conductors, so to speak. The men whom I would employ are all men who have been years in the business, and who in the folly of it, they are willing to do anything for a living, but still would not consent to <hi rend="italic">give any one away</hi> and have them arrested; they would merely warn them not to work here. In fact, it would be something like the Preventive Service in which, I believe, it was not unusual to find old smugglers, and they made the most efficient officers. There are a thousand things I could say to you in favour of my plan, and should you see fit to question me about it, I will be happy to give you all needed information. In order to show you that I know whereof I speak, let me inform you that it was intended to flood the London and European market this summer, during the Exposition, with all kinds of forgeries. The French bank notes, for which some men were arrested last month, were a part of what were to be used, but the men who had them got hard up, I suppose, and had to let some of them go. For this market there has been manufactured more than <hi rend="italic">one million of pounds</hi> of stuff, principally bonds. There were to be sold through certain brokers in the City, two of whom <hi rend="italic">I know</hi>. About 75,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of bonds, all ready for use, except a few minutes' work on each, are now awaiting my order on the other side. If it is required, I will send for them as soon as I am liberated, and have them sent to one of the parties who has promised them. There are a lot ready, a large amount of drafts of a certain steamship company, a few samples are here, but the bulk is on the other side. These I can get also at any time. In fact, I could mention, were it necessary, a dozen different things now ready or nearly ready for this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060007"></xptr>
               <p>market. Will the Treasury and the Banking Association allow them to come, and thousands of people to be robbed of their all, for the sake of sending <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to prison for a few years? Now, Governor, you are the man to take this thing in hand. It would be worth a thousand a year to you, if not more, and all you would have to do would be to transmit my daily or weekly report to the proper persons. You would not be known to any one but me, nor would I be known to any one but you and the people under my control, <hi rend="italic">who would not know each other</hi>. At least, they would not know that each was in my employ. Please think seriously over this matter, and let me know your opinion at your earliest con<lb></lb>venience. By so doing, you will oblige, yours respectfully (signed), Chas. Cherwood." "Gaol of Newgate, April 11th, 1878. To Mr. Abrams or the solicitor for the Central Bank. Gentlemen,—I hear that the utterer of the forged check is now under arrest for some offense: so if you want him you can fetch him. Don't you think it was unwise on your part to refuse to take advantage of the liberal offers I made you more than two weeks since? Perhaps Mr. Chapman never showed you my ' written propositions' with a synopsis of what I was able and willing to do. Did he? Please answer at once, and oblige, yours, &amp;c., Chas, Cherwood.

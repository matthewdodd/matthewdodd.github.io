               <p>EWEN BAILEY, Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>Early in June, 1784, I had in my possession returning from India, diamonds and pearls to a certain amount, which were shewn to a broker, Mr. Sharpe, for the purpose of being disposed of in the usual course of business some time had elapsed when a person was brought in order to purchase those diamonds, I think it was a Mr. Randall, he was brought by Mr. Sharpe, and upon examining these diamonds, this Mr. Randall found a deficiency from the original invoice, Mr. Randall and Mr. Sharpe ascertained the quantity that were taken out by comparing with the invoice, and Mr. Sharp sold the pearls to Mr. Randall, not supposing as I believe, or not knowing, or not suspecting that there was any robbery committed on them; the pearls were sold according to the invoice, and the diamonds according to the deduction of the ascertained number of the stones that were taken out; Mr. Sharpe acquainted my agent sometime after (I was not in town myself.) that upon Mr. Randall's having sold these pearls to a certain person there appeared a deficiency in the pearls, Mr. Sharpe advertised these pearls and diamonds, and circulated hand-bills in the usual form, these produced no discovery; I could not at that time fix the robbery on any particular person: in the course of last month I was going out of town, and I took from my finger a diamond ring that was made by Gray in Bond-street, and put it in one of my lodgings in a drawer, the house is in St. Alban's-street, No. 11, the house of Narcissa Marskall; I lodged there when the former things were stolen, the prisoner was my servant, and had been so during the whole time, he had lived a little more than twelve months with me at this time; and he had formerly lived in my service: upon my return to town I looked for this ring and could not find it, I think I was absent ten days, the prisoner was not with me, I left him in town, I left it in a drawer in a mahogany box and the box was locked up, I had the key; I enquired of my servant, who denied having seen it or knowing anything of it; when I returned the box was locked as I left it; I could not arrive at any knowledge of this ring, and it then struck me very forcibly that this servant must be privy to it, and I recollected having seen in the same box two sapphire rings, and a gold stock-buckle, and they were missing also; that confirmed me in the idea of the prisoner's dishonesty; I then came into a resolution of quitting everybody that was about me, from the discomfort of having a thief about me, I quitted my lodgings and went into a house of my own, and the prisoner was the only person I took with me; I mentioned the circumstance to the gentlemen at the Rotation-office , and they sent to search his boxes, I was present at the search, and in searching his baggage there was found that ring, made by Mr. Gray, the stones of an antique ring that belonged to me also, and two handkerchiefs with my name; the ring made by Mr. Gray was a hair ring set with diamonds of a particular form, the sapphire rings and the gold stock-buckle are accounted for, but not found.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Councel for the Prosecution. After he was taken into custody were there any promises made to him, that it would be better for him if he would say anything on the subject? - I sent to him, and told him my determination to quit everybody that I had about me, and that it was necessary to recommend him to the next service, that he should undergo a search that my mind might be convinced; I advised him to make a full discovery, which he did not.</p>
               <p>- DIXON sworn.</p>
               <p>I went to search this house, and found this ring; I was searching the drawers in the room where the prisoner lay, and just as I came to the drawer where the ring was, he went down on his knees, and said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290073"></xptr> would shew where it was; and I found it in a powder bag, mixed with the powder; it was in the case just as it is now; I found the stones of a ring, and these two handkerchiefs; here is the antique; and I found two keys in one of his breeches pockets in the drawer, which opens two of the Major's boxes, I tried them, and the Major tried them, these picklock keys opened the boxes as easy as the Major's keys.</p>
               <p>(The diamond ring deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This ring I purchased of Mr. Gray in Bond-street; I am clear it is the same, the form of the ring is particular, I have no doubt of its being mine from the hair in the inside; it was made by my particular directions; this is the stone of a ring that I wore, when I lost it it was set; I have had it several years, I have no doubt of this being the same; I examined the keys that were found, they opened and shut the boxes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Council. This property must have been found out in consequence of the confession .</p>
               <p>Court. It strikes me from the evidence Mr. Bailey gave at the outset, that it will be extremely difficult, perhaps ultimately so, to identify these diamonds and pearls, the value of the things already produced go far beyond the mark the law fixes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I wish to call Mr. Grant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. With submission, whatever comes to you, is in consequence of the confession of this boy.</p>
               <p>Court. Unsuspected and voluntary consession are the best evidence against offenders, and it is from the apprehension that promises of favour or threats might induce a man of a weak mind, like torture in some countries, in order to obtain the benefit of those promises, or to escape those threats, to make a confession that was not wholly true; but that can never go to the rejection of the evidence of other witnesses which is got at in consequence of that confession, as the law is clearly settled.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. The examination of Mr. Grant is for the purpose of supporting out of his own mouth, an action against him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I have no difficulty in stating what my purpose is, independent of any action, I think it my duty that he should be examined.</p>
               <p>Court. Had it been wholly immaterial, I dare say you would not have desired to add less evidence to the stronger, and the resistance to it would decide me in receiving the evidence, if I had no other motive.</p>
               <p>

               <p>What price did you pay for them? - Ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Did you purchase any other articles of him? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you at any other time purchase any rough diamonds of him? - No, Sir, not of him.</p>
               <p>Did you of anybody that came with this man? - No, Sir, not in his company.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you purchase of anybody you ever saw in his company? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you see that person in the company of the prisoner? - Some time before.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with the prisoner at that time? - No, I think they came first together.</p>
               <p>Did they come together when he sold the pearls to you? - I cannot recollect, upon my honour.</p>
               <p>What complexioned person was he, black or white? - He was a mulatta, a genteelish looking man.</p>
               <p>What time was it that you purchased any diamonds of the other? - In the same month.</p>
               <p>Was it after or before you purchased the pearls from the prisoner? - I think it was after, I think it might be eight or ten days after.</p>

               <p>Court. Is there any other evidence to this property, not out of Mr. Grant's mouth?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There are, but they are not here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grant. My book shews the sum of money, but there is no quantity; my man corroborates the circumstance, but he is not here.</p>
               <p>Then it rests upon the memory of you and your man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is that the usual course of your business? - I seldom buy pearls, I do not deal much in them.</p>
               <p>Do you frequently buy diamonds in the rough state? - Not very often, I cannot say that I bought any others, I believe not.</p>
               <p>How many strings of pearls might you buy besides these? - I have bought diamonds ready wrought, and strings of pearls; I really cannot say, but I believe half a dozen or a dozen in that state.</p>
               <p>Did you consider the ten pounds as the full value of the pearls upon your oath? - I sold them for thirteen pounds, I sold them to different people.</p>
               <p>When did you sell them? - Immediately after, I do not buy these things to keep by me.</p>
               <p>What is your man's name who was present? -

               <p>Court to Mr. Grant. Did you ask these persons any questions how they came by these pearls and diamonds? - They said they brought them over from India; they said they lodged in the Haymarket, and were dealers, they did not say they were servants.</p>
               <p>Did you suppose them to be merchants that had come over from India to dispose of their property? - If I had had the least suspicion I should not have bought them, I had no suspicion of them; I have stopped things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Were not the things left at your house for some time? - Eight or ten days; I did not buy them rashly at the first coming, I thought they had been all over the trade, I sent my man to enquire whether they lodged there, because one of them was about buying a gold watch.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. What is your profession? - A diamond broker, I saw a parcel of pearls, out of which Mr. Bailey missed some. Mr. Bailey first produced me the invoice of diamonds, by India weights; on opening them and shewing them, I found them once exactly agreeable to the invoice, the pearls I counted and weighed myself, and when I first saw them they tallied exactly with the invoice; after this I returned them to Mr. Bailey; I had the pearls five or six days, we did not agree on the purchase of them, and I returned them to him.</p>

Mr. Rumbold bought them at 550 l. clear of all deductions; and according to the 600 l. the proportion of pearls that were taken were worth 41 l. 14 s.</p>

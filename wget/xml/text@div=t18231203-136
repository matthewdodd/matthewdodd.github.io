            . I am proprietor of the Basingstoke coach. On the 2d of December, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, I and Mills went to Armstrong's house - we could see from the window what passed at the <placeName id="t18231203-136-crimeloc742">Bell, inn, at Bedfont</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18231203-136-crimeloc742" type="placeName" value="Bell, inn, at Bedfont"></interp>

                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18231203-136-defend1254 t18231203-136-deflabel743"></join>. I saw Cowdray drive his waggon up to within three yards from the window - his horses were taken out and put to bait, and in a short time I saw Wheeler peep round the corner of the yard, look round two or three times, and then saw him bring a sack nearly full of corn from the yard, and put it into Cowdray's waggon - it was a covered waggon - directly it was placed there, Cowdray came from the bar door, called "Charles." Wheeler answered - Cowdray asked him if the corn was put up? He said "Yes." His man, and Collins, a boy, were present. Collins was holding a lantern to Cowdray, who said "Is all right? - put the horses to;" which was done. Cowdray then came along by the side of the window where we were, with some silver, and asked Wheeler what it was? - I did not hear his answer, but saw Cowdray count 6 s. into his hand, or it might be more - one of them said to Wheeler, "We must have something to drink out of this." He immediately ran and fetched a cup of liquor, and all four drank together, and the waggon went off. Daffarn and I had part of a granary between us in this yard - I had no oats there. I noticed a particular mark on the sack which was mine. I followed the waggon, and stopped it at Staines, having got a warrant. I told Cowdray he must stop, for I wanted a sack of corn which he had in his waggon - he said he had no sack of corn in the waggon - he said he had only a small parcel of his own. I said I wanted the sack he had from Wheeler, of Bedfont - he made no answer. I got into the waggon, and took the sack out of the front of it. I said, "This is the sack I wanted." He then said he bought it of Wheeler, the hostler, and paid 9 s. for it. I gave him in charge, and sealed the sack up. There were four bushes in it. It is worth 12 s. or 12 s. 6 d. I returned and took Wheeler. I have been in the corn trade twenty years. I have compared a sample from the sack with that in Daffarn's granary - I have no doubt of their being from the same bulk - it is hedge-grown - the ends of the oats are very green, and some are black.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was not a lad named T. Collins in your employ - A. Yes; I have not brought him here; he was examined before the Magistrate - I thought he was the biggest rogue, and therefore have not brought him here. Wheeler said he had borrowed the sack of Collins - he had the care of the sacks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. They had a lantern; what time was it - A. Between five and six o'clock - the landlord was out with the prisoners while they were drinking - he is not here.</p>

            . I was with Monk watching them - we were within four yards of the waggon, and saw Wheeler come up with a sack - (he came out of the yard apparently,) and put it in at the front of the waggon - nobody was present then - he went into the yard, and in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour Cowdray came between the window and the waggon, and paid him between 6 s. and 9 s. in silver - the four drank some gin amongst them. Cowdray went on with the waggon - I kept in sight of him all the way; he did not stop till we stopped him at Staines. Monk got into the waggon, and said, "This belongs to me." It was taken into the public house, and contained four bushels of oats - it appeared full.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Cowdray was not present when it was put into the waggon - A. No, I did not see him with Wheeler till afterwards - he paid the money openly - our window was open, but there was no light in the room - they could not see us.</p>

            . My house is close to the Bell, inn. Monk and Mills were watching at my window up stairs - it is about the height of the tilt of this waggon. I was down stairs with a candle in the window, at work - I heard Cowdray call out "Charles, here is some beans for you." Charles went to the waggon and took them out, and soon after he pased with something on his back.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You missed none - A. No; hedge-grown oats are generally green.</p>

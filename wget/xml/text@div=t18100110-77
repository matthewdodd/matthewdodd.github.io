               <p>Q. Is she a servant in the house - A. No; she said the room was her own. I met her in a public house, I went home with her and went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in bed before you lost the things - A. After I had been in bed a few minutes she got out of bed and made her escape out of the room, my money was in my tobacco box, she took that with her; it was about twenty-five shillings more or less. I heard money rattle in the box as she went out of the door; I missed the breeches that I had pulled off, two old handkerchiefs, and my gaiters; there were three dollars among the money. A few minutes after she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181001100043"></xptr>was gone this man came up and asked me what business I had there, the room was his, he swore I should not be there; he pulled me out of bed; I begged of him to let me stay, for I was robbed; with a deal of persuasion he let me stop. The next morning before day light he wanted me to get up, for there I should be no longer; he pulled me out of bed, opened the window, and swore I should go out one way or the other; he pulled me out of the room and hurled my clothes after me; I put my clothes on and went into the street; I went to the police office, they told me to come down at night; I did, and they had taken the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your things - A. No, none of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen the woman before, had you - A. No; not till I saw her in the public house; I took notice of the woman; I am sure it is her, and I am sure as to the man.</p>

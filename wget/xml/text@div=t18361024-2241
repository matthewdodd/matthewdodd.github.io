                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Chaplin, the stage-coach-proprietor. On the 4th of January, I saw the prisoner making his escape from the constable, who hallooed, "Stop thief"—I made an attempt to stop him—he showed me down—I got up, and ran after him, but he got away—he threw away a pair of stockings and then a bundle—he then took a purse out of his right-hand breeches pocket, and threw it over a hedge into Mr. Gray's fields, by the hay-stack—he next threw a bowl of a spoon into a pond—I marked the place where the things were all thrown, and followed and took him, two or three yards further off, and delivered him to the constable—I then went after the things where he had thrown them—Mr. Cray picked up the purse—I went and showed him the place—I was about two yards from the prisoner when he threw it, and distinctly saw it was a purse—the same purse was found in the fields—I was present when the constable picked up the spoon—the pond was not more than five or six inches deep, and it was clear water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. I was in Mr. Anson's house on the 4th of January—I did not see the prisoner, as I was in the shop behind a screen, talking to Mr. Anson, who was very till—some conversation passed between Miss. Anson and her father—the prisoner had just gone out then—in consequence of what passed, I went after him and took into—I had a bad hand—I had got him by the collar, and as I was taking him into the Rose and Crown, he twisted himself out of my band—I followed, and Chapman took him—I was not many from him—I saw him throw a purse over a hedge close to the road-side, near a hay-stack belonging to Mr. Gray—I was from eight to ten yards behind him at the time—I also saw him throw part of a spoon into the pond by the side of the lane—I told Chapman to hold him while I went and took it out—I produce it—I think it is made of Britannia metal—I took this spoon from his pocket af<lb></lb>terwards—it is of the same metal as the bowl—Gray came up lane at the time we were bringing him back—he and Chapman went to the hay<lb></lb>stack and found the purse—this is it—Gray gave it to me—it contains twelve counterfeit shilling, and one of same sort cut in two.</p>

I have examined all these shilling—they are all counterfeit, and have been produced from the same mould—here are two pieces of another counterfeit shilling, which corresponds with the other twelve—I have seen the bowl of a spoon which appears to me to be of Britannia metal—the shillings are of a similar metal—Britannia metal spoons are frequently melted to make coin of this de<lb></lb>scription—this other spoon is of same description as the bowl—there re different sorts of Britannia metal—some is very superior to this—these shillings are of the inferior quality.</p>

On Saturday, the 16th of October, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I met the two prisoners at the end of Buckingham-street, Strand - they came up to me, one laid hold of each arm, and requested something to drink; they asked me to go and treat them, I said I would not. They wanted me to walk round the corner with them, I said I would not, for I was going home; I had no sooner said the words than one let go my arm, the other held my arm - they immediately gave me a push on my left side, and I fell on my right side.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a hard push - A. Very hard; I immediately missed three 1 l. notes out of my pocket, and laid hold of Smith - the other was running off; I followed her, holding Smith, laid hold of her by the arm, and requested her to give me back the three 1 l. notes which she had stolen from me. She said she had got none of my money, and used very bad expressions. I immediately called the watchman, Donovan, he came, and took them in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel either of their hands in your pocket - A. No, but I think their hands must have been in my pocket at the time they shoved me - the money was in my right-hand breeches-pocket - it was safe just before they attacked me. I had my hand in my pocket just before, and felt it; I pulled my hand out of my pocket when they laid hold of me. I did not button my pocket up, it was then safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Might they not have fallen out - A. No, a piece of writing paper was in my pocket with them, and that was there afterwards.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Martin's in the Fields. About half-past ten o'clock, or near eleven, Walton called me, and gave charge of the two prisoners for robbing him of three 1 l. notes. They walked quietly with me till they came to the churchyard, then Davis put a paper into my hand, and told me to keep it. When I got to the watch-house I gave it to Richard, he opened it in my presence, it was three 1 l. notes, not folded in any thing.</p>

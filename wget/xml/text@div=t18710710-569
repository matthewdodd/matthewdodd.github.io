                  </hi>. I am single—I lived in July and August last at 19, Temple Street, St. George's Road, Newington, with my neice, Mrs. Brown and her husband—the prisoner came into her service in July—Charles Parfitt was a member of the family—he was in very good health—about a fortnight after she came, she went out for a holiday—she came back on the following morning, between 7 and 8 o'clock—she had leave to stay out—the boy had slept with me that night—I got up about 7.30, leaving the boy in bed, in good health, asleep—I went down into the shop—about an hour after I heard a noise, a stifled cry—I went up stairs, I found the prisoner in the act of getting off my bed—the boy was in the bed, crying—I asked him what was the matter, the prisoner said that she thought he had been dreaming—he was in a great state of agitation—he heard me put a question to her—he said "No, I have not been dreaming, Ellen has been trying to strangle me"—I called her by that name—I asked her whether it was true, she said "It is not"—he showed me the way, and put his hands to his mouth and throat—he said "That is the way in which she tried to do it"—his uncle called him into his room, and asked him if it was true—that was not in her presence—she said she did not try to strangle him—the boy said "You did"—he had a sweet in his mouth; I did not see that—his aunt saw that, and asked him what he had in his mouth—I was present—he said he had a sweet in his mouth; Ellen had given it him not to cry—his aunt made him take it out of his mouth directly—Mr. and Mrs. Brown then came up stairs—they called him away into the other room—his mouth was very sore inside the lips—I could not say what kind of sore it was—for two or three days after, the glands of his throat were swollen and tender—I heard her say once she was not fond of children, shortly after this event—she remained a few days after that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was living with my niece, as a relation—she was very delicate, and I assisted her—she engaged the prisoner—I never told her father or mother what I have here to-day—I never communicated with the police; I told several people about it—I was examined before the Magistrate;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100167"></xptr>
               <p>I said, "I have told somebody of it, Mr. Freeman;" I told Mr. Sauders the Same day, I believe—they are not here—as near as I can recollect, I told Mr. Saunders that the prisoner tried to strangle Charles Parfitt—I can't say I used the word "strangle" before to-day—I can't swear the boy said "Ellen has been trying to strangle me"—I believe I told the Magistrate the boy said Ellen had given him a sweet not to cry—this is twelve months ago—I believe I gave the Magistrate the same account as I have given to-day—I said before him, "The boy put his hands to his mouth and throat, and said, 'Ellen's been doing so, and knelt upon my stomach"—I thought I had told all to-day—I took the boy to Mr. and Mrs. Brown—they called me—Mr. Brown came out on the landing, and took the boy in to them—I did not say before the Magistrate, "Mr. and Mrs. Brown came and took the boy away"—I said "Mr. Brown came on to the landing"—I did not discover that the boy's neck was swollen till some days after—I said before the Magistrate, "I looked at his mouth, and found the inside of his lips very sore; his throat was very much swollen"—I did not send for a doctor, and none came—I did something for his sore throat—I rubbed it with hartshorn and oil—I and Charles Parfitt slept in the prisoner's room this night only—the shop is on the ground floor—the kitchen is on the same floor as the shop—at the top of the stairs is the bedroom, on the first story—I was in the shop—when she first came in that morning, she went into the kitchen first, then to her bedroom, where the boy was sleeping—there is no doubt I heard this cry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In consequence of hearing that, I went up stairs at once—I mentioned it to several persons, I daresay—it made an impression on me at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is holiday time now—I go to school at Brecknell, near Windsor—I was not very good friends with Ellen—I did not play with her very much—we did not have many <hi rend="italic">romps</hi> together—I recollect telling the Magistrate I had many <hi rend="italic">romps</hi> with Ellen, and used to play with her—I was asleep when I found Ellen on the bed that morning—I did not hear her come into the room—the first I knew of it was feeling something on my throat—she said "Don't cry, here is a sweet for you"—I didn't think she was going to hurt me—I took the sweet from her—I tried to cry out—I didn't cry out—I made a noise—I could not cry out bud—the Browns were in the next room when this happened—I don't know if the partition is thin—I have heard uncle and aunt talking in the next room—I don't know in what month it took place, or how long ago—I don't know which room is farthest, where the Browns were, or where Betsys was—I don't know when it</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Brown, of 19, Temple Street, the prisoner was in my service—she came in July last—I recollect after her holiday her coming back—that morning my husband and I were in bed asleep; I was awoke by hearing the boy before 8 o'clock, or past—he woke me by coming into my room—his Aunt Betsy was with him—he was agitated, pale, and trembling—he had a sweet in his mouth—my husband was in the room—he had been out of the room on to the landing, and came with the boy and Aunt Betsy—my husband called the prisoner upstairs; she came—I do not know that he said anything to her—I did not hear her say anything to him—I was not out of the room—I looked at the boy's lips almost directly—his aunt said he complained of his lips being very much inflamed inside—I told him to take the sweet out of his mouth, which he said the prisoner had given him not to tell—I did not notice any<lb></lb>thing wrong about his mouth when he went to bed the night before this—nor his throat—I noticed his throat afterwards, about the next day; it was very much swollen—the prisoner said she was at the toilet at the time, she said "How can you say that, Charley?"—he said she was trying to choke him—my husband said nothing to her in my presence—after some time I asked her what she meant by going into Charley's room, she said "Nothing"—she said when he spoke of it "I was at the toilet putting on my cap when he spoke about it"—I had told her what complaint he had made—she said "Oh, Charley, how could you say so?"—I don't think Charley was present then—she ran away on the Thursday following—I gave her notice in the morning, for her insolence—a week's notice—I went over to Mrs. Gardner's, where I saw her the same day—she did not expect to see me there—she said she didn't intend going back to me—I didn't know she had run away till then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If Mrs. Parfitt said I and Mr. Brown fetched the boy, that was incorrect—I had a good written character with her from Mrs. Gardner—I kept her a few days at my house, after this affair—I saw her mother before she left—I told the prisoner, in her mother's presence, never to trifle with human life—before the Magistrate I said "I don't think I did tell her mother, now I come to consider, and if I said anything to her at all it was because I dismissed her, because she was saucy," that is a fact.</p>

               <p>"You naughty boy, I have not"—she said she was at the mirror at the window, taking off her things—I think he continued agitated, and trem<lb></lb>bling, for an hour or two after—his nerves now are generally affected; he will not go to bed, or be left alone—he is especially nervous now when anything of the sort is mentioned.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Portland-place, Walworth-common; I keep a wardrobe. On the 5th of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and asked me to show her some dresses—I showed her three—she said she would purchase one, and would call in hour's time for it—I put it on the bed, for her to call again in an hour's time and pay for it—after she had selected that one I was putting the others away in a box—I had to turn round to do that—she was close to me—I saw her put something under her shawl—she left my shop before I could rise from my knees—just before that there was a shawl lying on a box, wrapped of with a bit of dimity—she had been standing close to the box—when she was gone I missed the shawl—I know it was on the box half an hour before—other person had come in between the time of my seeing it safe and missing it—she did not come back till the Tuesday following, which was a week but one day—she then asked me to let her see some dresses—I said, only those dresses I showed you when you were here last, only this half-mourning one"—I put her in mind that she had been there the last Wednesday—she said she had not been in the house for three weeks, and then said it was a fortnight—I said it was impossible to be a fortnight, for If not the dresses in my possession till the 4th of Aug.—I told her I had missed shawl, and that she took it—she said I was a lying good-for-nothing creator that I had sold the shawl, and charged her with it—I sent for the policeman—I showed her the dress that she had agreed to buy, and never came back</p>

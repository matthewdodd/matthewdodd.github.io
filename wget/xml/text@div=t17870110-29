               <p>I am a patrol of St. Sepulchre's; on the 2d of January, I and my partner Parry were going our rounds, about two in the morning, in Seacoal-lane I saw a man coming down the steps, by the light of the moon I saw he had something in his hands; I stopped in a corner and saw him pass; he stepped on pretty fast, and knocked at No. 24, in Seacoal-lane; I went up to him, and told him he must go along with me; he had four iron bars; I called to a watchman who came to my assistance; I took him by the collar, but he would not go quietly; and I ordered the watchman to spring his rattle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Did not the prisoner cry stop, stop, did not he say he picked them up? - No, he did not.</p>

I asked them whether this could not be settled without their taking us away; they said, no, they must do their duty; they took me and my son-in-law to a public-house, the side of the Poultry-Compter; then they asked if we had any body to come forward on our behalf. I answered I would send to a friend, this was about ten o'clock; they said I might, and I did send to a friend; they found a person to go for me to Mr. Wells; he did not come;

             came for him, and Shearman was surprized to see me there; he asked Mr. Cooper what he wanted, and he told him twenty guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Cooper say what he wanted that twenty guineas for? - Q. Then he said he would return the papers, and keep the informer back; Mr. Shearman went away, and returned with sixteen pounds; he asked me if I had enough to make it twenty guineas; I told him I had none in my pocket; my son-in-law had three pounds, that made it nineteen pounds; Mr. Shearman rolled the nineteen pounds up, and tendered it down to Mr. Cooper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Cooper say any thing? - A. Mr. Cooper said he did not take it in that manner; it was rolled up,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160039"></xptr>and thrown over the settle; Mr. Cooper walked away, and took it up; Howard was walking backwards and forwards out of one room into the other; I cannot say whether he was present during this transaction.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear Mr. Howard say any thing? - A. No further, than he was agreeable to what Cooper did; I was taken to the Lord-Mayor about twelve o'clock; Mr. Cooper had my numerical papers that lay on my table.</p>

               <p>Q. But the papers upon the witnesses table, Mr. Cooper presented to the Lord-Mayor? - A. He did; there was nothing appeared against me, on account of that paper; my Lord was pleased to fine me five pounds, which I was to pay before I was released; I did not pay the five pounds then, I went back to the Compter; my son-in-law paid that.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did you do any thing respecting this prosecution? - A. Yes, on the Friday following, I did, I was persuaded; I went to the Marshal; I saw the Lord-Mayor, and told him the same story as I have here, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, the Lord-Mayor directed this? - A. He did.</p>

               <p>Q. I am told, that what is bred in the bone, is never out of the flesh? - A. I was before a Justice last week, that is the third time; that was a charge of a false woman, I never saw her before in my life from her birth; that was on the lottery business, by an informer.</p>

               <p>JOHN BAILEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Vaillant. Q. Are you son in-law to Mr. French, the last witness? - A. I am; Cooper and Howard came right into my father's apartment; they saw my father with a paper on the table, and some women in the room; they said they had an information against him for taking illegal insurances, and that he must go with them; they searched the women in the room, and let them go; my father asked if it could not be made up without going out of his own place; they said, no. Howard said he would be agreeable to any thing that Cooper was agreeable to; they searched me, and took two or three papers from me; I had put them in my pocket. When they came in, they took my father's papers that were lying on the table, and they took us to a public-house inside of the Compter; they brought out a book, and took our names down; they asked my father if he had any friends to come forward; my father had sent for a friend, and Mr. Shearman came; Shearman spoke to Cooper, I cannot rightly say what he said; I heard Cooper say to Mr. Shearman, twenty guineas; Mr. Shearman went out, and returned in about a quarter of an hour; he brought sixteen pounds in notes with him. When he came in, he said, French, I cannot get any more than sixteen pounds; he said, you must make it up; my father said he had none; he said to me, John, what money have you; I said I had got three pounds; I laid it on the table, and Shearman put it up with the sixteen pounds; he rolled up the sixteen pounds and the three pounds together. Cooper said, chuck them down any where; he chucked them down in the next bench to where we were sitting; Cooper went, and picked them up; then he said, let us go into the next room, there is a good fire there; and when we had been there about five minutes, he said, do not look so chearful, look as you did when you first came in. They gave all the papers back to my father but two; we went to the Mansion-house before the Lord-Mayor, and there two papers were produced; my father was fined five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the five pounds? - A. Yes, I gave it to Cooper; Cooper said, do not give it before any body; my father said, have I occasion to go before the Lord-Mayor again; with that, I walked down the yard, and gave him the five pounds; with that, he said you are cleared, by paying the jail fees.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You and your father were fined five pounds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were cleared after paying the fine of five pounds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>ROBERT SHEARMAN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I live at No. 25, Belvidere-place, Borough-road: On the 4th of February last, I went, at the request of Mr. Wells, to the Poultry-Compter, there I saw Mr. French, Bailey, and Cooper, I never saw Howard before this day, they were the only persons that were in the room, to the best of my recollection, there was a girl that came in to light the fire; when I went in, I asked Mr. French what was the matter; he told me he had been taken up for insuring in the lottery; Cooper, or French, said, (I think it was French) it would be all settled for twenty guineas; I am not positive, I think it was French.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it said in Cooper's hearing? - A. I was sitting between Cooper and French; Cooper said, nothing less than twenty guineas would do; upon which I said I had no twenty guineas, I would go back and inform Mr. Wells; I went out, and returned in about a quarter of an hour; I brought with me twenty pounds, but when I came in, I thought the sum so extravagant, I said, French, I have brought from your friend sixteen pounds, this is all he will give, and I am not authorised to give it, without you will pay it by instalments; upon which French asked his son-in-law (Bailey) if he had any money; Bailey took out three pounds, and said it was all that he had; I took the three pounds, and put it to the sixteen pounds. Previous to that, Cooper said, I will not take any thing, but you may throw it down in any corner, it will answer the same purpose; I took the sixteen pounds and the three pounds, and rolled them together, and threw the whole over the partition of the boxes; there was a curtain between us and the next box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body pick it up? - A. Cooper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160040"></xptr>picked it up, and insisted on having two pounds more before I left the room, to make it up twenty guineas; I said to Cooper, if nothing else will do, I will give you the other two pounds at the Dolphin, on Ludgate-hill, if you will meet me there this evening; he met me there that evening at the public-house; I did not give him the other two pounds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What sort of life are you in; how do you live? - A. I live as you do.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been before a Magistrate; you had the impudence to say, you lived as I did; have you ever been in gaol? - A. I have for debt and for the lottery.</p>
               <p>Q. For selling illegal policies? - A. I had the opinion of the first lawyers in the kingdom that they were legal; I have been before the Lord Mayor; I was before a Magistrate once before, and once at Hick's hall, a man took me in the street for the little-go.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you live? - A. I have had a liberal education; I have in my present employ two guineas a week, and I earn a guinea now and then, when I can; I settle matters between people.</p>

I lodge at Mr. Orchard's, who keeps the King William the Fourth, at Kensal-green—I had the misfortune to break my leg, ant on Tuesday, the 23rd of July, I was confined to my bed—it was the day after the accident; the prisoner came into my room while I was in bed—my trowsers laid in a chair by my bedside—I saw him take them out of the chair, turn round to the window, and while they were in his band I heard my money rattle—I had two half-crowns and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. there—I was too ill to move at the time—I dared not move—he laid the trowsers down, turned himself round, and went to the cupboard at the foot of the bed to open it—I saw him draw his hand down from the cupboard, put it into his waistcoat pocket, and walk out of the room—next day I heard an alarm in Mr. Orchard's room—I then took my trowser off the chair, found my money was gone, and called out, "I have been robbed too"—the prisoner was brought into my room—I told him he was the person who had taken it—he said he would make me prove my words—I said I would do so im<lb></lb>mediately I got well.</p>

Mr. Cunningham, Vicar of Harrow—I lived three months with him—before that I lived for twelve months with Mr. Brand, of the Trea<lb></lb>sury—I left him to better my situation, as I was out of livery at Harrow—the Vicar has not afforded me any relief while I have been ill—that was not because he found out I had brought the accident on myself by being drunk—he never told me the reason—I had drank before I hired the chaise—I hired it of Mr. Mingay, at the White Lion, Edgeware-road—I</p>

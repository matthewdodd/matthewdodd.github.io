                  </hi>. I live at 26, Wentworth Street, Whitechapel—on 27th September, between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, I was walking along the Commercial Road with my mother, who is eighty years of age—I was helping her across a street, a man pushed against her, put his hand on my breast, snapped the watch and half the chain away, and my bonnet, and ran away; I ran after him, crying, "Stop thief I"—I saw him throw my bonnet into the road as he ran—another man came and told me to run into New Street, and I should find him there—I do not know either of the prisoners.</p>

I am a clerk, and reside with my mother, at 26, Charles Street—about 5.6 on this afternoon, I saw the prosecutrix and her mother crossing Mulberry Street—I saw Hughes rush up against the prosecutrix, pitch her over on her mother, and run down Mulberry Street, closely followed by another, who I recognized as a man named Dyster, but at the Police Court the evidence was so much in his favour that he was discharged—Hughes made a snatch, and thereby I saw his front face, carrying away the prosecutrix's bonnet—he ran down the street, carrying the bonnet in his hand—as I stopped to pick up the old lady, I saw him at the corner disen<lb></lb>tangle the bonnet with his left hand, and throw it into the street—after having righted the old lady, I followed round the street, but saw no one—I identified Hughes at the station next morning.</p>

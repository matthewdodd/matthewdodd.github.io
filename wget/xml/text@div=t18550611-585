                  </hi>. I am a master mariner, and live at No. 96; Leman-street, Whitechapel On the evening of 14th May, about a quarter to 7 o'clock, I was walking along Leadenhall-street with my wife—I had in my pocket a silver watch with a gold Albert chain; I had seen it safe about five minutes before missing it—as I was walking along I felt some<lb></lb>thing touch my pocket, and felt the watch go away—I immediately turned and found the prisoner alongside of me on the pavement—I took hold of him by the collar, and told him he had taken my watch—he denied it—there were severalpersons by him in the street, but none connected with him that I could see—I told him a second time that he had taken my watch; he said, "I have not"—Mr. Bevan came from the opposite side of the road, and the prisoner then put the watch into my left hand—he said nothing when he did that—I had kept him by the collar from the time I first seized him—the officer came up immediately, and I gave him into custody.</p>

I was in Leadenhall-street on the day in question, and heard Mr. Baxter call "Police!"—I went across—he had the prisoner by the collar—I took hold of him likewise, and saw him pass a watch and chain to the prosecutor—he said nothing at the time; he said at the station that another man had given it to him.</p>

I had accused the prisoner of it, and he said he had no money - he was then searched, and said he had a half-penny and penny, which were his own, but he denied the other; I did not see them found, but the officer asked if they were mine - he was taken to the watch-house. I went there in about a quarter of an hour - I then asked him where the silver was, and he said he had thrown it, in a white kid glove, down an area in Mount-street, next door to a plumber's; I went there, and a person brought the glove up, with this shilling and sixpence in it.</p>

I took this glove out of his pocket, and there was nothing in it; he afterwards took it, and put it into his pocket again; it was afterwards given to me by Mrs. Lord, with 1s. 6d. in it.</p>

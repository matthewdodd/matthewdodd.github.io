The prisoner came and told he was to buy three hogsheads of beer for three gentlemen, and that he liked it so well, he would have one himself; so he bought four hogsheads, casks and all, at eighteen pounds. I sent them according to his order, to the Three Cranes by water. He pull'd out a twenty pound note, said it was upon a very rich gentleman, and the money would be safely paid me. He wrote his name on it, and gave it me. I gave him in change forty shillings.

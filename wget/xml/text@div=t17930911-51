            , when there was no such a transfer made, nor did such names exist in the books, and that though there was a transfer to Elizbeth Harrison, yet there was none for any such sum as six hundred pounds? he said he had lost the first receipt, and knowing the difficulty there was of getting a second receipt of the clerks at the Bank, he had filled up this receipt from memory; and that was the way he accounted for signing names that did not exist in our books; Mrs. Harrison was present at the same time, and she was evidently in great perturbation of mind, hardly knowing what to say on the business, she said she expected to find six hundred pounds, but she thought he did not mean to defraud her; and that she said to me, and that she said before the justice; but seeing these improprieties on the face of the receipt, and comparing it with the transfer book I thought it my duty to take it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any other thing that passed? - I cannot say any more than I have said.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 92). I was on duty, on Friday morning, 23d April, at Church Street, Deptford, about half-past 8 o'clock—Isaw Kennedey coming out of the shop of Butler—that was the first time I had seen him—the shop is about 200 yards off the premises where the robbery took place—I went into the shop, and asked Butler what the man had sold who had just gone out; he said, "Some fat;" I said, "How much?" he said, "About a quarter of a cwt;" I said I expected it was stolen, as a man who worked at Mr. Hills' was suspected; he said, "I hope not"—he showed me the fat in a tub in the yard—I examined it, and said, "I have no doubt that is Mr. Hills' property, being raw fat"—Butler did not then say what he gave for it—I asked him to take care of it, and I would go and find the prisoner Kennedey—I went to Mr. Hills', and, during the time I was there, Kennedey passed by the shop door, in the same dress he has on now—when I first saw him, he had a fustian jacket on—he might have had a smock, but I did not see it—I went out and stopped him, and asked him what account he had to give of the fat sold at "Noble's"—Butler's shop is gene<lb></lb>rally known by the name of "Noble's;" it used to be kept by a man of that name, and that name is over the door—he said he met a man in the New Town who gave him the fat to sell—I then asked him what he had done with the bag, and the money he got for it; he said he had given it to the man who was waiting for him at the corner of Giffin Street—he did not say what money—I asked him where his coat was; he said he had been home to break<lb></lb>fast, and had left his jacket at home; I said, "I expect you have left the bag as well, for I don't believe your story; I shall take you into custody"—I then took him into Mr. Hills' shop—he there repeated the statement about the man meeting him—I said I should charge him with the unlawful posses<lb></lb>sion of the fat; he turned round, and said, "You can't swear to the fat"—I took him to the station, and searched him, and found on him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I asked him how he accounted for the possession of so much money; he said, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. belonged to him, the other was money he had got</p>

               <p>for the fat; I said, "I thought you told me you gave the money you got for the fat to the man;" he said, "I did not tell you so; I told you I meant to give the money to the man"—on my way, I looked in at Butler's shop—he identified the man, and gave me up the fat—he said there was 1qr. 18lbs.—hesaid he gave 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I showed the fat that Butler gave me to Mr. Hills, at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father; we carry on busi<lb></lb>ness at High Street, Deptford, as tallow merchants. Kennedey has been in our service about five years—on the morning of 23d April, he was brought in by the constable—he generally goes to his breakfast about 8 o'clock—whilethe constable was speaking to him, he turned round and said, "Mr. Hills cannot swear to the fat"—Crouch charged the prisoner—I was after<lb></lb>wards shown the fat—there was about 45 lbs. or 46 lbs.—the value is 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we gave that price for it the day before—it is a peculiar description of fat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You do not know it was the same fat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot swear to it—it was the same description as that we had bought—if it had been collected more than three or four days, it would have been more putrid—Ido not think there are any men who go about and collect fat from the butchers to sell to the melters—I believe that the melters are the only purchasers.</p>

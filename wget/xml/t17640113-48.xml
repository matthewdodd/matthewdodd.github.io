The next morning he sent one of the watchmen for me again; he wanted more money; I lent him half a guinea more on it; after that I saw him go past my door; I said, so I see you are cleared; he said he was going for a friend, to ask him to appear for him; I never heard more of him till after he was taken again for stealing a spoon; then I went before the Justice, and produced this piece of money.</p>

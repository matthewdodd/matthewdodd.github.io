                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Sutton, in Surrey—on 21st February, 1863, I let my furnished house there to the prisoner by this written agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is an inventory of the furniture, knives, forks, and glass—besides the articles contained in this inventory, there was a telescope, a pistol and case, a game-bag, a pair of boots, a shot<lb></lb>bag, an inkstand, a fishing-rod, a landing-net, and a walking-stick—they were Napoleon boots, which had belonged to my late husband, and were nearly new; they cost two guineas; they were riding-boots for the chaise, and came up above the knee—besides the knives in the inventory, there were some new ones which had not been used, and which I did not intend the prisoner to use unless he had company—I told the servant I should fetch them away, and if the prisoner had not enough she was to come to me for them, as I lived close by—I left the telescope, and pistol and case in the store-room—I told him there was a telescope, and he might have it to view the country with, but when I called once or twice he said he had not seen it; that was about a fortnight after he took possession, and by the date of the ticket it had been pawned then—he wanted to buy the pistol—I said that I would not sell it, but would leave it on the premises—the game-bag hung up in a closet, and I had no idea that it was taken, or the shot-bag either—he said that if I wanted to part with the boots he should like to purchase them, but he did not pay me for them—I said that if he liked to fish in the grounds he might use the fishing-rod—the rent was to be paid every three months from the day he commenced, and about a fortnight after, 21st May,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186408150059"></xptr>
               <p>I heard that he had left—he gave me no notice, but under-let the house—I did not go into it then, but in September I found it shut up, and no one in it—I then went, and missed these things—the first quarters rent was paid—the tenant to whom the prisoner let it disappeared two days before the rent was due—I heard nothing of Keily till June this year, when I found he was living in John-street, Hercules-buildings—I went there with a police<lb></lb>man, and found the servant Harriett Wiltshire, whom I had discharged, but who Keily said might stay with him if she liked—I there found the articles I have mentioned—I did not see the prisoner after that day till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were the things included in the inventory all in the house when you got possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he has taken many more besides these—there are a great many things missing from the house, and the garden utensils also—I did not say before the Magistrate," There is nothing miss<lb></lb>ing from the house that is in the inventory"—this is my signature to my depositions, but that is a mistake—none of the things I am complaining of were in the inventory, but they are not near what he has taken away—I did not leave these things in the care of my servant; I discharged her, and Mr. Keily took her—I had confidence in her, but I did not leave her in the house as my servant—I only left the knives with her—these things were not included in the inventory because I left them for his amusement, and I might want the telescope, and then I could go and take it away when I pleased—he was to be there two years, and I could take away anything that was not in the inventory—I left these things in the store-room; it was only the knives that I left in the servant's possession, but the servant knew that the other things were left there quite as well as myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlady of 4, John-street, Hercules-buildings—the prisoner came to lodge in my house, with a person he represented as his wife, on 12th September, 1863—they lived there till June; they oc<lb></lb>cupied the second-floor front room, and went by the name of Mr. and Mrs. Edwards—I was present when the policeman and Mrs. Butler came, and saw them find the things in the room occupied by the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you tell him the policeman had been to inquire for him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he said that he had nothing to fear; that Mrs. Butler had stolen his things, and he would go to the station and see after her.</p>

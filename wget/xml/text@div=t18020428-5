               <p>Q. Was it quite dark? - A. Yes, it was; I had a light in the shop; I had occasion to go into the cellar, I was gone about two minutes, when I heard somebody at the street-door; a child was sent, but saw nobody; a short time afterwards, the same noise was heard again at the door, I was still in the cellar; the same noise was heard a third time; I then blew out the candle, and crept forty up stairs; when I got to the top of the stairs, I saw the door three parts open, I had left it on the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body gone out of the house while you went into the cellar? - A. No one soul.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure the latch was down? - A. I am; I turned my eye to the left, and saw the prisoner at the bar with one boot in his hand in the shop; I had left it hanging up on one side of the shop, and he was reaching for more; I immediately laid hold of him, and called for assistance; he then said, he hoped I would not hurt him, the constable has got the boot; the fellow to it was hanging up close by it; I am positive to the boot being mine.</p>

I am a police-sergeant I saw the female prisoner in her way to Mr. Nursey's house, with a white mug in her hand—about ten minutes after, she was returning, and passed me on the other side of the way, and appeared to have a bar of soap—I saw the officer stop her—I crossed over, and heard her say she was going washing, and had none at home—she ran from the shop-door into the passage, where they make candles—I ran after her, and the male prisoner said, "Good God, what is the matter?" she said, "It is about this soap which you have bought of Mr. Nursey, you know"—he said, "Yes, it is all right"—I asked for Mr. Nursey—he said he was in bed, and he would go and call him—I said I should <hi rend="italic">go</hi> myself—he went with me—he knocked at the room-door, and said, "Will you step down, sir"—Mr. Nursey said, "What is the matter?"—he said, "It is about some soap which I have taken, and intended my wife to pay for—I asked Mr. Nursey if he allowed his servants to take soap—he said, "No," and said, Cattle, you have got yourself into a pretty mess"—the female prisoner was taken to the station-house—I went with the male prisoner to his lodging, and asked him if there was any thing belonging to Mr. Nursey there—he said, "No"—I said we were going to see—he then said there was soap, but it did not all belong to Mr. Nursey—Mr. Nursey found a quantity in a cupboard—there was 20 1/2 lbs., and three cakes of scented soap in a box under the bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tallow-chandler, and live in Whitehall-place, Kentish-town. On the 12th of October, I was called up by the police-sergeant—the male prisoner said to me, that he had taken a cake of soap, but he meant to pay me for it, and the policeman had stopped his wife with it—when I came down, he said he meant to pay me for it, and he hoped I would have mercy on him—I said I did not believe him, he had got me into a pretty mess, as well as himself—I went to his lodging, with the policeman, and found 20 1/2 lbs. of soap in a cupboard—I could not swear it was mine—I do not make soap—it is such as I bad by me—the prisoner used to buy soap of me, for his own use, three or four years ago—I do not believe he meant to pay me for this—he has been with me seven years, and bore a good character—I had no suspicion before—he could not want this soap, because he had plenty of the same kind at home—what I found at his house was new soap—he had no authority to sell, except when the shop was open, and it was not time for the shop to be open—it usually opens about seven o'clock—I keep a book to enter all things sold—there is no entry of this soap in the book.</p>

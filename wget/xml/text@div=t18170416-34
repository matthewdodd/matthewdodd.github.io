On the 20th of March last, I went out in the morning with my father; I returned at twelve, and found my box broken open, and the articles stated in the indictment gone; we left my mother at home, but she was gone out. I found the door shut, but not locked. I was going to the Cross Keys, In Bolton-street, with some goods, about half past eleven o'clock, and saw the prisoner within about twenty yards of my lodging, with a bundle. I did not suspect her, but when I found I had been robbed, I went to look for her - I could not find her at her lodgings. On the 23d of March she was taken up.</p>

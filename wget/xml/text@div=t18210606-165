            . I am an officer. On the 26th of May, about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, I was in Whitecross-street, and saw the prisoner about six hundred yards from these stables, with a bag on his back. I watched him up a court - he knocked at a door - a naked child opened it. One Tee, who keeps a horse and cart, lives there. I asked what he had there - he said corn; that he worked for a corn-chandler close by, and brought it from there. I said,</p>
               <p>"Take it up, and go to the place." When he got in the street, he said he was Smith's hostler, and brought it from him, and begged I would let him go - it was oats, beans, and chaff. I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060076"></xptr>him to Mr. Smith, who asked, how he could do it - he said he took it from the granary.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Were you set to watch - A. No - he did not say they were not his master's, or that they were his perquisites.</p>

            . The bag is not mine - I asked how he could be so ungrateful as to rob me - he said, he took it out of the granary - he never pretended that he had a right to them - he had been eight years with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you settle with him - A. I deliver him three bushels at a time, and he is to pay me for it. If horses go away without eating their corn, I do not allow it him - I never gave him leave to take any - I expect him to pay me for the corn whatever he makes of it. If I receive the amount of the corn I am satisfied.</p>

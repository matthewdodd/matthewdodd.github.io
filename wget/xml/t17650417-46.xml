She was going out, but I said, Modly, you have not paid for your beer; she said no, nor she never would: I perceived she had something about her. I took her back; my wife went up stairs and miss'd the things; she was charged with taking them: she took them out of her pocket, and delivered them to my wife; she owned she had taken the sheet and stockings out of the drawer up stairs; she is very young. I look upon it, that a man who used to come after her brought her to this.</p>

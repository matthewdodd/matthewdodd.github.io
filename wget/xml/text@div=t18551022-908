                  </hi>. I am an excavator, and have been employed in tie Crimea. I arrived at Gravesend three weeks ago, on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Wild<lb></lb>fire</hi>—the prisoner was on board that ship—he came from Balaklava—my duty was to trim the lamps—on Friday, 28th Sept., about half past 9 o'clock in the evening, I was going to bed, and one of the men brought down the signal lamp, and said it would not burn—I looked at it, and took out the wick—I got a piece of fresh wick and put it in, and was going to light it—the prisoner said that I should not light it—I said I would—I was going to light it, and he blew it out—I took the lamp out of the case, and walked a pace or two from him, with my back towards him—he came behind me, and knocked both the lamps out of my hand—I had one lamp that was alight, and the lamp that was alight went out—I asked him what he had done that for—he never said anything—I said to one of the men, "Light the lamp, if you please, and I will see whether he is going to rule the place"—I told the prisoner I would hit him—when the lamp was lighted, I went up to him, and asked what he did that for—I struck at him, and he stabbed me in the neck with a knife—I hit him again, and he stabbed me again—I gave him five, six, or a dozen hits—I walked away, and Mr. Taylor, the captain's clerk, said, "What is the matter?"—I told him, and he told me to go to the surgery, and he would send the doctor—I had one wound in the back of the neck, and one on my arm—I was quite sober.</p>

On Thursday the prisoner came into master'e shop for a pair of shears that we had to grind; I delivered the shears to him; there was only me in the shop; master met him at the door, just coming out. I was looking on the counter for the shears, and while I was looking, the prisoner was standing by the shelf that was behind the door, where the knives and forks were. He had his apron up when he went out; I suppose he put them in there. I suppose he put them in his apron while I was looking on the counter. I am sure I did not see him do any thing. I went with master's son to the pawnbrokers; I saw two small desert knives; I knew them; the prisoner's wife was offering them to pawn, and the prisoner's wife was waiting; the pawnbroker sent information to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the pawnbrokers - A. No. I went out for an officer, and as I came back; I saw the prisoner at the door; I knew him.</p>

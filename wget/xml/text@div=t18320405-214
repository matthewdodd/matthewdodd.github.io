            . I am an officer. I was sent for to Mr. King's public-house; Mr. King's sister charged the prisoner with taking three quarterns of rum; she said, in his presence, that she saw him draw it from the cask - he did not deny it; I took him into custody, and as I took him along he threatened the prosecutor that he would do for him and his sister also; he said he had taken the rum, that they could only send him to Newgate, but could not hang him.</p>

I did not see him draw the rum, but I saw him with three-quarterns of rum - he was going to take it out into the yard with some empty pots, which he had in his hand; he had the rum in another pot - no customer had ordered it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me draw it? A. No, I heard you draw it: I was alone in the bar, and when I looked I saw you setting the mug down - the tap leaks, and there is a half-pint pot under it to catch the leakings, but you

I came home at ten o'clock - my sister informed me she had caught the prisoner taking the rum; that he had gone out to collect his pots, instead of which he had taken his clothes away by throwing them over the next wall, and absconded - I was in search of him till nine o'clock at night, when I found him asleep at a public-house in Jewin-street; I told him the charge; he swore and abused me very much - he had been thirteen months in my employ; I took him in out of charity, and gave him 4s. a week; he had not a farthing when he came to me.</p>

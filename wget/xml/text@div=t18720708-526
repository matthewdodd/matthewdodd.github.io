                  </hi>. I am a watch maker—previous to and a short time after the robbery I carried on business at 118, Fenchurch Street—on Thursday, 30th May, I left my premises about 7.45 in the evening—I locked the watches in a drawer in the iron safe, and locked the outer door—I kept the keys in my pocket—the next morning I got there about 11 o'clock—I found</p>

I am a pawnbroker, of 253, Goswell Road—on 4th June, about 5.30 p.m., the prisoner came into my shop and offered this silver watch in pledge—I asked him whose watch it was, he said it was his own—he asked me first of all to lend him 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., then he said he had had it in for 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before, and I could advance him the same amount if I liked—I had seen a list of property alleged to have been stolen and I asked the prisoner how long he had had the watch—he said it belonged to him, and he had had it four years—I asked him if it had been out of his possession—he said yes, he had had it once cleaned—I then asked him his name—he said John Lewis—I asked him where he resided—he said "13, Charles Street, New North Road"—I said "I suppose 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would answer your purpose?"—he said "Yes"—I then feigned to take the watch in pledge, and begun writing the ticket—he said he purchased it four years back in Shoreditch—while I was entertaining him with these questions, I had sent a messenger out to a house where I thought they would know whether it was one of the watches—he began to get uneasy—another customer came in—the prisoner stood behind him for a moment and then started out of the shop, and ran up the road as hard as he could go, leaving the watch—I had given him no money—I sent my assistant after him, who brought him back to the shop—I had sent for a constable, he came, and also the party who I had sent for came into the shop and identified the watch—it was one of Mr. Dicker's people—I don't know his name.</p>

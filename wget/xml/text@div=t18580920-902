I went to where the geese were, and saw a man named Adams killing them, and the prisoner standing with a stick in his hand, keeping them in a ditch—the men escaped, and I followed them—the prisoner had a sack on his shoulder, which I saw him throw into some bushes—I picked it up and found a goose, which I knew belonged to my father—I went to the police-station and charged the prisoner.</p>

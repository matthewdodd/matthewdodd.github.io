            What is your business - A. I buy pigs, calves, or any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this horse that was lost by Curtis - A. Yes, I bought it of the prisoner at the bar on the Wednesday before Christmas; I gave him a guinea and a half for it. He was very poor when I bought him; I thought he might get a little better; I lit on him just at the corner of Worship-street; I asked him if he was going to sell this horse; he said, yes; he asked three guineas and a half; I bid him twenty-shillings five, and when he came to Sun-street, I gave him a guinea and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the horse you bought of Ingram the prisoner - A. I kept the horse about a week, and sold it to Mr. Mash for a guinea and a half again. Mr. Mash had it, and I had it again soon afterwards; he could not do any thing with it; he was going to knock it on the head; I bought it again; I had the horse at home about a week, and then I had it owned by Mr. Tomkins; he met me in the road; he said the horse belonged to Curtis; he would bring him down in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver the horse to Curtis. - A. Yes, they took me to Worship-street, and there they identified the horse to be Mr. Curtis.</p>
               <p>Q. to Curtis. That horse that the last witness delivered back to you was the same that you lost on the common - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had him - A. From about the 11th of September.</p>

               <p>Mr. LOW. Q. Do you remember the horse that formerly belonged to Upton that afterwards belonged to Curtis - A. Yes, a rusty brown horse.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen Curtis have it - A. Yes, a little before Christmas I saw it at Worship-street; it was then in Mr. Peck's possession; Curtis was there; he delivered it to Curtis.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a man on the road; I bought it for twenty-five shillings; I brought it on the road till that gentleman bought it of me; and when I lit on him again, he said he had lost the horse, and if I would give him the money again, he would not hurt me.</p>

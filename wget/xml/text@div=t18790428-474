                  </hi>. I live at 79, Murray Street, New North Road, Islington, and am a metal-worker employed at the Sekforde Glass Works, in St. James's Walk, Clerkenwell—the prisoner was employed there as a foreman——the deceased, Maurice Thomas William Cole, was also employed there as a glass driller—on Wednesday morning, 9th April, I was at work there at 7 o'clock—I saw the prisoner and deceased there that morning—they did not work in the same shop—I saw the prisoner return to his work after breakfast at 9 o'clock—the deceased went into the farther shop—the prisoner was then at work at the vice in his own shop—the deceased would have to pass through the shop where the prisoner was in order to get to his work—the shops are separated by an archway in the wall—I was working in the same shop as the prisoner—about 10 o'clock something happened which attracted my attention, it was a dull, heavy thud—I turned my head round and saw the prisoner standing with his back against the bench he the other shop in a striking attitude—I had not seen him leave the shop where I was at work—he had this iron spanner raised in his right hand—I guessed there was something wrong, and I said to Mr. Pace, the prisoner's father, "For God's sake, be quick"—he was working at the next vice but one to me—I rushed into the other shop, but I made a falter just as I got into the shop—there was no one else in the shop besides the prisoner and deceased—the deceased was on the ground in a sitting position, with his back against the press—he was bleeding and appeared to be senseless—when I made a falter, Mr. Pace, senior, being more courageous than me, rushed forward and elasped his son round the shoulders—I had not made any noise as I Went in, only in running and scuffling along as quick as I could—at the time the father clasped the prisoner round the arms, he was raving as though he was out of his mind; he had his hands still raised, he did not seem to know what he was doing, he was raving and flourishing about—he said, "Let me go, let me go"—the father said "For Christ's sake, Harry, what are you doing of"—he still had this spanner in his hand—I said, "For God's sake, Harry, give me this, don't use this," and he let me take it out of his hand—he kept on raving, and said, "Let me go, let me go; I want to go, I shan't hurt him, I shan't hurt him"—I took the spanner downstairs, and put it on one side out of sight, and it was handed to the policeman—I saw Wm. Bates come up from below—a constable was sent for, and the prisoner was taken into custody, and the deceased was taken in a cab to the hospital—I have not seen the prisoner and deceased talking together before this, only in the way of business—the prisoner has said to me that he thought it was very wrong of the deceased to act as he had done towards him after he had been such a friend to him; he said he thought he was a very bad man, after he had treated him so well, and then to induce his daughter to go away with him and then not to marry her—he has said that many times—I cannot tell when it was that he said this, perhaps a week before this occurrence—he</p>

               <p>has not spoken lately, he has been so sullen—he had not spoken to anybody for three days, not since the Thursday, when he found out that his daughter had got a child—there was a great change in him from that time—he was sober at this time, he is a sober man, I never saw him otherwise—he had not been long from breakfast when this occurred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been at these works eighteen years—I have known the prisoner that time; for the past seven years he has been foreman of the works, he has always been very good to the men under him—he has not lately spoken to the deceased, except in the way of business—the de<lb></lb>ceased seemed to avoid him—he wished to be friends with the deceased—I heard nothing in the nature of a threat on Pace's part towards Cole—there was a very great change in his manner after the Thursday; it was generally remarked; I was asked what was the matter with him, and I said I did not know, I thought it was some family affair, something fresh had turned up—he did not talk to the men as he did before, only if you wanted a job you had to ask for it, he kept on with his work at his vice—Cole's place was about 37 or 38 feet from where I was at work—it would be about 40 feet from wall to wall—the second shop was the one Cole was working in; the work was drilling glass—Pace was making frames in my shop—the work causes a good deal of noise, there is a continual knocking when putting the frames together—I was at a vice screwing levers on a frame—that would not cause noise—if all the men were at work there should be eleven, but several were out that morning—there were four in the shop I worked in, and Pace and Cole in the other shop—the spanner is used for taking the metal out of winding, for bending bars—in the ordinary work the spanner was used by a man named Tull—Tull was away that day; he worked in the second shop, the spanner lay on his bench—Cole worked about 8 or 9 feet from him—in making frames the prisoner, in Tull's absence, would have to use the spanner; he would go into that shop and work with it there—I had been on friendly terms with Pace—he was talking to me as a friend when he spoke about his daughter, he seemed very much distressed about it—I have never been to his house—I saw him with his daughter Lucy on the previous Thursday, when he found out that his daughter Lizzie had gat the child.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> On this morning the prisoner was working in the shop where I was, making frames—if he wanted a frame, the man not being there to get it out, he would go and get it himself; and in doing so he would use the spanner in the shop where Cole was.</p>

I am the prisoner's father, and live at 80, St. James's Road, Holloway—I have worked at these glass works eighteen years—the prisoner has worked there twenty-five years and two months—I remember Cole coming to work there, about two years ago—I understood he came from the country—some time back the prisoner was living at Enfield—he is married and has eight children; Lizzie, the eldest, is twenty-one, Lucy is eighteen, and the next thirteen or fourteen; they lived at home with their father, their mother is living—Cole was in the habit of visiting the prisoner at Enfield—I have seen him there—he afterwards lodged in the same house—he left Enfield about last April, and went to live in Arlington Street, Clerkenwell—Lizzie left her home about the last week in June last year, I did not then know where she went—I afterwards learnt that she went to</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My son is 43 years of age—he has been nearly 26 years at this one place—he went there as a lad at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he worked steadily on till he rose to be foreman at 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week at this time—I have frequently been to see him at his home at Southgate or Enfield—I re<lb></lb>member Cole coming to the works as a stranger; my son was very kind to him, and invited him to go down to Southgate on the Sunday to spend the afternoon thrre—as time went on I heard that Cole was going to marry Lizzie—I have seen Cole at the house, but that was before I was aware they were engaged to be married—my son has always been a kind and affectionate father to his children, attentive in every respect—he has been very anxious and distressed ever since last June, when his daughter left home; that had increased during the few day's before the Thursday, but from the Thursday there was a very marked change in him—from Saturday, 29th March, until Tuesday, 1st April, he had been kept at home ill—I went to see him on the Monday (I live in town); he seemed very ill indeed then everything was entirely changed in his manner; he was sitting by the fire with a coat over his shoulders; he had only just got up—he said his head was that bad he did not know what to do; he could get no sleep—he never got off his chair while I was there—finding him so ill I asked him to come and sleep at my house, and he did so on the Tuesday and Wednesday evenings—he seemed very ill then; he complained about his bead, and wanting sleep and could not get it; he was in that condition on the Thursday morning, and on the Thursday he heard this about the child.</p>

I am a clerk in an office in Tavistock Street, and live in Avenue Road, Southgate—I have known the prisoner intimately for about four years, as, nearly as I can recollect—I have been in the habit of travel<lb></lb>ling with him by train, upon an average of three or four, nights a week, not quite so frequently of late, as I had been laid up with a bad foot and did not go by the particular train he used to go by—on the Tuesday evening previous to this affair I was with him in the same carriage, I noticed that he was very dejected indeed—the station at which I get out is Southgate, and his is Oakleigh Park—I did not go to Oakleigh Park with him that even<lb></lb>ing, but I had on several previous evenings gone with him—that might have been perhaps three weeks previously, and several odd evenings, but I cannot exactly say the dates; that was in consequence of what I saw in his manner, knowing as I did certain circumstances connected with him, and finding such a difference in his manner and style I thought possibly it would be better to accompany him home, as I feared something might be the consequence—I really feared, owing to the alteration in his mind and the breaking down of his health, that he would perhaps commit an act of suicide.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He went pretty regularly to his work at this time, he used to go at 4 o'clock in the morning—I cannot say that he did his work, I knew that he went—I knew the cause of his dejection, it was on account of his family misfortunes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am eighteen years of age—I have been living at home with my father and mother at Southgate—since September last there has been a great change in my father's manner and behaviour at home—I noticed that since my sister went from home, it gradually increased—on Saturday 29th March, he went to bed, he was very ill and he was at home until the following Tuesday, he complained of his head—on Tuesday and Wednesday nights he slept at my grandfather's house, he was at home on the evening of Thursday and Friday; I thought him very quiet and strange to all of us to what he used to be—on the Sunday morning I was afraid he was going to make away with himself, he was very strange—on the Wednesday morn<lb></lb>ing before he went to town, my mother got out of bed and hid his razor—we sat up for him till 12 o'clock on Monday evening the 7th, and I think he came home between one and two—he did not know where, he had been—he said, he found himself at High Barnet, and he did not know how he got home—he had no business at High Barnet, but had gone beyond his station—on the Wednesday morning I was not up when the prisoner went to work, but mother told me, of his going.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner went to St. Bartholomew's Hospital when he was ill on the Tuesday—on Wednesday morning previously his razor was put away—I went to see my sister the Wednesday week before and found her with the child—my mother told my father of it on the Thursday night.</p>

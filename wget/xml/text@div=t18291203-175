On the 4th of November, between four and five o'clock, I observed the prisoner loitering about the premises - I watched, and saw him come into the warehouse and try four locks by taking hold of the doors and shaking them; I was out of sight - he was a stranger; the warehouse door has a lattice work to it - he put his hand through, and tried the lock again; he went out, cut a birch-broom to pieces, and took the stick, which forms a hook, put it through the lattice work, and fastened it on some shot bags, and was drawing it towards him but was disturbed - he went out, came back, pulled something out of his pocket, and got his stick back again; he was again disturbed, took his stick and went out - came in again, and put it through the opposite door - he went up stairs, got over the bannisters, through the lattice into the warehouse; I then came out from where I was concealed, and had him secured.</p>

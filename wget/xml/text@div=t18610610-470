                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, T</hi> 7). I had a communication with the prosecutor, and in consequence of information he gave me I went on Wednesday, 8th May, about a mile and a half Below the Wagon and Horses, on the Uxbridge-road, in the parish of Hayes—I saw Hughes and Cook come along with a wagon loaded with hay—Cook was riding on the hind part of the load, and Hughes was driving the horses—I followed them to the Waggon and Horses—they pulled up nearly opposite the stable door, within about a yard or so—Cook then got off the load—Hughes and Cook then walked to Wright, the ostler, who was then in the road, about eight or nine paces off—they stood close by him, apparently in conversation, for two or three minutes—they then left him minding a horse and chaise, and they came back to the load of hay—Cook got up on the top—Hughes laid hold of the horse's head and put it a little towards the stable, in such a way that; the end of the load was close to the stable-door—Cook then put down one of the eight trusses that were on the load Behind, and Hughes took it into the stable—I was from fifteen to twenty yards off—Hughes then came out, laid hold of the horse's head, and drew it on three or four paces, and put it before the trough—I then came up—Cool had got off the load—I asked them why they left that truss of hay which they took into the stable—they both said that they had started with a load and had got a load then—I said, "You have left a truss in the stable, and you have started with more than a load, for there were eight trusses Behind, and now there are only seven"—they both said then that they had not taken any into the stable—I told Hughes that Cook had put it down, and that he had taken it in—he said that he had not—I then went into the stable, and found a truss of clover hay under the manger—it weighed fifty-six pounds—I brought it out and said, "I believe this to be the truss that you left"—they both said they knew nothing about it, and had left none—I told them I should take them into custody for stealing that truss of hay—I took them to the station—I then called Wright and asked him whether he knew what they had left it for—he said that he did not, in the presence of the two other prisoners—I asked the landlord if he knew what they left it for, and he said that he did not know; that the stables were in the occupation of the ostler, who had the full charge of them—I then took Cook and Hughes to the station, and then came back for Wright—I told him that I was come back to take him in custody for receiving two trusses of clover hay, yesterday evening, knowing it to be stolen, and to be careful what he said, as it was very likely I should have to</p>

               <p>make use of the words against him again—he said that he had had two, and they were in the stable—I said, "Who was that left By?"—he said, "The same parties that left the one to-night"—this was not in the presence of the other prisoners—they were locked up—Paine was with me when I took Wright—he came up just when I was bringing the first truss of hay out of the stable—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a sample of the trusses of 8th May—these other two are samples of the other two trusses that I found in the stable.</p>

On the evening of 8th May, I went to the Waggon and Horses, on the Uxbridge-road—when I first came up I saw Sergeant Ravening fetching a truss of hay out of the stable he told Cook and Hughes that that was the truss which they had put in, and which he charged them with stealing—he took them into custody—he went up and spoke to Wright—I did not hear what he said—I saw the other two trusses from off two or three cribs in the stable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn-dealer and Baker, and live at South all—early in April, I bought a rick of clover-hay at a sale in Hayes parish—I employed the prisoner Hughes to Bind it—I did not employ Cook to drive it; he was in the service of Mr. Ford, my neighbour, and drove his cart—he was so employed for three or four days—in consequence of certain feelings in my mind, I gave information to Ravening—on Wednesday, the middle of the day, I directed him to watch—I saw him again at about half past 7 o'clock—he had Cook and Hughes with him then—Wright was not charged till late at night—some trusses of clover hay were brought with them at this time—the sergeant had charge of one, and there was a load on the cart also—the two other trusses were not brought till late at night—I did not count the load, but it was sent to one of my customers, and he found it all right—I looked and found that it was clover hay—the single truss corresponded with the bulk in the cart—it also corresponds precisely with the hay which. I bought early in April, in Hayes parish—About 10 o'clock in the evening I saw Wright, and desired him Be taken to the station—I then saw two more</p>

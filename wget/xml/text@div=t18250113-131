               <p>THOMAS TOMKINS. I live in Camden-town. On Monday the 6th of December, about eight o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in the New-road - I knew him before. We went to the Buffalo public-house, near Mary-le-bone church - we had a pint of beer, and a quartern of gin; I paid for that with halfpence, which I had loose in my waistcoat pocket. We then had some more at the Portland Arms public-house, which I paid for in silver. He said at the Buffalo, that he had only 6 d. in his pocket. I had changed a sovereign, and had a crown, four half-crowns, and some silver. I put it in my right hand breeches pocket in his presence; there were several other persons at the Portland Arms. I did not know them - we were all talking together, and they drank with us - they sat in the box facing - I laid my head on the table and went to sleep; when I awoke they were pulling me about - I cannot exactly say who was pulling me about - they had got some vinegar, which they wanted to give me, but I would not have it. The prisoner was in the same box when I awoke, but I do not know whether he shook me. I put my hand into my pocket and found I had only the empty purse. I said,</p>
               <p>"I see I have lost my money." He said,</p>
               <p>"It cannot be here." I said I had it when I came into the house, and some one of the company I thought must have it. He said he had not got it, nor had he seen any one by me to take it. Nicholls the pot-boy was there, and he told me something. I went for a constable - and told the constable I had lost my money, and what the person in company had told me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had not he and you been very good friends before that? A. Yes; we had drank together very often, and sometimes got tipsy. We met about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, and it was about ten when I awoke - the people were treating me as if I was drunk. I found the empty purse in my pocket. I said</p>
               <p>"Jem, I have lost my money." He said</p>
               <p>"No one here has taken it." He said afterwards</p>
               <p>"Well, I have taken your money; and if you like to take me up, do - here it is." He was pretty well tipsy as well as me. He said</p>
               <p>"If you wish to take me up about this joke, do." When we went before the Magistrate we were so tipsy the Magistrate would not hear the charge, till we got sober. After the money had been produced we were sitting down, pretty good friends, and if it had not been for the constable I do not know that I should have had him taken.</p>

            . I am pot-boy at the Portland Arms. I remember the prisoner and prosecutor being there. The prosecutor was asleep, and I saw the prisoner take some money out of his breeches pocket - he rolled up the purse and put it into the pocket again. The prosecutor awoke in about a quarter of an hour, and said he missed his money, and one of these three men must have it. The prisoner was awake then, but did not say any thing about it. I told Tomkins what I had seen, and he went for a constable - that was about half an hour after he awoke.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not they both very tipsy? A. Yes; I saw the prisoner take the money, but I did not say any thing about it, because it appeared to me that he was taking care of it till the other got sober. I saw the prosecutor lying on the table, and they got some vinegar to awaken him up to do his master's business. There had been a good deal of talk about the money. I did not hear the prisoner say</p>
               <p>"If you are going to be serious about this money, take me at once before a Magitrate." He seemed as if he wanted to give the man his money again - he did not seem pleased about being taken.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by the COURT. I told Tomkins that Cole had taken the money, and he went for a constable - I spoke it quite loud, and Cole might have heard it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to the Portland Arms on the 6th of December and saw the prisoner there - he was charged by the prosecutor with having robbed him. I beckoned Cole out - I told him what charge I had against him; and he said he had a crown piece, four half-crowns, and four shillings - that he had received 25 s. for work, at several places. He did not say that he had taken the money from Tomkins. I took him to the Magistrate, and he postponed the hearing till next day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I said it was the prosecutor's money at the time he took me. I thought I had more money about me when I was taken, which made me say I had 25 s.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TOMKINS. Q. Did the prisoner say at the Buffalo that he had only 6 d. in his pocket? A. Yes; at the Portland Arms, I paid 1 s.</p>

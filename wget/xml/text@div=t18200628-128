               <p>"Ah my love," put her arms against me, and in an instant I felt her hand in my breeches pocket - she took 4 s. out. I seized her hand, and endeavoured to take it from her, she made a disturbance - two men came up from behind a wall and took her part, one of them struck me. I kept hold of her, called the watchman, they ran away, and I gave her in charge. I was quite sober. A note has been put into my hands since I came here, threatening my life if I appeared against her.</p>

               <p>Court. In what manner had you shut the door of the shop? - I went and shut the door fast, it was fast by a spring lock.</p>

               <p>I am a heel and patten maker, I live in Compton-street, No. 19, I was coming by at the same time, and I picked up this cheese about twenty yards from the door where I imagine it was taken from; somebody spoke to him, and he said, I think, it was the first time he had ever been guilty of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they tell him he had better own this? - Yes, and he did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Court. And upon that he said that was his first offence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, first, as to the hour of the night, it was long after it was dark; then, as to the fact of breaking the house, the door, Mr. Pearce says, was shut, and that he was looking particularly to it; if he had latched it, and the prisoner had opened it for the purpose of committing a felony, it is a burglary.</p>

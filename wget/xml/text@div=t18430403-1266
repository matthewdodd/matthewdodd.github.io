                  </hi>. I live at Harmondsworth—the prisoner was in my employ as a carter—I was called by the policeman on the morning of the 17th of March—the prisoner was on his road to London with a load of hay—I went after him in my chaise for about six miles, when I found him in custody—I found two trusses or bundles of hay on his cart more than he ought to have had—he had thirty-six trusses for his load, one for his horses, and the other two which he ought not to have had, which made thirty-nine in all—the two trusses were two that were allowed him for his horses at home, but not to take out with him—it was my hay.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 5th of March I was on duty at Paddington, near the Regent's-canal—at two o'clock in the morning I met two women, carrying a parcel of crockery, about two hundred yards from where there was a boat lying—I questioned them—they told me how they got them—I took them to the station-house—I then went and took the prisoner out of the boat the girls mentioned—I found him on board about three o'clock—I charged him with giving the girls the crockery—he said he gave nothing away but what was his own.</p>

I am captain of the boat which laid in the Regent's-canal—it came from Derbyshire—Richard Evans was the owner—I had employed the prisoner on board only two days—I met with him at Tring—the boat had crates of crockery, and some of it was loose—when I heard of this I went to the station-house, and saw the prisoner and the crockery—I could not swear to the crockery—I believe it came out of the boat, which the prisoner was in care of—I missed it from the boat—it was worth about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

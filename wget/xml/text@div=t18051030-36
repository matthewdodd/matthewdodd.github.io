               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner? - A. He was sitting in the tap-room, I pulled off my hat, I had been there a considerable time, and the prisoner went out, I missed my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been sitting with you? - A. No, he had been sitting and drinking by himself, the landlady of the house came to me, and said, Jem, where is your hat, I looked round directly behind me for my hat, and it was gone, I immediately pursued the prisoner, he had his hat in his hand, and mine he was trying on to see if it would fit him, it would not fit him, he took it off, and put it on his own.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he put it on while you were by? - A. Yes, when I was going to take hold of him, he did not see me I believe; when I got up to him, I said, you villain, what do you do with my hat, he said it was not my hat, I took him back to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he got from the house? - A. About an hundred yards, it was near six o'clock in the evening, on the 14th of October, when I got him back, he offered me any thing to let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not let him go? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with him before? - A. I never saw him above once before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your hat worth? - A. About 3 s.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his own hat worth? - A. I do not know, it was an older one than mine, he pulled out his watch, and offered me that to let him go, I sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. When the officer was gone for, was there there any thing particular that happened? - A. Soon after I sent for an officer; he asked me to let him light a pipe, I let him go to the fire; he took up the fire-shovel, and was going to clear the house of all the people; he took up the shovel and said, the first that comes near me I will cut down; he tried to make his escape towards the door; the landlady took the shovel from him, and by that time I caught hold of him myself, and then the constable came in, and took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what this man is? - A. I know nothing more of the man than seeing him once or twice or so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he near you at the time this hat was taken? - A. He was in the same box where I put my hat, and was drinking by himself.</p>

               <p>Q. His own was on his head? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was something to choose between the hats, your's was worth 3 s. and his was an old one, worth less? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many people in the room besides you? - A. There were only myself and the landlord's son, the landlady was getting her tea.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he use to frequent your house? - A. Not very often.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he? - A. He goes to sea, and he was here last sessions; he was sitting in the box, my mother was drinking her tea in the kitchen, he slipped out of the back door; my mother said to Jem, where is your hat?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that any hat had been taken away? - A. No; only my mother had suspicions.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner take up the hat? - A. No, my mother did; I saw him putting it on his head to try if it would fit him.</p>

               <p>Q. How far were you from him when you saw him fitting the hat on? - A.

               <p>Prisoner's defence. It is all spite and malice; the day that the prosecutor says the robbery happened, I was getting a ship into dock; I came to this house about half after five o'clock, I had a pot of beer, and went out of the house again; they swear I took the hat, whereas they came after me with the hat in their hands; I had none but my own hat on my head; they began to hustle me about, there had been two attempts to secure me, I went to the fire-place, and took the fire-shovel, I said, if any man lays hold of me before the constable comes, I will knock him down. Ask my prosecutor if he has not been in the pillory for false swearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any body here for your character? - A. Mr. Trott.</p>

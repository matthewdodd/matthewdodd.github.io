            . I took charge of the prisoner on the 5th of January. The prisoner applied for a warrant of the Lord Mayor for her mistress detaining her box; his lordship ordered me to go with the prisoner. I went along with the prisoner to Mrs. Newstadt for her box. I told Mrs. Newstadt my business; Mrs. Newstadt insisted upon seeing what was in her box; the prisoner unlocked it. Mrs. Newstadt saw the articles mentioned in the indictment; she claimed them as her own.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Newstadt. The prisoner went away, she was not sent away; in the prisoner's box I found three caps, I know to be mine, and this night gown is mine, all the articles are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any wages due to the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I sent for a coach; she said, I should not have the box until the box was examined; my master told me my wages was safe, and if I died my child should have it. Gentleman, my mistress looked over my box, and found nothing but my own property. I missed a little tin box that contained three one-pound notes, and a two-pound note; I had a cloak, my mistress took a fancy to, and tried it on, and pursuaded me to move it from that box to one where it might lay strait, and when different people came for money my master used to write a note, and I was pretended to be sent for the money, and to come back and say the people were not at home.</p>
               <p>COURT. to Prosecutrix. Did you ever try on any of her clothes - A. Yes, a black Mode cloak; that is not in my house now.</p>
               <p>Q. to Porter. Did she relate the circumstance of her money in her box - A. She did.</p>

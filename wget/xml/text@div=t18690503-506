I live at 16, Eltham Street, Old Kent Road, and am an unfortunate woman—I know the three prisoners by sight—about 12.45 on the morning of the 11th April, I was going along the Kent Road—a man, not in custody, came up and spoke to me—he made a proposal to me which I declined—I turned away, and he struck me in the mouth—I called out for assistance—five other men came up, the prisoners amongst them—one of the men, not any of the prisoners, took me by the back of the head—the others assisted in beating me—one had his hand in my pocket, and took my money and my keys—Hurley struck me in my mouth—Manton was there—I can swear to him, but not to Balaam—I had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket at the time I was attacked—I felt someone's hand in my pocket, and when the constable came up I missed my money—I told him I had lost it.</p>

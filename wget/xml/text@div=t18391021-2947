                  </hi>. I live at Roehampton, in the parish of Putney. Elizabeth Mayo was in my service as dairy-maid, and Mary Mayo as cook—on the 14th of October they were about to leave my service, and their boxes were packed—in consequence of some loss of money, I sent for a policeman, named Finlayson, and had their boxes searched—I be<lb></lb>lieve some cups and saucers, and other things were produced—I know nothing of these.</p>

I went to Mr. Sheill's on the 14th of October, in Park-lane—I searched the prisoners' boxes, which were packed—I found in Mary Mayo's box these cups and saucers, plate, wine-glass, basons, piece of dimity, two pots of butter, some soap, some vermicelli, and a book, which is not claimed—Mary Mayo said they were Mr. Sheill's things, but they were given her—she did not say by whom.</p>

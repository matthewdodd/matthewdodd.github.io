            . On the 25th of October last, about seven in the evening, I missed a silver tankard.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Pushee. I can't say he took it, one man may be like another.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you miss it from?</p>
               <p>Pushee. I miss'd it from out of my parlour, where the best of my company use.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live ?</p>
               <p>Pushee. At <placeName id="t17561208-36-crimeloc184">the Crown in Newgate-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. After what manner was it taken ?</p>
               <p>Pushee. I believe the prisoner to be the very person who was at my house at the time it was stolen; that person came in about half an hour after six o'clock, he call'd for a tankard of beer, a pen, ink and paper, and my maid servant carried them to him. He wrote a fictitious letter. When he came in there was no body in the room but a man that belongs to the Penny Post Office. He sent that man with the letter to Jewen Street; before he was gone with the letter my servant went into the room; he gave her half a crown to change, she brought it out, and my son gave full change for it; she carried it in, and said here is your full change. Very well my dear, said he; she came out again, and went to draw a pot of beer for a person that lives in Newgate-street, and I went in to snuff his candle, when to my great surprise he and the tankard were gone out at the window. I took the candle in my hand and look'd upon the bench, where was the mark of his foot in the sand, and another on the e, and upon the bench in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the sash ?</p>
               <p>Pushee. I found that up, and the curtains blowing about with the wind.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Pushee. As to being particular to swear point blank that he is the man I cannot, but I believe him to be the very man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the prisoner since you lost the tankard?</p>
               <p>Pushee. On Saturday last I was before Justice Fielding, the prisoner was examined there, when a witness of mine swore against him; he then own'd the fact in my hearing.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175612080024"></xptr>Q. What words did he use?</p>
               <p>Pushee. The witness said you are the person that I carried the letter for to Jewen-street [here is the letter he return'd and gave to me] there you are, and you cannot deny it. Mr. Fielding said see and search the prisoner if he has any writings in his pocket to compare them together; the prisoner said he had no writings at all. Well, said Mr. Fielding, Mr. Ball, pray what have you got to say to this ? he said, Why and please your worship it was so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he charg'd at that time with taking the tankard, or was the conversation about the letter?</p>
               <p>Pushee. It was about the tankard and letter too.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I when I was first examined say to the man that my prosecutor brought there, do you know me or not, and what answer did he make ?</p>
               <p>Pushee. I was not by at that time, but when the prisoner at the bar saw me and my son, he immediately came up to me, saying, What do you know of me, am I the man, am I the man?</p>
               <p>John Skindalsby. I was at the prosecutor's house on the 25th of October last, between six and seven at night; Mr. Bail the prisoner at the bar came into the room where I was, and call'd for a tankard of beer, pen, ink and paper; he wrote a letter, and paid me six pence to carry it into Jewen-street. I saw him write it, it was neither wafer'd nor seal'd. I carried it there, and shew'd it to a man, who read it, and said it was all a pack of nonsense.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Jewen street from the prosecutor's house?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. It is about a quarter of a mile distant</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the letter?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. I return'd and gave it to the prosecutor, and said I could not find such a house as it was directed to; the prosecutor said I'll go into the room and shew it him, and tell him you can't find the house (he then going to light the candle) he went in and found the window up, and the curtains flying with the wind, and the prisoner and tankard both gone.</p>
               <p>Q How long might you have been gone?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. To the best of my knowledge I believe about half an hour, or a little better.</p>
               <p>Q Was you first in the room or the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. I was in the room when he came in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue in the room after he came in ?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. I continued there about 3 or 4 minutes, just while he wrote the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Where was I when you came into Justice Fielding's?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. You was in the room where all the prisoners come.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. How long was you in the room before you saw me?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. I can't justly say how long.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. When you did see me, did not I come up to you and speak to you, and say, honest friend do you know me?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. When I came into the room I pull'd off my hat, and look'd about to see which was the man, and the people fell a laughing at me. He did not say to me friend do you know me, they only made game of me.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did not you say you did not know me?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say now to the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. I am sure the prisoner is the person that sent me with the letter that night the tankard was lost.</p>

            . The prisoner came into our house on the 25th of October, and call'd for a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him well and consider?</p>
               <p>M. Palmer. I am sure he is the man, the little boy carried in his beer; after that he ask'd me to bring him a pen, ink and paper. When I went with them he asked me if I could give him 2 s. 6 d. for half a crown. I took his half crown, and carried him his change, and after that he asked this man if he could carry a letter for him to Jewen-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the room first, the prisoner or the man?</p>
               <p>M. Palmer. The prisoner was in the room before the man came in.</p>
               <p>Q. to Skindalsby. Which did you say was in the room first, the prisoner or you?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. I was in the room first, I was there when he came in; I had a penny worth of beer at the other box, and was warming it by the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. to M. Palmer. What was done when this man was gone with the letter?</p>
               <p>M. Palmer. Then the prisoner went out at the window with the tankard.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>M. Palmer. Because there was no body in the room but himself.</p>

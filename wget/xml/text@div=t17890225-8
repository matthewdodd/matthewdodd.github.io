               <p>Who paid for the child's clothes? - The father of the child finds her in every thing; I had put the sash quite close down, but had not fastened it any farther, I saw nobody in the house; I went to see what it was o'clock, I am sure it was about seven; I had the candle in my hand, the child wanted to go to bed at that time; I shut my shutters at six in the evening, and this happened at seven.</p>

            , standing at a public house, the Red Lyon, he asked me to drink, I went in, we had two pints of beer, I believe we might stay about half an hour; there I saw the prisoner Robley, he was in the house then, I believe he and the others had been drinking together; Robley said to me that they were going across Moorfields, we went together, they did not say what they were going to do; we went across Moorfields till we came to Grub-street, then we went into the Crispin and had a quartern of gin, we did not stay there; and when we came out we consulted to go to see for some place to rob; I proposed going to Barbican; and Avery said he knew a place in Little Archer-street, where he said he had looked at a house several times before; accordingly we went there, the house was fronting a passage, Avery went to the house and pulled open the window shutter, they were shut to, whether they were fastened or not I cannot really say, there was a fire in the room, but no candle; Avery shoved up the window, and shoved open<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250033"></xptr>the blinds, Avery in shoving up the window made a noise, and I heard somebody coming down stairs; then Avery reached himself into the window, and took out the articles here mentioned; part of his body was in the window, I think these are the same things, I know the hat and bonnet, but I did not know what the other things were, they were laying very near the window, but I cannot positively say, he could reach them without going in entirely; Robley was at the distance of about twenty paces, I could just discern him: he was standing by, watching; Avery gave all the things to me, and Robley afterwards took the things from me, except the bonnet, he took them from me underneath the passage; when we got into Golden-lane, Avery told Robley and me to go to a place in Golden-lane to sell the goods, and going into the house we were apprehended by the officer.</p>

               <p>Who laid hold of you? - Armstrong; I had the bonnet, nothing more.</p>
               <p>Who laid hold of Robley? - Armstrong laid hold of him at the same time, and I let the bonnet fall; Mr. Shakeshaft came to his assistance, and brought us out, and another person came up of the name of Harper, then they handcuffed us, and took us to the justice; I did not observe what they took from Robley.</p>
               <p>Is all this true? - To the best of my knowledge it is.</p>
               <p>What became of Avery? - I cannot tell indeed, he stood at a distance off.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Parliament. Is there an entry oposite your house? - There is a passage, but my house is not opposite, the passage goes into Great Archer-street, there are three doors difference between its being opposite.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I happened to be at the Red Lion, Holywell-lane, when this Buckingham came in, he goes by two names, and we were talking together about going over Moor-fields, he said he had a friend in Grub-street that he wanted to see, and we all agreed to go together, he, Avery and me; when we came to Grub-street, he was not there, we had some gin, and went out towards Barbican; and when we came in this street where the robbery was committed, we were all together, I walking before them, I missed them; I being before them a great way I turned back to see for them, and as I came back again, Buckingham gave me the hat and some of the things, and I did not know where he got them from, I had not the presence of mind to ask him, I was a hundred yards from the place where they were taken, I did not know they were stolen, and when we came into Playhouse-yard, we were stopped by Mr. Harper and Armstrong, and the things were taken from us; I thought they had belonged to Buckingham; I have a person here that I have lodged with since I have been in London.</p>

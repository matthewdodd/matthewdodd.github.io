               <p>Capt. Roach. On Monday night last, at half after eleven, going to my house at Chelsea, I met two men; the prisoner and the other that was just now at the bar; the prisoner pushed me violently into the gutter; I did not fall by it; I clapped my hand to my sword and asked them what they meant by that: upon which the prisoner immediately fired at me; the ball grazed my head and the paper fell upon my shoulder; I pursued him but heran too fast; I seized the other with one hand, and held my sword to his breast with the other hand. On taking him before the guard he was searched; there was a loaded pistol found in his pocket; he gave me information where to find this man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive to this man that he is the person?</p>
               <p>Roach. I am quite so; I am very unhappy that I should be so certain.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The pistol was not loaded with ball: when I fired this pistol at Capt. Roach, I thought it was in my own defence, as he assaulted me.</p>

            . I took the prisoner out of bed with two women by Godlington's information. This small pistol (producing it) is the fellow to that found upon Godlington; I found it in a hole in the chimney as far as I could reach up, I could not find any thing round the room; he denied there was any thing in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pistol loaded?</p>
               <p>Bond. No, it was not; I found six bullets which are here, and two pistol flints all together in this hole; when I pulled the pistol out the the others fell down and a bullet mould.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Three or four days before this happened Godlington came up to my room and brought this brace of pistols and balls up with him, and desired he might leave them till he called for them; he called two or three days afterwards, and asked me if I would go to Chelsea with him; I said I would; he took these pistols, loaded them with powder, and put them in his pocket; we went to the Black Dog, in the King's-road, Chelsea, where we continued from half after six till eleven that night; I was greatly elevated in liquor as Godlington was also; I stumbled against Capt. Roach, not with any design to molest him; he clapped his hand to his sword, and said, d - n you, you scoundrel, what do you mean by that; I said, what you assault me, if you me an to molest me take that, and fired at him; the captain pursued us; we had no weapons to make our defence with; Godlington had another pistol loaded with powder, without ball; I ran away as fast as I could. The next morning I was apprehended by Godlington's information in bed: I had no design on Capt. Roach.</p>
               <p>Q. to Capt. Roach. You do not know whether Godlington's pistol was loaded with ball?</p>
               <p>Roach. I cannot tell that because a soldier discharged it.</p>

            . There was nothing at all in the pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. It did not go off at all then?</p>
               <p>Godlington. Yes; one was charged with a little powder; one might have a little powder in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any wadden?</p>
               <p>Goddlington. Both had a wadden in them?</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose was it to charge with powder without bullets or shot?</p>
               <p>Godlington. They were charged for our own defence coming home; we did not intend to do any person wrong, only if we were interrupted on the road to defend us.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Roach. Did you feel any thing graze your check?</p>
               <p>Roach. I think something passed by my cheek which I imagined to be a bullet.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Was your shoulder singed with any thing?</p>
               <p>Roach. The paper fell upon my shoulder; I should be very sorry to declare further; I am to all human probability certain in my own mind the bullet whistled by my head. I should much rather wish he might be transported.</p>

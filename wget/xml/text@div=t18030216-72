             came with Lucas and Sharpe's dray to my house; he laid down a cask of amber; he said to me, I have a cask of the best table beer on my dray; you shall have it for three shillings and sixpence rather than take it home; I said, I had never taken table beer into the house, and should not begin then; this was whilst he was putting down the cask of beer; when he had done he began to press me, and said, it was as good as twopenny, and would draw for twopenny; he said, if I rubbed the chalk-mark off it, if the cooper came he would think it fine; he likewise said, when the coopers got drunk at home, he could bring beer out almost at any time; as soon as I conceived he had come unfairly by it, it struck me it would be better to inform Mess. Sharpe and Lucas of it, which I did, by letter, within an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay the man for it? - A. Yes, three shillings and sixpence; we never purchase the cask; I shewed the cask to Mr. Sharpe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The cask was to go back? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were to pay Sharpe and Lucas for the beer? - A. No, we only pay the collecting-clerk.</p>
               <p>Lucas. That cask was my cask, and I believe the beer is mine.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you serve Mr. Hyde with any table beer? - A. No.</p>

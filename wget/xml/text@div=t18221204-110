            . I am an officer. I was sent for between seven and eight o'clock, and took her. I searched her at Hatton-garden, and found another fowl in her pocket. Alwright's fowl was taken from her before - she offered to leave her shawl for the value of it. I found 6 s. on her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took up two fowls to look at, the boy was particularly engaged, I put my hand into my pocket, and was going into the shop when he cried out that I was stealing the fowl, I offered to pay for it as they made a noise. I bought the other at Newgate-market.</p>

               <p>- DOBEL. I am a book-binder. The prisoner is a stranger to me, but being in the gallery I heard this boy's evidence. I was coming by at the time and consider that she was taking it off the shelf to take it in to see what she was to give for it, the boy is set as a spy to look out, and it might appear as if she was thieving. I saw it taken out of her hand, but I did not interpose or go before a magistrate.</p>

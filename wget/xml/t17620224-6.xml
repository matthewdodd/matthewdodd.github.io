               <p>Q. What reason had you to suspect her stealing of it?</p>
               <p>Hicks. The money was there on the Saturday, and between that time and Monday my wife miss'd it. She had left my house unknown to us; upon that I went to see after the prisoner, and I found her in Star alley, and, charging her with the fact, she took out two guineas, and deliver'd to me as what she had stolen from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you induce her to do it by a promise that you would not prosecute her?</p>
               <p>Hicks. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get the crown again?</p>
               <p>Hicks. No, she had changed that; then I took her to the justice's.</p>

            . I live in the house where the prisoner lived; and in the morning of the 8th of Feb. when I came down stairs, there was a candle left burning; I supposed the prisoner might be gone out to get a dram. I opened the shop, and staid there till my mistress came down, and asked for her. I said I knew not where she was; and afterwards my mistress miss'd the money, and my master went out to search for her, and found her, and had her before the justice.</p>

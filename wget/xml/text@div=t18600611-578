Durand, the first dated 8th May, requesting to be furnished with their price current, and the second containing an order for various goods, referring to the London and Westminster Joint Stock Bank and requesting them to draw a bill at thirty days for the amount</hi>)—I have known Reding seven or eight years—he was once a customer of mine and had goods invoiced to him—this (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) is one of the genuine heads of my invoices; on it is the representation of my prize medal from the exhibition in 1851—some communication passed between me and Mr. Durand; the result was the stopping of the case of goods in question.</p>

S. from Paris, and consigned to William Stockil, Long-lane, Smithfield"—"William Stockil, 7, Long-lane, May 29th, 1860"—this was signed by Reding; he came to me a day or two after to know if the case had arrived—I saw him again on the Monday—it was on Friday when he first came—he came again on 4th June and produced a a letter from our agent.</p>

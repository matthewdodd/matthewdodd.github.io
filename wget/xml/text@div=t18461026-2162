                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert William Child, a watch-maker, of High-street, Camberwell. On the evening of the 9th of Oct, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked to look at a double-bottomed silver watch—I showed him one—I put the watch on the counter—he took it up, took the ticket off it, seemed to object to the price, and asked if we had any more—I said to Mr. Fry, "Have you any more?"—as I said that the pri<lb></lb>soner ran out of the shop with the watch—I am quite sure he is the man—I saw him in custody in about ten minutes—the watch was was worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was the price on the ticket—the prisoner was smoking a pipe.</p>

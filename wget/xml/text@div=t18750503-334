               <p>out on an errand for my husband, leaving the prisoner there with my husband and the baby—I had given the baby some milk from a bottle before the prisoner came in, and there was very little milk left in the bottle, which I left on the sofa with the baby—I returned in I think less than a quarter of an hour and still found them there, but there was more milk in the bottle than there was when I went out—the baby looked sleepy, drowsy and very heavy—it was about 9.30 when the prisoner left, but I cannot tell to a minute or two—I smelt the bottle and noticed a very peculiar, smell and so did my husband—it was rather a smoky smell—the baby got worse, and my husband ran for a doctor who came and gave it some medicine and it vomited milk, and afterwards some thing with more of a browny tinge, and the smell of what came from the baby was the same as what was in the bottle—we had to pinch and beat the baby and had great difficulty all night to keep it awake—the doctor took the bottle away—the milk in the bottle came from a milk jug in the same room, there had been some taken out of the jug when I came home, and I had a small portion in a cup of coffee—the prisoner said when I came home that she had put a little more milk in the bottle, and the baby had the bottle when I came back, but I cannot say whether it was in its mouth—I have a basin of warm water to keep the bottle warm.</p>

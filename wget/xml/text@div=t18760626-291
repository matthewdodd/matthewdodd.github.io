                  </hi>. I am potman at the Crown Tavern, High Street, Borough—on Sunday evening, 28th May, a little after 10 o'clock the prisoner and deceased were there with some women—a quarrel took place between them, and the prisoner, at my request, went out with some of his companions—the deceased stayed in the house—at closing time, about 10.50, they all left—the prisoner was waiting outside alone; he spoke to the females, and then to his brother—he told his brother if he wanted to take the part of the females he could—they then began to fight—I don't know which began it; they both fell to the ground—neither of them had had much to drink.</p>

I live at 6, Swan Court, Blackman Street, Borough—I was at the Crown public-house on this Sunday evening; the prisoner and his brother were there—the prisoner said something to me about a clean collar and a dirty face, and his brother took my part, and said "Why don't you leave off?"—the prisoner then went outside—the deceased after<lb></lb>wards went out—the prisoner said" Are you going to take their part?"—he said "Yes," and they closed with one another—a crowd came round directly, and I saw no more—I saw no blow struck—I think the prisoner was the worse for drink of the two.</p>

I am house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—the deceased was brought there; the prisoner came with him—he was perfectly unconscious—he never rallied, but died in an hour and three quarters after his admission—I made a post-mortem examination—I found a large, bruise behind the left ear, and there was bleeding from the ear—the skull was fractured, and the brain slightly bruised and blood effused—I do not think a blow with the fist would have been sufficient to account for the injury; a heavy fall would be much more likely to do so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am brother to the landlord of the Three Rabbits. I recollect seeing the prisoners in the tap room on 23rd Jan.—Stevens had a velvet coat on, and he was sitting on the seat—Osborn was standing by him—the potboy came to me and gave me a shilling for half a pint of beer; I gave him change—he came to me again and gave me a shilling; he said it was for a pot of porter, I gave him change—he came to me again and gave me another shilling, and I gave him change—he came to me again and gave me a four shilling, and I gave him change for that—I put those shillings into the till—there was other silver there, half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences, I could not say to what amount—Stevens left first;—I then saw Osborn leave—my mother ordered me to go after him, which I did—he told me not to come near him—I saw him take something from his trowsers pocket, and throw it down, about 100 yards from, the Rabbits—I gave both the prisoners into custody—I went back to the place where I saw Osborn throw something down, and found a bag containing three counterfeit coins, and two coins lying outside the bag, wrapped up separately in tissue paper—I put them in the bag, and took them all to the inspector—I received another shilling from Mrs. Othen, which I also gave to the inspector.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You do not keep the Rabbits? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; my bro<lb></lb>ther does—he is not here—he chiefly attends to the house, he was out at that time—it is a roadside house—Little Ilford is not a large village—it is six miles from London—there are a good many persons who work in farm work about there, and they frequent our house—on that evening there were not many persons in our tap room—I think not half a dozen—I had not known Stevens before—I noticed them by looking over the door—when I was before the Bench I pointed out both the prisoners—when I pointed out Stevens he was dressed in a velvet coat and a cap, the same as he was in the tap room—it was dark when I saw the prisoners in the tap room—there was</p>

                  </hi>. My son keeps the Rabbits. I was sitting in the bar on 23rd Jan.—Barnes, the potboy, brought me a shilling—I put it in the till, separate from other money—I saw my son receive four shillings, he put them in the till—I had cleared out the till before we sat down to tea, about 5 o'clock—all I had left in the till was a shilling, five or six sixpences, and a half-crown—after my daughter had taken a shilling I went to the till and took out the shilling which I had put a part—it was not a good one—I gave it to my son to take to the station—I first gave it to my daughter, she bit it, and returned it to me—I then gave it to my son.</p>

                  </hi>. I am daughter-in-law to the last witness. I was in the bar on 23rd Jan., Osborne asked me for a pennyworth of vinegar, and he gave me a shilling in a piece of thin white paper—I took it to the light, best it, and returned it to him—I told my mother—Osborn then left, and my brother went after him—after my mother had looked at the other shilling—I saw Stevens in the tap-room that night—after the prisoners were taken, I went out with my brother, and saw him find the bag of money—there were three shillings wrapped up in paper in the bag, and two shillings lying outside—one of them was the one that I bad bent—alter my brother had gone to the station, I returned to the Rabbits—I looked in the till, and found four more bad shillings—I took them to the station, and gave them to the officer—I found only one other shilling in the till, beside the four bad ones—there were some sixpences and fourpenny pieces, but no other shilling.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Friday evening 23rd Jan., about eight o'clock, or near before eight when I was asked for the vinegar—I saw both the prisoners in the tap room before he asked for the vinegar—I am sure I saw Stevens there—I had never seen him before—he had a velvet coat on—they were swearing about their drink—when they had the quarters of gin they quarrelled a great deal about it, and I looked over into the tap-room to see who they were—there were four or five persons in the tap room, not more, besides the prisoner—I did not know Stevens's name till he was at the Bench.</p>

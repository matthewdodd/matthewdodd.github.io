               <p>having done so, I read it over to her—she made no objection to it, and made her mark to it, as required by the act—I then signed it in the next column—I gave her an acknowledgment that the death had been registered, which is the authority to the Clergyman to bury—the clergyman is liable to a penalty if he buries without that certificate—I asked her own name, to write it, for her to make her mark—it says, "the mark of Mary Harris, present at the death, No. 6, Clement's-lane"—I have the book here—this is the entry, "John Harris, six years, hooping-cough, present at death—the mark of Mary Harris, May 17"—this is one of a set of books furnished by the Registrar-general, under the Act of Parliament—I gave her the acknowledgment of the entry in the terms prescribed by the Act of Parliament—I gave her one of these blank forms filled up properly.</p>

On the 17th of May, between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prisoner came to me, and produced a document, which she took away again—she stated that her husband was lying dead at St. Bartholomew's-hospital—I read part of the paper she gave me—I saw "John Harris" and "William Fitch"—the age was not stated—she said her husband had died in St. Bar<lb></lb>tholomew's-hospital, and belonged to a club, and, providing she had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., she could get 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. towards his funeral, but she must have it by three o'clock—I said I never gave money for deaths—she said she had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; if she got 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more she could make up the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I declined to assist her, and she went out—she came back shortly after, and begged I would assist her with the 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said somebody else had given her 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and asked me to give her 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and she could make up the odd 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "Well, I shall go with you to inquire into your case"—I went to No. 6, Clement's-lane, and found the shutters up at the house—a party stood at the door—I asked if she re<lb></lb>sided in the house—they said no—she was with me, and said, "I am extremely obliged to you for taking the trouble of going to inquire into my distressing case"—she said, "It is not this No. 6, it is No. 6 higher up"—I said there was no. other No. 6—she said, "Yes"—I said, "Well, let us go and see where it is"—I went a short way, she gave me the slip, and I lost her—I then went to the registrar and made inquiry, which led to her being taken.</p>

I took the prisoner in charge, on the 18th of May, at No. 18, Little Ormond-yard, Lamb's Conduit-street—she lived there—I told her I had come to take her on account of having been the day previous to register the false death of a child in Clement-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields—she denied it, and in going down towards Charing-cross she said she had done so—I said, "Well, you must walk with me to Mr. Fitch"—I took her to him—he identified her as the woman—I asked her what her name was—she said Johanna Catlin—I asked if she lived in the house I found her in—she said she did—I asked her for the certificate she had received from Mr. Fitch—she said she had torn it up the night previous—I was present when she was examined before the Magistrate—I heard her asked if she had anything to say by Mr. Jardine—I heard her say something, which was taken down in writing, and signed by him—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"The prisoner being asked if she had anything to say, says, 'I went to Mr. Wilkinson, and asked him for 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; what Mr. Fitch has said is truth; I</p>

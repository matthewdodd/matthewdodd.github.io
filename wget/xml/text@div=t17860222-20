               <p>What condition did you find the house in? - The bar was stripped of all the bowls, the cellar door was broke open, the lock broke, and the street door was open, not broke that I know of.</p>
               <p>What was missing? - All the pewter was gone out of the house, I have lived in this house five years, there were fifteen pewter dishes taken away, and a fish plate, a pewter cullender; I found the cloak, and the bag on the kitchen floor, there were a pair of new shoes, and three coloured aprons, these bowls were in the closet on the over night, and the aprons and shoes in a drawer, the chiset door was locked, and the key was in it; the pewter was found the same day, in some ruins, covered with some line; the prisoners were taken within two minutes after I came down stairs, I stood at the door while the watchman took the first, they were taken the very next yard to us.</p>

               <p>A public house, a pretty notorious one, I believe it is? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You deny that? - She keeps a very regular house.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, regularly irregular? - No, Sir, we shut up the house at eleven.</p>
               <p>Your mistress has been a little unlucky, she has been robbed before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She lost a silver tankard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long ago was that? - The day after Christmas-day.</p>
               <p>What was the value of that tankard? - I do not know, it was a full quart tankard.</p>
               <p>Your mistress went to the Justice's? - No, Sir, but a person who was in the house at that time took the man.</p>
               <p>What man? - Mr. Ramus.</p>
               <p>Was it six or seven guineas that Mr. Ramus gave your mistress? - He did not give any thing at all.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - I did not see him give any thing, I will take my oath, my mistress never told me so.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you know by some means or other, that your mistress received six guineas upon that occasion? - I heard say so, but I did not see it.</p>

               <p>I am a lodger of Mrs. Chapman's, about four in the morning, on the 5th of this month, I was awaked by the watchman knocking and calling Mrs. Chapman up, I thought something was the matter, and I bid the servant girl get up, she got up, and going by my room door, she desired me to come down, she said she was afraid something was the matter; I got up, and come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220053"></xptr> down with my coat on, and her cry when I was half way down stairs, was that she was robbed; with that I came down, and as soon as I came into the tap-room, I laid hold of the poker, I said, if any body is here, let us see who they are; the watchman was there, and he and me went to the door to go into the next yard, there was another watchman waiting, and they opened a door, and went into the next adjoining yard; while I stood within the passage, with the poker in my hand, I heard one of the watchmen say, here we have got him; they returned with the prisoner Thompson, I knew him directly, and says I, Harry, what in the name of God are you doing here; they brought him into the tap-room, and they left our watchman Ware with him, and me and the other watchman went out again into the same yard, and found the other prisoner Harris in the necessary; the prisoners are the men, Harris was sitting in the necessary pretending to be asleep, we brought him into the tap-room to the other, and with that I left the two watchmen with the two prisoners, and I went up stairs to put on my clothes, and when I returned they were gone with them to the watch-house, and a neighbour came in, and we searched round, and could not find the pewter; I found the cellar door broke open, and the lock wrenched off, it was hanging on one of the nails; as I was going down the steps, I saw the little window out that goes out of the yard, into the cellar, about eight or nine inches wide, that was knocked out; I went into the cellar, and looked round with a candle, I could find no property there, but the lamp was lighted, and was burning on the side of one of the buts, the tyling of the yard was all broke, and some garden pots with a few trees in them were all knocked down, four or five of them, and the sky-light was broke, and I saw the print of the fore part of a man's foot, all mud and dirt just fresh done, as if he had been getting out of one yard into another; and one Basset a constable found the pewter, I saw a cloak, three aprons, and a pair of new shoes in a bag on the kitchen floor, which Mrs. Chapman claimed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long have you lodged in this house of Mrs. Chapman? - Four years come April.</p>
               <p>You found Harris in the necessary in the next yard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He appeared to be asleep? - He pretended to be asleep.</p>

               <p>Did you find any tools or implements of house breaking? - No.</p>
               <p>The property that was found, was found in a different direction, instead of being found on the side of the house where Harris was found, it was on the other side? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. How far was the place where the pewter was found, from Mrs. Chapman's house? - About sixty, eighty, or a hundred yards, it is but a little way.</p>
               <p>Was it as far as to the wall of Newgate? - I cannot tell for certain, it is I suppose above a hundred yards, as high as I can tell, it is a contrary way where they were found, it is going out of the house, and turns up a court to a dunghill, there was nothing found on the prisoner.</p>

               <p>How did they get into the yard? - One of them unbolted the back door; I took the box iron and opened the casement; says I, pray give me a light, for it appears to me, by the great noise of the garden pots, and the tiles falling, that there must be more than one, and he said there is nobody here, and I slipped on my under petticoat, and went to the door, and said, have you looked on the tiles; no, says he; says I, have you looked in he necessary, and he said no, and he opened the door of the necessary, and there sat that young man, Harris, I saw him there.</p>

               <p>Mason. I was going to mention it, but was ordered down, I had been to the watch-house, and when I came back this stick was found.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose stick that is? - It is the prisoner Harris's, I know it, for a few nights before this affair happened, I had this stick in my hands for high half an hour from the prisoner Harris; a person came to speak to him, and I was in the same box sitting where he was, and the stick fell, and I took it up, and went and examined it very much, and another man that was in company with me asked me what wood it was, and we agreed it was ash; and if this stick was amongst a thousand, I could swear to this stick, that was at the same house the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Was you present when Harris was taken out of the necessary house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he any stick in his possession then? - He had none when he was taken, nor when he was brought to the tap-room.</p>

               <p>To Mason. What did you do with the stick when you had it half an hour? - Harris asked me for it, and I returned it to him.</p>
               <p>Did he leave it in the tap-room that night? - He went away soon afterwards.</p>
               <p>And did he carry the stick with him? - To the best of my knowledge he did; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220056"></xptr> examined it very particularly, not thinking any thing of the kind would happen.</p>
               <p>Have you any imagination that he left the stick behind him that night? - No.</p>

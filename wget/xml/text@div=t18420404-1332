                  </hi>. I live with my father, in Gore-lane, Kensington. On the morning of the 7th of April, I was in my father's cart, and on turning into Gore-lane, by my father's yard, I saw the prisoner, and watched him—I saw him stoop down towards two pewter pint pots which were on the ground near the door of a house in Gore-lane—he saw some persons coming, turned away from them, and walked a little farther where there was a pot on a shelf over the door of a house—he turned his back to the door, looked up and down the lane, then pulled the pot down, put it into his hat, and put his hat on—I went and gave information to Mr. Harvey who keeps the Hind's Head public house—he went with me after the prisoner—we found him just down the lane—when be saw us running after him, he made a bit of a run—he turned round a little opening between two houses, and came out again—he was not there an instant—I found this pint-pot up against the wall, round the corner where he had turned.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Hind's Head public-house, Gore-lane. In consequence of information I received on the 29th of March, I went after the prisoner with Darcy, down Gore-lane, and saw him walking—when he saw us running after him, he ran a little—I saw him turn the corner—I followed him, and saw the pot was lying in a space between two houses where there was a doorway—this now produced is it—it is mine.</p>

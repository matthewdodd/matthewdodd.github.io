I considered the signature not genuine, and sent it to be examined, Auger remaining at the counter—it was brought back, and I said "From whom do you present this cheque?" he said "From Mrs. Biggins; she has been attending on Miss Paul, who has been unwell, and this is the balance due to her," or "the sum due to her"—he said "I hope I shall not be detained long, as I want to get back to the barracks"—I returned it to him with a paper attached "Signature differs," and he left.</p>

On 2nd November I took Auger at St. George's Barracks for uttering a forged cheque on Coutts's—I showed it to him, and asked him how he accounted for the possession of it—he said "It was given to me by Mrs. Biggins"—I said "How long have you known Biggins?"—he said "About nine months. I thought the cheque was all right, or I should not have had anything to do with it; that is what women do for you; I wish I had never seen her. She brought this letter to me this morning to the barracks," pulling it from his pocket, "and if I could have got out, I should have gone no doubt again this morning with this letter."

I took him in custody—on 30th November I searched Biggins's room, 32, Wellington Street, Chelsea, and found this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and about 50 others in the same writing, and this cheque: "Messrs.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Most of them were love letters—he did not say "I have known her nine months, I had no idea it was a false cheque"—he said "When I left the bank I enclosed it in a letter addressed to 38, Montpellier Street"—that is Miss Paul's residence—" if I could have got out this morning I should have presented it again this morning with a note"—I have no doubt that the note is in the same writing as the cheque—he said "It is the first time I have been in trouble, and I hope I shall not be locked up this time."</p>

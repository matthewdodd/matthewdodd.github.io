                  </hi>. I am a first-class foreman at the West India Dock Com<lb></lb>pany's warehouse, in Crutched-friars, and have been so four years. The pri<lb></lb>soner Warren was in the service of the establishment, as a labourer, for eleven or twelve weeks before this transaction-his hours of work were from eight o'clock in the morning till four o'clock in the afternoon, except when we were busy, and then we sometimes altered the hours to seven o'clock in the morning-from twelve o'clock to twenty minutes past is allowed for dinner—the men generally take their refreshment in the warehouse-none of the men can leave the warehouse between eight and four o'clock without a pass from me—it is impossible—this is the pass we give the men-(<hi rend="italic">looking it a paper</hi>)—on Wednesday, the 12th of September, Warren was at his work at the warehouse—I saw him-(<hi rend="italic">looking at a book</hi>)—this is a book of the labourers' time—it is kept by Thomas Thorn, who is here-Warren was at the warehouse from eight to four o'clock that day—he was with me all day in the tea warehouse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that you did not leave the warehouse at all, all day. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; not from eight till four o'clock-not for half an hour—I took my refreshment in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe there is a regulation, that you are not allowed to go out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes-Warren was absent on the 13th, and ever race—he was working there on the 12th, and for some days before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What makes you recollect the day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a very particular day—he was employed in a very particular purpose, putting leads on a tea-chest—he being a very steady man, I put him to the work from among 200 people—he never left me except to get refreshment, and that was on the same floor, among the other men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember hearing of the charge against him on the 13th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, on the 14th—that called my attention to the 12th—I inquired for him on the 13th—he was a very honest, steady man—he never lost an hour all the time, and never asked for leave to go out—he has been promoted by me for being steady.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KEENE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the promotion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For easier work—I do not mean to say a person cannot run out of the premises, but it would be difficult to pass the gate-keeper, who is one of the police, and never leaves the gate—the warehouse is nearly half-an-hour's walk from Beech-street, at moderate walking—he commenced working at eight o'clock that day—I never left him till dinner-time—he was on the same floor—I saw him at work the same as others—I walk about, and superintend them—I dare say there are 150 at work on a floor—I walk about for the purpose of seeing them all do their duty—I have two overlookers to help me—we do not divide the men between us—we go to different parts—it is my duty to see the men do not stand still for want of leads, and it was Warren's business to put the leads on the chests, and Iliad to pay more atten<lb></lb>tion to him than to others, that the men should not stand still—there was only him engaged in putting the leads on-Bell supplied him with them—he went to dinner at twelve o'clock—I cannot say whether he passed me</p>

               <p>in going to dinner—when the bell rings, every man stops work—I know he was there when the bell rang—it rang again in twenty minutes and within two minutes after that, I saw him again at the same work—I an sure of that, or I should have been standing still, as he had to supply the men with leads.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it possible for one man to go away without you seeing him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They can go away for a lead or so—they cannot go away for twenty minutes without my missing them—they go away for the pur<lb></lb>poses of nature, but we have persons to see that they do not stop an in<lb></lb>proper time—a man could not go to the prosecutor's and commit a robbery, I should think not even in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>.</p>

I am employed as keeper of the check-book is the warehouse—we take it alternately—on the 12th of September I made the entries—I can tell from that, that Warren was there from eight o'clock till four o'clock—I remember seeing him that day, and can undertake to say was there within those hours—he was there at ten minutes before eight o'clock and I discharged him at ten minutes after four o'clock in the afternoon—a bell rings about five minutes before four o'clock—I can say he was then then—I do not know where he was in the course of the day, or what was his employment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am second-class and assistant foreman at the Crutched<lb></lb>friars warehouse. I remember the 12th of September, last Wednesday week-Warren was at the warehouse that day—I heard of this robbery on the Friday following—I saw him from ten minutes or a quarter to eight o'clock in the morning, till four in the afternoon—I never lost sight of him for twenty minutes—I saw him there when the dinner bell rang at twelve o'clock, and saw him all the while he was at dinner—I went with him to work again when the bell rang, and saw him at his work.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is, if the gate-keeper is at his post? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are two or three gate-keepers, and inspectors to look after the gate-keepers—it is impossible to get out without an order signed by the foreman.</p>

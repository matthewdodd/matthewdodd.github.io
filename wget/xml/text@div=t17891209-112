               <p>Look at Liscomb? - Yes, I knew him before the robbery was committed; and it was a moon-light night, and done under a lamp; I had a full opportunity of viewing their persons.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner Stone do any thing to you? - He was in company with them, and assisted; but he neither struck me, nor unbuttoned my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Why, you described Stone as coming up the second time, when the woman called? - He did; he assisted along with the others in striking my wrist, and making me let go my hold; but he did not assist in unbuttoning my breeches, and taking away my property; three of them ran away; I went and gave information; Cluff I swear positively struck me while Liscomb was taking the money out of my breeches.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the woman before this time? - Yes; they live in that street; I have seen them all, and knew them all; I described them to the officer, before I took them: and I went in and picked Stone out the next day, among thirty or forty people at the public house.</p>
               <p>How came there to be so many people there? - Why there were a great many benches and tables; they were as thick as they could be; it is called the Prince of Wales, the corner of George-street; there we took Stone; and from the Black Swan in Rosemary-lane, we took Liscomb and the woman; there were a great many other people there.</p>
               <p>Did you lose any thing else besides your three half crowns? - A pocket handkerchief; but I did not think it worth while to put it into the indictment; it was an old one; I lost a silver pencil and pen; that is not in the indictment; nothing else; I lost my hat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Liscomb. Has not he taken up three besides us? - I took three more, but then as there were six or seven in the scuffle, I would not venture positively to swear to them all; I could only swear positively to these three; I fixed my mind on them; and I remarked more when I came to the corner, and when Mr. Staples asked me to be sure and certain of them; I do swear positively to them all; I am very confident.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Liscomb. He has taken one of the others again, and afterwards swore to him, and then acquitted him; and the justice said he did not think that it was any thing but an assault; Cook and Brown are the two officers that apprehended them.</p>

               NOT GUILTY
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoners, the Jury, in a case which in some measure might be doubtful, have taken the favorable side; in your own consciences you must know whether you have been guilty or not; if you have, I hope you will take warning.</p>

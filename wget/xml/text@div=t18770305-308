Batley and Watts' premises, wholesale druggists, and through the window—he then went to the back entrance in Fore Street, and up a gate flay—Osborn came out from the warehouse, and they went to a public-house together, they remained there about fifteen minutes, Purser then went away—Osborn returned to the warehouse—next day, the 27th, I saw Purser in Fore Street, about 2.15, in the afternoon—he joined Okill in a public-house, in Fore Street, they had some drink there, and went into another public-house, in Moorgate Street, where they joined Tarrant, they all three then went to another public-house, next door, I followed them in, and there saw Tarrant giving Okill some money—they remained there drinking some considerable time and then separated—on the 29th I saw Purser go to Tarrant's house, about 9.30 a.m.) in Abbeyfield Road, Rother-hithe, Purser then came on the City alone, he went again to the front entrance of Messrs. Batley and Watts', and afterwards to the back, and at 11 o'clock Osborn came out and joined him, they went to a public-house and remained about eight minutes—Osborn then returned to the ware-house, and I saw Purser take two small parcels from his pocket and examine them; he then went away—about 1 o'clock I saw Osborn in a public-house, in Jewin Street, he joined Purser there; they remained there till about 1.50—I did not see Okill that day—on 8th February, about 1 o'clock I saw Okill and Osborn loading a cart at Messrs. Bailey's, they drove away to Jewin Street, Okill was the carman—I saw Osborn join him, and the cart was taken into Ansell Street; they left the cart and went into a public-house in Aldersgate Street, Okill returned to the cart alone and drove to Gee Street, Goswell Road—about 2.30 the same day I saw Tarrant go to his warehouse, No. 10, Barron Street, Pentonville, and at 3 o'clock I saw Messrs. Batley's cart drive up with-Okill, who went to Tarrant's ware-house—Okill returned to the cart and gave the carman some money to get some beer, the carman went into a public-house, and Okill got up on the wheel of the cart and took out this parcel, he ran with it to Tarrant's warehouse, which is on the first floor—I and Downes, another officer, followed closely behind, and I saw Okill hand the parcel to Tarrant, who placed it on a shelf—we told them we were City officers, and asked them what the parcel contained—Tarrant said chlorodine—I asked Okill where be brought it from; he said Messrs. Batley&amp; Watts, Whitecross Street—I said—'Have you an invoice with it"—he "said "No"—I asked Tarrant if he had ordered the chlorodine—he said "Yes, about a week ago; I ordered it of one of Messrs. Batley's men"—he did not say the name of the man—we then took them into custody and told them they would be charged with stealing and receiving it, well knowing it to have been stolen—they said nothing at that time—on the way to the station, Okill said "I have been there before with parcels, although I have done wrong I don't wish to criminate myself"—next day, 9th February I went with Downes to Manor Road, Rotherhithe, where Purser lives—we saw him leave the house about 9 a.m, stopped him and charged him with being concerned with three men in custody, mentioning their names, in stealing and receiving drugs from Messrs. Batley's warehouse, in Fore Street—he said "I know nothing of their transactions," or words to that effect—I searched the house, and in</p>

On 31st January I was at Rother-hithe, in company with Taylor, about 9 a.m. I saw Purser leave his house, 9, Manor Road, Bermondsey, he came on to the City, he went to the bank entrance of Messrs. Batley&amp; Watts, he looked in there, and came round to the front—Osborn came out and they went and had some drink together in the Grapes public-house, Fore Street; that was about 11 o'clock"—Osborn went back to the warehouse, and Purser continued in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood till 1 o'clock, at various public-houses—about 1 o'clock Osborn came out of the warehouse and met Purser at the corner of Jewin Street; they both went to a public-house in Jewin Street—after they had been there a little time Okill came in, they all drank together, and then Okill left and went back to the cart at the warehouse, and immediately after Tarrant came in—they remained drinking there some quarter of an hour—they then went to another public-house, in Goswell Road; just before they entered that public-house, Tarrant took a canvass bag from his pocket, took some money from it and gave it to Osborn—they remained there about a quarter of an hour, Tarrant then took the tram to Pentonville—Osborn and Purser came back into the City—they went into three other public-houses, and Osborn went back, a little the worse for drink—Goswell Street, Pentonville and Messrs. Batley's warehouse, are within a mile of each other, it is pretty well a continuation—on Friday morning, 2nd February, I saw Purser leave his house and go to Tarrant's, they came out together and went to the Deptford Railway Station, and came on to the City—Purser went to Tarrant's warehouse, in Barron Street, and shortly after Tarrant came in—about 12 o'clock Purser came back to the City, and about 1.50 he went to Batley&amp; Watts' warehouse—he did not appear to see what he wanted, and he waited there till 2.15, when Osborn came out, and they went to a public-house in Cripplegate Buildings; they were in there about five minutes—Osborn then went back to the warehouse, and Purser went towards Bermondsey—on Saturday, 3rd February, Purser left his home and went to Tarrant's house and both came to the City, and went to Barron Street, they were drinking within the neighbourhood of the warehouse till about 11.30 or 11.45, when I saw Batley&amp; Watts' cart come up to the Penton Arms, at the corner of Barron Street; Okill was in the cart—he gave Walker, the carman, something, and he went away, and Okill took a parcel from the cart and ran into Tarrant's warehouse with it—Tarrant and Okill then came out together, leaving Purser in the warehouse, and went into a public-house and had some beer—Okill then jumped into the cart and drove away, and Tarrant went back to Purser.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 19<hi rend="italic">th February</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">addressed to Messrs.

               <p>Arnold. Yes, I know there were two iron rails wrenched out from the rest next the street.</p>
               <p>Q. When were they taken away?</p>

            . I am a chairman, and ply in the street to carry people; I was waiting upon some gentlemen, and I saw him break them out with this spoke (producing the spoke of a coach-wheel.)</p>
               <p>Q. When was it?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. The first of May last, on a Monday morning about one o'clock, I saw him get the two rails out; I let him take the first away, and when he came to fetch the second, I held him till I got proper assistance, and took him down to St. James's Round house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. No, to the best of my knowledge I never saw him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took him to the Round house, did he confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. He denied it that night, but when he came before the justice, he said, why should I tell a pack of lies, I was the man that did it.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did you catch that spoke in my hand ?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. My Lord, he did the spoke and the first rail in a place called Bridewell-Lane, and when he came for the second, I took hold on him.</p>

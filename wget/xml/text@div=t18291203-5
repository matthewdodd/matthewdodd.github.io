The prisoner lodged in my second floor back room, and had the use of the front parlour - he was out of employ, and had been there five or six weeks; I do not know how he got his bread. On the 18th of November the property stated in the indictment was all in a box, which I am sure was locked - it was worth above 13l.; the box stood on a small bedstead in the back parlour, covered over with a small counterpane - it was taken about five or ten minutes before ten o'clock in the morning; I had seen it safe about half an hour before I missed it, and am sure it was locked and safe - the prisoner was then in the front parlour; I went up stairs to make my bed, and left him in the front parlour with Selina Waller - I was absent about ten minutes; Waller came up stairs for an apple, and when I came down stairs the prisoner was gone - I had heard the street door shut; I passed through the back parlour as I came down, and saw the quilt turned back in quite a different position to what I had left it, and having heard the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030007"></xptr>street door bang too, I put my hand under the quilt, and the box, with its contents was gone; the prisoner was to have left on the Monday, but not before - he had never told me he was going before; this was on Wednesday - he never returned; I have found none of my property. I went immediately I missed the box, and gave information - there was nobody in the house but myself, Waller, and my little girl, who is about three years old; no other person could possibly take it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Was not Mr. McDermot in the place at the time? A. He had been gone about ten minutes - he lodges in the house; not a soul came into the room after I saw the box safe; the prisoner was in the parlour at the time the lodger went out - the lodger never went into the back parlour - he still lodges with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not come up stairs to bid you good hye before I went out? A. I never saw you - you left a night cap, a night shirt, and a handkerchief behind, which you have never fetched.</p>

            . I was on the steps of my door, No. 2, Weymouth-terrace, on Wednesday morning the 18th of November, and saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutrix's house; he banged the door, which made me look round; he looked up, as if to see if any body was at the window - he had a little bundle tied in something white; after he got off the steps, he ran, and about five doors down he turned, and looked through some iron railing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was my back turned towards you before I ran away? A. Yes - you looked up at the window when you shut the door, and when you looked round, I could see your face - you turned down about five doors off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am innocent.</p>

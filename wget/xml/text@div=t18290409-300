On the night of Friday last I went home at half-past eight o'clock, and inquired if Benjamin had come in - my wife said he had: while I was eating my supper John came in, had his supper, and went to bed - when I got up the next morning, at six o'clock, they were both in bed: my house is a mile from the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>- TAYLOR. I am the prisoners' sister. My brother Benjamin was at home when my father came in; John then came in, and sat down - when they went to bed I locked the door, and took the key out; when I got up in the morning they were in bed - the key had laid on a chair in my bed room.</p>

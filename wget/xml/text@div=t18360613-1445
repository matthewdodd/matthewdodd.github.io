                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edgat Jones, who keeps the Clarence, at Poplar. The prisoner was in our service on the 30th of May, and asked to go out that day—as she was going out, she came to me at the bar to ask for some money—I gave her what she asked for, and looked at her—I said, "Mary, you look rather larger than usual round the waist"—she coloured up very much—I said, "I think there is something which is not right with you, allow me to search you"—she said, "Oh, ma'am, if you will let me go up-stairs, I will take them from me"—I took her up stairs, and found she had a flannel frock and a long robe under her gown, belonging to me—I searched her bed, and found a pocket and vail between the mattress and the bed—I asked her if she had anything also—she said "No"—I was not satisfied, and sent for a policeman, who took her to the station-house, and there she searched—she was in our service about six weeks.</p>

Watkins, in favour of Henry James, and dated 20th August—it was already endorsed—it was brought back to me next morning by Mr. Coles, and we went to look for the prisoner at 22, Park Walk, Chelsea, at the address he had given—we did not find him there, but I previously saw him in Kinnerton Street talking to Mrs. Hubbard—I beckoned, and he held up his hand and said, "I am coming"—I turned round, and when I turned back he was gone, and I did not see him again till he was in custody—after that somebody called and wanted me to make it all right—he gave no name—Mr. Coles kept the cheque.</p>

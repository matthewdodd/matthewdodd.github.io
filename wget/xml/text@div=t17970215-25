               <p>Q. Were you in liquor? - A. No, I was not; when we came to the Cannon he stopped there,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150046"></xptr>and would convince me that I was really in liquor; I said, my friend, I am not, if I am it is nothing to you; upon that he suddenly snatched hold of my watch chain, pulled me down upon my knees, and ran away with the watch; I put my hand in my pocket, and found the outside case left in my fob; the catch does not go properly; I immediately cried out stop thief, stop thief, and he was stopped; he had got round opposite Little Titchfield-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lost sight of him? - A. Yes, it was quite dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know nothing of this man before? - A. No; I am sure it is the same man, but he has changed his coat.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Prisoner, have you any questions that you wish to put to this witness?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, conceiving the embarrassment I should be under, I have committed some questions to paper, if I may be permitted to refer to it as occasion requires.</p>
               <p>Court. By all means.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I humbly thank your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. You had been in the country that day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have already told his Lordship you had not been drinking at all? - A. I could not walk all the way there and back without drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sober? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a dark night? - A. It was dark, but it was star-light.</p>
               <p>Q. From what particular circumstances are you able to swear to my being the person that robbed you? - A. By your features; you have not got the same coat on, it is true; it was a star-light night, but no moon.</p>
               <p>Q. You are so positive to me, that if a soldier similar to me had been apprehended at the time, you would as positively have said he was the man? - A. I will positively say that you are the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You have already informed the Court how I got into your company? - A. You did not get into my company, you attacked me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the person who attacked you, whoever he was, use any violence? - A. No, not till you snatched the watch from me.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not, previous to taking the watch, use any violence whatever? - A. Not by any means, he made a snatch at my watch.</p>

             sworn. - I am clerk to an attorney at the west end of the town: I was walking in company with my brother on Sunday night, the 29th of January, up Titchfield-street; it might be about half past nine; we heard the cry of stop thief; we saw a man running down Norton-street, near the top of Titchfield-street, he was running towards us, we had a dog with us, which we set at the man, and the dog stopped him; he immediately fell; we went up to him and charged him as the thief; he said he was not the thief, that he was run round the corner, and begged of us to stop him; he then got up, and was going to walk away.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not believe that story, I suppose? - A. No; he turned again and said stop, I have lost my hat; we walked by his side a few yards, till he got a little before us; upon finding himself a little before us, he began to run; we were endeavouring to keep him in conversation till the prosecutor came up; we then set the dog at him again, and the dog stopped him; we let him go on so several times that he attempted to slip away; we got him into Titchfield-street, and finding him very anxious to get away I took him by the shoulder; he begged we would not stop him, he was in a hurry upon his own business, and begged we would not hurt him; during all this time I never saw a watchman; when my brother saw I had got the man in custody, he left me, and came back again with two watchmen; I delivered him to the watchmen; and in the mean time the prosecutor came up, and said that was the man that had robbed him; I went back again, and found the watch a very few yards from where the prisoner fell, to the right hand; I shewed it to the prosecutor at the watch-house, he said it was his, and I delivered it to the watch-house keeper.</p>

             sworn. - I am brother to the last witness: On Sunday night, the 29th of January, I was going up Upper Titchfield-street with my brother; we heard a cry of stop thief; when we got very near to Carburton-street, a street leading from the Cannon across Norton-street, into Titchfield-street, hearing the cry of stop thief, I ran to the corner of Carburton-street and saw the prisoner turn round; when I came up to him, in a vacant place where there was space for four houses, he turned in, and we set the dog at him; that part was not paved; whether from the fear of the dog, or the roughness of the road, he fell upon his face; I instantly went up to him, and he got up; I asked him what he had  been doing, he said there was a cry of stop thief, and he believed he had run round the corner; I told him I rather thought he was him; there was some broken earthen-ware lay where these houses were to be built, and I heard something thrown among the rubbish, what it was I cannot tell; then he went to walk a little way, about half a yard; he turned round and said I have lost my hat.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150047"></xptr>Q. Had he lost his hat? - A. Yes; upon that he turned back to pick up his hat, and put it on; after he had put it on, he went a little way, he had got I suppose five yards distance from us, and then ran away; I could not see any person turn round the corner; I still heard the cry of stop thief, but no watchman appeared; at length a boy came round, and said it was a soldier had done it, and I set the dog at him again, he had got I suppose twenty yards when the dog caught him; I found no one came forward, he turned round the corner of Titchfield-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a large dog? - A. The dog weighs I believe 38lbs. between a terrier and a bull-dog; I left my brother and went for the watchman; the prisoner turned round the corner and made a feint to go into a public-house, but I came up, and he said, Gentlemen, I cannot think why you should stop me; I found the watchman at last the corner of Charlotte-street, Portland-road, and we gave charge of him; we walked with him back till we met the prosecutor, and he said that was the man that had robbed him; there was another soldier upon the spot that went with us, whether he was quartered at the public-house I don't know; I told my brother I had heard something fall, whether it was a pistol, or a knife, or his bayonet, or what, I did not know; I went to a doctor's shop and borrowed a light, and we found a watch exactly opposite the place where he fell down; we took him to the watch-house, and delivered him up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. You did not accompany me to the watch-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were upon the spot when I was apprehended? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention to the watchman that you heard any thing fall? - A. Not by any means, I only mentioned it to my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember my asking any person why you stopped me? - A. No further than that you were in haste, that you did not know that you had done any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember my mentioning, gentlemen, I am in a hurry, going home to my quarters, pray let me go? - A. I don't know that you said so.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the watch yourself? - A. No, I did not, my brother did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, at the Public-office, say to the prosecutor, you have to thank this dog for finding your watch? - A. It is very likely I might.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the dog find the watch? - A. No, but I believe he was the strongest person that apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. It was understood that you said the dog  picked it up? - A. I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a very serious thing to me, as my life is involved; - do you remember assigning any reason when you were asked by me why you came forward to give evidence against me? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not to this effect? - I am sorry to see a young man like you in this situation; for my own part, I would not have come forward but to oblige a gentleman to whom I am under very particular obligations. - A. My brother is a clerk to an attorney; and knowing it would be a disagreeable business, I certainly had some difficulty in going, but getting my business done by twelve o'clock, I did go.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Clarke, it was a duty you owed the public, and you would not have done your duty if you had not.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Mr. Laurence Clarke.) Do you think the prosecutor was in liquor when he came up? - A. At the time that he gave charge of the man to the watchman I observed him, and he was very much covered with mod; I don't think he was drunk, I rather think he had been drinking something, but he was not intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You said there was another soldier? - A. There were a great number of people round us when this watchman came up, and this other soldier came out of the public-house the corner of the Mews.</p>

On the evening on which the gentleman supposes he was robbed, I had been at the Globe, in South Molton-street, where I was quartered last year, I had had a pint or two of porter; I went into the Portland-road, in order to get into the City-road to my quarters; I had not proceeded far before the liquor I had drank began to operate, and I turned into a street that I was not acquainted with in

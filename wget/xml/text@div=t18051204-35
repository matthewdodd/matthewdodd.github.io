               <p>- MOSS sworn. On the 22d of November between five and six o'clock in the evening I happened to go into Osborne-street. I saw the prisoner at the bar have a string of pots I said to him, where are you going with them pots, he said what is that to you; a person there says I saw him take them up while the boy was collecting his pots; I said to the prisoner, I must insist upon yout going back to the place where you took them from; I then took him to a butcher's shop: I looked at the pots, and by the name I found I was just by the back door of the prosecutors'.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>

             sworn. I am headborough. On the 22d of November I was coming along, I saw a crowd; accordingly I unlocked the watchhouse door, and took the pots and the prisoner into the watchhouse. I produce the pots.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are every one of them my pots.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have to say my lord, in my defence, I used Mr. Sage's house on and off upwards of two years; I have sufficient witness to prove that I was intoxicated, that I came from Deptford, where I had drank too freely. At Wapping I parted with Mr. Jones, endeavouring to make the best of my way home. Coming through Osborne street, I saw these pots, and in the heat of liquor I took the pots up, and brandished the pots, asking who they belonged to. I did not know they were Mr. Sage's; I went into Mr. Sage's, feeling myself so much in liquor, I came out again, knowing that part of the company would make a comment on me. I was determined to go to some other house in the neighbourhood, or to Mrs. Smith's; meanwhile a person overtook me, and asked me whose pots they were; I told him they were the property of Hanbury and Co. meaning the brewer, who had most of the houses there; being asked who I was, I gave my name

            , No. 2. East-street; I meant no embezzlement, but merely to take them to some house to ascertain the property, and to make the landlord forfeit. When I was brought back, I was surprised to see Mr. Sage; I still held them in my hand, and one of the pots was held up to the light at the butcher's, there he saw they were his property; I was then taken to the watchhouse, and I was for two hours before some recollection; I then offered respectable housekeepers, who would answer for my appearance; it was denied; I was taken before the magistrate; I am perfectly innocent of the charge; I support myself and aged and afflicted mother (who is now in court) by my industry.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a tailor; I live in Red-Cross square, Great Tower-street; I have known the prisoner thirteen years; I never heard a blemish in his character till this time; he called upon me the day this affair happened; I was with him at Wapping; I observed that he had been drinking; I advised him to return home with me; he said he would if I would indulge him to go into a public-house. We went into a house; we got a pipe; as he was sitting with it, he rather fell on one side; I went into the yard, and when I returned he was gone; I never heard of him after, till I heard he was in confinement; I advised him not to cross the water upon account of the state of intoxication he was in; we had only one pint of porter, I was thirsty, I drank the greater part of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Where does he live? - A. No. 2, East-street Spital-fields; he takes care of an aged mother.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

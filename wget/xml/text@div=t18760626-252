I took the prisoner—I said that I held a warrant for her apprehension for knowingly uttering a forged order for delivery of goods, and should take her in custody; she said "All right, I will go with you, I had the order given me in the street by a woman, I had no idea of its being forged. I told her I would try it."</p>

I do not know who she was, on the Friday, and I kept it until the following Tuesday, and then came down to Mr. Carter's and I gave him the order, and he went up to Miss Reeves, and she asked me where I got it from. I told her I got it from some lady in the street. She asked Mr. Carter if I had ever been there before, and he said "No." I turned and asked Miss Reeve if I was to have anything, and she said "No." I thought the order was genuine, and she said "No."</p>

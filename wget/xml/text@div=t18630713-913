I said, "No," unless he would pay me. He had taken me home three or four times before and did not pay me. I got up between 2 and 3 o'clock and went away, and he came running after me and said I had robbed him. I said that I had not, and he said he would have me searched. I did not take his money and did not know where he kept it.</p>

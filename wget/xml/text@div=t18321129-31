               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is your daughter here? A. No - my family had access to the bag when they wanted it; I gave them the key of the bureau - my daughter was about to pay away some of the marked money by mistake; my wife had a key of the bureau - I received 25l. premium with the prisoner at different times; I had tried to get rid of him as an apprentice, and to take him as a journeyman at 5s. a week, on account of his bad conduct, but his father refused it - I did not want to take another apprentice with 60l.; my son is not here - I allowed him and the prisoner some little perquisites, and they told me they kept it in a little box: I did not tell the prisoner's father, that if he would sign a bond to get rid of his indentures, I would not prosecute him: it was suggested by a gentleman named Roudley - I did not say any thing.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your husband paid him nothing as an apprentice? A. No; he had often given him half a crown - I found one halfpenny of the marked money in the prisoner's coat pocket this morning.</p>

            . I keep a corn-chandler's. On the Sunday morning the prisoner came to me, and bought some corn and chaff, which came to 5s. - he paid me 4s. in silver, and 1s. in copper; I put the copper into a drawer, with some other copper - Mr. Underwood came in the evening, and took some copper out, which I have here; I cannot see any mark on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there other money in the drawer? A. Yes, and it remained there till Mr. Underwood came; I believe he had no money in his hand when he came in - he had gloves on; he requested to see the contents of my drawer, and took the money out himself - I have not seen his daughter at my shop.</p>

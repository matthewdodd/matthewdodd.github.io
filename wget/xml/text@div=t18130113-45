I saw the prisoner come through the Savoy sutling-house. He came down the steps to the Strand bridge. This was about five o'clock in the evening. He took up two pieces of timber that were laying on the abutment. I followed him until he got near to the Savoy church-yard, going out into the Strand. I asked him, what he was going to do with it. He said, he was taking them for a use. I asked him, for what use. He then said, he did not know where he was going to take them to; he was going to make a trifle of money; he was short of money. These are the pieces of timber. He brought a man to take one of the pieces.</p>

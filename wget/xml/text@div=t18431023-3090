                  </hi>. I am master of the <hi rend="italic">Harriet</hi> coal-brig, and live at Poole, in Dorsetshire—I formerly knew the prisoner at Gibraltar. On Tuesday afternoon, the 10th of Oct., I met him, and went with him to several houses—we went into the Nile tavern—while there I took but my purse which con<lb></lb>tained three sovereigns, eighteen shillings, and two sixpences, to pay for something—the prisoner could see me do that—I put my purse into my pocket again—the prisoner remained four or five minutes after that, and then went out—I was not sober—he had called for a pot of beer——he had drunk a part of it—three or four minutes after he was gone, some soldiers came in, and said the boat was ready—I said, "Call for a pot of beer, and I will pay for it "—I put my hand into my pocket, and the purse was gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am mate of the <hi rend="italic">Harriet.</hi> On the 10th of Oct. I was in the Nile tavern, and saw the prosecutor and prisoner there—the pro<lb></lb>secutor took out his purse, and put it into his pocket again—there was gold and silver in it—I afterwards saw the prisoner with one arm over the prose<lb></lb>cutor's neck, and the other on the table—he was sitting at the right hand side of the prosecutor, and his hand was towards the right pocket which the purse was in—the prisoner remained a very few minutes after, and had hardly got out of the door when the prosecutor missed his money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

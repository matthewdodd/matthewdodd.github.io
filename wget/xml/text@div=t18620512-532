                  </hi>. On 22d April, I was at home at my father's, for the holidays; I generally go to school—my father is a stationer, and sells receipt stamps—on 22d April, about half-past 12 in the day, I was in the shop—the prisoner came in, and asked for a pound's worth of receipt stamps—I got them, and was folding them up when my father came up to the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. The shop at 23, Skinner-street is mine—on 22d April I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner come in, and heard him ask for some receipt stamps—my son went to get them, and they were brought to the prisoner—I asked the prisoner for the money, and he threw down what appeared to be a sovereign, which I at once perceived to be spurious—I took it up, and found it was bad—I did not tell him it was bad—I said, "Who are the stamps for?"—he said they were for himself—I said, "What are you going to do with them?"—he said, "To send them to my brother at the Cape of Good Hope"—I said, "Where did you get the money from?"—he said he had saved it up—I called in a police-constable, and gave the prisoner in custody—I said nothing about the sovereign being bad, I felt so convinced he knew it—I gave it to the policeman—I stood at the door when I called the policeman in—the prisoner made no answer as to where he got the sovereign from.</p>

                  </hi>. This is a bad sovereign—it is of the ordinary kind, made of the same metal as the shillings, and then coloured—it is as near as possible about two-fifths of the weight of a real sovereign—it is cast in a sovereign mould, and afterwards gilt over by the ordinary process.</p>

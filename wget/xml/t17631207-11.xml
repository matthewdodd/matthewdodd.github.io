               <p>Q. When had you seen them in your shop last?</p>

               <p>Dodd. There were about five hundred weight of them, I found three more of them in another place; there were about half a ton of them at first.</p>

               <p>Dodd. There were about 50 of them on the shelf, the pile was full in the morning (that was 5 or 6) which were gone before I came home; that pile was on the shelf, very near to the outside of the window, the person need not come into the shop to take them; they might draw them from off the pile.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the situation of the shelf.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutor. I was serving behind the counter about a quarter after eight o'clock that night. I saw two cheeses move from the shelf; I came from behind the counter (which is the opposite side the shop, my face was towards the shelf); there then was only they two on the pile; I ran out at the door, seeing them go out at the window, and followed the prisoner, who had got about 10 or 12 yards, and saw him put something under the flap of his coat. I went before him, and said, Friend, where are you going with them cheeses, and tapped him on the shoulder? He said, no where, only in a joke. I called him, and brought him into the shop, and took the two cheeses from under his arm. These are the same here produced; I am certain they are my master's property. I took him into the counting house, and sent for my master; then the prisoner said, Lord bless me, what have I done this for! a man put the cheeses into my hand as I was standing at the corner.</p>

               <p>On the 24th of last month, I was drinking at the Dolphin, in Honey-lane Market, till about 20 minutes after eight at night. I went home; a man that lodges in the house of Mr. Leven, said, James, I should be very much obliged to you, if you had come home sooner, and gone of an errand for me; said I, I'll go on an errand for you ten miles, if you want it, or for any body else; said he, carry these slides, belonging to a watch. to such a man in Holborn. I set out with them about 20 minutes after eight, and came opposite to Warwick lane; there I stopt to make water, and was buttoning up my breeches; coming out of the passage, a man said, be kind enough to lay hold of these two cheeses for a moment. Immediately I mist him; I had them not a minute in my hand before the man came and laid hold on me, and said, What are you doing with these cheeses? Said I, I am holding them for a man that is making water, or casing himself. I had been but five minutes out of our own house, before that man took me into his house: There were three more cheeses found in a house on the outside Newgate, and two others under Newgate. I never went out of our house till 25 minutes after eight o'clock.</p>

My Lord would not hear any character of me; I had as good a character as any man in the world. I have been seven years to serve his Majesty, and am a freeman of the city of London; I am as innocent as a child unborn.</p>

               <p>Leven. He is a barber.

I saw him go out with them; the next morning I had a note from him, to tell me he was in the Counter, and that he had not carried the slides.

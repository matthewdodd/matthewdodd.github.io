                  </hi>. I live at 4, Turrett-grove, Clapham-common, and am a commercial traveller—on Friday, 20th November, about 11 o'clock in the morning I was in Parliament-street, standing at a shop door—I saw a cart coming towards where I was looking from, towards Charing<lb></lb>cross, from Westminster-bridge way—there was a man driving, walking by the side of his horse, with his whip over his shoulder—it was immediately opposite Trollope and Sons, the upholsterers, just before you come to the corner of Charles-street—the man was walking on the proper side of his horse and cart, on the near side of his horse—he was an old man; he appeared to me about sixty—at that time I saw another cart, it looked like a tradesman's cart; a lad was driving it—I have every reason to believe it was the prisoner—when he came to where this other cart was, he passed it on the near side, that was the side between Trollope's and the wagon, the wrong side—at the time he so passed there was just sufficient room for him to be enabled to pass any vehicle that might be drawn up at the side of the road, just the breadth of the cart—whilst it was passing I saw either the shaft, or some part of the light cart strike the deceased on the shoulder—he staggered and fell down on his face immediately before the wheel of his own cart—the horse was walking, and I saw the wheel pass up his body, and rest on the pole of his neck—the horse then stood still, and he was pinned to the ground in that way—the light cart had, by this time, passed on—immediately after that I saw a policeman come across the road and take the head of the horse that was standing still, and back it off, and I was surprised to see the de<lb></lb>ceased roll towards the kerb-stone; he was not killed on the spot—the policeman followed the light cart and called the boy back, and he returned—I saw the man in proper hands and went on my way.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, A</hi> 232). On 20th December, between 11 and 12 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Parliament-street—I saw a heavy cart coming from Westminster-bridge towards Charing-cross—the deceased, James Ray, was driving it—I also saw a small light cart coming up towards Charing-cross, at the same time—the prisoner was driving it; he was going about five or six miles an hour—I saw the light cart come up to where the heavy cart was, and pass it on the near side, the left side—when it passed the deceased was about opposite the end of his own shaft, or the horse's head—the light cart ran against him, either the fore part of the wheel or the shaft—I saw the cart run against him, and the man stagger; another cart kept the sight from me; and by the time I passed the cart, the man was under his own cart wheel—I was prevented from seeing him fall by the other cart—the cart struck the left side of the man's body, and he fell forward straight across the road, the deceased's own cart wheel then</p>

               <p>went on him—I went to his horse's head and backed it off—I afterwards put him on a stretcher, and two other constables took him to the hospital—the light cart drove on I should say about fifteen or twenty yards—I called to the prisoner, and he stopped and came back, and I ascertained his name and address—there was a good deal of traffic in Parliament-street at this time—it was just below Charles-street, on the Westminster-bridge side—the right hand side of the light cart struck the deceased.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at Westminster Hos<lb></lb>pital on 20th December, when the deceased, James Ray, was brought there—it was about half-past 11—he was then alive; he was very weak, in a a state of collapse, had considerable difficulty in breathing, and in a good deal of pain—I had him removed to the ward and put into bed at once—I examined him and found he had several of his ribs broken, four at least I should say, on the right side—he was under my care about fifty-two hours—he then died—the cause of death was the wound of the lungs, from the sharp end of the rib having penetrated the lungs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Ferdinand Hershfeld Peraire, a merchant, of 24, Cannon-street—the prisoner was his town traveller for about thirteen months, and was in the employ of other parties besides—his duty was to obtain orders, receive the moneys when due, and pay them over to me or to Mr. Peraire—about the latter end of October I told him that several accounts of his customers were not paid, and I should have to take steps to recover them—he said that some of them were not able to pay, and made various excuses, and that he would try to get them in—when pressed closely, he said, "I told you, Mr. Baker, I have taken the cash of some of them"—I looked rather surprised, and said, "To what extent have you done so?"—he said, "To about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "I am indeed surprised to hear you say so; it is a very serious thing, and I feel it my duty to acquaint</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186411210059"></xptr>
               <p>Mr. Peraire with it," but I did not do so till about a fortnight afterwards—during that time be canoe three or four times, and each time I said, "Mr. Hamilton, have you got any of those accounts?"—he said, "Mr. Baker, I am sorry to see you take it so much to heart, because I value your good opinion, and it will be all right"—I asked him each time if he was prepared to pay the money—he said, "No"—I said, "I cannot allow you to go on any longer; you or I must tell Mr. Peraire this morning"—he then went to Mr. Peraire, who was in the warehouse, and I heard him say that he had cashed some money—Mr. Peraire asked him to what amount—he said, "Well, perhaps, to the amount of 50<hi rend="italic">l"</hi>—Mr. Peraire came into the counting-house, and told me to send for a policeman—he then gave the prisoner in custody—he may have collected from 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. during his employment—Mr. Giddings, Mr. St. John, and Mr. Purchase, are customers of ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you engage the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, Mr. Peraire did—he was to be paid by commission on all goods sold by him—the commission was paid at any time he liked to have it—when an order is given the name of the customer would be entered in the commission book, and the amount of goods sold—I should do that from our sales book, which I keep—the prisoner brought his orders in written on paper—four months' credit was given in some cases, and 21 1/2 per cent discount in a month—the prisoner was paid on the bulk sum at which the goods were invoiced—if he required payment of his commission in a week after he obtained the order, he would not have it, because it would give us unnecessary trouble—when I said that he had it when he liked, I meant once in three months—he would be paid by a cheque—he has not been paid this; he has not applied for it—he received no cheque from Christmas till he was put into gaol—I am positive he never told me that he had retained some of the accounts to pay his commission—I had no knowledge that he had used sums, and not paid them over to me—these papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my writing—the whole of the business the prisoner did was his own connexion, but he did not obtain many customers—the business he did was small; 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—we had no other collector—he collected from all our customers except those in the City, which I collected myself—our trade is principally on the Continent, and he must have known that commissions alone could not have paid him—he collected for other houses as well—I do not think he ever told me that he was put to considerable expense in extending the business—he did not tell me he had laid out, in soliciting orders, some of the sums he had received—he said that he was expecting funds; I believe that was from the Ornamental Wood Company—he said latterly when I pressed him for the money, "Well, I am looking out for a partner, and I shall do your business in a different way; I shall buy the goods of you as a wholesale buyer, and supply them myself"—Mr. Peraire had objected to such small orders, and complained of it for four or five months—I said that if he would pay the money at once from his connexion I would allow him 2 1/2 per cent.—I was not then aware that he had received any money—I have a book in which I enter what accounts are due, and I keep this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I handed the prisoner a paper, and said, "Here is so and so; I must have that paid <hi rend="italic">n</hi>—he said, "I will see if I can get any of them in"—the information in our books, from which this is abstracted, is not furnished by the prisoner, but from our ledger—I do not know when I made out these two papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), I make out so many of them—I gave him the account, Chapman, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did not furnish me with it—I have not noticed that some of these figures are struck through with a pencil; those marks were not there when I handed it to him—if they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186411210060"></xptr>
               <p>were struck through by me they would have been in ink—when I first heard that he had received some of these accounts, I gave him a fortnight's time, on his promise that he should receive some money, and would pay it—he said many times that the Ornamental Wood Work directors were about to meet, and he should have some money—I believe he brought orders within the fortnight after he told me this; if he did I should have taken them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, of 24, Cannon-street, City—the prisoner has not accounted to me or paid me these three sums—I think I engaged him—his duty was to take orders from his customers, whom he represented to be very numerous, from his former connexion, and if the amounts were due, to collect them and band them over either to me or to Mr. Baker as soon as collected—it was distinctly stated several times that the amounts must be handed over directly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Why did you tell him so several times? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because once or twice I saw that amounts collected on Friday or Saturday were put down on Monday—I said that I would not allow it, but that the money must be brought to the office as soon as it was paid—when I gave him in custody I did not know that he had not received his commission for twelve months—the commission-accounts were made up, and he would have his money whenever he liked—he would say, "I want my commission account," and I should ask Mr. Baker what it was, and give him a cheque—he could always see the books—when I gave the prisoner in custody I acted on what he himself told me—he did not say at that time that there was anything due to him.</p>

               <p>I self if you would allow him a discount? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not a word—the conversation on that subject was, I objected to very small accounts, at they gave too much trouble to write out all the statements in the books, and Mr. Baker said that as the prisoner would lose his commission upon them, if when he got a partner I would execute the small orders, he would take them and pay for them—that was at least two months, and, perhaps, three months before he was taken in custody.</p>

               <p>

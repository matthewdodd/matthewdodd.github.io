                  </hi>. I am a single woman, of 14, Splits-terrace, Whitechapel, and am an umbrella maker—On 30th March last I was employed by Mr. Boss, of Little Love-lane, Wood-street, Cheapside—I work at home—at that time the prisoner was in my employ—on 30th March, about 2 o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon, I sent her to Mr. Boss's with two dozen umbrellas—she left them—she ought to have brought me some work home, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money—she could have been home between 4 and 5 o'clock, at the very latest—she did not return—I sent my mother to her house, who came back with her to my place at half-past 6 in the evening—she brought me one dozen covers, one dozen frames, two dozen trimmings, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in Money—I asked her why she did not bring 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and she said she had stopped it for a little sum I owed her—I thought nothing of that—I asked her if she had anything more to deliver from Mr. Boss's, and she said that they would send me another dozen down on Saturday, but she did not say whether it was to be a dozen frames, or a dozen covers—she did not at any time that day tell me that Mr. Boss had given her two dozen umbrella-frames.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DICKIE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were any covers sent to your place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; my mother carried the things from the prisoner's house—the umbrella frames have never been found—I do not write—I do not know that it was half past four o'clock when the prisoner was at Mr. Bon's—when I send her for an errand, she is always going home—as she was late that day, I sent for her—she was talking to her mother, and the work wag lying on her mother's bed; there was no concealment—her mother lives at Bell's-place, Commercial-road—I discharged the prisoner on the following day because she was not worth the money I gave her—I am not single now—I have been married since.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What o'clock was it when you sent to her mother's house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Half past six in the evening—it is not above 3 minutes' walk from our place to where her mother lives—it takes about half an hour to walk from Mr. Boss's to her mother's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of the last witness—in consequence of a communication from her I went to the prisoner's mother's house on 30th March about half past six—she did not deliver anything to me—I took the things off the bed; one dozen covers, one dozen frames, and the trimming for two dozen was found when the bundle was opened on her own bed at home—while the prisoner was opening the bundle to show us, she said "They will send you another dozen to-morrow by the lad"—that was all I heard from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you live a good way from Whitechapel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, we call it Commercial-road—that is rather further than Whitechapel—I went to this place, being astonished that the girl had not come back—when I went to the house, I found her standing talking to her mother—she said she had not been there 5 minutes—I at once went up stairs, saw the things lying in a bundle on the bed, and I took them and carried them home—she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070106"></xptr>
               <p>offered to carry them for me, but I carried them myself, as it was only a little way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say anything to her when you went in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I scolded her for stopping so long—she said she had only just come home; that she had not been there above 5 minutes—I took the work and went down stairs, and she followed me—she said she had occasion to go into the back yard, and that detained her—that was all she said to me—she did not appear in the least unwilling to go with me; she went quite readily.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, High-street, Bloomsbury, and am fore<lb></lb>woman to Mr. Boss, of Little Love-lane—I remember the prisoner bringing home, on 30th March, some work from Amy Sadd—I gave her 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some other materials to take back—I gave her two dozen whalebone frames, one dozen green gingham covers, and two dozen trimmings—I am quite certain that I gave her two dozen frames.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> During this transaction, were you not called to attend to some one else? <hi rend="italic">A</hi> No; I can say that I did not have any con<lb></lb>versation with any one while the prisoner was there; not to my knowledge—if a person spoke to me I should answer them, but I did not go out of the room—I am quite sure that I gave two dozen frames, and two dozen trimmings—I have never made a mistake since I have been in the business—the servant came to call me to my tea which was in another room—the prisoner stayed there perhaps 10 minutes—if I had any work-people to attend to, I did not go to my tea—I am not friendly with the prosecutrix—they are quite strangers to me—I only have to serve them—they have threatened at Boss's to discharge me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many people did you serve that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say a dozen—we were in a great hurry at that time—we always close early on Friday, Mr. Boss not being of our religion.</p>

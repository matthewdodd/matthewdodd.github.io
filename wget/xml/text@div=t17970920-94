               <p>Q. Do you know the house to whom that cellar belongs? - A. Yes; it belongs to the sexton, Mrs. Round; and the prisoner then ran up Aldersgate-street, and turned up Westmoreland-buildings; a man came up, and said, he was an officer; and at the bottom of Westmoreland-buildings, we took him; we carried him to a public-house, and searched him, but there was no sort of coin in the world found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200091"></xptr>upon him; I never lost sight of him; the dollar that I had from the girl, I gave to the constable; if Mr. Meek had come, we should have taken him with all the money about him.</p>

               <p>Q. What are the value of them? - A. I reckon I could have sold them for nine pounds, I should not have given more than eight pounds for them; the first that I saw of them afterwards, was five at Mr. Mathews's, in the Minories, on the Saturday; and I saw four more at Mr. Davidson's, in the Borough, ten days after, or more; I know them to be mine from the quality, and from certain marks that I had observed in working them; and had put them by for certain persons that I thought they would suit; I saw the prisoner aout nine o'clock, within a hundred yards of my house, I never saw her before.</p>

               <p>Q. Had not you told her it would be better for her to confess? - A. No; it was voluntary; she said she was sorry for the other woman, for she was not with her when she pledged them; she said the she had pledged five skins at Mr. Mathews's and the other four she had pledged at Mr. Davidson's, in the Borough, in the name of Darby, but that Darby was not with her.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Lambeth-street-office, I was with Griffiths: I took Mr. Matthews to see the prisoner in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150021"></xptr>the lock-up-room, and she said to Mr. Matthews, it was me that pawned them; the other pawnbroker could not swear to the woman, and the Magistrate ordered him to deliver up the skins. (The five skins were identified by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Goulding. The other four I had returned to me, and I have sold them.</p>
               <p>Griffiths. The prisoner acknowledged that she had pledged these skins at Mr. Davidson's.</p>
               <p>Goulding. I knew the other four to be mine by the marks, and the quality; by the quality, I mean that these were skins that I bought in a rough state, and before, what we call grounding them, I washed them over with a liquor which contracts them, alters the texture of them, makes them finer, and not so spungy; it is a practice that is exploded in the trade; I do not know any man in the trade that uses it besides myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My husband is a leather breeches-maker, and he makes up his leather, and sells at Rag-fair; my husband bought some skins of a Jew, he had not money enough to pay for them, and he sent me with five skins to pledge; the skins that were pledged in the Borough I never saw; I am innocent of it.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Goulding.) Was it light when you went out? - A. No, it was not. <rs id="t18010415-30-verdict159" type="verdictDescription">

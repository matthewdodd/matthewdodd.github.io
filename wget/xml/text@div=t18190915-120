            . On the 29th of August I had been out for a walk. I returned about half-past eight o'clock, and saw a lad sitting on Mr. Stephens's step, looking up and down the place; he was about fourteen years old. When I got past him, I saw two men came out of the area, with a bundle under each arm. I followed them into Marylebone-lane, there being nobody present to assist me. When I was within ten yards of the prisoner, I called Stop thief! and he dropped the bundle of clothes before him, ran about three yards, and was stopped by a coachman. I gave him in charge, and am sure he is the man who came out of the area. The property was picked up, and given to the officer. The other man was about twenty yards before the prisoner - he dropped his bundle, and escaped. I lost sight of the prisoner for two minutes as he ran down a court - I ran round, and caught sight of him again with the bundle, and did not lose sight of him after he dropped it. I saw him come out of the area.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I apprehended the prisoner on the 10th of November, about five o'clock in the afternoon, with a basket on his shoulder, which seemed very heavy. He passed me - I went after him, and stopped him - I asked what he had in his basket - he was then in Harford-street, May Fair - he threw down the basket, and said lead, which he had brought from a building just above, and if I would go back he would show me. I asked him if any person gave him the lead - he said "Yes." I went to Mr. Burgess's with him. I then asked the prisoner where he was going? he said, to Wardour-street, where his master lived. I took him to the watch-house - the lead weighed 36 lbs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. He took you back to this house, where Mr. Burgess was at work? A. Yes; he then said he was going to take it to his master's - that a great quantity was taken away on the night before, and his master authorised him to bring that home.</p>

               <p>MR. BURGESS re-examined. Q. If your servant had found any more lead would it not have been his duty to have brought it to your house? A. Yes.</p>

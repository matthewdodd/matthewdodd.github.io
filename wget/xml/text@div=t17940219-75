               <p>Prisoner. We had a coach to go to the Commons to take out the licence, and he gave me a ten pound note, and he had said before to me, that when he had some money come to him, without you will be my wife I will never live with you. Another day he bought me a pair of silver sugar tongs, a silver punch ladel, seven china bowls, two large ones, which we had one for our marriage bowl. When he urged me to marriage, I told him I was married; then he said that was nothing, for if I was cast for death, I was dead in law and to all; and when I asked him what name I must be married in? he said, I must be married in my maiden name. I never lived with my first husband but eight months; there he is, he knows what I say is truth.</p>

               <p>I know Lark; I have known him personally these ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever give you any reason why he would marry that woman? - At the latter end of March, or beginning of April, in the year 1790, I was going up Drury-lane, and I went into a house and had a glass of brandy, while I was in Lark and two or three more came in, and one said to him, I hear you are going to be married to Kit Connolly; he said he was; they said they wondered how he would do that, when he knew she was a married woman; he said, damn me if I care about that, for that is all done away, and I shall marry her.</p>

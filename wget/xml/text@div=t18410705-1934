                  </hi>. I am a gunner and driver in the eighth battalion of Artillery, at Woolwich. On the 14th of June, in the evening, I was in the Barrack-yard, washing some tables—I could see the window of the room No. 64—I saw John Grice at the window of that room—he was leaning on a small desk on the window board, writing—I saw the flash of a musket, and heard the report, and immediately after heard him cry out, "I am shot"—I immediately ran up the steps, and down the stairs, and went to the room where he was, No. 64—I saw John Grice, the bom<lb></lb>bardier, leaning on the window cill—he had not fallen on the floor—the prisoner came forward, and said, "I am the man who shot him"—Grice was bleeding, and was wounded—I saw the blood—I did not see the pri<lb></lb>soner at first—he came as it were from behind the door—any body might bare left the room and run up the stairs before I got there—the prisoner had nothing in his hand—there were twelve beds in the room, six on each side—they were turned up—the bedsteads turn up—I cannot say who came in after me—I saw a cartridge burning under Grice's face, it was the paper out of the musket—Grice was carried away, and the prisoner given into custody—I went out of the room into the yard, and shortly after returned into the room, looked behind the door, and saw a musket standing against the wall—I did not examine it then, I did a few minutes after<lb></lb>wards, and it appeared as if it had been recently fired—I was near enough to the deceased to have heard him speak if lie had been speaking before the flash—I was four or five yards from the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sergeant-major of the sixth battalion of Artillery, at Woolwich.

DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the deceased say any thing else about the pri<lb></lb>soner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was moaning a great deal—he said at times, "He must have been a bad man"—it was difficult almost to know what he said—I asked if there was any quarrel between them—he said, "No, none"—he said, "In the early part of the day he had asked me for money, and I told him he had had quite enough to drink, and would not give him any"—I said, "Did he appear at all annoyed at your refusal?"—he said, "No, he did not."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a captain in the Royal Artillery, to which the deceased belonged. When I heard what had happened I went to the hospital, and saw him there in Mr. Li tie's presence—I asked Mr. Litte in what state he considered the deceased—he said he was in a most dangerous state—I conceive he must have heard that, as it was close to his bed—I asked Mr. Litte if I might safely speak to him—he said he thought I might—I then asked Grice if he thought he could without much pain to</p>

               <p>himself answer one or two questions—he said be could—I asked if he could in any way account to me for this dreadful act—he said no, he could not—I asked if he had any quarrel—he said, "No," the only thing was that day at dinner time, the prisoner came to him, and asked him to lend him some money, which he said he would not do, as he had had drink enough; that he pressed him, saying, "You know I will pay you"—he said, "No, I will not let you have it"—I asked him if that at all exas<lb></lb>perated him—he said, "No, not at all"—there had been nothing whatever to call on the prisoner to dispose of one of his cartridges—there are ten rounds given to each soldier in two packets of five rounds each, and that am<lb></lb>munition is on no account to be used for any detail of the garrison—there its convict-guard, and two guards on the river for which the men load—the men for the convict-guard are always furnished from the laboratory with each a ball cartridge by the quarter-master, when mustered to go on duty they are all ordered to load, and every man receives one cartridge, and at night when the guard is over they are 811 ordered to fall in again, the charges are drawn, and a person in the arsenal receives the broken powder which each man returns, and his musket bullet—there was no circumstance whatever to cause the absence of the cartridge—under no circumstances can a soldier have his musket loaded in the barracks without being guilty of a high crime.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You mean a military offence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the pri<lb></lb>soner enlisted in May 1826, I believe—he was then eighteen year old—he has a good conduct stripe on his arm, and if be had continued good another month he would have had another—he has been a good soldier, of course, from 1837.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> When I saw the prisoner cleaning his pouch on his bed I did not see his musket—I did not notice whether his pouch was closed or open—it was the brass part outside that he was cleaning, making the brass part bright—the pouch appeared to be shut at that time—I saw no musket near him—I did not take notice—I think if there had been one on the bed or near his hand I should have seen it—I taw him distinctly—the bedstead was turned up—the pouch was on the rug—the rug and blanket were on the top of the bed—he was standing up with his hands on the pouch on the bed—there was no other soldier in the room—it was about three or four minutes from the time of my going out into the yard, and hearing the report—the prisoner had no gun with him when he was walking about the yard shaking his head.</p>

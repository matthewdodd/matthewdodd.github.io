               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, which was read, as follows:</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen of the Jury - As the chief witness for the prosecution, I have every reason to expect, comes forward not to do public justice, but for pecuniary emolument, I hope the Court will grant me the indulgence of enquiring into his private character as to the mode of his subsistence, being credibly informed he is one of those who obtain a living by informations upon lottery transactions, and other things; I cannot learn where his residence is, and he himself refuses to say where he lives, and therefore there is no opportunity of investigating; I implore the Court that they will satisfy themselves that he is an honest man, before they admit his evidence to affect the life of a fellowcreature. I hope this will induce the Jury to consider it their duty to attend to his evidence; he left no address at the office from which I was committed, and gave no account of himself previous to the finding the bill of indictment."</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

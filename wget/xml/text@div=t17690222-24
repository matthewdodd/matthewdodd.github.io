               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he get into the house?</p>
               <p>Jones. I believe he got up on the backside of the house: here is a chissel I found with him. (Produced in court.) This chissel exactly fitted to the marks he had made in cutting it off.</p>

His friends are very honest people at Coventry. If the court will consider his youth, and give him his punishment here, I will, at my own expence, see that he shall return down to his friends.</p>

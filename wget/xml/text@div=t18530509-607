                  </hi>. I am a pork butcher at Edmonton. On 30th April last I bought some hay and straw of another man, and the prisoner was employed to take it into my back premises—it was as near about 9 o'clock in the morning as could be—in my yard at the back I have a tub of water, and in the tub there were two legs of pork—they belonged to me—the prisoner took two trusses of hay and a truss of straw into the yard, and then went away—I</p>

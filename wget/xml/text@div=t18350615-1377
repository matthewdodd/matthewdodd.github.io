I am master of the barge <hi rend="italic">Perseverance</hi>; Caleb Hitch is the owner—it laid in the West India Docks Basin, at Limehouse, on the 31st of May—I, my son, and Chapman, formed the whole crew—about eight o'clock on Sunday morning, the 31st of May, we all left it to<lb></lb>gether—I returned about eight o'clock in the evening, and found Chapman</p>

               <p>there and Floyd—I missed the ropes and a block, which I had left under the tarpauling, covered over—the prisoner said he was watching two lighters in the basin—he was in his own craft when I came back—he was looking after two craft; one having tobacco in it, and the other was empty—he said so himself—he was in the empty craft—the officer asked him for the key of the tobacco barge cabin, and he gave it to us—I told him I was going to get a warrant to search his barge—Chapman opened the cabin in my presence with the key, and brought up part of the rope—I knew it to be mine very well, and the other rope I found under the tar<lb></lb>pauling of the tobacco craft—they are both ours, and both were on board the same barge.</p>

The <hi rend="italic">Perseverance</hi> and the two barges were very near together—the prisoner had the care of the tobacco barge and the other barge—I told him the rope was missed, and charged him with the theft—I went on board the tobacco barge, but found the cabin locked—I asked the prisoner for the key—he gave it to me—I gave it to Chapman, who went down and found a coil of rope with the block to it—I asked the prisoner if he had had the key in his possession the whole day—he said he had—I found the coil under the tarpauling, between the casks of tobacco, concealed at the bottom of the barge—he produced a note, which was his authority to have the care of the barges.</p>

Upon turning to the left I saw the prisoner walking off with it on his knot, about forty yards off. I pursued and asked what he was going to do with it? he said, what was that to me, and that they were not mine. I took him to the watch-house. He said, a man gave him 1 d., lifted them on his head, and told him to take them to a cart by the watch-house - he insisted that they were not mine after I gave charge of him; I am sure they were mine. I have seen him frequently in the market with a knot. He did not say he was employed to carry them till he got to the watch-house. It is usual to employ porters to carry to the carts - he did not offer to shew me the cart; but struck me and tried to escape.</p>

On Saturday, the 1st of November, between five and six in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop to pledge a handkerchief for six-pence; there were two or three people in the shop at the same time, at the front of the counter, and she stood behind; I had the handkerchief in my hand, and she said she would call again; she went away; when the other people were gone away, I dare say it was not five minutes before I missed a gown that was hanging upon a part of the shop,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080101"></xptr>upon some pins. I directly suspected her and sent about to the pawnbrokers, and the shop that I found the gown pledged at was Mr. Swaine's, in Panton-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner; did you ever see her before? - On the 1st of November, about seven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner at the bar pledged with me a gown for seven shillings. I have got it.</p>
               <p>Gordon. I have got a petticoat of it, and there is a piece of the same, I am certain it is the same; I had it by me a long time; it is made very old fashioned.</p>

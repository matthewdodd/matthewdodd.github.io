                  </hi>. In Nov. 1856, I was in the messenger's office of the South Eastern Railway. I remember an accident happening on 30th Oct. at Deptford station—a few days afterwards this note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was put into my hands, in consequence of which I went to No. 33, Somer Street, Tanner's Hill, Deptford, the address contained in the letter—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner there, and showed her the letter, saying, that we had received it from her about her injuries—she said, "Yes; I was very much hurt"—I asked her what compensation she thought would be likely to satisfy her—she did not state any particular amount, so I suggested the amount which I paid her, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and took her receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).—(<hi rend="italic">The letter was signed Mrs. Grist, Tanner's Hill, Deptford, stating that, she was very much hurt in the back and loins, that she could not sit to work as a tailoress, and that she would be satisfied with a small compensation being very poor</hi>)—she did not say anything about where the accident occurred, and I took it for granted that she was in the accident—I paid her the money from my belief in the truth of that letter.</p>

I live next door to the prisoner—I heard of the accident in Oct.—I saw the prisoner on the morning afterwards, and she asked me if I had heard of the accident, I said that I had not—she said that it was a very serious one, and happened in Church Street on the railway, and she knew a person in King Street who was injured, that Dr. Downing, who was attending him, told him that he was not to take any money that the railway company offered him—she said nothing about being injured herself, she appeared in her usual health—she did not tell me at what time the accident happened—Isaw her in the day before that conversation several times in the morning and at night, but there was no appearance of suffering about her—about a month after that conversation we had a little disagreement, and she shook her pocket at me, and said that she could produce more sovereigns than I could farthings—I said that if she could, I supposed she had got it by cheat<lb></lb>ing some railway company, or some way that she ought not—I had not known from her about any application she had made to any railway company—shesaid that she had not cheated any one, she was not ashamed to show her purse anywhere.</p>

From Oct, 1856, to Jan., 1857, I was surgeon to the Kent Dispensary—I attended the prisoner's daughter at my house with a dispensary letter to the latter end of Aug., 1856—some few weeks after that, the prisoner called on me, and asked me to give her a certificate of the cause of death of her daughter—I believed her daughter was well, as she had discontinued her visits to me two or three months before, this being quite at the end of the year—I told her that I could not give her a certificate of the cause of death, as I had not seen her for so long a period, and was not aware of her death—she said she thought I could, as I was the last medical man that attended her—she said nothing about any railway accident.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Clement Danes. On the 5th of May I saw the prisoner at the corner of Wych-street, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, in company with a girl of the town; he had a bundle: I asked him what he had got there - he said, "Pieces of cloth;" I said, "What cloth?" he did not give me a satisfactory answer, and I took him to the watch-house.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to me about one o'clock, between the 4th and 5th of May; I had the bundle opened, and asked him how he got the things - he said they were pieces which were allowed to him: he did not then say where he lived, or how he got them, but begged I would not take charge of him, and he would pay me anything to let him go. I found one of the pieces of cloth in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did he not tell you where he lodged? A. Yes, afterwards - I went, and they said he had not been there for three nights.</p>

The prisoner has been in our employ about twelve months; he used to cut up the cloth on the premises: this is our cloth - there is about three yards of it altogether; there are two lengths about a yard each: he had no right to carry away any property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the only mode of identifying this cloth, its having the broad arrow on it? A. Yes. Many persons have the same sort of cloth, and the same mark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is very clear if a man goes in the least aside from honesty he is amenable to the laws of his country, and it is clear the cloth was in my possession, but I had not taken it for the purpose of stealing it. I must leave the case to the Jury.</p>

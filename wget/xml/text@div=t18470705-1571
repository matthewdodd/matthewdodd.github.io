                  </hi> I live at Staines, and am a coal-merchant—the pri<lb></lb>soner was in my service. At a little after six o'clock in the morning of the 30th of June, I heard something in my lane which leads to the coal-wharf—I looked out of the window, and saw the prisoner and the policeman in the lane—I put on my clothes, and went down and found the prisoner and the policeman, and about 100 yards lower down in my yard I saw a barrow with a sack and some coals in it—the sack was mine—the coals I do not know—I deal in such coals—the prisoner was my agricultural servant—he had nothing to do with the coals—he, of course, had to go down the yard occa<lb></lb>sionally—I gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was not going to steal the coals; the cook ordered me to take coals and wood into his place; I took them in mornings and mornings for her.</p>

I was on duty in Staines a little before six o'clock on the morning of the 30th of June, near the prose<lb></lb>cutor's, and heard a shovel move on his premises—I looked round, and saw the prisoner putting coals into a sack on the wharf—he did not weigh the coals—I followed him about 200 yards, and stopped him—he said he was going to take them to the foreman—I asked where the foreman was—he said, "In the stable"—I went there, and there was no one there—the fore-man was not on the premises—I took the prisoner to the station—this is the sack.</p>

               <p>Q. By what means had the persons entered? A. By raising the window of the Board-room, not by breaking the glass; the Board-room is part of the building, and communicates internally with the rest of the premises - it is part of my dwelling-house; I know that window was shut down the preceding night, but whether it was fastened I cannot say: I looked about that night to see that every thing was safe - the boxes had been broken open, by a chisel, which we found; a piece of brass, belonging to a centre-bit, was found under the window in the garden - they had entered at the Board-room window, which was found open. Moore was a pauper in the house two or three years ago.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Luke's. On the morning of the 2d of October, about half-past four, I was standing near the workhouse-wall; I heard the prisoner Moore jump from the wall, and saw Crisp on the wall - I took them both into custody; they at first said they were only making their escape from the workhouse, and begged of me to let them go - it was quite dark; they came from the wall which enclosed the workhouse: Moore jumped off the wall and I took him - then Crisp came down and I took him, and going down Bath-street I met another watchman, who assisted me in taking them to the watch-house; in Bath-street I heard something drop from Crisp, and as we returned from the watch-house, we found a centre-bit in the place where I heard something drop, and this small crow-bar I found in Moore's jacket pocket in Bath-street.</p>

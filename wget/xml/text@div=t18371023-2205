I saw Mr. Colling on the night of the 1st of October—I saw the prisoner and a woman dote after him, following him—I saw the prisoner lift up Mr. Colling's coat with his right hand, and put his left hand into the pocket—I saw him hold the coat up till he put his hand in—he then gently lowered the coat, drew his hand out, and passed it under his own coat to the woman—I stepped round I the woman and collared him directly with my right hand—the woman had kept close to him so that I could not get between them, but the moment collared him the woman went away—I tapped Mr. Colling over the I shoulder and asked him if he bad lost any thing—he put his hand to his I pocket and said, "I have lost my handkerchief."</p>

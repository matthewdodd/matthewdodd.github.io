I saw the prisoner going out of the shop, on the 11th of December, about a quarter to nine o'clock in the morning, with the tub of butter on his shoulder; I was in the counting-house with the clerk; I pursued the prisoner, and never lost sight of him; I stopped him, brought him back, and asked him if he wanted Smith, whom he had been inquiring for at our shop a few weeks previous - he gave no reason for taking the butter.</p>

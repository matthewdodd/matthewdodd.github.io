                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Anderton, he keeps a coffee-shop and eating-house, at Stratford. On 16th Nov. the prisoner came to the shop at twelve o'clock at night, with a young woman—they sat down and had some coffee—in a short time the young woman went out in the back-yard—shortly after she had gone, I missed the prisoner, and I heard some persons outside talking loudly—I sent a woman to tell them to come in, and the young woman came in—she had not a shawl on then, but she had when she first came—she wanted to go out for it, and I said the young man would bring it in with him, and I would not allow her to go out again—I then opened the back-door, and asked him to come in—he was then standing opposite the parlour window—I was then standing with my back to the parlour-door, to prevent the girl from going out, and I heard a noise in the back parlour—I went in with a lighted candle, and found the shutters were open, and the sash lifted up—I saw the prisoner standing outside the room, opposite the window—he had this work-box partly outside the window—I took it from him; it is my husband's pro<lb></lb>perty—it contained some thread and thimbles, and other articles—the</p>

               <p>shutters of that room had been closed about six o'clock in the evening—I took the box from the prisoner's hand; he escaped—I gave information, and he was taken afterwards—I had seen the box on a small work-table just under the window, perhaps two hours before—a person like the prisoner could have put his hand in that window and reached the box where it was—the prisoner came to my house again in about a quarter of an hour with the girl—I do not think be said anything then—on the Sunday morning he came and said he was very sorry for what he had done; he said I had not lost any thing, and what good would it be to me to im<lb></lb>prison him for two or three months—I said, it was no goodness of his that I had lost nothing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Thomas Slatter, a hackney<lb></lb>carriage proprietor in John-street, Fitzroy-square—the prisoner came into his employ as a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-driver, on the 26th of September—on the following Saturday afternoon he went from the yard with a horse and <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and re<lb></lb>turned about eleven o'clock at night, drunk—the horse was in a very bad state—it had been out from six to seven hours, and I noticed that it had been cut about very much—I counted twenty-two cuts on the horses flank, where the skin had been broken, and it bled very much—at the first place where it stopped there was about a tea-cupful of blood upon the stones—it then went on to another place, and stopped to have the harness taken off, and there was another tea-cupful of blood—I sent for the police<lb></lb>man, and gave the prisoner into custody—as they were going up Mortimer-street, I was a little in advance of the prisoner, I heard a noise—I turned round, and saw him and one of the policemen on the ground—I saw the knife directly after it was taken from the prisoner's hand, while he and the policeman were on the ground.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 159.) At half-past eleven o'clock on that Saturday night, I was called to take the prisoner—I saw the blood a the yard in two places, and the horse was in the stable—the prisoner denied having done it—I took him out of the yard—he said he would walk quietly with me if I would let him go—I allowed him to walk by my side—when we got to Newman-street, he said he would not go any further, and threw himself back—I took hold of him—when we got to Mortimer-street, Doswell came up and took hold of the prisoner—he said he would not go any further, and if we did not let him go he would do for us—he then drew this knife from his coat pocket—I seized his arm—in throwing him down I let go his arm, and he then made a stab at Doswell's right cheek—he laid hold of his arm—we got the knife from him, and he was taken on towards the station-house—when we got to Cavendish-square, he commenced struggling again, and threw himself down—on the following morning he said he did not draw the knife to stab us, but to cut his neck cloth—it was immediately after he said that he would do for us, that he drew it.</p>

I was down Berner's Mews, and heard a disturbance—I came up, and saw the prisoner struggling—I laid hold of him—he was then very quiet—I let go his arm—he then resisted—I took hold of him again—when we got to Mortimer-street, he said, "If you don't let me go, I will do for you"—he had scarcely spoken the words before his right-hand came from his pocket, and I saw the blade of a knife—we threw him on his back, and while he was on his back he made a stab at my face, and it came so near, that the cuff of his coat came to my face—we got the knife from him.</p>

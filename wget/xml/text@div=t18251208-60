            . I am a Thames police-officer. On the evening of the 2d of November, between six and seven o'clock, I stopped the prisoner in the New-road, St. George's in the East, about half a mile from the prosecutor's house - he was carrying six shirts tied up together in a bundle. I asked him what he was carrying - he said shirts. I put my hand on them, and found them wet. I asked him where he was going - he said on board a ship lying off the Tower. I said they were wet - he replied, he had not time to dry them. I took him into a shop, and asked how many there were - he said he did not know, a man had given them to him to take to Tower-hill, and he was to meet him there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a woollen-draper, and live in Regent-street, in the parish of St. James. On the 13th of January, about two o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked me to allow him to wait there awhile for a gentleman—I said he might, and immediately went up to my dinner, and told my young man to have a sharp look-out—a gentleman came in afterwards and bought some goods, for which he paid a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—my young man put it into the till, and after I came down we found the prisoner had disappeared, and the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was gone—I have since found a note—I do not know it to be the note myself.</p>

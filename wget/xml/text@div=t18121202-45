After he had been with me about a month I saw him in different situations in the back warehouse, as though he was hiding of something or other, and on Sunday morning particularly, instead of going to church, he was lurking about in that warehouse, among the empty casks and tea-chests, and in other circumstances I was led to believe he was a dishonest man. I found, likewise, a quantity of currants laid by, and from losing cocoa-nuts, and other things in the shop, I was convinced there must be a thief in the house. I kept a large quantity of halfpence in a recess opposite of my till, behind the counter. I missed them at different times, and in order to detect the prisoner I went down one evening and marked some halfpence, and the next morning I watched him narrowly, while in the act. I went down early in the morning, before any of them got up, and saw that the halfpence were all in the same situation that I left them the over night. I watched the prisoner while he was sweeping out the shop behind the counter. He put his hand down, and took up two papers of halfpence from the pile. He put them into his coat pocket, two five-shilling papers, and almost immediately went into the back warehouse. I watched him as narrow as possible, and hesitated in my own mind, whether I should detect him while the halfpence were upon him. As soon as possible I went down, and sent him up to breakfast, during which time I made every search I could for these halfpence, in the warehouse. His coat was off. I examined the coat, to see whether the halfpence were in his coat or no. They were not. After searching an hour and a half I found the halfpence in a tub of saw dust, with about twenty shillings more, about a foot down, under the surface. I sent for a constable, and gave charge of him directly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. You were here last sessions, and prosecuted the same indictment in a different form - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many apprentices have you - A. Two.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you always so clear that you saw the prisoner taking these halfpence - A. I wanted no other evidence than my eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever charge your apprentice with these halfpence - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner by when you found the halfpence - A. Yes. I gave him no hint that I suspected him, for fear he should run away.</p>
               <p>Q. In the last case, I think you dropped, that you received a false character with him - A. I did. I received it from Mr. Roebuck; after that, he said he turned him away for theft. I saw Mr. Roebuck at a wholesale house, Messrs. Warner and Company. Another man, when I went to the house, gave him the character, who, it appears since, was not the master. I believe it was the shopman, whom I understood since to be his brother.</p>

            . Mr. Dunman sent for me. He said, his porter had robbed him. The copper money was found in the sawdust.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he sawdust in the warehouse - A. Yes. I was in the shop two hours. The shopman, and indeed the whole of them, said it is very likely Mr. Dunman put them there himself. When the halfpence were brought here last session, Mr. Dunman charged me and Mr. Holland as two rascals, that we had received a bribe of four pounds to make a flaw in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I said, it looked as though there was a bribe given to the officer, or to persons that had the drawing up the indictment in order to save the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Kinnersley. There is another circumstance I wish to mention. When we came out of the Lord Mayor's justice-room, he said, Mr. Kinnersley, I'll thank you if you will let me look at the halfpence; he said, he wished to count how many good and how many bad ones there were. Oh, said he, I made a mistake, this is not the paper. He went into a shop and bought a stick of sealing wax, to seal them up again.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you first, that he had information that this man stole the halfpence - A. Yes. He took me up stairs, and opened a trap that is made along the ceiling and the floor. There is a long window, to watch the movements of what was done in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020034"></xptr>shop. He opened the trap, and shewed me the manner in which the prisoner took them. I think, says he, he turned round after he took them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. How many examinations were there before there was mentioned any eye-sight robbery - A. Two, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. What mark did he put upon the halfpence - A. I really cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with him when this search was for the halfpence - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The halfpence were found before Kinnersley was sent for.</p>
               <p>Kinnersley. I was there ten minutes before the halfpence were found, before he led me to the cask, and then he took the halfpence out.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. May I explain what this officer has been saying of this money, what was said at the Mansion House. It was a busy time; the Lord Mayor had a great press of business on his hand. We were there three times. The first time, his Lordship's clerk said there was sufficient evidence to convict this man. He asked for Thursday to bring forward his friends; and, with respect to my having any doubt of seeing the man take the halfpence, I will positively declare it is all false. I represented that I saw him take the halfpence.</p>
               <p>COURT. There is another thing, he says you accused the officer and him of having four pounds - A. With respect to bribing the officer, it was nothing more than a joke, what I said.</p>
               <p>COURT. Shew the halfpence that you marked - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What mark did you put - A. A private mark. I found them a long time before the officer came.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you take the officer there first -</p>
               <p>Kinnersley. He took me all round the warehouse, at last he went to the barrel.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are the two marked papers.</p>
               <p>JURY. I understood you that you marked the halfpence - A. No.</p>
               <p>JURY. We heard you say so.</p>

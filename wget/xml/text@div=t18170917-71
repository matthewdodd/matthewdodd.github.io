On the th of August, about two o'clock in the morning I was going home; I was rather intoxicated,but knew what I was about. I was knocked down by two men, I could not see their faces; they took my jacket and waistcoat, handkerchief and stiffner, and hat off, and left me. I was stunned by the fall, and remained on the ground ten minutes. I was taken to the watch-house, and found the prisoner there, he had my waistcoat on. I described it to the watchman before I saw him; I told him there were four cards of address in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR.ADOLPHUS. I did not see their faces - He was wearing my waistcoat.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SUMMERS. I am headborough of St. George's in the East. About a quarter before two o'clock the prisoner was brought into the watch-house. I searched him, and found he had a waistcoat on over his own, and a great coat on over them. I locked him up. The prosecutor was brought in also, who said he was knocked down by two men and robbed of his straw hat, blue jacket and waistcoat, a silk handkercheif, and a stiffener. When I brought the prisoner out, he immediately said the waistcoat which he had on was his; he described it to me before he saw it, and said there was a blue ribbon and several cards of address of different persons in the pocket, mentioning their names. We pulled it off, and found the cards he mentioned and the ribbon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prosecutor was rather in liquor, but knew what he was about. The prisoner was put in a place by himself; he could not have made way with the waistcoat.</p>
               <p>JOHN PETERSON. I am a watchman. I was going my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170024"></xptr>rounds about ten minutes after two o'clock, and saw something lying on the ground; before I went up to it I stopped at the corner of Old Gravel-lane to have some coffee. I got more towards the end of the lane, and saw the prisoner and another man leave the thing and come towards me, but crossed on the other side from me. I let them pass, and found it was Mackay whom they came from. I had seen the prisoner about three times that night before Mackay was stripped; I asked him where his clothes were? In consequence of what he said, I went after the men; I missed them for about five minutes, and was told two men were gone towards St. George's watch-house. I followed, and came up with the prisoner - the other man was on the other side of the way. The prisoner had the stiffener in his hand; I took him to the watch-house; he dropped it at the door - I picked it up. I then went and brought Mackay in; he described the waistcoat very particularly before he saw it; it was taken off the prisoner - He had two waistcoats on, his coat was open</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you first saw Mackay was he stripped - A. I was about twenty steps from him. I saw two men moving about him. I thought he was drunk. As soon as I began to call the hour they left him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the priprisoner on the 22nd of January, in St. Giles'; I had information that she had stolen these things about a week before - I took her to where she had lodged, and the occupier of the house said it was the prosecutor's bonnet; the prisoner said she was going to return it - I asked what she had done with the cloak, and she gave me no answer.</p>
               <p>ANN BRADLEY. This is my bonnet - it was a dark brown cloth cloak, for which I gave a guinea; I never permitted her to take and wear my things - she was a stranger; I paid her lodging - I do not know what her trade is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes you know very well I am an unfortunate girl, and have supported you and your child; have you not lent me that shawl you now have on? Witness. Yes, I did one night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She lent me that shawl about six o'clock in the evening, and said she was distressed for clothes - I brought her in some money; she said, "As it is cold take my cloak and bonnet;" I was taken up that night, and had fourteen days in the House of Correction -I was taken by this officer the day I came out.</p>

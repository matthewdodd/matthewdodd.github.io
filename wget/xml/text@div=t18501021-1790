                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Robarts, Curtis, and Co. We have no person named John Weston keeping an account at our house—this is a very old blank form of check of ours—I should say at least ten years old.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. James Cooper, of the Bankruptcy Court. The prisoner was formerly employed by Mr. Turner, of the Bankruptcy Court, who is now dead—I am acquainted with the prisoner's handwriting, and have been so I should think four years—I have frequently seen him write, almost daily—I believe the writing on this check to be the prisoner's—no part of it is Mr. Cooper's writing—he was not in town on that date; he was at Penzance—I had a letter from him that morning—he had been away for a fortnight previously, and he came back about a fortnight afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long is it since you saw the prisoner write? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think about four months—the formation of these letters are the prisoner's—I have looked at the check before—some portions of it are exactly like his writing—some portions are attempted to be disguised—the I in "James" is different to what he usually writes—the C in "Cooper" has a tail to it; that is not like his; but the "ames," those who have seen him write previously would not have a doubt about—he used to copy for Mr. Turner; he was not his clerk; if Mr. Turner had any copying to do he would give it to the prisoner to do—the prisoner and I have not, to say, quarrelled; we have had a <hi rend="italic">lark,</hi> or something like that—I have never complained of his telling of any misconduct of mine; I am quite sure of that—I know Bolton, a pensioner of Mr. Commissioner Shepherd's—I was never charged with keeping back the pension, and making use of it myself; nothing of the kind—this is the first time I ever heard of anything of the kind; I swear that most positively—I was never charged with keeping back any money given me by Mr. Commissioner Shepherd to pay a pensioner of his—I have been eight years at the Bankruptcy Court, and the prisoner about four—I have known him during that time—I have had no quarrel whatever with him—he very often got drunk, and would come in and be very <hi rend="italic">bouncable,</hi> and I would sometimes order him out—he was in an inferior position to me—he used to create a disturbance, and then I turned him out—I have done that I think twice, not recently; I should think it is twelve months ago—I swear positively I never had any other quarrel with him—I never complained of his stating that I had kept back money which Mr. Commissioner Shepherd ordered me to pay over—Mr. Commissioner Shepherd never gave me a</p>

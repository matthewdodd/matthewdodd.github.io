After tripping me up Wilson took my hat from my head, and in endeavouring to get my hat back they drove my head against the wall - they all three beat my head against the wall - they said nothing; they got my hat, and then ran away; I felt very great pain in my knee, and my head was bruised in the fall. The moment they ran away I observed that my breeches pocket was cut completely out; I had a shilling and 7d. in copper there, and the key of my trunk; my pocket handkerchief was taken from my coat pocket; every think was safe just before; they all made the best of their way off, and I after them; I called out Watch! as loud as I could - none came; but in about two minutes after I got up into my bed-room two watchmen came up, and asked if I was the young man who had been robbed - I stated to them what had happened; one of the watchmen said he knew them, and told me to let it remain till next night - I had seen both the prisoners about the streets in the neighbourhood several times before, but never spoke to them. Wilson was taken on the 13th - I saw him in Pearson's custody - and on the 14th I saw Haggerty in custody at Marlborough-street; I saw them taken - I pointed Wilson out in Church-street, and next day pointed Haggerty out - I knew them well, and swear they are two of the men. I have not found any of my property - it was all taken away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WILSON. Q. Did I get out of your sight? A. Yes, you turned a corner, and I lost you. I had told Pearson of it on the 13th, when I saw him in the street.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 13th of June I saw Williams at the end of Bainbridge-street - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120005"></xptr>said he had been robbed on the Monday; he described Wilson to me, and said he had seen him that night - I told him to go and look for him; he came back to me, and said he had seen him; I went with him to the end of Church-street, where Wilson was sitting on a post - I secured him; Williams had described Haggerty to me, and I took him next day; the prosecutor stood close by - I said, "Is that him?" he said Yes, and I took him; they both said they were not the persons. I found nothing on them relating to the robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WILSON. Q. You said the prosecutor charged me with robbing him of his hat, and I said I heard so twenty minutes before, and had thrown myself in your way on purpose to clear myself? A. You did not say so to me.</p>
               <p>HAGGERTY's Defence. When he took Wilson from the post I was on the opposite side of the way - the prosecutor knew it, and did not point me out; he said it was a stouter lad than me. On the 13th the officer came and took me - I made no resistance; he took me up to Williams' room - fifteen or sixteen people were there; he asked him if I was the lad; he said No I was not, for there were two a great deal stouter than me, and the other was taller; the officer said,"Are you positive of it?" and he said, "Yes, you may let him go, and he did so. On the 14th I was going along the street, and was taken - Williams said then that I was the lad, and at the office he said he had said I was not because he wanted to take us all together.</p>
               <p>RICHARD WILLIAMS re-examined. I saw him in the street some time before, but not at the identical time that Wilson was taken; I saw him the same evening, but several people persuaded me not to take him into custody. I never said it was a stouter lad than him - I said the one who took the hat was a larger man; I never said he was not the man; he was taken twice - a Bow-street officer took him the first time - I said he was not the person who took my hat, but was one of the party; the officer let him go - I had no doubt of him; I only said he was not the person who took my hat, as I wished to get Wilson.</p>
               <p>WILSON's Defence. I knew nothing of the robbery till twenty minutes before I was taken, when a woman came and said the officers were after me for robbing a man named Williams, of Church-street, of his hat - I said I was innocent, and went into Church-street, and sat on a post at the corner of Bainbridge-street; a man came and said I was charged with stealing a hat, and somebody had gone for an officer - he had not been gone a minute before the officer came and said, "Williams charges you with stealing his hat" - I said I thought so.</p>

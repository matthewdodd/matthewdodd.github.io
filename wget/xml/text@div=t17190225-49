            </rs>. It appeared that the Deceased and his Sister had been at the Red Cow in Eastcheap, and as they were going home together about 9 a Clock at Night, the Prisoners overtook them and would have joyn'd Company with them, but she desired they would not; that one of the Prisoners chuck'd the Deceased under the Chin, saying he would cock his Chin, that he pinch'd him on the Sides, and turn'd up his Nose; that the Deceased told them if they continued their Affronts he would make use of his Stick , but did not; that another of the Prisoners wrencht his Stick out of his Hand, beat him against the Wall and then threw him to the Ground, and the Deceased pitching upon his Shoulder against the Kenel put in out of joint; that they went to the Cow and sent for a Surgeon to dress his Arm. There were Evidence deposed that he was very well before, but since that, he bath not been able to lift his Hand to his Head, but been in a weakand languishing Condition, and complained of a Pain in his side, and belived it to be the Occasion of his Death. The Prisoners in their defence said they had been a Fishing, and coming back went to the Gun-Tavern , and as they were going home from thence overtook the Deceased and his Sister, and after some Words the Deceased broke one of the Prisoners field's with a large knotted Crubstick upon which they endeavour'd to get it out of his Hand, and so the Scuffle began. The Surgeon deposed that he found the Deceased's Shoulder was out of joint, and he reduced it; that he had also a flight Bruise of Scratch in his Forehead, and that was all the Injury he perceiv'd; that he came to his shop afterwards and he then said he was very well only he had a pain in his Arm, he advised him to stir it a little, and gave him a strengthening er and did not believe he died of this Fray , but a natural Death. Therewere other Evidences that had seen him abroad since, he told he was pretty well only he had a Pain in his Arm, and that he complained of no Bruise at all. It appear'd by other Evidences that he had owned at the Quarter Sessions that he had broke one of the Prisoners Head's before he was struck; and likewise that one came to them to compound the matter and drop the Process. The Prisoners called several to their Reputation, who gave them a good Character, and particularly as to their quiet and peaceable Behaviour.

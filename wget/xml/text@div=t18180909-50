               <p>JOHN TIMOTHY. I live at Lambeth; I had 170 flounders in a coff in a vessel on the river. I missed the coff about half-past three o'clock in the morning of the 26th of July, the prisoners lived near me I went to look for them, and found them about four o'clock trying to get through<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090024"></xptr>London-bridge-their boat was fastened to the starlings. I found 170 flounders concealed under the bottom boards of the boat, which is not a place where fishermen would put them. I asked them to go to the Thames-police Office with me - They refused; they challenged me to prove the fish to be mine. I charged them with stealing them, they said, "Rather than be accused wrongfully they would pay for them." I said they ought to have known my boat - They said they did not. I believe the fish were mine, because one had been wounded in the water; and so had one of them.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER MITCHEL. The prisoners were given into my charge. They said they got the fish in Greenwich.</p>
               <p>BLAKE'S Defence. Flounders are often speared, which would bruise them.</p>

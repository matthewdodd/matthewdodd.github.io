             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a colour maker; Davis brought me some colours on the 13th of January, in two paper bags, rolled up in a cloth, which I agreed with him for, but I did not pay him, because it was not according to the sample, and I thought they were stolen; Mr. Berger came to my house, and I shewed him the colours, which he claimed. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>(To Berger.) Q. Look at those colours? - A. As God in Heaven is above us, these are my greens.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson.(To Leurson.) Q. These were damaged goods, were they not? - A. I cannot say they are damaged.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were produced before the Magistrate, were they in papers as they are now? -No; they were in a firkin.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to be sorted into this variety<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150032"></xptr>of parcels? - A. That was done Yesterday, by Mr. Berger and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Davis tell you where he got them from? - A. He said first, he came from Croydon; and another time he told me he had them from a gentleman in the King's-Bench.</p>

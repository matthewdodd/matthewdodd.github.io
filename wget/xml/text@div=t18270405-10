On the 12th of March, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was returning home, and saw the prisoner standing close by the door, with his hand on a piece of carpet, which was within the door - he was outside himself - I stopped for a minute, then stepped into the middle of the street to watch him - I saw him take the carpet up on his shoulder, and go off with it - I went over into the shop, and told one of the young men to follow him; I also followed - I did not lose sight of him - I went and took him by the collar, and asked where he was going with the carpet - he said he was taking it for a gentleman - he was secured with it - the young man took the carpet back - here it is - I have measured it; there are thirty-six yards - it cost 3s. 6d. a yard - I took him back to the shop - an officer came and took him - it was within the hinges of the door; we could not shut the door without moving it - there were twelve pieces there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been out of work five weeks - I was looking for work, a gentleman stood at the door, and asked if I wanted a job - and if I would take this carpet with him to the first coach, at the corner of Red Lion-street, he would pay me for my trouble - I took it, and followed him - my hat fell off - I stooped to pick it up, and had not got above four doors when the man took me - I said I was following the gentleman - he said,"Never mind, come back, you will do."</p>

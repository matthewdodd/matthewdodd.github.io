               <p>E. Pever. I was going home to Chelsea. He called for a pint of ready-money beer. I told him I had no money; and if he would fac me home, I would make him satisfaction. He sat on one side the table, and I on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>E. Pever. I never saw him in my life before. He reached over the table and took hold of my hand, and pulled my ring off, and went off. I ran to cry after him; then he pulled off both my cardinals.</p>

D - n your eyes, said he; then she took me by one arm, and Holmes by the other. Then Soddi came up, and they all three of them dragged me down towards the iron gate. Riddal quitted my arm, and came and took my ear-rings out of my ears, and pulled my cap about my neck. Soddi took my necklace and ribbon off. Then they took my apron and stays, and my petticoat, a new one. They dragged my poor body about; they cut my lace and petticoat strings; they took one of my shoes and my two buckles, they were plated ones. They mauled and tore my gown to pieces; they left me one shoe, my stockings, garters, and gown, and my cap about my neck. Riddal gave me a drive, and knocked me down, and they all ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not call out?</p>
               <p>E. Pever. I did, to the centinel. Then the prisoners d - d my eyes, there was no centinel there.</p>

               <p>E. Pever. I take in washing. I had been to see an acquaintance at Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get any of your things again?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250053"></xptr>E. Pever. I saw my bonnet at Mr. Steel's, a pawnbroker at Westminster, the next morning. He is not here. I never got any of my things again. Holmes was taken upon the Parade the Friday following; the women were taken up last Monday fortnight. Riddal said before the Justice, she had an odd buckle and a broken one; and she met two young fellows, and they made her put my buckles in her shoes, and go and buy a lace, and they laced my stays on her; and she put my clothes on, and went and lay at Bloody-Bridge. Holmes said before the Justice, that I followed him to the Tilt-yard cellar. The waiter was put to his oath; he said, I said several times to Holmes, I wanted to go home; and that he offered my new bonnet for the two pints of beer.</p>
               <p>W. Jones. Last Monday was fortnight in the morning, I was carrying a pennyworth of beer from the White Bear, Park-street. The landlord said, there was a soldier taken for robbing a woman who was at Grosvenor Gate. I went there. The prosecutrix was there; she knew me; she was crying for somebody to secure the people that had robbed her. I took her to the Red Lion, Grosvenor Gate; there was Riddal. As soon as she saw her, she said, That is one of the women that robbed me; and cried, and made great lamentation. I told Riddal the consequence of it. She said, D - n it, as I am in the mess, I'll shew you the other, and go along with you. She went with me to the Magazine in Hyde Park, where the other girl was concealed by the soldiers. I went to the gate, and desired admittance. The soldiers were very rude, and refused me admittance at first. When I got admittance, I found her concealed in a hole. As soon as Riddal saw her, she said, That is the girl that was along with her. I brought them both down to Sir

            's; then Riddal said, she would tell all, and clear herself, as we were going along. She wanted to be an evidence before Sir John; but the prosecutrix swore positively to them all three. He would not admit her. The soldier was in custody a week or ten days before, and came up to be examined. Riddal said, it was not this soldier, but two other men. I never heard the soldier confess any thing.</p>
               <p>Holmes's Defence.</p>
               <p>I happened to go into a house in the Ambury, where this woman was. I never saw her with my eyes before. I called for a pint of beer; she snatched it up, and gave it to the other woman. I called for another, and paid for it, and went out of the house; she followed me to the Tilt-yard. I was some yards before her; I never kept her company. I got upon the steps, and was talking to a brother-soldier; she followed me, and had like to fell down the steps. I called for a pint of beer, and she came and sat down on the other side the table; then she went into other company, about ten or a dozen soldiers, all strangers to me; there she danced. I never drank with her at all. She went out up by the steps, and three or four soldiers with her. I never went nigh the Park that night.</p>
               <p>Riddal's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was up in Hyde Park all day long; I am an unfortunate girl of the town. I had had no business all day. We went to a cook's-shop, and had two pennyworth of meat each at night. Coming back, I heard a great cry in the Tilt-yard; there I saw four soldiers round the woman, taking her cloaks from her shoulders; we were afraid to come near them. I went in and got a pint of beer; the woman came in and sat down between seven soldiers. She pulled off her ring, and said to one of the corporals, she would pledge her ring for some money. A person took it up stairs, and brought it down in about a quarter of an hour, and said she should pay a gallon of beer before she had it again. He gave it her; she put it on her finger, and went up the stairs, and came down again, and called for a pint of beer without her bonnet, and her ring was gone. Then I and the girl with me, went out, and up into the Park; I believe it was then near about a quarter after nine. This woman came along, and two men with her; one had a black waistcoat on, and the other a white coat. We were just by the canal-side; one of them drawed a knife upon me, and said, if I did not stand there, he would run it through me to the heart. We did not stir; (that is, me and my partner.) They came by me with a pair of stay, a petticoat, and an apron; I never had them in my hand. They gave each of us a clout on the head, and went away; we both cry'd, and went to the Ambury to bed, at Mother Brown's. I never heard of it till I was going up the Park to see the recruits fire; then the woman came to me and said, I was one of the women that robbed her. I said, Pray call a constable; I'll go with you. Then she began abusing me, calling me all the whores, blasting my eyes and limbs;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250054"></xptr> then we went to the magazine, and took

I had seven guineas done up in a handkerchief, and locked in a box next room to where we lay. I had seen them on the Saturday night. I went out by break of day on the Sunday to go to London. The prisoner came to bed on the Saturday night about eleven. I left him in bed. I returned home about four in the afternoon; he was then gone. I looked in my box, and my money was gone. I found a couple of nails were drawn out very loose in the hasp of the lock, not in the state I left it in. The prisoner never returned till he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body lay in the room your box was in?</p>
               <p>Prosser. There were two gardeners did, but they did not lay at home that night. I took the prisoner up on suspicion, but he denied it. I never got my money again.</p>
               <p>Rich. Woodruff. I lodge in the same house. When we took the prisoner up, he had a good hat, new shoes and stockings, a new silk handkerchief, and other things, and before he had hardly any clothes at all. There were two guineas and a half and three shillings found in his pocket when searched. His landlord had lent him a shirt the while his shirt was washed, but a little before. He borrowed a shilling the first week he worked there, and he had worked but nine weeks and three days, at nine shillings a week.</p>

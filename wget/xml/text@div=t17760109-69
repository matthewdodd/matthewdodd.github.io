I lost four of them; they introduced the thing by cutting of cards.</p>
               <p>How did they get the notes from you? - The 10 l. and 15 l. notes, Jones came up to me and griped my thigh in such a terrible manner, that I thought he would twist it off, and they forced the notes out of my hand: after I had been concerned with them at cards two or three times, I thought they were bad men, and wanted to be clear of them; I said I would not be concerned with them; Jones said I had two bank notes in my pocket, and desired me to pull them out, I did; they said I should be concerned again, and made me put them down on the table; Jones took them out of my hand and put them on the table against my consent, and they forced me to cut the cards; as soon as I had cut the cards, Gratrix took up the notes and cards, and ran away with them, and Jones followed him.</p>
               <p>What money was laid down besides yours? - They laid down their money.</p>
               <p>Were the notes taken from you with your consent or not? - Not the last to the amount of 25 l. were not.</p>
               <p>How came you to take them out of your pocket? - I hardly know what I did.</p>
               <p>How much money did they get from you in all? - 49 l. 4 s.</p>
               <p>Did you part with the last notes by your own consent, or were they taken from you? - After I took them out of my pocket I was all in a flurry, I hardly knew what I did.</p>
               <p>Did they take away the notes with your consent or not? - The last two without my consent.</p>
               <p>I want to know how it was to be determined by the cutting? - If I cut a higher card than a five, then the party concerned with me was to win, if under five, Gratrix was to win.</p>
               <p>Did you draw a higher or a lower card? - A lower.</p>
               <p>Did you cut for the 10 l. and 15 l. notes? - Yes; after they were forced down on the table.</p>
               <p>Tell us how the notes were forced from you? - By Jones forcing them out of my hands and putting them on the table; I had my hand with the notes in it in my pocket, he persuaded me to pull my hand out, and then he took hold of my hand, and forced them out of it, and put them down on the table, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, you shall cut the cards."</p>
               <p>Where were the notes when you cut the cards? - On the table; as soon as I cut the cards Gratrix took up the notes and cards, and ran out, and Jones followed him.</p>
               <p>How did they get them out of your pocket? - He persuaded and hurried me.</p>
               <p>How did he get them out of your hand; did you hold them fast? - I did not hold them so fast as to tear them.</p>

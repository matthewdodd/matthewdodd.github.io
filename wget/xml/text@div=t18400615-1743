                  </hi>I am a stock manufacturer, and live in Mansel-street, Goodman's-fields. On the 11th of March, the prisoner came to my house and brought a card, which I have not got—he took it away with him again—in consequence of what he brought me, and what he stated besides, I let him have the bill in question—he said Mrs. Burnell had sent him for the bill, and I let him have it in consequence of his saying so—he gave me this memorandum—I saw him write it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—" Mem. 11th March, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Recd, of Wm. Hales, a bill of exchange for 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Dated 17th February, 1840, at three months. Drawn by G. B. Collins, and accepted by Wm. Hales, for the purpose of discounting the said bill, or the money, minus the discount, to be returned on or before Saturday, the 13th instant."—Neither the bill nor money have been returned to me since—I did not see him again till he was in custody, on the 1st of June.</p>

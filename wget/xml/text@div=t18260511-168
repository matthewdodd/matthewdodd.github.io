            . I was in Mr. Willis' service. On the 8th of February I fastened all the doors - I fastened the outside door - about ten o'clock the next morning I and my fellow-servant came down together - the doors were all open - one of the windows, by the lobby, door was broken - the top bolt had been unbolted, and the bottom one almost wrenched off - a hand put in at that window could unbolt the door - the latch was broken off the kitchen door, and the bottom bolt almost broken off - the wash-house door had the staple wrenched out - I missed the things which had been hanging on the horse in the kitchen- the doors were open, and the drawers out, and all the things pulled out of them; I had seen them all the night before.</p>

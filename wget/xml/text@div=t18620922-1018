                  </hi>. I am barman at the Duke of Gloucester, Union-row, New Kent-road—about five weeks before 3d September, the prisoner came in the evening for a pint and a half of porter—he gave me a half-crown, and I gave him a shilling, two sixpences, and some halfpence—I then stopped to serve a customer, and the prisoner said, "Give me two more sixpences"—I took his shilling, put it into the till, gave him two more sixpences, and he went out—the witness, Mann, spoke to me, and I went to the till and found a counterfeit shilling at the top, with the other silver—I have not the least doubt that the shilling I gave the prisoner was good—I showed the bad shilling to my master, who marked it and put it away—on 3d September, at twenty minutes to 7 in the morning, the prisoner came again for half a pint of porter and one pennyworth of gin—I recognised him—he gave me a half-crown, which I put in the till—I was going to give him change, when he said, "Give me that back, I have something smaller"—I gave him back the half-crown he had given me, and he threw down a bad shilling—I said, "This is a bad one, I shall keep it"—he said that he had it given to him in</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Duke of Gloucester public-house—the last witness is my barman—I received a shilling from him about five Weeks before 3d September—I marked it and put it by—I have seen the prisoner there twice or three times a day, and about three weeks afterwards one day when I served him with half a pint of beer, he gave me a bad ling—I gave it back to him and let him go—I did not know at that time where he lived—I cannot say whether I had seen him earlier that evening but I had seen him day after day at the same time—on 3d September, my barman gave me a counterfeit shilling immediately I got up, and I instructed a constable to apprehend the prisoner, and gave him both the shillings.</p>

I am a parchment-maker, of 9, Granville-street—I was at the Duke of Gloucester public-house five weeks before 3d September, and saw Adams give the prisoner change, two sixpences, a shilling, and some halfpence—the prisoner picked it up—he had another shilling in his hand, which he put down and asked for two more sixpences for a shilling—I am quite sure he put down a different shilling to what the barman gave him—the barman gave him two sixpences and he left—I told the barman, he looked in the till, and took out a bad shilling.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in Wimpole-street. On Saturday night, 30th June, I was going home from the theatre, between eleven and twelve o'clock—at the corner of Oxford-street and Langham-place a woman accosted me, and walked towards Langham Church with me—I stopped there for a moment, and two men rushed round the corner, and said, "Have you seen a little dog? I would not have lost him for five" something, I believe pounds or guineas—they did not come near me—I retired, and the woman went imme<lb></lb>diately with the men—I missed my watch, it had been suspended to a</p>

I was on duty in the City-road, in plain clothes, on Sunday afternoon, 1st July, with Evans, another officer—I saw the prisoners walking towards the City, talking together—I had not any knowledge of the loss of a watch, but for a reason I had I stopped them—after watching them for some distance I took hold of Hicks, and Evans took Elliott, who commenced struggling violently, and kicking, and doing all be could to get away—while he was so engaged, I distinctly saw him put his hand into his right-hand trowsers pocket and withdraw it—he then raised his arm, made a motion, and I saw something leave his hand—it struck against a wall, and as it fell I saw it was this watch, the glass broke, and I saw the pieces on the ground—I made a motion towards it—a man picked it up, and handed it over to me—I asked Hicks if he knew anything about it, he said, "No."</p>

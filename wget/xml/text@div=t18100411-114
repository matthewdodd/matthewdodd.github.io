            . I am a baker in Dog-row, Bethnal-green. On the 28th of February, a little after three in the afternoon, I perceived a cart standing still in Red Cow-lane, there was a man upon the cart, and another man by the side of him; the cart stood there. In about ten minutes I saw the cart coming past my door, the carman was with his horses proceeding towards Bethnal-green, and the prisoner was going towards Mile-end turnpike, he appeared to have a bulk under his coat; I stopped him; I said, you have flour about you; he threw a bag he had under his coat on the ground; I gave him and the flour in the charge of an officer. We overtook the cart where the flour was taken from, it stood unloading at Mr. Brockson's; the carman was challenged of taking the flour, he went down upon his knees; I gave him in custody of a man, the mob coming round, he run away. This is the bag and the flour.</p>
               <p>MR. BROCKSON. On the 28th of February I re- received ten sacks of flour from Mr. White; I weighed them and found twelve pounds weight deficient; that flour and the bag and all weighed fifteen pounds.</p>

I live at Kilburn, near Mrs. Ellison; I was up two pair of stairs, and from the window, a little after 3 o'clock, I saw a man come up to the hedge; he looked to see if any body saw him, he went back again; seeing nobody, he took the furthermost sheet off the hedge; I went down stairs and asked my fellow servant

             sworn. From information that I received from my fellow servant, I went up stairs and saw the man go from the meadow; I went and pursued him, and at last overtook him, after following for above a mile, with the bundle under his arm tied up in a chock handkerchief. I called to him two or three times; he would nor stop nor answer me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he running? - A. Yes, I followed him across two or three fields, he got over two hedges, I got over after him, he ran two or three fields further, and flung the bundle into a ditch of water; then he ran two or three fields further, I pursued him still, he went to a gateway, and there he sat down on a bank, and I went up to him; he laid down his stick before him; I took it up, and took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not offer to strike you with it? - A. No, he told me to come and take him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the same man that threw the bundle away? - A. I am; I never lost sight of him; two girls came running down the meadow, and asked me where the bundle was; I went with them, and got the bundle out of the ditch.</p>

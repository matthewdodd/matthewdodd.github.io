We were both disorder'd with drinking, but especially my Friend. Mr. Creamer refused us Admittance, and a Chair coming to the Door, my Friend was getting into it, but Mr. Creamer bid the Chairman not let him; upon which the Chairman took my Friend by the Collar, and turn'd him out. This provok'd me so far, that I was going to strike the Chairman, when presently the Prisoner came up and struck me in the Face, and so he and I went to fighting. He fell down and pulled me over him, at which time I felt my Watch drawn from me. The Mob soon gather'd about us, but upon his getting up they clear'd the Way, and made a Ring that we might have room to fight; but upon my saying I had lost my Watch, he ran away.</p>
               <p>- Fletcher, Chairman. I and my Partner were order'd to the Five Bells to fetch Esquire Northmore. The Prisoner pulled the Prosecutor upon him, and then getting up, he took his Hat and Wig and ran away. The Prosecutor said he had lost his Watch; upon which several of us pursued the Prisoner, I over-ran him, but my Partner took him.</p>

            , Chairman. The Prisoner and Prosecutor were both down. I saw the Prisoner grapple in the Kennel. The Prosecutor said his Watch was drawn from him. The Prisoner ran and hid himself under a Gate till the Pursuers past him, but I turning back found him there wiping his Hands.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say I put my Hand 3 times in the Kennel, and pulled out a Gold Watch?</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 20, Pitt Street, Commercial Road, Peckham—on Sunday, 25th August, about 2.15, I was in the Crown and Sceptre public-house in the Commercial Road—the prisoner came in hawk<lb></lb>ing some pencils—I declined to buy any, and told him to go and look for some work the same as we did—he made use of an expression to me about my wife—I attempted to put him out of the house—he struck at me and struck me in the jaw—I returned the blow and hit the door-post; and the blood from my finger splashed on his face—I am sure I did not hit him—then we had a scuffle; he left the house then—a man gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I believe, to go away—about twenty minutes after that I was returning home I got close to my gate; I turned round and saw the prisoner about twenty or thirty yards from me—he came up and said "You b—I have got you by yourself, and I have come well prepared for you"—I asked him what he meant—he struck me with his fist, and there seemed a hard substance in his hand—we had a tussle together in the road; we fell; my wife came out, and I heard her say "My God, he is stabbed!"—we were both lying in the road at that time—I lost my senses, and I don't recollect any more till I was indoors—the blood was streaming down me from a place under my left arm—they washed me and put me to bed, and my wife sent for a doc<lb></lb>tor; I was laid up three weeks—I never knew the prisoner before—I am well enough now to go to light employment, but not to hard work—I was stabbed twice in the leg—I did not know that till they got me in bed.</p>

               <p>a scream outside—I went out and saw my landlady Mrs. Heritage, and Mr. Heritage down in the road, and the prisoner was on the top of them—I went to the right side of the prisoner to help Mrs. Heritage up and I saw a knife in the prisoner's hand—I tried to get it away but could not—with the help of a young man we got Mr. Heritage up and got him indoors—he was bleeding from his left side—I don't know what became of the prisoner, he went away after we got indoors.</p>

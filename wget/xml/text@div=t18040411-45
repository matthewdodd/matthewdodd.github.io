             sworn. - I am a patrol of Portsoken Ward: I know the prisoner, he is a <rs id="t18040411-45-deflabel262" type="occupation">merchant's watchman on the Quays</rs>

               <p>Q. How came you to stop him? - A. By the property being concealed, and he walking in a suspicious manner; I asked him what he had got under his coat, he told me slings for weighing; I asked what he was going to do with them, he told me he was going to get one of the same pattern, he told me Gravel-lane, Ratcliff-highway; I asked him the person's name that made them, he could not tell the person's name; I asked him how he should know the house, he said he should know it if he was by it; then I asked him what house he brought them from, he told me he brought them from no house, a man gave them him on this side of London-bridge; I asked him what the man's name was, he said he did not know his name, he should know the man if he saw him; I asked him to walk with me, and I took the slings from off his neck; I then saw the broad R on the head hook; I asked him if he could find the man any where; no, he said, he did not know where the man lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the King's mark? - A. Yes, I know the broad R.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got them here? - A. Yes; (produces them); the head hook has the broad R, and the others have not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I told him it was scale-rope; the hooks catched hold of three different people passing along the street, it catched hold of one gentleman and made his clothes crack, and he was angry; the witness asked me where I got these things from, I said they were given me by one of the King's warehouse-men, at the corner of Tooley-street: he calls to me, Beal, how far are you going over the bridge, he asked me to carry them; I put them across my shoulder, and coming over the bridge the first person I met the hooks catched hold of; he was to pay me one shilling for taking them; I know him as well as I know any body, I have known him between these three and four years; I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110040"></xptr>could get out, or else I could have found him directly; I would not have stooped in the street if I had seen them lay down to pick them up; I never was in any hobble before, I am as innocent as a child unborn.</p>
               <p>- SANDLAND sworn. - Q. Do you know them; - A. I do know them, they belong to the Commissioners of the Customs; I am scale maker to the Custom-House, we put the King's mark on the strong arm.</p>

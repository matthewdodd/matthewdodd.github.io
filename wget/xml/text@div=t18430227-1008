                  </hi>. I am foreman of the case-wine warehouse, No. 4, London Docks. I was occupying a box on the floor, No. 10, which is the second floor of the warehouse—there is an entrance into the warehouse by a staircase—between that staircase and the box which I occupy there is a pile of spirits, which prevents my seeing any persons passing up the staircase—there is a staircase leading to No. 11, and a person on that staircase could see a person on the staircase leading to No. 9—there is a trap-door through No. 10, from which goods are let down to No. 9, and from that out of a loop-hole—on the 7th of Feb., between three and four o'clock, the prisoner came to me at my warehouse—he handed me orders for five cases of wine—they were such orders as authorised me to deliver them to him—the smallest of those cases contained-three dozen, and the largest six dozen—I had known the prisoner many years—he was in the habit of coming with orders, and he knew the mode of business—the proper way of delivering those cases was down the trap-door, and through, the loop-hole—when he delivered the orders to me, I told him to make haste down, he should have them directly—one of those cases was in No. 10, and four were in the upper floor—in order to get out of No. 10, the prisoner had to go round those cases of brandy which were piled up—Watkins was at that time going up the stairs of No. 11 floor—he called out to me, and in consequence of that, I sent Smith round—the prisoner, in going out, would have to pass the cases of brandy, and the case now in question was one that was in that pilr—Watkind went after the prisoner—Smith went after him, and I followef—ehen I got down I found the prisoner standing by this case of brandy, directly under the tail of his cart—Watkins and Smith had got to him beforr—I heard the prisoner say he believed he had got the wrong case—I said I thought he had—he was then taken into custody</p>

               <p>—the case he took was not at all similar, in shape or size to the cases of wine which he was to take—the smallest of them was thirty-three inches, and the case he took was only eighteen inches—this case of brandy had never been let through the loop-hole.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the Docks. On the 7th of February I was called by Mr. Evans to load for the prisoner—I came down from No. 11 to No. 10—while I was coming down I saw the prisoner standing at the end of the gangway, at the foot of the stairs that lead to No. 11—I passed on to Mr. Evans, and Watkins came along directly after—in consequence of what Watkins said I was sent to where the cart was loading—I found the prisoner standing at the tail of his cart, unfolding a tarpaulin in the bottom of the cart—the case of brandy stood at his feet, under the tail of the cart—I looked at the case; he turned round, and said to me, "I think I have made a mistake; I want No. 8, this is not it"—he took a paper from his pocket—this little case could have been got conveniently into the curt, under the tarpaulin.</p>

I was going up the stairs, from No. 10 to No. 11, on that day—I turned round, and saw a person similar to the prisoner, with a straw hat on—I saw him go our, with a case on his shoulder—I called out—we went round, and saw the prisoner with a case, at the tail of the cart—it was such a case as I had seen the man carry—the prisoner said a man had brought it out of the ground floor, with a paper cap on.</p>

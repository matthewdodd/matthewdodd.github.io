               <p>Prisoner. I went down to Northamptonshire to a brother on the 16th of June; and coming back, I came to the Swan at Hockley , and lay there all night. In the morning I went away, and it rained as hard as it could. There stood 4 or 5 people under a hedge, and a little, well set man in a blue coat said he would sell me his horse. I said I had not so much money as to purchase him, and that I did not want a horse. However I purchased the horse, bridle, and saddle for 43 s. - I bought him at the first house in Dunstaple under the gate-way: I think it is the sign of the Bull.</p>
               <p>Samuel Green. I keep a publick-house at the Cherry Tree in Kentish-Town . The Prisoner lodged with me 4 years, and went away about last March: he used to hedge and ditch, and bore a good character in the town all that time.</p>

               <p>Joyce. I don't know but he might have more than that; for I know his wife pawned her clothes for him, and had above 40 s. upon them. He never was known by us to be a man that kept late hours, or used to spending of money. <rs id="t17440912-24-verdict125" type="verdictDescription">

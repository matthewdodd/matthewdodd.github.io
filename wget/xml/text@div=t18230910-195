            . I am a widow, and live at St. James's poor-house. On the 14th of June, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was at the Duke of Wellington, public-house, Princes-street, and had these things in a bundle; I was enquiring for a lodging; the prisoner came in; I knew her before. She said she would give me a lodging, and took the bundle from me, saying, she would carry it for me; we walked together a little way. I went to leave a basket at a house, and when I came out she was gone - I have found nothing. I met her seven weeks after, and charged her with it, she said she had none of my things, and used bad language - she went into a wine-vaults, at the corner of Crown-street, and by going out at another door, escaped me.</p>

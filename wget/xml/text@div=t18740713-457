I keep the Tredegar Arms, North Bow—on 20th June I served the prisoner with a pint of ale—he tendered a florin—I sounded it on the counter, felt it, and said to my brother-in-law in the prisoner's hearing, "I think this is bad"—I bit it, and told the prisoner it was bad"—he said "Is it? I am very sorry; my wife has just been to a butcher's shop, and must have got it in change. I will go away, if you will let me, and come back and pay for the beer"—I gave it to him; he went out, and I let the beer stand ten minutes, but he did not return—about half an hour afterwards a policeman came in with young Two cock, and gave me infor<lb></lb>mation, and on the next night, Sunday, I went to the station and identified the prisoner—I was shown a florin at Worship Street Police Court—it was not the one which the prisoner had attempted to pass on me.</p>

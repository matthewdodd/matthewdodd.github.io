                  </hi>. I am a glass-blower, and live in Rosemary-lane. On the night of the 5th of Sept. I was at the Nag's Head, on Tower-hill, between asleep and awake—I had been drinking, bat was not the worse for liquor at all—I had my head on the table—I had two half-crowns in my pocket—I felt a person's hand in my pocket—I awoke up, and saw the prisoner not more than two yards from me—she moved to the other side of the room—I had not seen her there before I went to sleep—I saw two half-crowns in the prisoner's hand, I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my money—I spoke to the prisoner about it—she used very abusive language, and would not give it up—she made for the door, and said she would call a constable—we both walked together out of the house, and met a constable at the corner of the Minories—neither of us called him—I have seen the prisoner at the house before—there was another girl or two there.</p>

I search prisoners at the police station—the prfsonerwas brought there—I asked if she had any property of the man's—she said she had none—I was in the act of undressing her—she dropped a half-crown out of her sleeve into her hand and gave it me—I continued undressing her, and saw</p>

I was employed to watch Hughes's van on 16th August—I watched it about a week—about 1 o'clock I saw Hughes in Church Street, Greenwich—I watched him till 2 o'clock, when one of Fleet's vans came up—the van men went and had a drink together—Arthur Hickman was Fleet's van man—they returned to Fleet's van, had a conversation, then the lad Holme handed out two empty crates, and took them to the barber's shop, and Hughes had a basket—in about ten minutes they returned with the crates full of bottles like this one produced, and put them in Fleet's van—Hughes helped the boy put them in—Hughes van was standing round the corner in Clarence Street, about 30 or 40 yards from Fleet's van—they then went into the Spanish Galleon—I tod Robinson followed them in—they were drinking together—I told Hughes I should take him into custody for stealing bottles belonging to Messrs. White—he said "I think it is 14, not 16; I never thought it would come to this"—I took him to the station—I searched the van and found the bottles—I sent for Mr. Robert White; he came in a short time—I took Hickman into custody for receiving—I had previously seen them in the barber's yard with Mr. White's boxes—I found 16 dozen bottles—Mr. White spoke to Hughes, and Hughes asked him to be lenient with him as it was the first time he had had the bottles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I mentioned what Hughes said about "the first time" before—Hickman was discharged by the Magistrate—Holmes and Bray were also charged—they were remanded several times and discharged—Bray is Taylor's man; Holme assists Bray, and Hickman is Fleet's man—we charged the servants of three firms—they were all brown bottles, and belonged to White's boxes—I know White's do not charge for their bottles—I do not know that the men have the privilege of collecting them, only from what I have heard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We have hundreds of bottles like these—we do not charge our customers except they are lost—customers are not allowed to keep the bottles—there is a similarity in ours and Taylor's bottles—the prisoner would not be allowed to take Taylor's—their system is different, we should not know it—we pay no heed to it so long as we get them back—we never lend our boxes to receive other people's return bottles—Weaver and Barratt's are in the patent stopper trade—we very seldom have theirs returned—when we do they are sent back to them—I said "I wish to go on with the case, as we have lost a lot of bottles."</p>

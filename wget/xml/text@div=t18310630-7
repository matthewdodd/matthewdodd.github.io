            , JUN. I am the prosecutor's son. On the night of the 28th of May I left the house, leaving nobody in it - I double locked the door, and was very particular in doing so; I took the key with me - the shutters were bolted fast, and fastened at the bottom besides; I went to a public-house in the neighbourhood, and in about ten minutes I was alarmed - I went directly towards my father's house, and found the door open - no violence had been committed; the shutters and the back door were as I had left them - I went up stairs to the looms; I had left some silk velvet safe in my loom - I found the made-work cut out and gone; I missed fourteen or fifteen yards of silk velvet from my loom, and thirty-eight yards of silk from my father's - we call it three singles; I afterwards saw the property at the station-house - we were working it for Mr. Walters; I afterwards saw the Policeman try a key to the lock - it opened it as easy as the right one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you in your father's service? A. No. I work for my master, and am paid for what I do; there is no partnership between us.</p>
               <p>ESTHER RIMES. I am single, and live in West-street, Bethnal-green. On Saturday night, the 28th of May, I went to the prosecutor's house to pay a visit - it was about half-past nine o'clock when I got to the door; my sister, who was with me, said something, and I observed two persons come out of Barrett's door - the prisoner is one of them; the other man came out first - the prisoner had a basket in his hand, with something black hanging out at the end of it; they both ran out of the house - when the first ran out I had no suspicion, but when the second ran I thought it was the work that he had, and I screamed out Stop thief! the prisoner ran in the opposite direction, more in the middle of the road - he then turned the corner, ran down another street, turned another corner, and in the next street I saw him taken; I had followed him, and never lost sight of him till he was taken - he put the basket down immediately before he was taken, and then walked; a person passing stopped him - the Policeman came up, and he was given into custody; the basket was picked up, and given to me- I took it to the station-house, and gave it in the charge of a person there; I saw that it contained silk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A. Halfpast nine o'clock - I live a good way from Barrett's; I went to tell him I was coming to dine with him on the Sunday - the prisoner ran down three streets; I never saw him before - I was on the step of the door when they both came running out right facing me; I swear to him from seeing him at the door - I did not lose sight of him in turning the corner; I never lost sight of him - I had not knocked at the door.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Hare-street, Bethnal-green. I was in Edward-street about twenty minutes after nine o'clock - I passed the prosecutor's door, and saw two men about six feet from the door; I lost sight of them in a moment - I went about fifty yards up the street, came back again, and when within fifteen yards of the door, I saw two women at the door, and saw two men come out of the house; the second one had a basket - the females called Murder! Stop thief! I saw the man run across into Thomas-street - I was opposite,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300014"></xptr>I went into Busby-street, and met the prisoner full butt with the basket; about twelve feet before he came up to me he stopped and dropped it - I collared him, he asked what for, I pointed to the basket, and said, "Look at what you have dropped;" he said he knew nothing about it, and said,"There he goes," pointing to the other who was running - I took him back about forty yards; he then made a desperate resistance, and got his hand into his pocket- I said, "He has got a picklock-key or something in his pocket, let us search him;" the mob said, "It is more than you dare do," and at that moment he threw something out of his pocket - I afterwards returned to the spot, and saw Moore pick up a key; it was given to a Policeman, who I saw try it to the prosecutor's door, and it opened it.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I have a key, which I got from Moore - I tried it to Barrett's door, which it opened easily; here is the velvet and silk which I saw taken out of the basket.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to my aunt's, and was coming towards home - I was walking up the street when that man laid hold of me; I said, "What are you taking hold of me for?" I was full three parts up the street, walking at my usual pace - he said, "Look what you have dropped;" I said "I have dropped nothing, if any body has dropped any thing it is that man who is running up Hare-street;" well, there were about eight of them all seized me - I said, "I will not go further till a Policeman comes, and then I will go any where you choose," and about an hour afterwards they brought a key forward from Thomas-street, where two men had run up - I was at my aunt's house at a quarter-past nine o'clock on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>JANE WRIGHT. I live in Baker's-row, Whitechapel, and am the prisoner's aunt - it is about five minutes' walk from Bethnal-green. The prisoner was at my house the night he was taken; he came about eight o'clock, and left about a quarter after nine.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

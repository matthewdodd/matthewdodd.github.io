                  </hi> I am in partnership with my father Robert Pain, and my brother—we are farmers at Shepherd's Bush—Tarrant has been in our ser<lb></lb>vice for ten years—I did not suspect him till this occurrence—on Friday, the 3rd of Sept., he started, at half-past eight o'clock, with a cart-load of potatoes for Covent-garden market—I followed hi—he had no authority to sell any by the way, unless he had an order to do so—when he had got about half way on the road, the cart stopped at the Swan at Bayswater—I got be<lb></lb>hind a delivery cart there, and saw Tarrant remove a basket of potatoes from the cart, and take them towards the prisoner Bitmead, who ostler there—I laid hold of Bitmead's collar, held him till the policeman came up, and said, "You are very wrong to take these potatoes"—he said, "Well, I bought them fair enough, I gave your man the order three or four days ago, and was to give 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them"—that was about the fair market price—I gave them both into custody—this is our basket—it is market with our name—some of the potatoes are here—they are the same kind that we lost—I have not the least doubt of their being ours.</p>

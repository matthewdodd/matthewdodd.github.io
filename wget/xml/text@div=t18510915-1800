I saw the boy Caffrey here as hour ago, outside the door—I was obliged to leave him, as I had another case in the Third Court, and when I came back I could not find him—On Satur<lb></lb>day, 4th Sept., between 9 and 10 o'clock at night, I heard screams of "Murder!" as I was standing at the corner of Marchmont-street—several persons came up and said I was wanted—Crescent-mews is near there, runs behind Burton-crescent—I went to 25, Crescent-mews—there was a crowd round the door, which was open—I went in, got a light, and went to a</p>

               <p>front-room door at the top of the house—the door was shut—I asked for admittance—it was refused: I cannot tell by whom—I burst the door open, and saw the prisoner, with a red-hot poker in his right hand, holding it by a cloth, which was round the handle—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—his son, John Caffrey, was there, stark naked—I said, "What is the matter?"—the prisoner ordered me out of the room—I said I should not go out—he said I had no business there—I asked the boy, in the prisoner's presence, what had been the matter—he said, "He has been beating me with a red-hot poker"—I saw several marks on the boy's back, breast, and thighs, as of a warm iron—the prisoner's wife was not there at that time—the prisoner insisted on my going out of the room—I would not, but laid hold of him, and said he was my prisoner—He said, "I will see yon b—d before I will go with yon," and made a blow, which broke the rim of my hat—I was even<lb></lb>tually driven out of the room—I obtained the assistance of Harris and several other constables—I got into the room again, and the prisoner and his wife threw me over the stairs—he was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the infirmary of St. Pancras's work<lb></lb>bouse. The boy was brought to me last Saturday week by the police—I examined him—the whole of his back was severely bruised—there was a burn on the top of the back, ten inches long, and at the bottom of the back a burn two inches long; one on the upper portion of the chest, three inches long; one on the right arm, three inches long; another on the left arm, three inches long; one on the light thigh, two inches long; another on the left thigh, two inches long; and one on the left leg, three inches long—the skin was destroyed at the two burns at the back, and the burn on the chest—such an instrument as this poker might have caused the burns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. There was a pot of hot tea in the fireplace; he says that instru<lb></lb>ment could inflict ten inches of wound. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. It would produce a wound much longer than that if it was run along when it was hot—there was no burning on the boy which I attribute to a scald, nor any blisters.</p>

               <p>for Mr. Parker, and robbed him; I gave him half-a-crown to fetch me some victuals on the 1st of this month, and he ran away, and left me destitute; I caught him, and brought him home, and left him with his mother, and told her to take his clothes off, and hide them away where he could not get them, that he might not make away; so she did; she went out every day to work, the same as myself, and paid a woman to mind the children; when I came home to breakfast he was in bed; I never spoke a word to him; between that and dinner-time he got out of bed, and managed to find some very old trowsers, and made the little girl, six years of age, collect all the old clothes belonging to the children, and make away with them, for 21/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a yard of ticking, and before I came home to dinner he was off; we could not find him anywhere till 8 or 9 o'clock; when I got home again, there he was sitting in the room, naked; I told my wife I would give him a good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi>; she went out, and returned as I was beating him with a strap; he ran at me several timer; I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him from me, and he went against the fireplace; I was guilty of no brutality to the boy; I am the father of twelve children, and would not do such a thing; I have not beaten him for this twelvemonth, thinking he would become a good boy; since he has been in prison, he has said to the other boys that he would not mind what he said to condemn his father; he was taken for stealing a pair of shoes last Whitsuntide two years, and another time they ordered me to take him home, and see what I could do with him; there was another witness, named Woolahan, to prove that he was on the stain from eight to nine minutes, and he never heard a blow from my room.</p>

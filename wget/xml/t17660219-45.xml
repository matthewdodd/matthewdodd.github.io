He that was behind me got upon the shafts of the waggon, and demanded the passengers money. I went back again to the town I came from, that is Stanes, and told one of the serjeants how I had been served; he asked what sort of a person it was that robbed me; I described him as having a large rough voice, a middle sized man; he said he could not pitch upon any body but the prisoner. His outward cloaths were not buttoned, I could see he had red cloaths underneath, made me mistrust he was a soldier, the prisoner denied the fact before Justice Fielding, and I cannot swear to him.</p>

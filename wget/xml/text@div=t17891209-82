               <p>I am assistant patrol: last Thursday night, the 10th instant, about half past one, just as the watchman was crying half past one, I heard a noise of some shutters: and instantly, I heard a crash of glass breaking; we ran a little forward, almost opposite, and he was running away; I could see him perfectly by the lamp; I ran across the way, and we both seized him: we asked him, what have you been doing? he said, nothing: we said, you have been breaking the window? he said he had not; he said he lived in the neighbourhood, and his father was a person of property, and worth 30,000 l.; then he took a decanter out of his pocket, and dashed it against the pavement, all to pieces: and another dropped from him; he tried to stamp his foot on it, but it did not break: we went and knocked at the prosecutor's door, and took the prisoner to the watch-house: going along, he begged us to let him go; he said he belonged to the India-house, and had three shillings and six-pence in his pocket, which he would give us to let him go.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; I saw him in custody: and I saw a bottle in his hand: he dashed it on the stones, and I picked up some of the pieces; I was not present when the other decanter was dropped; I saw it in the patrol's hand; I have the pieces in my pocket now.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I have no Counsel to plead for me; I wish to ask this witness a question or two, if you please; have you any other decanters like this? - I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Did you ever sell any more decanters besides those? - What do I get them in for but to sell them?</p>
               <p>Answer the question, sir? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Can you, on your oath say, that that is not the decanter you had sold? - I had not sold that decanter.</p>

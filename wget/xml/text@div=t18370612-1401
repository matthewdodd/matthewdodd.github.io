                  </hi>. I am a wharfinger, and have partners. We had some ¦beef in casks, in Carpenter and Smith's wharf—the prisoner was one of Hour regular men, but he had nothing to do in that particular warehouse that day—we are responsible for the beef—in consequence of suspi-Hcion, I set Taylor to watch—some beef was afterwards shown to me, which I have no doubt was ours—the prisoner had been about twelve ¦months in our service, and had 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and two pints of beer every day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Dare's employ; he desired me to watch the casks. On the 19th of May, a few minutes after eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner come in, after the men had left work, and go to the beef, take it off the casks, and cut it into several pieces—he put one piece into a handkerchief in his hat, and concealed the others be<lb></lb>tween the tierces—the piece he cut up weighed from six to eight pounds—he wiped the knife, put it away where he found it, and walked out—I was going after him—he closed the door, but hearing me moving he came back—I charged him with it, he said he had not got it—I took his bat off, took it out, then he took and threw it away, and wanted me to say nothing about it.</p>

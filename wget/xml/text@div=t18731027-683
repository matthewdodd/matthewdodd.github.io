I am a carman, of 30, Hall Villa Road, Canning Town—on Friday night, about 11. 15, I was walking towards the Dock House public-house, and saw seven or eight foreigners, dark men—when I passed them they were quarrelling among themselves—I went on aud saw some of my mates—I was talking to them and Reneval came back and said "I am stabbed in the leg"—blood was pouring down his leg—Moralles was seven or eight yards off, and could hear what he said—Reneval spoke English—I noticed that Moralles had a knife in his hand—this is it (produced) I saw it taken out of his hand—I daresay he stopped a minute,</p>

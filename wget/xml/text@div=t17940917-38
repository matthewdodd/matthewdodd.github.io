               <p>I know the prisoner, John Smith; I am apprentice to Francis Hunt; the shop has a sore door and a back door; the shop is in Long-lane, West Smithfield; I was coming in at the fore door, and I see the prisoner go out at the back door, with two faws under his coat, on Friday the 6th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your master? - A <rs id="t17940917-38-viclabel194" type="occupation">carpenter</rs>

               <p>Prisoner. I wish to know whether he saw my face or no? I am certain I never was in the place at all? - I am sure and confident of the person; he was taken directly within three minutes; I never was ten yards from him all the way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were two men running in green coats? - I saw none but the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I was coming along, I heard the cry of stop thief! and I stopped this man on suspicion that he was the thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing? - No, he did not speak a word to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was following the man in the green coat, and I asked him why he stopped me rather than the man in the green coat.</p>
               <p>Court to Powell. Whose saws were they? - The property of my master.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going down Cloth Fair, and I came to the back of this house, I saw a man running on before me, and then I ran as well as that man, turning the corner; I saw two saws lay before me, with that I ran strait on, not knowing which way the man went, and this other man says, stop thief! with that he stopped me, and I came along back with them; I asked them, says I, what do you stop me for?</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a character, and said, he was a cabinet maker, and had a wife and three children.</p>
               <p>Jury to Ruggles. Did you see any other man running in a green coat? - Not a soul coming along that way.</p>

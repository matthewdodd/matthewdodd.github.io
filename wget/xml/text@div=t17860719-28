            ; I was pulled round, and I thought I saw two other persons towards Mr. Ellis, one had hold of him, and the other was between him and I; when he seized me by the collar I thought it was somebody I had known that had done it out of a joke, till I saw a pistol at my face, with his right hand; he demanded my money or my life; I was determined I would not give him my money, I hesitated, I was watching an opportunity to strike him; I could not strike him with any effect; I was looking at his heels, to find an opportunity of tripping him up, and he snapped a pistol in my face, it missed fire, and did not flash; it was as near as my fingers; I immediately made a snatch at it; in missing the pistol, in the scuffle, I think he snapped it a second time against my body; but, however, he struck me violently over the head with it; with that I seized him by the collar, and we both fell to the ground, another came up to his assistance, one took my money and my watch, while the prisoner Gall kept beating me about the head with the pistol; they took a guinea and eighteen pence in silver, and my watch; I heard the prisoner Gall ask the other what he had got, he said a guinea and his watch; directly afterwards there came another person running, and they called out, come along, come along; they immediately got up from me, and I got up without my hat, with that the prisoner Gall took my hat, and left his own, he run away; I am sure the person that took my hat and left his own was Gall; he flung his own hat away, mine dropped off my head in the scuffle, then they all ran away; I saw nothing else left besides the hat. (The hat produced that Gall left.)</p>
               <p>What sort of pistol was it that you was beat with? - It might be about this length, I have seen it since; I believe it is the prisoner Chambers who had but one eye that came to the assistance of the other two; I cannot swear to him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Gall. Can you swear to either of these two men? - No, I cannot, I swear to you.</p>
               <p>What was there remarkable about me? - There was his face, his body, his dress, his size, I described every thing particular to the runners, his legs were remarkable, very thick legs, and swelled ancles, I so described him to the runners.</p>

               <p>Mr. Ellis. The button I lost from this coat I have on, which corresponds exactly, we had a struggle, one snatched at the watch-chain, in the struggle we broke this chain, this is my chain, and the two silver seals, they are two old fashioned coats of arms, they were found close together.</p>

               <p>What are you? - A Jew.</p>
               <p>What else? - I deal in old clothes, I know all the prisoners, I remember selling Gall a pair of pistols about thirteen weeks ago.</p>
               <p>How long was it before the 30th of May? - I cannot tell, I bought them on the 19th, I gave four shillings for them, Chambers gave me six shillings; on the 30th of May I bought two watches of the three prisoners, they were altogether.</p>
               <p>Who bargained with you and took the money? - The tall man.</p>
               <p>Did either of the others say any thing about it? - Yes, Chambers said, if I would give him two shillings he would advise Gall to let me have them; I bought a hat of them in about ten minutes after, I sold the hat in Monmouth-street to a shopkeeper, they were all present when the hat was sold.</p>
               <p>Jealous. I delivered them this morning to the prosecutor, we kept them in case they should be wanted. (The watches produced by Davis, and deposed to.)</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190048"></xptr>Holmes. I have had mine between two and three years, I know it by the maker's name, and a silver cock.</p>
               <p>What is the maker's name? - Stevens, Bristol; I have no doubt but this is my watch, I lost it at the same time.</p>
               <p>Court to Ellis. Is that your watch? - Yes, I believe it is, I do not recollect the maker's name, but a watchmaker who has cleaned it for me is here, I did not make any particular remark at the time I wore it.</p>
               <p>Court. Who took the money for these watches? - I laid down the money, and they all took some.</p>
               <p>Did either of them take a part of the money? - Yes, I saw them with some silver in their hand which I had paid them.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. What silver did you give? - I gave half a guinea for the one and nineteen shillings and sixpence for the other in silver, Chambers was in the room, he shared the money, I think they all three took the money in their pockets when it was shared.</p>
               <p>How much money had Chambers? - A very small part; they each of them had some silver, and Gall had the half guinea, I am very sure that Gall took up the money, and gave it into Turwood's hand, and Turwood took the rest of the silver in his hand, I do not know what he did with it; after I had bought the hat of him I went away, Chambers had a sixpence in silver, and sent for some gin with it.</p>
               <p>Who produced the watches? - Gall produced one, and Turwood the other.</p>
               <p>To Jealous. What money had Chambers in his mouth? - Half a guinea.</p>
               <p>To Davis. What time of the day was this? - About half past ten, on the 30th, I went there about half after eight, and staid with them till about nine; when I sold the pistols Gall was there, and Chambers was there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Gall. These two men knows nothing of the robery, it was two other men that was along with me, I know nothing of these men, only seeing them once at a public house, and that was all.</p>
               <p>Court to the witness Davis. You have appeared here in a very bad light indeed, you sold Gall a brace of pistols, and you afterwards bought two watches, it is impossible but you must know how they were obtained, therefore let me admonish you.</p>

               <p>I live in Monmouth-street, I deal in hats, I remember buying this hat by a hole in the crown, I gave three shillings and sixpence for it, the prisoners were all together, but I gave the money to Gall.</p>
               <p>To Davis. Did you sell the same hat to Kayton that you purchased of the prisoner? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my hat that Gall left.</p>
               <p>Court to Davis. Who was present when Gall bought the pistols? - Chambers.</p>
               <p>Who paid for them? - Chambers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Davis. It was you that gave the information against these people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Turwood. What do you know of me, Mr. Israel?</p>
               <p>Prisoner Gall. Did not I pay you the money for the pistols, Mr. Israel, did not I give you five shillings, and you said you would trust me one? - It was Chambers that gave me six shillings for them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Gall. I paid him five shillings, and I owe him a shilling now.</p>
               <p>Davis. That is not true, it was Chambers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Gall. I have nothing to say in my defence, but these two men are not guilty of the robery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Conduit-street, Padding<lb></lb>ton—Pantrey is my son. On the 8th of Nov. I left him in care of my shop for about five minutes—I missed four bottles, two quarts of wine, a quire of paper, and a memorandum-book—these are the articles now produced—I saw Grigg in company with my son on the 13th of November—I went to Grigg's place, at No. 27, Wharf-road, and there I found these articles—there are labels on these bottles, but I have seen labels to others, and will not swear to them—I think these pens are mine, but as to the other things, I should be very loath to swear to them—I bought this wine of Mr. Walker, in Farringdon-street.</p>

On the 9th of November, I suspected him, and observed him do the same before he went to dinner - I got the keys of my wine-cellar and went down, he made a violent rush from the cellar to the privy; I asked his reason for doing so, he said he had a bowel complaint. He went to dinner, I again went down with a candle and found in an iron safe, not in use, four pair of stockings. I sent for Mr. Maynard. When he returned I demanded his reason for rushing from the cellar to the privy, and said he would save himself much trouble by telling; he said he had done nothing to my injury, and was ready to answer it. I took him to the cellar with his father and shewed him the stockings, and asked if he put them there, and said "I presume they are the remains of a dozen," he said "Yes; a man in the street induced him to do it," and he had sold or given them to him.</p>

I am the father of the last witness, and am a jeweller Of Bunhill-row—I made this ring—it is made of yellow gold and the shield is rather redder—I made it myself and gave it to my son to put the hair in—I know my own work—Mr. Dowsett of Wilderness-row engraved it—I sent my boy to him with it—I understood that the initials were to be C.B.—I gave directions for C.B. to be engraved, and I find C.B. on it—I gave it to Mr. Newman on 13th September, with three others—I did not receive a letter containing that and two other rings—I never saw it again till it was brought to me by the post-office authorities.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter carrier of the northern district office, Lower-road, Islington—on 12th January, the prisoner was employed there—he came to that district in November—he occupied the same lodging as I did in January, but had not done so from the time he came—he did for seven or eight weeks—we occupied the same room—I have seen him wearing a hair-ring—I did not take enough notice of it to swear positively to it—he did not wear it every day—the first time I saw it was</p>

               <p>on Sunday, about a month after he first came to lodge with me—it might be a week more or a week lees—it had initials on the back, but I do not know what they were.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did he come to lodge with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was ten weeks ago last Sunday—it was about 1st December that I first noticed the ring—I have seen him wear the other rings—sometimes he put on two on Sundays, and when he went out one evening, I remember his wearing one—he wore them in full dress. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LLOYD</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that there was no case against the prisoner as he was not seen wearing the ring till three months after it was stolen. Mr. Justice Patteson having decided in the case of Regina v. Partridge, that in the case of articles which passed from hand to hand readily, two months would be too long a period to be considered at a recent possession; and that there was only a bare possibility that the prisoner might have taken the ring.</hi>

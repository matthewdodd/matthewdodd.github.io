               <p>Q. Was the street door fastended? - A. It is seldom fastened, on account of there being nine families in the house, and nobody knows who is out; when I got to the street door, I saw a man running on the opposite side of the way, I was in my shirt. but I immediately called, stop thief, and followed him near a quarter of a mile; when I took him, the first words he said, was, he had been in a great deal of distress; I knew him before, he is a weaver by trade, and had been once or twice up stairs into my room; I saw he had my blue coat and waistcoat on over his own; I asked him if he had my watch, he said, he had, and would give me every thing if I would let him go; I called assistance, and going along, he shewed me where he had thrown my boots; he was then taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. There are eight or nine familes in the house? - A.Nine; I live in the first floor back-room.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the prisoner some time? - A Yes; I suppose, I have known him nine or ten years by living in the same street, but have not spoke to him for four or five weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. You have played him a variety of tricks, I believe? - A. Yes, and he has played me some.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you frequently been out all night together? - A. Yes, once.</p>
               <p>Q. But you have had a quarrel? - A. No, no particular quarrel. (The things produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>JOHN QUIN sworn. - I searched the prisoner, and found the two handkerchiefs, and a pair of leather gloves on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The prosecutor has been my acquaintance for a year or two, and has played me several tricks, by which he always had the laugh against me; I, knowing his room, took his things to retaliate upon him, with an intention of telling him of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Jury. (To Ryder.) Q. Did you ever take his things from him? - A. He slept with me one Saturday night, and laid his breeches on the bed, with three shillings in the pocket, two shillings fell on the bed, and one on the floor; I picked up one and let him look a long time for it; then I told him I had one, and that if it would make no difference to him, I would return it to him the next Sunday, which I did, and he took a silk handkerchief away from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on intimate terms with him? - A. I was, till I heard the badness of his character, and that he would not work.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only time you had any thing of his? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called nine witnesses, was gave him a good character. <rs id="t18021201-80-verdict439" type="verdictDescription">

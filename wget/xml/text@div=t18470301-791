                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Cole. On the 17th Feb. I was sent by my mistress with some mutton and money—I did not count it, but I know I had some half-crowns, some shillings, and some halfpence—I was to take it to Dr. Brown's—I went and saw Dr. Brown, and found there was no mutton ordered—Dr. Brown told me something, and I went away—I saw the prisoner just out of the gate at the private door—he said, "You have brought the mutton to the wrong place"—I said, "I believe not"—he said, "It is Dr. Brown's, give me the mutton; have you brought the change"—I said, "Yes"—I gave him the change first, and then he took out of his waist<lb></lb>coat pocket a paper with two half sovereigns, as I thought, and gave them to me—just as he was going to take the mutton out of the tray, Dr. Brown caught hold of him—he said, "Let me look at that"—I showed him the half-sovereigns—he took the prisoner into his surgery, and went out to ascertain whether the gold was good—the prisoner ran away, and I ran after him—when he came to Marks-terrace, he stopped—I walked alongside of him, and he asked if I would have some beer—I had some, and then he asked if I would have some tobacco—I said no—he walked on to Walham-green, and then we had some more beer—he then said, "I am going a little way" and pretended to be looking for some house—he ran off, and I ran after him—he turned up into the Queen's-road, and asked a man for Sloane-square—the man told him to keep straight on—he turned down the Park-road—I then met an officer who took him.</p>

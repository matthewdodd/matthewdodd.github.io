                  </hi>. I live at Horsham—on 11th July, about half-past 6, I was in Covent-garden market selling fruit—the prisoner bought a sieve of currants of me for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and left a shilling on the basket, which he was to return—he gave me a half-crown, two shillings, and a sixpence, and went away—one of the porters came and spoke to me and I looked at the half-crown and found it was bad—the other money was good—the prisoner was afterwards taken into custody and brought back to my place, and I identified him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter in the market—I saw the prisoner in front of Mrs. Cotterell's stand, and saw him give her half-a-crown, two shillings, and a sixpence, and leave with the currants—I immediately spoke to Mrs. Cotterell, and took the half-crown up and found it was bad; I kept it, and went after the prisoner who was about 200 yards off—I said, "You must come back"—he said, "What for?"—I said, "Mrs. Cotterell wants you"—he said, "I don't want to go back, you take the currants back"—I said, "No"—he said, "Here is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for you and let me go"—I said, "No, I am not to be bought like that," and he then came back to the stand with the currants—he wanted to get out of the stand and I would not let him go—he laid hold of me and I took hold of him—he kicked me about till the beadle came and took him into custody—when he came back to Mrs. Cotterell's stand I told him the half crown was bad, and he wanted to give her a good one for it, and said he was not aware of it, and that he had just bought a bushel of peas and got it in change from a man named Bagley for a sovereign—he was given into custody—I marked the half-crown at the station and gave it to the inspector—this is it.</p>

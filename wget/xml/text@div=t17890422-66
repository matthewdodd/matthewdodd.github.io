               <p>I keep a shop, and sell old shoes, and other old things; the prisoners brought me those things to sell as old iron, they were both together; one of them said, his father was a stone-sawyer, and had been two years making these old wasters; I bought them as old iron; I live in Ogle-court, Marybone, at No. 7.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to buy those things as old iron? - I thought they were good for nothing else, they were knocked up together.</p>
               <p>Court to Green. Was these things fit to be sold as old iron? - Some were, and some were not; some are new, and some are old.</p>
               <p>Court. Could not anybody that understands old iron know that these were not fit to be sold as such.</p>
               <p>Cartwright. I did not understand it, my Lord.</p>

               <p>(Some of the saw-blades deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Cartwright. What did you give for those things? - A halfpenny a pound, that is as much as I can give for iron that is not thick; those people that buy iron of me give me no more than a halfpenny a pound.</p>

               <p>I am an officer; I went to take the prisoners in custody, and Jeffkins told us where they had sold them; we went to Cartwright's, and in a shed, at the back of his house, we found these saw-blades, and the hammer was found in the shop.</p>
               <p>Court to Cartwright. Let me give you this caution, that if you had been on your trial for receiving these things, most likely the Jury would have convicted you, and you would have been transported for 14 years.</p>

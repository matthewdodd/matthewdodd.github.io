On the 31st of March, about nine o'clock, or a quarter past, in the evening, I was passing through Wigmore-street—I felt some one touch my side, and a drag at my dress—I saw the prisoner at my side—I put my hand to my pocket, where I had my purse and some keys—the prisoner had one end of the purse in his hand—I caught hold of the other end of it—he pulled it through my fingers, and got it, then turned and ran away down a mews close by—I pursued him, and saw him taken, without losing sight of him—I had some silver at one end of my purse, and four sovereigns at the other—I heard some money fall on the stones as he turned round again to meet me.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor; I was standing behind the counter in the shop, and my maid at the side of me. I heard something breaking the window, and the handkerchiefs grate against the glass as they were drawing out. I called out and my husband ran and brought the prisoner back; after which, upon searching, we missed nine silk handkerchiefs all of one piece; I believe the handkerchiefs were drawing out for the space of three minutes after I called out, had I not been in a fright I might have catched the person that drew them by the hand.</p>

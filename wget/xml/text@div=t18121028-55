On my return, I found there had been some foreigners in the shop, two men and a woman, and that they had behaved in a comical kind of a way, by attempting to put the light out; that they had purchased a hat, and ordered another to be got ready again they came back. I had not been many minutes in the house, when they did return, and asked for the hat they had ordered to be got ready for them.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181210280058"></xptr> It was shewn them, and they made a murmuring that the lining was not put in well enough. Lopez put himself in a passion about it. I then told them to recollect that they had a man to deal with, and not two women to frighten, as they had done before; and then I missed Antonio out of the shop. I asked where he was; they said he had gone home. They paid me for the goods, and then went away, they had not been gone many minutes, when I missed a hat from out of a case that I had just opened. I went after them. I came up to the, men and the woman within an hundred yards of the house, and as an excuse to endeavour to see if they had got any more goods than they had purchased, I said if they did not like the hat, I would change it for them on the next day. I found they had no more than the two boxes which they had purchased, and just as I was going to leave them, Antonia came up, and said in broken English, I have got a hat; he came behind the woman to tell her. She put her hand back for him to get out of the way. I ran to him and secured him, and took the hat that he had stolen, from him, which hat I knew to be my property. I gave him in custody, and went after the other two, and took them to the watch house. This is the hat, it is worth 10 s. 6 d. It cost me eight shillings. I will swear it is mine, by the private mark.</p>

                  </hi>. I Am shopman to Robert Watt, a pawnbroker, in Exmouth-street, Clerkenwell. On the 27th of May, about five o'clock, I saw the prisoner near the stall at our door—she took a pair of women's boots, concealed them under her apron, and went away—I went after her, and caught her two doors off—she let them fall—I took them up, I gave her into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I went to buy the boots—I asked the young man at the door the price—he said 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and if they fitted me I should have them for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I stepped round to a step to put them on—a girl came out of the door in a hurry, knocked against me, and knocked my bonnet off—blew a little way, I went after it, and this young man came out of the shop, and said, "Mistress, you are going away with these, I must take you to the station-house," and he gave me in charge. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not see anybody speak to her—we have a person in charge outside—he came in for change, and then I saw her take the boots—she did not say she intended to buy them—I am certain she had no conversation with our shopman—her bonnet was not blown off, nor did she try the boots on—she had got fifteen or twenty yards when I spoke to her, and had them under her apron—I saw her take them, and walk away without examining them.</p>

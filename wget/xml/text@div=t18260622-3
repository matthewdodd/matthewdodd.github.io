On the 15th of May, about two o'clock in the morning, before day-light, I got up, came down stairs, and found the back kitchen window broken open; the bolts were wrenched off, so that any one could get in. I proceeded to the shop, which is part of the dwelling-house, and found the things in great confusion; I missed the articles enumerated in the indictment - they are worth above 30l. I found some implements of house-breaking in the kitchen and garden; my son was the last person up the night before. All was safe at ten o'clock, when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you no servants? A. No. I have two daughters; they went to bed before me.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I secured the house at ten o'clock at night - it was dark then. A little after two o'clock in the morning I heard a noise of some persons walking in the lower part of the house - it was not light. I gave an alarm, and then heard persons escaping; there is a light fence on the top of the garden wall, and the rails broke as they got over them; I looked out of window, but it was not light enough to see them - from the noise they made I am sure there was more than one person. I called out of window Stop thief. The two bolts which secured the kitchen window were forced back, and the window open. The property stated was all taken away - it was safe the night before.</p>

            . I am a watchman - my beat is at the back of the prosecutor's premises. I heard Read cry Stop thief! and in two minutes I saw two men running down Philpot-street, as hard as they could - that street leads from behind the premises to the back of the London Infirmary - I pursued, springing my rattle; I could not catch the first man, but took the second, which was the prisoner; I took him half way up Storey-street - he had this cloth round his body, and a new great coat on. Wilson took charge of it at the watch-house.</p>

               <p>MR. READ. I had cut a pair of trousers off this cloth, and the remains are left on it - it also corresponds in list and colour. I made this coat for a Custom House officer, to a particular order, with shifting buttons.</p>

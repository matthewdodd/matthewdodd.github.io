                  </hi>. I live with my father, a tailor, in Old Brentford—the prisoner is a neighbour of ours. On Monday morning, the 25th of April, at five o'clock, he came to our house and asked me for a light—I told him to take one, which he did, and then went out—I went out and shut the door after me quite safe—it is a false latch, and when shut would seem as if it was locked—there are two latches to it—anybody knowing the way of the door, by putting in a bit of stick, could open it—when I went out I left the prisoner walking up and down the road—my father was in the house in bed up stairs, in the back room, and nobody else in the house; before I went out I had occasion to go to the drawer in the front-room, and touched the trowsers—I saw them in the drawer—I am certain these now produced are them—I know them quite well by seeing them so often, and they are not finished at the bottom—my father made them for my brother, but did not finish them, as he did not know the length—on the Tuesday when my brother returned home he missed his trowsers—I was not present.</p>

            . I am a servant to these gentlemen, on the 28th of February I received instructions to watch the prisoner, I marked certain brushes and placed them in the back warehouse under some baskets, I then returned into the front shop where the prisoner was, and requested him to take some corn fans into the back shop, and remove the baskets and put them into a proper place, which he did, and by so doing I was certain that the prisoner would see the brushes that I had placed there, he was gone long enough to accomplish what I told him, and came down into the front shop again, I immediately went into the warehouse and found all the brushes missing, I communicated it to Messrs. Francis and Barker. The prisoner was then sent out with a load, and as soon as he returned I went into the same room again and placed four other brushes that I had marked, I came down and took the prisoner with me up into the same room where I told him I wanted to look out certain articles, and that I would take part of the articles into the shop myself, and requested him to bring the remainder, he did, I went and missed three out of the four brushes of the second parcel, and those three brushes I saw on the 1st of March in possession of the officer. The prisoner I believe is a soldier in the guards.</p>

            . I keep a stand with hardware in Bishopsgate Street. About the begining of February, the prisoner asked me to buy four dozen and a half of shaving brushes, I offered him three shillings and sixpence for them, he agreed to take it and I bought them. About a week or ten days afterwards he asked me if I would buy any clothes brushes, I answered no, they were too cumbersome for me, I had some suspicion that he did not come honestly by the first brushes, and as soon I saw the officer I communicated my suspicion to him, he bid me to buy them and he would speak to the master about it. On the 28th of February the prisoner brought me two brushes, and on the 1st of March two more, and in the afternoon of the same day he brought five, and two pieces of spunge.</p>

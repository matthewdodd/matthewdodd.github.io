On Saturday, the 18th of October, in the afternoon, I left my shop, when I returned, between five and six, I missed three books from the shelf where they had been exposed for sale - I saw them before I went out. I missed them immediately on my return to my parlour. The same evening I went to several pawnbroker's, and described the books; on the Monday following I found them at Mr. Avilla's.</p>

I saw him on the 18th of October, he came to my master's shop, brought three books, saying, he brought them from his father, and that he lodged in Lisbon-street, Commercial-road, which is about five minutes walk from our house. I lent him twelve shillings upon them. I gave him the money before I heard the books had been lost by Mr. Mann. Five or six weeks after the prisoner pledged the books he came to offer a time-piece. He was disguised. I made an excuse, to detain him while I sent for the prosecutor. I pretended not to know him, and said time-pieces were cumbersome, and I did not like to take them in from strangers. He said, "I am no stranger, you may remember my bringing some books sometime ago;" mentioning these very books, the Bible, in two volumes, and the prayer-book. I asked him if he was the person who pledged them? he said, "Yes, in the name of

I said I would, and according went to the pawnbroker's and asked 1l. on them; they lent me twelve shillings, and I went to the young man, gave him the money, and he gave me a glass of liquor for my trouble.</p>

We had planted several crab stock plants on the 19th of March; I left the ground in the afternoon; the men usually leave at six o'clock - it is dark before seven. Next morning, between nine and ten, I went to the grounds, and found that about eighteen hundred had been stolen; the ground was trodden down - it had been a wet night - I did not see the ground when it was finished at night, but plants were left standing in different places. I afterwards saw six or seven of them - our clerk brought them from Vauxhall; they appeared to be a part of those stolen, as far as I could judge. I had not assisted in planting them, but was present part of the day. We always trim them in planting them. If they are intended for sale they are not trimmed. I do not know the prisoner. After his committal he came up to me, and said,</p>

            . I am clerk to the prosecutor. I was with the men planting the trees. They left work on the evening of the 19th - it was not dark then. I returned to the ground soon after six o'clock next morning, the sun had risen about ten minutes. I found a number of rows, and about eighteen hundred plants pulled up and gone. We had left the ground pretty level. The land is rather of a yellowish hue, and a stiff soil. I did not observe any earth on the parts of the plants that were above the ground. I assisted in pruning them - they were done for planting, and not for sale; we could not have exposed such for sale. There was the print of men's feet on the ground. Some rows were taken entirely; and sometimes one left here and there, as if done in a hurry, and in the dark. In consequence of information from Phillip, I went to his grounds at Vauxhall, and saw about two thousand plants, being near the number we lost; they were not planted, but the roots merely covered with earth. I have seven of them here, and am positive they are part of those stolen from our ground. I had pruned them myself, and cut the roots much closer than if they were intended for sale - we always cut them closer for planting; and the leaders of some were on, and others were not; and in cutting them. I frequently left a small piece of bark, which I observe on these. I will swear that at least fifteen hundred of them are ours - our soil is a yellow loom colour, and these were covered with mud at the top, above the roots, which would not have been the case, if they had not been taken from the ground in a hurry, laid on the wet ground and walked over; they have the same sort of soil on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Are they now in the state you found them - A. There was a little more earth about them than now.</p>
               <p>Q. Will the earth that is now on them weigh twelve grains - A. I think not. I speak from the quality and nature of the soil which was on them at the time.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. When you saw them they were fresh - A. Yes. I positively swear they are ours. I received them from Phillips on the Saturday following.</p>

            , sen. I have a nursery ground at Vauxhall. About a week previous to the 22d of March, the prisoner called on me, and produced a sample of crab<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090080"></xptr>and pear stocks, I agreed for two thousand of each. About ten o'clock on Saturday morning, the 22d of March, he brought two thousand of each. I covered the roots with earth to keep the air from them. I saw they were much injured in the bark, and in a state improper to be sold. They appeared to have been trampled on in the dark. He accounted for the injury, by saying, they were damaged by rubbing against the sides of the cart. I shewed him that the interior of the bundles were the same. He could give no satisfactory answer to that. The stems were very muddy - I refused to pay for them, as I had suspicions, and wrote to the prosecutors immediately. The clerk came over, and I shewed him the same; he took a few away as a sample - they were cut in an unusual manner for sale. He observed, in reply to that, that he had been so kind as to do that for me, as they were prepared for planting; and that he would not charge me any thing for it, though they were worth 7 s. 6 d. for it. He delivered them on the 22d. I left my ground on the Saturday evening, and on the Monday morning found them all stolen, except seven, which had escaped notice. The pear stocks were not taken; they were not the prosecutors', nor were they in the same state.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have bought of him before - A. Yes, at different times; I had ordered these a week previous. I wrote to him on the 13th of March to bring me a sample. I was never at his grounds.</p>

            . I am a nurseryman. When plants are to be sold, they are cut different to when they are intended for planting. Those in question are cut for planting only.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. But if sold for planting they would be cut that way - A. Never; the small fibres are never cut off when they are sold, or they would spoil; they should be cut off at the moment of planting. They are not sold after being planted and pruned; they never take them up. No nursery man would sell them in that state; the expence of planting is too great to sell them afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Every person has his own way of trimming - A. Yes. I should certainly have declined buying them in this state; I should have suspected they had been stolen after planting.</p>

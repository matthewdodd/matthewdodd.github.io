               <p>Q. You had a lad that lived with you, of the name of Lunn? - A. He lived with me about a year and a half; he was just breeched when I first took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed any of your property? - A. I had missed some noyeaux, that were in cases, and one bottle of Madeira.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of any information that you received from the boy, find any brandy on the premises of the prisoner? - A. Yes; on the 29th of August we went to her house near Widegate-street, Petticoat-lane; she furnished us with her address; when we came there, we opened her drawer, and there we found a bottle nearly full of brandy; I gave it to Read, the officer, after tasting and shaking it.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you go to your stock, and did you observe that you had missed any quantity? - A. About two-tenths of an inch, which is a little more than a bottle; I tasted it from the bottle which was found at her house; it was import strength; the strength it would be allowed to come into the port of London.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was import strength; is that the state in which it would be sold by publicans? - A. No; I believe you may go into ninety-nine gin-shops out of an hundred, and not get it of that strength, because it is the profit they are allowed; it would be reduced 3 s. in a gallon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you taste the gin; what state was that in? - A. Similar; I went by the bead on the vial.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing more in the stone bottle which was found? - A. The bottle was covered up in a sieve of fruit, as I conceived it to be, under her barrow; I found it to be brandy and water; brandy grog.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that to be your property? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the bottle of brandy that was found in her house? - A. Yes; I can swear to that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You import a deal of brandy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the strength of spirits is seen by shaking the vial, to see what sort of a bead it makes; do not you know that the thermometer is to ascertain the heat, and the hydrometer the strength? do you know the woman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not at all? - A. No; I have seen her in passing; that is all.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak to the brandy because of your shaking it; it had the strength of that which you had at home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say you may go to ninety-nine gin-shops out of an hundred, and not get such brandy? - A. That I am sure is true.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. As to the bead, that may be put upon it to make it look stronger than what it is? - A. I believe it is possible to be done, but the bead put upon it by a chemical process will shew different, we do not do it; the process may be done by others to lower it.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, if a customer comes, he sees there is a fine bead on it? - A. We never do it.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not do it, but the retailers do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What account did she give of the bottle of brandy? - A. She said she bought it at the Hole in the Wall, Aldgate; it was found in her drawer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. That might be owing to the lady's delicacy; she did not like her husband to know she had a bottle of brandy at all.</p>
               <p>- LUNN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How old are you? - A. I am 12 years and 6 months.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived with your master? - A. About a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the prisoner; where did she use to be? - A. Close to my master's house with a barrow.</p>
               <p>Q. What daily? - A. Yes; I have known her about two months.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you acquainted with her? - A. One day, I went to buy a halfpenny-worth of apples; she asked me to bring her some liquor; I denied her; she said I must do it; I took her five bottles of Hollands, four bottles of noyeaux, one bottle of Madeira, and one bottle of brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take this from? - A. From my master's house; I took them to Harp-lane, and delivered them to her there.</p>
               <p>Q. You took them at different times? - A. I took the five bottles of Hollands at once, and the four of noyeaux at once; and the bottle of Madeira<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120046"></xptr>and bottle of brandy at another time; she said she would give me 18 d. a bottle for the spirits, and and a shilling a bottle for the wine; she gave me a shilling a bottle for the noyeaux; I took nothing else to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure you have told us the truth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I am told you were a naked boy when you came to your master, and was breeched at your master's; how was it? - A. I was breeched some time.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you have learned your catechism? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me the eighth or ninth commandment? - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. The eighth is, thou shalt not steal; the ninth is, thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour; did you ever hear them before? - A. I learned them, but I quite forgot them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does your mother live? - A. At Bermondsey.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes you ride across the river with a scull to your mother's house? - A. No; I generally walk over.</p>
               <p>Q. Your sister used to be where your master lived? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not a sister? - A. Yes; my things used to come sometimes on a Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this you stole these things from your master? - A. About three months ago.</p>

               <p>Q. You are a good judge of liquor? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you tell whether it was gin, rum, or brandy? - A. I can tell whether it was brandy or gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you tasted gin? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot tell whether it was gin, brandy, or rum; you took the first thing that came to your hand, like any other rogue? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And though you stole, you cannot either read or write? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever drink brandy, rum, or gin? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it was red or white? - A. There were some red and some white.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you undertake to swear whether you gave rum or brandy? have you ever seen brandy mixed with sugar? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I hope you will never tell another lie? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then do not tell me another lie? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether it was brandy or rum you cannot tell? - A. It was a bottle of brandy that I gave to her.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it in a bottle when you took it? - A. No, I took it out of a puncheon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You were not wicked enough to taste it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You might mistake a rum puncheon for a brandy puncheon; might you not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you it was brandy? - A. Some of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body see you take it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You always took it privately? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know what a bellencher is? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is what they draw samples with; have you ever helped to draw with the bellencher? - A. I have sometimes with my master, upon the quays.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the smell of brandy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you put the bellencher in, did you suck the bellencher, or taste the brandy at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You were taken up for this? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever tell your master this before you were taken up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was she selling at the door? - A. Sometimes she sold apples and sometimes pears.</p>
               <p>Q. At the first time she asked you to give her some liquor, did not you tell your master or some of the men, that a wicked woman asked you to bring her some liquor? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you give them to her? - A. The five bottles of Hollands I took to the pastry-cook's, and left them there, and when she came I gave them to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver them to her in the presence of the pastry-cook? - A. No, I left them, and said I would call bye and bye.</p>

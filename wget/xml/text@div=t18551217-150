                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Turner, and live in Tothill-street, Westminster. On the evening of 3rd Nov. I went to a public house in Woolwich—I changed a half sovereign—I put a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece and a half crown into a purse, with 4 duplicates—I put the purse into my pocket on my right hand side—the prisoner and another man were at that time by my side—I left the public house about a quarter past 8 o'clock, and I missed my purse in less than an hour, between 8 and 9 o'clock—I went on Monday to the pawnbroker's shop, to stop these things—he was busy, and I went again on the Tuesday morning—the pawnbroker asked if I had found my duplicates—I said, "No"—1 gave information to the police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. She said she was in the Three Dolls public house, and she put seven shillings and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into her pocket. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, I put six shillings loose into my gown pocket, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into the purse.</p>

On the morning of 4th Nov. the prisoner was in my charge—I was about to search him—he undid his jacket, and took out this purse, which I produce—it contained four duplicates, a half crown piece, and a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and one penny—I was about to take the duplicates out of the purse, and he said, "Give me them for my wife"—I looked, and saw they were for wearing apparel—I said to him, "Are you married?"—he said, "Yes"—I did not give them to him—on 5th Nov. I took him into custody, and told him he was charged with stealing this purse and duplicates and money—he said he picked the purse up with the duplicates, but no money in it.</p>

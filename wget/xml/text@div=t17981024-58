               <p>Second Count. For that she, at the time she so uttered the said piece of false and counterfeit money, had in her custody and possession, another piece of false and counterfeit money, counterfeited to the likeness of a good shilling, she knowing the same to be false and counterfeit.(The case was opened by Mr. Ward,)</p>
               <p>MARY-ANN FROST sworn. - I am a widow, I keep a public-house in Star-court, Fenchurch-street: On the 20th of October, the prisoner came into my house for a quartern of raspberry, she asked for change for a seven-shilling-piece; I would not change it, because she had been, about a fortnight before, and changed two or three shillings with me, and therefore I did not like to give her change; she said she had no silver; then she put her hand into her pocket, and said, yes, here is one shilling, she gave it to me, and I saw it was a bad one; she then put her hand into her pocket and gave me another, which was not quite so bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure they were two different shillings? - A. Yes; I then reckoned the change out ready for her; I had a carpenter at work, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179810240035"></xptr>I asked his opinion of the shilling, and when I returned to the bar she was gone; there was a man having a pint of beer in the house who is the street-keeper of the Ward, he rubbed it, and said it was a very bad one, and then he went after her; he has got the shilling, his name is Perry.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the shilling you received from the prisoner was the one that you gave Perry? - A. Yes; it was never out of my hand.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PERRY sworn. - I was at Mrs. Frost's house, the prisoner came in, and asked for some raspberry, she wanted change for a seven-shilling-piece; Mrs. Frost told her she could not give her change; she then produced a shilling; Mrs. Frost said it was a bad one; she after that chucked down another; Mrs. Frost gave her nine-pence out of it; I asked Mrs. Frost to let me look at the shilling; I rubbed it against the sole of my shoe, and found it to be a very bad one; I immediately returned to the bar where she had been drinking, and she was gone; I went after her, and stopped her about thirty yards from the door; I searched her, and found a good seven-shilling-piece, and two bad shillings, she had but one good shilling about her; I took her to the Compter.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: I was standing in Fenchurch-street, I saw the prisoner, and another woman, pass by, whom I knew very well; I saw Mr. Perry come out, and look round, I thought he was looking after them, and I told him which way they were gone; I went up to her and found her hand clenched, I forced it open, and there were two bad shillings, (produces them); I found one good shilling besides, and a seven-shilling-piece, upon her; I took her back to Mrs. Frost, and she marked one of the shillings, which she said she knew; then we took her before the Lord-Mayor, and she was committed.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Frost. This is the shilling that she first offered me; I am very positive it is the same from a mark that I observed upon it.</p>

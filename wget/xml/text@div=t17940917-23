               <p>I work at bricklayer's labouring; I came from a job belonging to my master, the 30th of July, to our cellar for some stuff, and I heard a rustling noise come into the passage, over my master's cellar; it is in Castle-street, Holborn; the passage runs between Castle-street and Dyer's Buildings; this was about five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this from Leather-lane? - Not much more than across the street. I heard this noise come from Castle-street towards my master's door; and I heard a voice, d-mn your eyes, here they come in Castle-street; and I ran and looked up out of the cellar into my master's yard, and a man came and dropped a bundle, which afterwards I opened, and found it to be three counterpanes; and then he took hold of the door and pulled it to, and latched it, after he had dropped the bundle in the passage; he shut himself out, and he went out of the yard; he shut the bundle inside of the door, in the yard; when I saw him pull the door after him, I came out of the cellar as soon as I could, and I opened the door; there was him and another, as I supposed, to be just at the beginning of a run from the door, for Dyer's Buildings, and one of them said, d-mn your eyes, you have put them in the wrong place, and they turned back, both of them turned towards the door, and I pushed the door to as far as I could, and the force of the two against it, I could not push it so as to latch it; I was inside, they were outside, in the passage; I said to them, what have you put this bundle here for? I called out for master's clerk, and they ran off; he came down, and I took up the bundle and opened it, and found it to be to be three counterpanes, as they call them. When I opened the bundle, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170077"></xptr>tied it up agian, and gave it up to my master's clerk.</p>

            Who were the people that brought the bundles in this way? - That is the man in the red coat that laid the bundle down, Tilbury; I cannot tell who the other man was, because this man that was nearest to inside of the door I could see him, but the other that was outside I could not take notice of.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had these counterpanes, how did you get at the men? - As I went with the stuff to where my bricklayer was at work, I was turning into a court into Fetter-lane, and I saw a publican that keeps the White Hart, at the corner of King's Head-court, Fetter-lane, and I was telling him what happened in master's yard, while I was away, and this man, Tilbury, came up, and said, I have kicked up one of their heels just now, I knowed him directly, and I asked him do you know one? says I, so with that I went up with the stuff to the bricklayer, and I went back to my master's yard, and there was this man in his shirt sleeves in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave the man if you knew him? - I brought the bricklayer down along with me to the White Hart, and the publican told us that this man shot into Holborn like a dart, and I found him in my master's yard, demanding these things in his shirt sleeves, and when I first saw him he had on a blue coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the yard then? - Two clerks and a footman, and one or two of the labourers; I told our clerks to stop him, when he turned about and saw me, then he says, I will go and get my master and he shall prove the property; and I said, you are the man that put the property down, I will swear to it; and then he got off, and I did not see him again till Thursday week following.</p>

            How came the other man taken? - In about a quarter of an hour he sent two men, they said he sent them, they came in and demanded the things as he did, Coleman was one of the two that came, him and the other man was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you should know the counterpanes again? Was there any thing over them? - Nothing, over them but a piece of jack line I made no mark on them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. What are you? - I have worked at bricklayer labouring for this seven or eight years.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you are a very faithful attentive servant? - I have a right to be so, my master pays me very well for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been at work abroad? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You came home for some stuff and instead of attending to get the stuff you heard some conversation, and then you ran up to see what this conversation was? Was that the usual way you attend your master's business? - I ran up to see what the bundle was, I saw it in the yard from the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I ask you how you came to know it was there? - I saw it put down by a man in the yard, while I was in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Some time after this you met the prisoner at the bar in the street? - He came up and stood where I was in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason you did not stop him then? - I was unable, after falling down the day before.</p>

               <p>Q. Could not this landlord have taken them into custody? - I did not ask him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you ask him? - I don't know.</p>

               <p>Q. Was not Tilbury by at the time? - I knowed him to be one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you say they were fool sif you knew him to be one? - I was telling the publican, and he came up.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to mention this if Tilbury was by? - I thought he might come back to demand the things, and then there was somebody would stop him; a man in many instances may not have in his power to do what he would wish; and besides, how did I know but what that man might spend more money in the publican's house than ever I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think then the landlord would have refused you? - They tell me it is not a landlord's business, and one customer is as good as another.</p>

On Monday, July the 21st, the prisoner Coleman, and another, came into Mr. Norris's yard, and another man, that is not here present, he is outside of the door, to demand three counterpanes; I asked him, from what authority he came? Tilbury had come first to demand them, but I had suspicion that he did not belong to them, and he said, he would go and get his master; I asked him whose they were? and the other man said, that he was master of the cart, and his name was John Rose; and I said, I did not know that, and I sent a labourer out to see if such a cart was standing as he said, at the end of Leather-lane; on that I refused to give him them, and I sent for an officer from Hatton-garden, and they were both taken into custody; the other man turned evidence; I delivered the things into the hands of the officer, and he took them before the magistrate, at Hatton-garden.</p>

               <p>Q. You have been turning King's evidence I understand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you come here to save the prosecution of yourself; you must tell us the whole truth; how long have you known the prisoners? - I never was in their company before, I never knew any one of them, only by sight; I was standing at the back door of the Swan public house, in Field-lane, I saw Tilbury and Coleman coming down the passage; Tilbury came up to the door and says to the man that keeps the house, the things is good now; with that I went up to ask what they were; they said, they were three counterpanes, and they said, if I went after them, and said I was master of the cart, I might get them; they said they had dragged them out of a cart just by Leather-lane, Tilbury said that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the hearing of Coleman? - Yes; I had got on a silk handkerchief, and Tilbury proposed to let me have his white one, because it would make me look more like the master of the cart; I have got the handkerchief now in my possession; then Coleman and I went up Holborn, and as I went up Holborn, Coleman told me that he was not with him when they were stole; he took me to the place where they were, and went in first, and says, here is my master, with that I followed in afterwards, and they asked me if I was the master of the cart? I said no, I said I was the master's son, with that they said they should detain us, and send for an officer; and we were detained.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. You say you did not know these men, till you met them on this day? - I did not know them, only by seeing them by sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it must have been a very good natured thing, that these men should come and tell you they had taken things out of a cart? - I had spoken with Coleman. asking him how he did? I know him by sight.</p>

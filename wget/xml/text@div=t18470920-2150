The prisoner was in my service about three months—I missed a great coat on Monday, the 30th of Aug., which I had seen safe on Saturday, the 28th, on my horse's back—I asked the prisoner if he had seen it—he said "No"—he was taken to the station that night—he then said he had taken the coat, he was sorry for it, and asked me to forgive him—I found my coat at Mrs. Burman's, the laundress, who washed for the prisoner.</p>

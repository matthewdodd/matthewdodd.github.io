                  </hi>. I live at No. 11, Carter-street, Walworth. On 3rd or 4th March I was living there alone—I had some money in the house; I had it in two different boxes—one was a common deal box, and the other</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185404030137"></xptr>
               <p>a japanned deed box inside—they both had Chubb locks to them—the money was in the deed box—the other was merely a case—it amounted at least to 1,631<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, chiefly fives; there might have been a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note among them, for aught I know—the sovereigns were not loose in the box; there was one paper parcel, which may be called loose; it was in paper, but the others were in bags—I should say there were seven canvas bags; they were of various sizes, they were common canvas bags, such as bankers use to keep sovereigns in—any one could handle them with facility—the door of the room was locked with a common lock, and a small padlock as well; that was the middle room, first floor—the outer door of the house required a large key, and a smaller one to unlock it from without—on going out it merely required pulling to; in order to get in you had to use both keys together, one would not undo it without the other acting at the same time—on Friday, 3rd March, I went out somewhere between 12 and 1 o'clock—I remember pulling the outer door very firmly after me—I returned home about 9 o'clock in the evening, and in putting my hand to the door I found that it had been considerably loosened by falling back, but it required the use of the keys notwithstanding to open it—I fastened everything up, and went to bed, and next morning, somewhere about 11 o'clock, I examined the deed box, and found everything perfectly correct and safe—on that Saturday morning I observed marks on the outer door, as if some instrument had been put to the side of the door, and chafed or dented it—to the best of my recollection I saw marks both on the hinge and lock side of the door—I did not notice the lock—I went out on the Saturday, I think, close upon 12 o'clock—I fastened the door very fast indeed, particularly so, and had locked the bedroom door—I am quite certain of that, and the box was all safe—I returned somewhere between 8 and 9 o'clock—I found all apparently safe in unlocking the door, but on getting up stairs I was surprised to see the front door of the first floor room vide open, and on turning to the left I saw that the middle door, where the money was kept, was also open—I found the two boxes, one beside the other, broken open, and the money all gone—I have never seen any part of it again—the boxes are here—the prisoner Eliza Bacon was in the habit of charing with me, her business was to be with me daily—I engaged her for the purpose of doing up one room merely—she did not always come, but she did occasionally—I cannot tell the last day she came, but in consequence of having received a very severe wound it was my fault perhaps that she did not come, if she did not find me—to the best of my recollection, I should say she came on the Wednesday before the robbery.</p>
               <p>

               <p>are not trees on each side, it is merely a sort of passage that leads to the street door at the right hand side, and there is a pantry door in the front—there are neighbours' houses adjoining—the door of the room in which I kept my money was always locked, and I always kept the key in my pocket—the window of that room looked into the garden in front of the house—I have occasionally gone to the public house opposite—I have not been in the habit of going to public houses for the last five or six years; but within the last six weeks I think I might have been somewhere about a dozen times, I may say—I have been to two houses, and I have been to a third twice, to the best of my recollection—I did not sit and talk there with the rest of the people—I carried a good many sovereigns about with me the last part of the time—I was not in the habit of carrying a large amount of gold in my waistcoat pockets, but about that time I did so; but it was out of sight—the greater part of them were in a green purse—I will not be posi<lb></lb>tive how many I might have; some in a small bag as well—I had about ninety; I divided them into two, and carried them in my waistcoat pockets; I also had a purse and a few shillings in it in my pocket—when I went to these public houses I might be an hour there—I certainly took, something to drink during the time, chiefly sherry; not a bottle, sometimes a pint at the most, and very often much less, I think it was a quartern—I never con<lb></lb>sidered that I wanted a companion to guide me home; I was led home one night, but there was no occasion for it—I cannot say whether I have been led home more than once by some stranger; I will not swear I have not—I had not counted my money for some time, but I had seen the inside of the box and the bags correct.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Bennett-buildings, Kennington-lane. On Friday-afternoon, 3rd March, I was standing outside the Beehive public house, at the end of Carter-street, Walworth, talking to the potman, Edward M'Fell, who was cleaning the windows—it is about eighty yards from Mr. Harvey's house—about half past 4 o'clock, I saw Norns go in at Mr. Harvey's garden gate—there is a little garden in front of the house—I saw him go inside the garden gate; it is a very small garden—it is about three yards from the gate to the house—at the time he went in, I saw Hilton and Brunton standing at the corner of Carter-street; the same end where I was, on the other side—Norris remained inside the gate about a minute, and then came out and joined Hilton and Brunton—they had three or four minutes' conversation, and Norris then went back again to Mr. Harvey's house, and staid for about the same time—he went inside the garden gate, and remained about a minute—Brunton and Hilton were standing a few yards from where they were standing at first—Norris went back to them, and they all went down Manor-road together—I saw Norris go into a house there; he took a key out of his pocket and put it in. the door; he then put it back into his pocket, and took out another key, and entered with the second—it was an empty house—he remained in there four or five minutes; the other two remained standing at the top of Manor-road—Norris then came out and went up to them—he then went back, and was going into the empty house again when a lad spoke to them, and they all three ran away—I do not know the lad's name, but I have seen him since (<hi rend="italic">looking at a lad named Newberry, who was called into Court</hi>)—I think that is the lad, but he was in a different dress—this was on the Friday—on the Sunday following, I heard of the robbery; after hearing of it, I went into the Sir William of Walworth public house—I there saw Norris, Samuel Bacon, and another party who is not here—they were sitting down in front of the bar drinking together—I do not know what they were drinking—I heard Bacon say to Norris, "Is it to be wine again?"—I did not hear Norris make any reply—I have seen all the prisoners before, but not within two or three months of the robbery—I have seen Samuel Bacon and Norris in company together where I used to live, and Brunton—I think I have seen them repeatedly</p>

               <p>together—I saw Eliza Bacon on the Sunday—she came into the public house and whispered something to her brother, Samuel Bacon, and called him outside; that was while Norris and the others were there—I enrolled myself in the Militia, and was taken for desertion, and imprisoned—while I was in prison I saw Norris, while he was in custody under this charge—I was coming out of the school, when he came from two or three and spoke to me—he said, "If you will say Quinnear put you up to say what you have said, I will buy you off, and give you a <hi rend="italic">fin</hi> to spend"—I do not knew what a <hi rend="italic">fin</hi> is—I did not make any reply—he said if I thought he knew anything about it, why did not I come to him instead of going to sergeant Quinnear, that would be much better than having three months for the Militia—I think this conversation occurred last Thursday week.</p>

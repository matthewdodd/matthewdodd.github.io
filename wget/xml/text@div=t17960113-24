               <p>Q. Was you sober? - A. I was a little sober.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you been drinking? - A. I had been in another house; I was before in another house, where there was the fiddler and all.</p>
               <p>Q. And you danced there? - A. I danced not.</p>
               <p>Q. And you drank there; how much did you drink? - A. I cannot tell, I am sure, how much.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you drink? - A. Porter.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pots? - A. There were more people as me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pots did you drink yourself? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You was a little merry, was not you? - A. I was a little sober.</p>
               <p>Q. I am afraid you was more drunk than sober? - A. No; the officer has got my watch; the watchmaker, that I bought the watch of, saw it; I have got the watchmaker's name in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking at a public-house, where there was dancing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And there were women there dancing? - A. I danced not.</p>
               <p>Q. But there were women there? - A. I can swear, twenty times, it is my watch, and the watchmaker is here. (Pointing to a paper).</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to this house, where you lost your watch, you had been at another house? - A. The girls run away with my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you pay for your liquor? - A. I drank with the other sailors.</p>
               <p>Q. What share did you drink? - A. They were all Dutchmans, and they drank altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you pay? - A. That is my watch, and I will swear it twenty minutes; I cannot always understand what you say.</p>
               <p>Q. At another public-house you drank with some other sailors; did you pay for your liquor? - A. I cannot say how much we paid; we drank altogether; I was there a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you pay? - A. I can no say how much.</p>
               <p>Court. If you were sober, you can tell what it was that it cost you; was it half-a-crown, or one shilling, or how much? - A. I cannot tell; one gave sixpence, and another gave two pence, and so on.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you give? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. You paid the fidler besides, you know? - A. No; I no fiddle.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the ladies there, at this house? - A. That is the watch, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Your harping upon that watch will not deceive me at all; you know very well what is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130041"></xptr>going forward, though you are a foreigner; put up that paper about your watch; what liquor did you pay for at this public-house? - A. As you come in at the house, there come much peoples there, and one give four-pence, as you go in, and then you can drink as much as you like, as much as a pot, and then get some clean ticket; but there were other peoples gave me the ticket to drink; I left that house a quarter before eleven; when I got to St. Catharine's, it was about eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this house? - A. In St. Catharine's-lane; they stood at the corner of the house; and I go with the girls up stairs, and they tell me what is the clock, and I took out the watch, and the little girl took the watch, and run away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. There were several girls? - A. There were three or four rooms up there, were they live up that stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How many girls were there in this room you went up into? - A. I cannot tell more as that is my watch; I can swear twenty times to it.</p>
               <p>Court. Your harping upon that only convinces me that you have more art than you pretend to have; how many girls were there? - A. Three or four, and so on.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go up into this room, you did not know them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you say which of these girls took your watch? - A. It was that little girl.</p>
               <p>Q. How many others ran away at the same time? - A. I see no more as that one took my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the others, did they stay in the room? - A. She ran away with my watch, I followed her, and could not find her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the other girls do? - A. I don't know; I cry out after that girl, and I could not find her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to the mistress of the house, that night? - A. No; I did not stay that night, that girl ran away with the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any candles in the room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. More than one? - A. I cannot say there were more as one.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that all you can say? - A. That is all I can say; that I know is my watch.</p>

               <p>Q. (To the Prosecutor.) Look at that watch? - A. It is my watch.</p>
               <p>Court. The two prisoners are charged with stealing a watch; against one of them there is no a tittle of evidence; against the short one there evidence that she ran away with it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. I believe I can prove to your Lordship that she never has had this watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130042"></xptr>Court. It would be very dangerous. I think, to convict a woman upon such evidence; the man is at a public-house so drunk that he does know what he paid at the public-house; the girl receives the watch from she does not know who; and Mr. Andrews pawns it; the wife takes it out of pawn, and gives it to Mrs. Parkins; the constable says, that is the watch he received, not from Mrs. Andrews, but from Cable; so that it must have gone through some other hands: then the only evidence against this girl is-this man going to this house and picking up a girl in the street, at that time of night; and going into an improper house; as to the other girl, why she is charged, God Almighty knows; there is not a tittle of evidence against her: now it does seem to me, that if the charge was brought home, it is a serious offence; because women who have lost their virtue should not lose their honesty too; at the same time, these are not prosecutions to be countenanced in a court of justice; men ought to keep out of such houses; if it strikes you as it does me, you will acquit both the prisoners; the counsel says, he was evidence that may make it more clear; it is with you, if you think proper to hear it; but, if you think as I do upon the subject, you will acquit them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. I think, from respect to the time of the Jury and the Court, I ought not to trouble them with my evidence.</p>
               <p>Jury. The Prosecutor will have his watch again, I presume, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Jury. We wish it to be delivered to him under the eye, and by the direction of your Lordship; because, otherwise it may not be done at all; we should not have made that observation, but we saw the officer take it to himself.</p>
               <p>Court. It must certainly be delivered up, and I am much obliged to you, Gentlemen, for the observation.</p>

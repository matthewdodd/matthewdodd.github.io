I have a stable about 30 yards from my house - I was never on the roof till this lead was stolen - it was the hip. On Sunday the 17th of February I first found it was gone; it was thirty feet long, and weighed about 80 lbs. I saw it on Monday at Bow-street - I compared it with the roof - it appeared to be part of it - the nail-holes fitted. Howell is my next door neighbour, and lived with a cow-keeper - I have seen Andrews about.</p>

            . I keep a clothes-shop. On the 16th of February Andrews came to me with 12 lbs. of lead - I bought it of him. I put it on the floor, and on Monday morning the officer took it away. I told the officer where he lived. Alder and the officer took it with some more, which they got somewhere else.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. You buy lead whoever brings it - A. No - I was not given in custody - I was charged with receiving it - I was not kept in custody, but went home the same day, without being confined. I was not there above two hours. About 20 lbs. more was mixed with it at Bow-street. I gave three halfpence per lb. for it.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. The prisoner Howell is my son. I went to Johnson's by his direction. His master and Mr. Alder told him he had better tell all he knew about it; and in consequence of what he said I went and took Johnson in charge, put her in a coach with the prisoner, and took her to Bow-street - she was detained there till eight o'clock at night. I saw Alder fit the lead to the building - the nail-holes corresponded, but it was in small quantities.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time did you take the woman - A. At nine o'clock in the morning - she was detained till eight at night. The lead was mixed (after it was fitted,) with some which was hid in Hyde Park.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What part of the park was it in - A. Under a cluster of trees - my son went and shewed it me - part of that, and part of what was found at Johnson's tallied. I apprehended Andrews on the 17th, and before he was examined told him the charge; he said that was the lead they sold to Johnson on the Saturday night. No inducement was held out to him to say so.</p>

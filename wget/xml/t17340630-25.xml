He took something from him, and then came to me, and said, Damn you, now let's see what you have got? and robb'd me of 10 d. When they had robb'd us they went towards the Half-way-House. We stood pausing a little, and I was for going back, but one of 'em call'd to us, and said, Damn you, go forward. So we cross'd the Fields to Pancras, and went home to Red-Lion-Street. Next Day I went to Mrs. Moreland, at the Half-way-House, and told her we had been robb'd, and described the Men to her. While I was there the Prisoners and 2 Women came in. Lord, says I, those are the Men. You frighten me, says she, don't speak so loud, for if they should hear us, we may be kill'd. I know one of them, his Name is Cummins, and often frequents the Mag-Pye and Horse-Shoe in Drury-Lane. The Prisoners went away about 3, and I came home between 4 and 5. I told my Husband and my Landlord Falkner, that I had seen the Prisoners. We went next Morning to Mrs. Morland's, to get farther Information, and she gave us Directions in Writing to find Cummins. I went the same Evening to the Mag-Pye and Horse-Shoe, and finding York was there, I sent for my Husband, and Mr. Falkner, and they got a Constable who took him to his House, (the Rose in Wild-Street) and there Cummins came in to see what was the Matter, and so he was taken too.</p>

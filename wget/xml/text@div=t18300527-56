On the morning of the 22nd of April, soon after eight o'clock, I received information of the loss of some skeins of silk - I went to the White Horse, at Clay-hall, to inquire who had been there at six o'clock, at which time the men who come at four o'clock, are allowed to go out for ten minutes; before this I had asked the prisoner whether he had gone out at six o'clock - he said No; when I returned I ordered the men down, and searched them - I found nothing on them, and they went to breakfast; I went to the White Horse again, and was shown the prisoner's coat hanging in the kitchen; I searched it, and found two handkerchiefs and nine skeins of silk in each of them; I missed eighteen skeins from a bundle of two hundred and forty - I counted it just before they went to breakfast; there was a deficiency of 1 lb. 7 oz. 8 dwts. - the skeins I found in the prisoner's coat had our private mark on them; I took the coat to an officer with the silk in it, and called the prisoner down - Hedges, the officer, was there; I asked the prisoner whose coat it was - he said his; I then asked if he knew what was in the pocket - he said, "I did not put it there;" the bundles were not then produced - I then took out one of the bundles, and said, "How comes the silk to be in your handkerchief?" he said, "It is my first offence. I hope you will forgive me" - I produce from the bulk a skein of silk, which exactly corresponds with the eighteen skeins found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any share in the concern? A. No - the prisoner had been six months in their service; I do not know that any of the men had quarrelled with him - he has six children.</p>

            . I am a watchman to Messrs. Hall. I was on duty on the morning of the 22nd of April, at six o'clock; the prisoner gave me his great coat and his handkerchief with his food in it for the day - he told me to hang it in the kitchen, where I had seen it hang, at the White Horse: I hung it up, and saw the prisoner afterwards at the White Horse - he asked me to drink with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him all the time he was at the White Horse? A. I cannot pretend to say that, as I went to wash my face and hands; I believe I saw him all the time he was in the tap-room, but the coat was in the kitchen - he left the tap-room while I was there, but I did not see him in the kitchen; there was no one there when I washed myself - I then went into the tap-room, and found him there with Mr. Martin; I staid there five or six minutes - I did not see where the prisoner went when he left the tap-room - I did not see any thing with him then; he was in his working dress - I did not see any of the servants at that time.</p>

            . I am a headborough of Bow. I went to the office, and saw Mr. Hall; he called the prisoner down, and asked if the coat was his - he said it was; Mr. Hall took the parcel out, and said,</p>
               <p>"I suppose you know something of this?" he said, "I did not put it there, Sir;" Mr. Hall then put his hand into the other pocket, and said, "Here is some more of it;" the prisoner then begged for mercy, and said, "You have never been robbed before by me."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. These bundles of silk would make a considerable bulk in a man's pocket? A. Yes; he did not say, "I did not put it there," before he saw any thing - Mr. Hall was drawing it out of the pocket, and said,"I suppose you know something of this?" the prisoner then said, "I did not put it there" - he was agitated and frightened; I do not know of his having a quarrel with a man named Moules.</p>
               <p>MR. HALL. This silk is the property of my brothers - the silk had been weighed that morning when it came out of the stove; there were then two hundred and forty skeins - the deficiency was discovered by the weight.</p>

Howell to two cheques, one on Saturday last for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one yesterday morning for 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, "That is right"—Dymond was present, and heard the conversation—I said, "Where is the money?"—Davies then gave me a small bag from his trousers pocket, containing seventeen sovereigns, four shillings from, his waistcoat pocket, and a watch and gold Albert guard—he said that was, part—at that tune Legg spoke to Dymond, and we all went downstairs into the basement, where I saw Legg find the rest of the money, 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, and a quantity of new clothing, shirts, and other articles—I then took Davies to the station-house, and searched him—I found on him a ticket for a passage to Quebec—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. seems to have been paid on account—this other ticket was found on Davies by Legg in my presence—that is for a passage to Auckland—I have known such things done before as a passage taken to two different places—it is sometimes done to baffle the police in their inquiries—I was not surprised at it at all.</p>

Davies said, "I have to give my master a week's notice to leave, and my time is up on Monday, and the ship will start on Monday night at 6 o'clock;" and he said, "My master got me another place in the City;" I said to him," Why don't you go to that place until the spring, and then we will go away together, I don't care about going now; it is the wrong time of year?" but he said, "Uncle says it is the right time to go now;" and Davies said, "I have paid seven pounds deposit, and I told the man I was called White, and you Adams;" I said to him, "My name is Dymond, that you know;" "Yes," he said, "I know, but uncle said I was not to let father or mother know anything about it, for mother would break her poor heart if she knew."</p>

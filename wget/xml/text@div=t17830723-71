               <p>I live in Smithfield, the prisoner at the bar brought a horse to my yard the 20th or 21st of October last, he asked me to put him up to bait, and then soon after he had put him up, he offered him for sale to me, I said, I did not want such a kind of a horse, and he said, if I had one that was less, he would change with me, that would ride and draw, I told him, I had such a mare, and I shewed it him, he said, the horse was too big for his cart that he had, and he wished to change with me, and what I would give him to boot, I asked him a guinea, and I said, I thought my mare was of much more value, as his horse was a blemished horse, I think he asked eight pounds for him, I reckoned my mare worth six or seven pounds, I asked him his name, and where he came from, he said, his name was

            , and he came from Little Ealing, we had something to drink at the Crown coffee-house, and a little time after, he wanted to sell the mare again, that he had of me, for he had not money, he had not much use for her, I told him, he had better keep her, he asked me then, what I would give him for her, and whether I would give him four guineas for her, I told him, I had no objection to give him four guineas for the mare, I saw him again on the 13th of June, a person came and told me, he saw the man that sold me the stolen horse, and that he was upon a bay mare, at the Bull's-head, in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Court. Was not this horse worth more than eight pounds, he was only three years old, coming four? - Not to me, to sell again, and to run the hazard of keeping him, he might be worth more to the owner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230094"></xptr> I very seldom keep any horses to draw at all, but to let out to ride.</p>
               <p>Had you any evidence by when you bought the horse of him? - There is one here that was by,

               <p>Court. You say I think, you did not want a horse of that kind? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he said, if you had one that was less, he would change with you, then the first bargain was to change, there was no talk about the price of the mare till afterwards? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to tell me last night, on the other indictment, that you first agreed to give him five guineas before there was any agreement for the mare at all? - I do not know, it was a mistake if I swore so, I changed the mare with him, I offered him five guineas, but he did not agree to take it, to my knowledge, we went to the Crown coffee-house, and had something to drink, and I paid him, and he asked me to pay the reckoning.</p>

               <p>What day and time? - The 21st of October, between nine and ten, I was in the stable, I saw the horse when I came out of the stable, he brought him there, and offered him for sale as soon as he came in, I did not hear what money was agreed on, I was not at the finishing of the bargain, I think the price was near upon ten pounds, what I heard there, was half a guinea between them, as I was cleaning a horse, just by the door I made answer to the prisoner, when I heard there was only half a guinea between them, I said, if you will allow me to speak, I would split the difference, the prisoner said, I have abated some money already.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any thing about a mare? - I cannot say whether it was a mare or a horse in regard to a change, he was to take a mare in exchange, I understood the prisoner that the horse was too heavy for him, and he would wish to have a lesser horse to ride, I think they did agree to exchange, I do not know what money was paid at last by this man to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the same man that brought the horse into the yard? - Why I cannot positively say that he was.</p>

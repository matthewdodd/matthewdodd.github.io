The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174801150008"></xptr> Prisoner had been my servant : Bell desired me to go up stairs, and told me, the bureau was open; I went up stairs, and saw that my bureau was broke open.

               <p>Q. Did Bell tell you in the hearing of Simpson, that he believed you had been robbed?</p>
               <p>Guyther . No, Sir. I went up stairs with him, and shut the dining-room door, and told him, he had robbed me of so much money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him?</p>
               <p>Guyther. No. I told him, he must have the money: he asked forgiveness, and returned me nine moidores, and three half guineas, which he pulled out of his side-breeches pocket; I asked him, if he had any money when he came into my house, and he said, he had none.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks upon the moidores?</p>
               <p>Guyther. I don't know of any marks upon the moidores, the rings I can positively swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost eight rings; have you got them again?</p>
               <p>Guyther. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find them?</p>
               <p>Guyther. He put his hand behind him, and then I saw the box of rings in his hand; there were eight gold rings.</p>

            . I served my time with Mr. Guyther, and lived with him as a journeyman then; on Thursday the 10th of December, between six and seven in the evening, the Prisoner came into Mr. Guyther's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the Prisoner formerly lived there?</p>
               <p>Bell. Yes. After some conversation he said, he would go down into the kitchen to the maid, and I thought he was gone down; I went down into the kitchen, but he was not there; not seeing him there , I was surprized : I heard a noise in the dining room, and I sent a fellow-servant up with a candle to see if there was any body there. Then I went up myself , and as I was going up stairs, I heard somebody there: I called out several times, who is there ? And at last the Prisoner said, it is I. I asked him, what he did there; he said, he came for a brush that he had left there; I said, I would go up for it; I went up and found the flap of the bureau quite down, and the things in a confused manner .</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had found the brush?</p>
               <p>Bell. No, he did not say he had found it; afterwards I came down stairs, and went to a place where I thought Mr. Guyther was, but he was not there; a little after I met him at the door and told him, I had a suspicion that Simpson had robbed him, and desired him to go up stairs and satisfy himself. He went up and I with him, and he said, he was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bureau open then?</p>
               <p>Bell. The flap was put up again then.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did that?</p>
               <p>Bell . The Prisoner went up stairs again , for I saw him come down after I came back from looking for my master; then Mr. Guyther went up stairs with the Prisoner, and told him, he had robbed him, and he pulled out a handful of gold, and gave it to Mr. Guyther; Mr. Guyther asked him if he had any money, when he came into his house, and he said, he had not a farthing; then he put his hand behind him, and slid the box, and Mr. Guyther took the box from him and opened it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the box?</p>
               <p>Bell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the box?</p>
               <p>Bell. Rings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they gold rings?</p>
               <p>Bell . I can't tell whether they were gold rings or not, but I know they were rings.</p>

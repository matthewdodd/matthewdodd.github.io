                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17241204-41-defend227 t17241204-41-deflabel230"></join> to - Hawes Esq; in Channel-Row, Westminster; that having a Holiday given her, and being a Stranger in London, she came to him to desire him to go with her into the City to find out a Person that ow'd her some Money: They went, she received the Money; he brought her back to his House, where she staid till about Eight that Night, and he went with her as far as Katharine-Street in Covent-Garden. Marg. Dixon deposed, that soon after she had parted with Mr. Mow, she enquired the Way of two Men; and one of them, who was the Prisoner, told her he lived not far from thence, and would go home with her: He carry'd her out of her Way, and pulled her into a Tavern in a strange Place; she cry'd, and beg'd of him to to put her in the right Way; he promised her he would, and call'd a Coach, which drove to an Inn, and by the Way he pull'd her Rings off her Finger, and took away her Handkerchief and Fan. She was frighted, and knew not what to do; but when she came to the Inn, she desired him to give her back what he had taken from her: He swore that he would not, except she would pay for the Wine and the Coach. She consented, rather than lose her Things; and knowing that she had three Guineas before she met him, she put her Hand into her Bosom to take one out, but found that they were all gone. She cry'd out that the Rogue had got her Money too; upon which he endeavour'd to get off, but was prevented, and she fell into a Swoon. The Tapster and the Maid, at the Bear-Inn in Piccadilly, confirm'd the latter Part of the Prosecutor's Evidence; adding, that when she said the Rogue had robb'd her of all, he cry'd, Damn the Bitch, I'll have no more to say to her, and was going away; but the Maid catch'd him by the Hair and stopt him. This was corroborated by the Constable, who farther deposed, that he conducted the Prisoner to the Round-House; and thence next Morning before the Justice, where he deliver'd the Rings to him, (the Constable) and the Constable produced them in Court. - Hawes Esq; gave a very good Character of his Maid the Prosecutor, by assuring the Court that he believed her to be a good natur'd, innocent, modest, honest, Country Girl, and entirely unacquainted with the Town. The Prisoner in his Defence said that as he was talking with his Friend in Russel-street, the Prosecutor came by very drunk, and desired him to shew her the Way to Channel-Row; he having Business that Way, was glad of her Company; they went across the Park, where he having Occasion to make Water, went aside, and in the mean while a Man came up and took her round the Waste: She was frighted; but he stepping up to the Man, ask'd him what he meant by it? Sir, says the Man, I ask your Pardon, I did not know the Lady belong'd to you; and so saying, he retired. Soon after, she dropt her Handkerchief and Fan, he took them up, and she pray'd him to carry 'em for her. They then came to the Sun Tavern in King-Street, Westminster; where she told him she would treat him for his Trouble in coming so far with her. They drank two Pints, and she was so drunk, that she fell out of her Chair, and her Rings dropt off her Finger: He took both her and them up again, and she desir'd him to take care of them till they parted. She said it was too late for her to go home that Night, and therefore beg'd of him to provide a Lodging for her. They then went to a Brandy-Shop by the Gatehouse, from whence they took Coach to the Bear-Inn in Piccadilly, where he spoke for a Bed; but she being willing to drink first, they sat down together, and in a little time the began to cry about her Rings, which he did not refuse to give her, if she would pay for the Wine and the Coach; but she falling into Fits, the Constable was called, came, and carry'd him to the Round-House.

             deposed, that he was the Person that stood talking with the Prisoner when the Prosecutor came to them; that she was very drunk, and ask'd one of them to shew her the Way home. Robert Mow then deposed again, that the Prosecutor was sober when he left her; and the Tapster, Maid, and Constable, at the Bear-Inn, farther deposed, that the Prosecutor was in Fitts, but not drunk, when she was at that House. but yet two or three Gentlemen appear'd to the Prisoner's Reputation, he having been Servant to some of their Acquaintance: One more in particular said, having once by Mistake given him a Guinea in changing Half a Crown, he very honestly brought it him again the next Morning.

I lodged at the King William, King William-street, Strand—on the 14th of Nov. I placed seven sovereigns, wrapped in paper, under my pillow—I got up next morn<lb></lb>ing, leaving it under the pillow, and in the evening I missed it—the bed had then been made—the policeman afterwards showed me a pieoe of paper which I knew to be what contained my sovereigns.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Beeston, who keeps this public-house, which is in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-fields. The prisoner was our servant for three months—I had given her warning, and she was to have left the night this money was missing—her things were packed up, ready to go—the prosecutor left about half-past eight o'clock in the morning—I di<lb></lb>rected the prisoner to make his bed, at five minutes past ten—I never have strange lodgers—nobody slept in the house but the family and the prosecutor—there is a pot-boy—I heard the prisoner go into the room to make the bed—she was there about ten minutes—in the evening, when the prosecutor came to me I searched his bed, but found nothing—I called the prisoner up, and asked if, when she made the bed, she had seen any thing under the pillow in the shape of a small screw-paper—she said no—I said Mr. Meadows had lost seven sovereigns rolled in paper from there—she said "No, I have not seen it at all"—I said, "You must, for it was left there"—she said, "Here are the keys of my box, go and search"—a policeman was sent for, and she was</p>

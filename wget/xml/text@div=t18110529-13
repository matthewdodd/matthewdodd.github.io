The prisoner came to live with me on the 26th of April, she lived with me till the 8th of May, and between five and six o'clock we missed her; on our going up stairs we found a bureau had been broken open, a key was taken out of the bureau that opened a chest; we missed a ten pound note, a five pound note, and two ones, and two tablecloths; the prisoner left me on Wednesday night. On Saturday morning I met her in Ratcliffe Highway. I took her and had her searched. I found nothing upon her, I brought her to the Compter, there the officer searched her. He found a one pound note in the toe of her shoe, and a small broach in her pocket, which I knew to be mine; the officer found the duplicate of a tablecloth, not marked. I believe it to be mine, I have not sworn to it.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to me at the Compter. I found this one pound note in the toe of her shoe, and this broach in her pocket, and the duplicate of a tablecloth. I said, you made haste in spending the eighteen or twenty pounds; no, she said, there was only one single ten pound note in the drawer, and that she fetched her things out of pawn with it, and this one pound note is what she got in change for the ten pound note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My husband was serving his Majesty on board a man-of-war. He came home about three months back; I received thirty-one pounds, and my having a child to maintain; I went to service in order to save as much of the money as I could untill my husband came home, and during the time I was in service my mistress employed me to watch the workmen, suspecting that the platsterers robbed the house; and my master I met, he charged me with having robbed him of a ten pound note, and a five pound note; during the time I was in their service I returned a note to my mistress that dropped out of her pocket. I always acted with the strictest honesty and integrity.</p>

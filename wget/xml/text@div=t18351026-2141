I missed two pair of boots about two o'clock, they had hung about three feet inside the shop—I went to the station-house, and about six o'clock they were brought to our house, and we identified the boots and shoes—they had hung at our door—I had seen them safe about twelve o'clock—they have all been marked, and there are some remains of the marks now, but an attempt has been made to obliterate them—they are all quite new—I had not seen either of the prisoners at my shop, to my knowledge.</p>

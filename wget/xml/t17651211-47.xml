            . I am wife to the prosecutor. On the 14th of November, about one o'clock, I put three guineas and a shilling into a drawer on the ground floor, and left the key in the drawer; there were 20 s. in halfpence and a guinea in the drawer, besides what were taken out: the halfpence were in a bag by themselves, and four guineas and a shilling were in a tin cup: the three guineas and a shilling were missed about 3 o'clock. I was absent when it was taken: the other prisoner was in the yard waiting for the pots; he is a pot-boy at an ale house.</p>
               <p>Abbot's defence.</p>
               <p>I never had no more money than what I brought out of the country with me. My father gave me four guineas, and I gave it to this lad to keep for me, fearing I should have my pocket picked.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What three guineas did Abbot speak of, that he put into the prisoner's hand?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Abbot declared he was the person that took the three guineas and a shilling out of the drawer.</p>

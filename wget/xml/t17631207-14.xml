            , my partner, to endeavour to find out who was the thief. Accordingly, on Monday, the 7th of November, we sat up in the shop, secreted in two separate places, when all the rest of the family was retired to bed; about half an hour after 11 o'clock, we saw the prisoner come into the shop, and heard her go to the desk. I saw her pass by me again, out of the shop, with something in her hands, holding them both together; I supposed them to be the two boxes that contained the money; in about five minutes I saw her return again in the same manner. I heard her go to the desk again, and then return out of the shop; as soon as she was gone, we counted the money; my partner and I had before counted it, and marked 10 s. of it; there was to the value of two guineas in one box; one guinea, one half-guinea, and 10 s. and 6 d. and 2 s. in another, in silver and halfpence; out of those two boxes there were missing, 5 s. and 8 d. We missed out of the box, where the guinea was, 5 s, and 8 d. in half pence out of the other; then we locked the desk, and, in the morning, had a search warrant, and found 3 s. that were marked, upon her.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you mark the money?</p>
               <p>Konmacker. We filed a little notch on the edge, in the milling, towards the head, on them. (The money produced, and inspected by the jury.) At first, she said, she had nothing by her but her own money.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been servant in the family?</p>
               <p>Konmacker. She had been servant there between nine and ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you use to lock that desk?</p>
               <p>Konmacker. Very seldom.</p>

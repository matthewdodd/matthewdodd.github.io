               <p>Q. Was he not at Bow-street when Mrs. Moore had an opportunity of seeing him? - Not that I know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Mrs. Moore. You went from the magistrate to the house where the search was made, for the papers of this young woman? - I did.</p>

            . Did not you threaten me, and force me to marry you? Did not you say that you would make away with yourself? Yes, my dear, you did, you are my husband.</p>
               <p>Slark. I did not do any such thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You want that lady with the five thousand pounds fortune, that is all you want. I never have been married but once, and that was at Paris, with Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170053"></xptr>Wettenhall; I was never married to Edkins. The reason that that woman appears here, is in consequence of an advertisement of so much reward if any body of the name of Wilson would appear. I would be glad to know her character, and how much money she had of Mr. Slark for doing this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Mrs. Wilson. Pray how much money have you had of Mr. Slark? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. How much are you to have? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray are you married yourself? - I am.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never knew Mr. Slark had any thing, and I never asked him for a farthing of any thing, so help me God. And he worried me every day of my life to marry him; I knew he was nothing but an apprentice to his father,and therefore I had no fortune, and I could not marry him for the sake of fortune; and he knew what I was; it was no secret to him.</p>

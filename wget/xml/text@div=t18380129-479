                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Robert Fisher, who lives at No. 15, York-place, Kentish-town. On Saturday, the 23rd of December, about ten minutes or a quarter past eight o'clock in the</p>

               <p>morning, the prisoner came to the house, and asked to see Mr. Fisher—I said it was not the time Mr. Fisher would be about, and he could not see him for two hours—he said he had no where that he could go to, near, and asked if I would allow him to sit down in the hall—I said, "You had better go and call again"—he said, "I shall be obliged to you to let me sit down in the hall," and at last I did—in about ten minutes he called out at the bottom of the stairs, and said, "I do not think I shall stay, I will call again at nine o'clock," and in two or three minutes I heard the door go—I did not think it necessary to let him out, as I knew him—(I had lived with him for three months, about three years ago, with Mr. Fisher)—Mr. Fisher came home about five o'clock in the evening, and the cloak was then missing—Mr. Fisher said, "William must have taken it, if he has been here"—the cloak is here—Mr. Fisher got it from Mr. Fulles, the pawnbroker.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Turner, a pawnbroker, at No.38, Waterloo-road. This cloak was pawned at our shop by the witness Vernon, in the name of Cooper, for two guineas, on the 23rd of Decem<lb></lb>ber, in the morning, I believe.</p>

I should be sorry if I did—I do not live in a house of that sort—the prisoner came to me and called me up out of my bed—I have known him three years in a respectable situation—he asked me to be so kind as to do him a favour—he said, "Will you go and pawn this cloak, you being known in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood?" and I certainly did pawn it at Mr. Turner's.</p>

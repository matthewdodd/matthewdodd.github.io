                  </hi> I live at 13, Stamford Villas, in the parish of Fulham. On Friday night, 9th Feb., I went to bed about ten o'clock—between two and three I was awoke by my wife, who heard footsteps on the stairs—I immediately jumped out of bed, and asked who was there, but I received no answer—I then opened my bed-room door, and saw a man standing on the landing, very near the bed-room door—I said, "What do you want?"—he answered, "Here he is, "or" Here is the dog"—he had a lantern in his right hand—I immediately received a blow on the top of the head, which broke a vein, and it immediately bled very considerably, and caused a violent bruise—I did not see what I was struck with—I was not able to attend at the police-court for a fortnight in consequence of the injury—I did not distinctly see who it was that struck me, I was so alarmed, and the blood was flowing from my head, I retreated into my bed-room as quick as I could, fearful the man might follow me—my wife got out of bed, and assisted me to close the door—she then threw up the window and called the police, and I sprung a rattle</p>

                  </hi> I am servant to Mr. Waller. I was the last up on Friday night, 9th Feb.—before I went to bed I particularly examined all the windows and doors, and they were perfectly secure—there was no whole in the wall—I was awoke shortly before three o'clock by a bell ringing, and I heard a scuffling or confused noise on the stairs—I do not think there was more than one person going down stairs, but I cannot say—I looked out at the window, and saw a man running down the garden as fast as he could, with a lantern in his hand, apparently making his escape—when I first saw him, he was about eight or ten yards from the house—he leaped over the wall, at the bottom of the garden, and I lost sight of him—from what I saw of him I believe it to be Cullum—I heard other men's voices, but only saw him—I should say there were two or three men; that was after I saw the man get over the wall—I afterwards examined the premises, and missed two silver spoons, which I had seen just before I went to bed—next morning I received a piece of a knife from Snell, which I wrapped in a piece of paper, and afterwards gave it back to him the same day.</p>

I went to the house on Saturday morning, about five o'clock, and found a square of glass broken in the water<lb></lb>closet window, and the window open—I found marks of a crow-bar, and of a knife, on the inside of the water-closet door—I found a square of glass broken in the kitchen-window, and several marks of a crow-bar near the hinges on the shutter—the hinges were nearly forced off—I next examined a small place used for cleaning knives and shoes; a square of glass was broken in the window, and the window was open; no entry had been made that way—I found the tool-house door forced off the hinges, and set on one side—there was then a hole through the brick-work into the kitchen, large enough to admit a man—I picked up this crow-bar—the kitchen-drawers had been disturbed, and some linen removed—I went up and saw Mr. Waller in bed; he had a wound on his head—a quantity of blood was on his shirt, and in different parts of the room—I saw footmarks on the mould—next day I went to the Pimlico-station and saw the prisoners—I took off these shoes from Cullum and Pike (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and compared them with the footmarks, by making an impression at the side of the marks—they corresponded in every respect—these are Cullum's shoes—the right-foot is worn, and has given way to the sole—there is only half a tip on the heel—on the left here are a few nails on the toe, which left an impression; the toe was the deepest part—there is nothing peculiar about Pike's shoes—the impression was not distinct enough to show this impression on the side—I had noticed on the Saturday that one footmark had only half a heel—I received this knife from sergeant Matthews, in Digby's presence, and this point of a knife from Snell on Saturday afternoon; they fit one another exactly.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 20, Cadogan-place, Chelses. On the afternoon of Sunday, 11th Feb., I picked up this lantern in my garden, which is separated from No. 19, by a wall about six feet high—I examined it, laid it down again on the garden chair, and left it there—I beard on the Tuesday that the prisoners were taken, and told the servant to fetch the lan<lb></lb>tern in—she did so, and gave it to the policeman—I can undertake to swear it is the same lantern—I examined it carefully.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cullum's Defence.</hi> There was a chisel found, the policeman says he found it; and before the Magistrate a cook from 19, Cadogan-place came forward and said that she found it; and as to the footmarks, the policemen say they took the shoes from us on the Sunday afternoon, instead of that it was Sun<lb></lb>day morning about eight or nine o'clock, and it was not found out for a fort<lb></lb>night after that Digby's shoes fitted as well as ours; there is nothing particular in my shoes more than there would be in another persona buying a pair at the same shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Pike's Defence.</hi> On the Saturday night, as I was going home I was taken short, and went down this Mews, which is not connected with any gardens; the policeman came down and prevented me; I did not think I was obliged to give him my proper name and address, as I did not want any bother about it; next morning I was in bed, and the policeman came and took me; I asked what it was for, and they said for putting Cullum over the wall; I denied the charge, but I did not deny having been that way; that ia a falsehood of the policeman's; they asked me what time 1 was at home on the Friday night, and I said half-past twelve, which I was; as to my shoe resembling the marks, there are plenty of shoes the same size; it is false what the police<lb></lb>man says about meeting me with these two men at half-past one on the Friday night; I was in bed at half-past twelve, as my landlady, and the young woman I lived with can prove; I had no cap on that night; I wore a hat; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> do not associate with these men; I certainly know them, by having lived about Knightsbridge a good many years, and I own that Cullum lives</p>

                  </hi> I live at 2, Pine Apple-court—the prisoner Pike lived with me—he was taken out of bed from me on Sunday morning—he had come home on the Saturday night about half-past twelve—he had come home early all the week—on the Friday night we both went home together about half-past twelve—he did not go out again.</p>

This was on the morning of the 6th of February; I was awakened by a noise in the room adjoining the one I sleep in; the door between the two rooms was shut. It was a nose like the moving chairs, and a bustle of that kind in the room, after which, I heard my bed room door opened; an being perfectly awake, I thought it was my servant cleaning the adjoining-room; it was dark. There is a venetian blind hanging at the window, which perfectly darkens the room. Several times I have observed that there is hardly any light come into the room, until I get up. At about a quarter of an hour after I heard this noise, I heard St. James's Church clock strike the quarters: not being then alarmed, I tried to go to sleep; but could not. I layed until the clock struck seven; my lodgings were so near St. James's Church, that I always hear the Chimes of the Church. I was then alarmed, and thought it was a robbery, because the noise was not continued; I then jumped out of bed. It was near when the quarter struck that the noise ceased. I jumped out of bed, and thought to myself, if the door be open, I have been robbed; it was nearly dark; it was so dark that I was obliged to feel my way across the room; I opened the window shutters, and feeling on the table, where I expected to find my writing-case, I perceived it was gone. I went to the other end of the room, and in a chair, I found flint and steel, and about three or four matches on a table close by. There were sparks of the fint on the chair, as if it had been much used, and one match was half consumed. There was a tea chest standing under the window, and there was the appearance of a candle having been stuck against it, and the tea chest appeared burnt; my silver snuff box was taken from the chimney piece; I missed a gold seal, which had also been on the chimney piece; on a chair had been a blue great coat, which was gone likewise. The contents of the writing-desk were, nine french gold coins, called Napoleons, thirteen ten-pound Country bank bills; all but one belonged to the Blandford bank, the whole twelve were payable at Sir

In consequence of this, I rang the bell; the window sash was open; that sash was shut the night before, I presume. I went into my room, and rang the bed-room bell; I rang it no more, conceiving the noise might disturb the <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181602140007"></xptr>family. I went to bed again, and tried to sleep. When I got up, I went to Sir James Esdale's; I had privately marked the notes, and I gave them notice to stop them; I told them what the private mark was; it was such as would enable me to speak to the notes should I see them. I received a note from Sir James Esdaile's, and I went and got an officer. An officer of the name of Branscombe, produced a gold seal to me, which I knew to be mine.</p>

On his presenting the note, we sent him out. That person came back again; he tendered the note to the prisoner at the bar; he came back with the prisoner, and one of the partners of our house sent for a City officer.

            . I am a silversmith, and jeweller. On the morning of the 16th of February, the prisoner came to my shop; by his desire, I shewed him several watches, and he selected one; he then wished to look at a gold watch-key; when he had selected one, he asked me to change a ten-pound note, and I immediately called my young man, and told him to get change; during the time the young man was gone, the prisoner left the shop; he waited some time, and then he said, he would go to the Bull inn, Whitechapel. He did not return. We saw him on the opposite side of the way, standing behind a coach, and upon that, my young man took him, I did not go. I should not know the note again; I am sure that the note which I received from the hand of the prisoner, I gave to my shopman to get changed; I am confident it was for ten-pound; my shopman is not here. I know it was a Country bank note; I told my shopman to take it to Sir James Esdaile; because I was suspicious; I live in Aldgate; I had rather a suspicion. I observed it was payable at Sir James Esdaile's, and that was what I sent him there for.</p>

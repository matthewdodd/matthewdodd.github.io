The next day there were two more threepenny loaves missing; on the Friday we missed one more, and on Saturday morning one more. My son told me in the afternoon when I came home, he saw the prisoner putting two loaves in the place where he had seen one before, while the other servants were at dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner been your servant?</p>
               <p>Hore. About five weeks. I went down into the cellar, and in the same place found a twopenny loaf, and in the prisoner's coat was another twopenny loaf, one half in one pocket, and the other in the other; I acquainted a friend that is here to give evidence with it, and desired him to be in the bakehouse to see that he took away the other loaf; he was planted there; the prisoner went out with bread in the afternoon, with the two half loaves in his pocket.</p>

            . The prosecutor told me he was defrauded of bread by his servant. I went on the Saturday to see if I could detect the person that did it, at Mr. Hore's desire: I got into a proper place; after I had taken the loaf in my hand, and placed it the same as before, Mr. Hore had sent the prisoner for some yeast while I secreted myself; when he came in, he came to the place where the loaf was; I was close to it; he took the loaf and went up stairs, and set out to go home. Mr. Hore asked me if he had got the loaf; I said, yes; he called him, and found the loaf in his pocket. I believe the prisoner split it in the cellar; it was pulled in two pieces.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>On Saturday nights we take no supper, we commonly take a piece of bread in our pockets; I took a piece of a twopenny loaf in my pocket, and was going to supper with it.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Do you allow your men to take bread out in in this manner on Saturday nights?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is no such thing allowed at my house.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Charles Green. I have known the prisoner three years; he always had a very good character. I have been a baker: it is always allowed to take a piece of bread, and go out in an afternoon to get a pot of beer to enjoy themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. What, so much as a twopenny loaf?</p>
               <p>Green. No, not so much as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a perquisite in your trade that a journeyman shall take a whole twopenny loaf, and split it in halves, and go off with it?</p>
               <p>Green. The prisoner now has 40 l. a year coming in.</p>
               <p>Q. What countryman are you?</p>
               <p>Green. I am a Scotchman, so is he.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been out of the country?</p>
               <p>Green. Not nine years.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live at Islington; I have known him several years.</p>
               <p>Q. What countryman are you?</p>
               <p>Anderson. I am his countryman; I never knew anything to his dishonesty in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a master baker?</p>
               <p>Anderson. I am; and was he discharged, I would take him immediately to my service.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you allow your servants to take bread at a twopenny loaf at a time, in the manner here charged on the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Anderson. I never knew it to be found fault with in my life, to take what they please of bread, on a Saturday night when they don't sup at home; they always may go to the cupboard and take cheese, cold meat, and what they please. I never was denied it by no master when I was a journeyman.</p>
               <p>Q. What, was your practice to take twopenny loaves?</p>
               <p>Anderson. Sometimes one half of a twopenny loaf.</p>
               <p>Q. What, and secrete it, and take it out privately?</p>
               <p>Anderson. I used to take it before my master's face; that I never deny my servants now.</p>

               <p>Anderson. No; if they took it before my face, I should not find fault with it. </p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What wages did you give the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I gave him seven shillings a week, and his board and lodging.</p>

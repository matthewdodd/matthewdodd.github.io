               <p>I am a pawnbroker, in Gracechurch-street; I produce a watch which the prisoner at the bar brought on Wednesday August the 14th, between twelve and one o'clock at noon; I had never seen the prisoner before; I am sure he is the man; he was with me a quarter of an hour; when he brought me the watch I asked him what he wanted to do with it? he said, to sell it; I then asked him what he asked for it? he said, five pounds; I asked him whose property it was? he said it was his own; I then enquired where he got it; he said that his uncle gave it him, or left it him, I don't know which; but that he was going abroad and should have no use for it, and therefore he would sell it; I told him I did not believe it was his own property, and should stop it and him; I called a constable and charged him with him, and took him before the Lord Mayor; he persisted in the same story; I have the watch here; it is a watch inside case gold and outside case base metal; I was at Windsor the week before, and I went into the watch maker's house that had the watch to repair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make observation enough of the watch to know it again? - I did, immediately as I saw it I said it was the watch I saw before at Windsor.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see it at Windsor? - I went in to ask the widow how she did, and as the watch was hanging I took the watch out of the window, and opened it and looked at it, it was at a person's whose name is Wynn, she is here; this was the week before.</p>
               <p>Q. What is there remarkable about this watch that you knew it again? - I knew it by the outside case, and I knew the maker's name.</p>

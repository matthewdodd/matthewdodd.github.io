                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. James Towers, of Holborn-hill, a boot and shoe-maker. On the 14th of Nov. Fox came to our ware-house—he wanted to have 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of boots and shoes—I asked for a refe<lb></lb>rence—he referred to Nash, of Limekiln-hill, Limehouse, a grocer and ship<lb></lb>chandler—I went there, and did not find him at home—Fox gave me another reference to Mr. Wilmot, Gray's-buildings, Kingsland-road—I went there—an elderly woman opened the door—I asked if Mr. Wilmot was there—she said her son was not at home—it was a nice private house, rather large—she asked me in—I stepped into the parlour, and found it nicely furnished—no<lb></lb>thing more was said about Wilmot then, but Fox brought him afterwards to the warehouse to accept a bill—I asked the old lady about Fox—she made a statement to me, in consequence of which I gave credit to Fox—he had boots, shoes, and clogs to the amount of 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he paid three times 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., once 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and once 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he gave me two bills, one drawn by Nash, on Fox, and one drawn on Wilmot and Fox, and accepted by each of them—I took the goods to the Horn public-house, except once, when I took them to a coffee-shop, in St. John's-square—I went to the shop at Walthamstow, but I could not get in—I knocked four different times—I believe there is no bell to the place—I made inquiries after Nash and Wilmot, at the places to which Fox referred—they were both gone away—the houses were empty—I cannot say when they disappeared—I went on the Sunday before Christmas, to Nash and Wil<lb></lb>mot.</p>

In Nov. last Fox came to our shop, he stated he had just opened a shop at Walthamstow, and he wished to know whether I would give him credit—he said he would pay 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down, and give security for the remainder—I asked whom he proposed as security—he referred me to a man named Nash—I told him to call the next day—I went there, and found Nash was not at home—I staid there an hour—there were what appeared to be loaves of sugar there, but I examined them, and found they were chalk—I went to the window, and scraped some blue packages, and found them to be wood—there was some coffee there, and six or eight of those apparently loaves of sugar—there was a bag of rice at the door—I did not put my hand into that—I had known Hammell before—I did not see him at all on this occa<lb></lb>sion.</p>

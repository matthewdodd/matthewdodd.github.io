On Wednesday night 16th Oct., shortly after eleven o'clock, I was with Garforth in Walcot-place, a short distance past the Ship, and met the prisoners together—I first saw them when they were ten feet in front of me—they came on towards me, and passed me—I had known them both upwards of twelvemonths—there was a light where I first saw them—I had a perfect view of them which caused me to look round, and I saw something bulky under Smith's coat on the right side—Hardy was on his left, they were in company and speaking—it was about twenty or twenty-five yards from Ship-lane—I have seen and examined this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with the place, it is correct—I called the attention of Garforth to them, we turned and followed them—they had then got to the corner of Ship-lane, and we lost sight of them, and when we got in sight of them again they were running in the centre of Ship-lane as hard as they could—there are two lights at the corner of Ship-lane—they could not have turned down any other turning, there is none—we pursued them from Ship-lane down St. Mary-square, and they separated here (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>)—Smith took the direction of Bird-street, and Hardy went across Lambeth-square into Walcot-square, which leads again into Bird-street—I ran after</p>

               <p>Hardy through St. Mary's-square, where he ran nearly close to the garden—there is an iron railing separating the square from the garden—when he was opposite the garden I saw him put his right arm, which was next the rail<lb></lb>ing, up towards the railing near the gate—I was twenty or thirty yards from him, and continued to pursue him, calling, "Stop thief!"—he ran into Walcot-square, where I came up to him and found him in Edgar's custody, and Taylor came up at the same moment—I have not the slightest doubt he was the same person I had first seen and pursued—I directed them to take charge of him—I went round Bird-street, and found Smith in Garforth's custody—he had hold of him with his left hand, and had some clothes in his right—I took Smith to where I had left Hardy, and took them to the station—I found two coats on Smith over his own, and in his coat-pocket a teles<lb></lb>cope, a black silk waistcoat, and in his trowsers-pocket a blue silk hand<lb></lb>kerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the inspector on duty asked Hardy his address, and he gave 5, Martyn-street, Friar-street, Blackfriars-road—I know that he lived at 63, Webber-street, which is five or six minutes walk from the address he gave—about one o'clock the same morning I went to Webber-street, examined the front parlour where I had frequently seen Hardy, and in a drawer there I found these two pair of pliers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have seen such in the possession of house-breakers—they are used for opening locks from the outside without noise—if a key is left inside in the lock, and the door closed, by inserting one of these in the key hole, and taking hold of the protruding part yon can turn the key—I also found six keys (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), two of which have been partly filed—here is another key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with a black composition on one side of it, which by turning it in a door would take an impression of the wards of the lock, and so enable another key to be made or part of this one filed off so as to make it fit—Mrs. Higgins's house is in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth.</p>

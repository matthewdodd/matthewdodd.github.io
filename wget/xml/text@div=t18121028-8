            . I am an apprentice to James Tomlin. I was ordered by Mr. Hatfield to watch. I concealed myself in the top room of the private house; they could not see me, - I could see them. On the 12th of September, about nine o'clock at night, I saw

             and another man go up to the warehouse. There was a ladder standing in the yard, Palmer took it and put it up to the window. I saw him go up; I heard the window open, and saw him get in. As soon as he got in, I came down stairs; I stood between the house-door and the street-door, waiting for Palmer. While I was waiting there,

               <p>Q. Unlocked what door - A. The street-door. I told him to walk out that I had caught him. He made excuse, that he went to get drink. I told him to wait until Mr. Hatfield came, and he would settle it. He then said he would not stay any longer, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure he is the man - A. Yes; I ran after him and brought him back. Mr. Hatfield came up and took him to the watch-house. Then Kinnersley, the officer, came, and we searched the premises for Palmer. After we had searched for some time, we found Palmer in the dung-hole; he was sitting upon the bag of tobacco. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>COURT. You say you saw Palmer and another man? who was that other man - A. I believe it to be Mc Pherson. No other man could get in the premises without him letting him in.</p>
               <p>Q. No other man could get in the premises without Mc Pherson letting him in - A. No other man could get in the premises without Mc Pherson letting him in.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find a third person there, did you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Palmer was a servant, of course he had access to the premises - A. Not after the watchman came, without the watchman letting him in.</p>
               <p>Q. At first you said Palmer and another man; you afterwards said that it was Mc Pherson - A. When I said Palmer and another man, I meant Mc Pherson. I knew Mc Pherson by his long coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath, did you mean it was Mc Pherson - A. I did mean Mc Pherson, he opened the door by a key.</p>
               <p>Q. He had the key by the authority of those that employed him - A. Yes. When I took Mc Pherson, he said he had been for some beer. I overtook him by the corner of Swan-street; he was running as fast as he could.</p>

            . I am an officer. From in formation that there were thieves in Mr. Faddy's warehouse, I went into the premises; we saw Palmer sitting on the tobacco bag. Palmer started up. Good God, Mr. Hatfield said, you are the last man that I suspected would have robbed me; who is concerned with you? I Palmer replied, there is nobody with me but Mc Pherson the watchman. We went to Mc Pherson's lodgings, we found 2 parcels of tobacco, and in Mc Pherson's box we found 3 bags that had been filled with tobacco. From there we went to Palmer's house, there we found 6 lb. weight of tobacco, and 7 bags with tobacco in them. Mc Pherson was taken to the watch-house by Forrester. Palmer told us where he lodged himself. I produce 7 bags found at Palmer's, and this 6 lb. weight of tobacco was found under Palmer's bed.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Hatfield. Are these bags yours - A. Yes, I believe them to be my own property, and the tobacco I believe to be mine.</p>
               <p>Palmer's Defence. On Saturday I left work, about 7 o'clock. I had several pints of beer, and going by the dwelling-house where this watchman was, he asked me to have a drop of beer; he said come in, I went in the back yard to ease myself, and when I was going back I saw Mr. Friend. I thought he would be angry, seeing me on the premises. I went into the dung-hole to hide myself.</p>

             sworn. - I was standing behind Mr. Prater's counter about nine in the evening; I saw a small man come in with a light coloured coat on, and take the linen from the counter; he carried it away; I got over the counter, and ran after the man; I saw him drop the piece of cloth; I brought the cloth back, and the officer brought the prisoner back to Mr. Prater's; I did not see him apprehended.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you take another person as the prisoner? - A. I took Hanson, who is an officer, and brought him back.</p>
               <p>- HANSON sworn. - I am assistant to the Police, in Hatton-garden: On Wednesday, the 13th of March, I heard the cry of stop thief; I directly followed the prisoner; I saw the prisoner throw this piece of cloth from him into the kennel; I picked up the cloth; I went back with him, and the prisoner was brought back by another person, who is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Clarke). Can you speak with certainty to the prisoner being the man that you saw take it out of the shop? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Hanson). Are you positive that the prisoner is the man that you saw throw it away? - A. I am positively sure of it.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Clarke). Had you any suspicion of Hanson being the thief? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the dress of the prisoner correspond with the dress of the man that you saw go out of the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Father. She is a poor Girl, and sometimes troubled with the Falling-Sickness. I left a Bottle of Bitters in the Window, and she took a Draught, and I suppose made herself out of Order; she is foolish between whiles; she had no Occasion to steal them, for she had Nine-pence half-penny in her Pocket, and she carried them openly in the Street, which shows she did not know what she did: She is all the Children I have out of Fifteen, God bless you use her as well as you can. If she is released, I'll take care to send her far enough from London, if she has got into ill Company.</p>

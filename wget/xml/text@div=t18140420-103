            . I live in Bethnal-green. I had the key of Mr. Gogney's house, which was to let, to shew the house to the people that came look after it. On the 14th of March, about three in the afternoon, the prisoners both came together; they desired to look at the house. I took the key, and shewed them the house, and while they were looking at the apartment they were discoursing together. The woman called the man William; I supposed him to be her husband by the manner of them. The woman asked the rent; I told her fourteen guineas. She asked where the landlord lived; I told her; they thanked me, and both went away. About half past six in the evening the woman returned, told me she had been to the landlord, and had taken the house; she said she should move in on to-morrow. She had the key and went away. In about ten minutes after, as I was sitting in my own room, I heard a noise in the house; it was as if some person was sweeping the chimney-piece. Thirteen or fourteen days elapsed; nobody came into the house. I got into the house at the window. In the front parlour I found two sashes taken out; in the back parlour a half sash was taken out, and the locks were taken off the two parlour doors and the first floor doors. I immediately went to the rent gatherer to know if any person had taken the house; he told me, no. On my return home I met the woman prisoner in Brick-lane; I said to her, where is the key of that house you took of me; she said, what house. I said, upon the Green. I told her if she did not produce the key of the house, and produce the things, I would charge an officer with her. She said, do not, for God's sake, charge an officer with me; come with me to my mother's; I will give you the key. I went with her, and then at her mother's she said the key was lost. She never gave me the key at all. She said the young man that was with her was only an acquaintance, a very honest young man.</p>

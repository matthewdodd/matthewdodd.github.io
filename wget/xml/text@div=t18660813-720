               <p>Street, City—on the 21st July, about eleven o'clock, I was in Cannon Street—Jones came up to me, but I did not understand what she said to me—I asked her the way to London Bridge—Thompson then came up and asked me something which I did not understand—he went off, but the woman held me by the arm, and said, "Come along"—she ran away, and I missed my purse, containing four half-sovereigns and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or so in silver—I followed with a policeman, but could not see them—I described them, and soon after<lb></lb>wards saw them in custody, and Thompson had my purse in his hand.</p>

                  </hi> (City Policeman 586). I saw the prosecutor go up to the prisoners with the officer, who laid hold of Jones, and the prosecutor laid hold of Thompson—I saw this purse in Thompson's hand—he tried to throw it away—I laid hold of the prosecutor's hand, and he gave me the purse—Thompson tried to drop it in the street.</p>

About eleven o'clock on the 21st July I was at the corner of King William Street, and the prosecutor came and informed me that he had been robbed—I saw the prisoners stand<lb></lb>ing together at the corner of St. Swithin's Lane—Jones had her skirt drawn up over her head, so as to conceal the whole of her body, except her face—the prosecutor identified them—I took her by the wrist and Thompson by the collar, and as I did so money dropped between them on the pavement—I drew them aside, to allow the gas to shine on the footway, and saw the other officer pick up two half-sovereigns—they both denied the robbery and all knowledge of each other—I took them to the station, and on Jones was found a pawn ticket for a shawl pledged in the name of A. Mellor, and this leather pocket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which is three pockets in one.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing the prisoner there any time - A. Several times; but particularly on the 23rd of August; I turned her out of the passage of the house, that passage goes to the court; a box stood in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her come in again - A. I do not recollect; it was the busy time of the day, I was so much engaged crying the nonsuits; I saw the woman going out of the passage, that is all the notice I took of her.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the box was in that passage - A. It always stood there. It stands there now for sheets and sundry necessaries. It happened that day not to be looked, only hasped.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness; I live in this court house with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any box in the passage of that house - A. There were three boxes always stood there, we usually put in these boxes our clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you keep these boxes locked - A. Generally. We have but four rooms, and therefore we keep the boxes there; no person has a right to go through that passage but those that come to us, and the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any cloak being in that box - A. I put the cloak in the box myself that morning; one was a tabbinett cloak, and the other was a black gauze. There was eighteen yards of lace on the tabbinett cloak, I paid six guineas and a half for it, I only wore it a few times. At six o'clock on the same day I went to the box for my cloak, I found they were both gone; I never saw the cloaks afterwards; I got a part of the lace from a person at Poplar.</p>

            . I lived at Poplar last summer, at that time Mrs. Owen lodged with me in a furnished room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see a cloak that she had - A. I was put to bed on the 11th of August; near a month after that, on a Sunday morning the prisoner said she owed me three weeks rent.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was that - A. It was three shillings and six-pence a week. She said she had a bit of lace to sell for half a crown; I said I would give two shillings; she said I must stop till she ripped it off a made cloak. I saw it ripped off. There is five yards and a half of lace of different patterns; she said she bought the cloak in Rosemary-lane to make her some black bonnets; I saw no other cloak whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she do with the cloak - A. I do not know; I fancy she made a bonnet for her child; I saw her rip it to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the five yards and a half of lace - A. I gave the lace to my mother on the next Monday; Mrs. Curtis has it in her possession.</p>
               <p>Prosecutors. I did not lose a mode cloak. This is my lace; I know it by my own work in the joining of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This cloak that I took the lace off I bought in Rosemary-lane; I sold the lace for two shillings to my landlady.</p>

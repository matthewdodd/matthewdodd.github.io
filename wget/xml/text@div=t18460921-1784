                  </hi>. I am a working bricklayer. On the 24th of Aug. I was at the Horns, in Whitechapel—Thomas Ellemore was sitting there drinking—he was going out of the room and caught his foot against some steps—the pri<lb></lb>soner was upon the steps doing carpenter's work—I cannot say whether Ellemore's foot caught the steps accidentally or purposely—it moved them—the prisoner drew his saw from where he was sawing a partition down, struck at Ellemore, and missed him—he then took a step downwards, struck him, and caught him on the cheek—it cut him in the side of his cheek, which bled—he was taken out directly by a policeman, to have it strapped up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer. I was at the Horns, and saw the prisoner working at the steps—Ellemore passed and kicked against them, which twisted them from under the prisoner's feet, and slung them round—the prisoner drew his saw from where he was sawing and struck at him—he again struck him, and cut his cheek—I went for a policeman—I cannot tell whether Ellemore did it intentionally or not—it turned the steps an inch and a half, or two inches—he could have seen the prisoner at work there—the prisoner was shook, no doubt.</p>

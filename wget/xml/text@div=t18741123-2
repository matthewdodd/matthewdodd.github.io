                  </hi>. I live at 96, High Street, Kensington, and am a builder—I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> in consequence of which I went to Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, to see a horse—I saw the prisoner and a stableman—I told the prisoner I had come to see the large horse—he said he had sold that one, but there was another one there that he thought would answer my purpose—he asked for what purpose I wanted it—I told him for a builder's brick cart—he told me that his name was Conolly, and he was in business with his father as an ice merchant at 9a, Irongate Wharf, Caledonian Road, and that he had been driving that horse in an ice cart all the summer, and in consequence of the weather getting colder and the ice trade falling off he no longer required it, that he had driven it with 27 or 28 cwt. of ice and would go at the rate of 7 or 8 miles an hour—I asked to have the horse brought out and he had it brought out<lb></lb>side—he said it would be impossible to run it on the stones as one shoe was off, but he would have that put on and I could send for the horse next morning and take it on trial for a week—I did not agree to purchase it—I was going to take it on trial and not pay for it, but he objected and said he must certainly have the money as I was a stranger; that he was perfectly respectable and that I need not be afraid of depositing the money with him.—I was induced chiefly to take the horse on account of the statement that he had been driving it all the summer with 26 or 27 cwt, and if it would</p>

               <p>do that it would do all that I required of it—I should have taken the horse on trial, but I should not have deposited the money if he had not said anything about his business as an ice merchant—he said I must pay the money as he did not know more of me than I knew of him—that was on the Saturday—I left 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Saturday night; I had no more money then, and for that he gave me this receipt in the name of Conolly—I objected to there being no stamp on the receipt—he said he could not get one as it was evening, but he would write it out with a proper stamp when I sent for the horse on the Monday—the receipt, Alfred Conolly, was written in my presence by the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Oct. 3, 1874. Received of Mr. Hussey the sum of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of bay mare according to agreement. Alfred E. Conolly.") On the Monday I sent my man round for the horse, and I sent a cheque for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the balance of the money—the man was three or four hours gone—when he came back with the horse, it had got the shoe on—I have had the cheque back since—it was cashed on the same day—the carman tried the horse in the cart in my presence—it would not go; it would not draw an empty cart—we had to put two chain horses on to him—we took the empty cart to where we were removing some trees and put a little earth in the cart, but he would not draw it at all—we had to put two horses on to pull him out—other people were present at the time—we put him away for the night, and next morning we tried him over again and we could not even get him out of the mews with an empty cart—I told the carman to take him out of the cart and take him back to Charlotte Mews and I would come there too, and on the way I called at Irongate Wharf to see if I could find Conolly—I made certain inquiries, but I was not able find him—I then went to Charlotte Mews and found the prisoner and the same stableman there—I said "Well, Mr. Conolly, I am obliged to bring the horse back"—he said "Why?"—I said "He won't suit me, he won't draw, and is no good to me; I must trouble you to give me the money back"—he said "I can't, I have not got the money"—I said "You will have to get it"—he said "Why?"—I said "The horse does not suit me, it won't do my work and I must trouble you to hand over the money"—he said he could only give me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was all he had in his pocket, and he would give me that—I said that would not do, he would have to find the whole 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I threatened to give him into custody, and he said it was no good, no policeman would take him as it was only a debt—I <hi rend="italic">sort</hi> my man for a policeman and when he came I said "I give this man, Mr. Conolly, into your custody"—he said "It is not Conolly, his name is King-well, I know him well"—the prisoner said would I give him a little time to see if he could get the money and his man went away and said he had scraped together 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., would I take that and he would pay the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at some future time—I would not take that and gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not prepared to treat this as a debt at any time—I <hi rend="italic">let</hi> the man go to try and get the money—I should have had nothing to complain of if he had returned the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know that the horse is now being driven and goes admirably well—my carman has been in my employment some years—it was an ordinary brick cart he was put into and an ordinary brick cart collar—I don't know much about horses—I never bought a cart horse before—I think I could tell you a place where you could get a good serviceable horse for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know whether I mentioned before the Magistrate or not that the constable said he knew the prisoner's name was Kingwell.

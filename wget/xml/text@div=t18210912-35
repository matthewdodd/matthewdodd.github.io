Blowes lived ten months with me; the other was employed occasionally. A few days before the Coronation I counted my stock of lamps, and had between eight and nine thousand; after the Coronation I had them counted, and found 891 deficient. I gave information at Bow-street. Davey said, that my man took the lamps out of my warehouse, and gave them to him, and he sold them to Anderson, who keeps a tin-shop. I brought Davey to the shop, and took Blowes down at his own house, at Westminster, he said, he hoped I would not hurt him, but he did take a quantity of lamps, two or three times, and gave them to Davey. I got a search-warrant, and found them at Anderson's.</p>

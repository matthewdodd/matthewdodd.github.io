                  </hi>. I am a coach-maker, of High-street, Clapham—I know the prisoner—I have had transactions with him, in cashing bills for him—on 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> September last, he brought me this bill for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">this was drawn by the prisoner, and accepted by J. Fowler, South-place, Norwood</hi>)—I discounted the bill, and gave the prisoner a cheque for the amount—I have made inquiries for Fowler, and cannot find him, or hear of him—the bill is endorsed by the prisoner—I had repeated communications with him after this, daily—I have forty of his bills—I charged him with forging this bill—he said his uncle did it, or his uncle brought him into it.</p>

             is in partnership with me. We bought this mare about a month before the 20th of March - it was our joint property; it was a dark bay mare, and blind.

I missed it about six o'clock on Thursday night, the 20th of March - I had seen it in the fields about three o'clock that afternoon. I received it on the Saturday, from Jenkins, by order of the Magistrate, and knew it to be ours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Was it blind with both eyes - A. Yes, and old, and not worth above 30 s., I should think, for any body to work with.</p>

            . On Thursday, the 20th of March, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at Hyde Park-corner alone - I was sweeping a crosssing; he came up to me, and asked if I could ride a horse; I said Yes - he said he would give me 18 d. to take a horse for him down to Fleet-market; he had none with him. I said I would; he left me, and returned in about half an hour - I saw him coming along; a man was with him leading a horse in the road, and another man dressed as a soldier. It was a dark brown horse, and I think was blind - he came up and asked me to lend him three half-pence to pay the turnpike, and he would give me a handkerchief as security for the money; I did so, and received the handkerchief. I saw them go through the turnpike - he gave the halfpence to the man who led the horse - all the three men came through with the horse; I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not particularly notice the horse - A. No; I cannot be positive to the colour, or whether it was blind; I think it was - the soldier was in his company. It was not dark.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Rhodes, of Sharp's-alley, Cow-cross; he is a horse slaughterer. The prisoner came to the yard on Thursday afternoon, the 20th of March, about five o'clock; another man was leading the horse, and a soldier with them - it was a dark brown mare, blind with both eyes, and very old. The prisoner asked if I would buy it, I said Yes; he asked 20 s. for it - I offered 14 s.; he said he had been bid 16 s. for it; I then agreed for 16 s.; I had not enough money about me, but gave him 10 s. in the yard, and went and borrowed 8 s. of Mr. Bagnell - then we all four went to the Castle public-house, in Cow-cross. I paid him the 6 s. there, had something to drink, and they left me; I never saw him before. The prosecutor came and claimed it. I delivered it to him and his partner at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it fit for any thing but slaughter - A. No; I gave the full value, and do not think it was fit for work - we should have killed it, if it had not been owned - very few words passed between us. He said he bought it in Smithfield-market.</p>

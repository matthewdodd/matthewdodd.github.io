             sworn. - I am porter to Mr. Lange, and was sent out with fifteen bear skins and some things in a bag; they were very heavy; I carried them near to Temple-bar; between that and Chancery-lane, when the cord got loose, the bear skins were coming out, and I threw them down; the prisoner and coachmen helped me to get up the bear skins, and the prisoner offered to carry the bag, because I was so heavily loaded; he carried it, and went on one side and I on the other; my eyesight being bad, I could not see which way he went; I carried the bear skins opposite to Somerset-house, and missed him with the bag; I searched after the prisoner, but could not find him; I did not see him again till I saw him at the Mansion-House; I can swear to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>- MOSES sworn. - I am a dealer in skins: On Friday last, about three o'clock, the prisoner came to my house, and told me he had got some skins to fell; he took out of the bag some white fox skins and wolves' tails; I asked him the price of the fox skins; he said, a shilling a-piece; I was quite surprized at their being so cheap, and asked where he got them; he told me he bought them in Fleet-lane; I said they were stolen, and I would stop him and them; I sent for a constable, and gave charge of him.</p>

             sworn. - (Produces the skins and tails.) I asked him where he got them; he said, he bought them in the Strand, near Fleet-street; I asked him to shew me the house; he said then, he bought them of a man for a guinea and a half in the street, and he could not find him out.(The property identified by Mr. Lange.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Friday last I was in Fleet-street, and met with the porter in distress with his load; I helped him as well as another man; he asked me to carry the bag to a place just by Somerset-house; I went, but did not know where to go, he got before me; I meant to overtake him, but there was an interruption by the coaches, and I lost him; I came back, and looked about Temple-bar; I could not find him; I went back again, I did not know what to do with the property; I went to my odging, my landlord would not take them in; I went and offered them for sale, being persuaded to do so, as I could not find the owner and not knowing the value of them.</p>

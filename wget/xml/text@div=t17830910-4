             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable belonging to St. James's, Clerkenwell; on the 1st of September, we received an information, that the prisoner at the bar, with two others that are to be tried on the London side, were at a house in <placeName id="t17830910-4-crimeloc24">Onslow-street</placeName>

               <p>Court. You are sure this man stood by the bed with a poker, and struck Seasons with that poker? - Certainly, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Was you present with Redgrave when this prisoner was taken? - I was at the house in Onslow-street, Safron-hill; when we entered the room, I observed the prisoner with two others; the prisoner at the bar immediately seized a poker, and with very bad words, said, that sooner than be taken they would lose their lives.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether the others had any thing in their hands? - I did.</p>
               <p>What had they? - One had a long shovel, and the other this clasp knife open, in his left hand; as soon as ever the affray began, I saw the prisoner strike Mr. Seasons over the head with a poker; we had each a cutlass.</p>
               <p>Were you wounded yourself? - No, I was not wounded, I was beat and bruised over the head and shoulders by the women; then we overpowered the prisoners and handcuffed them, and took them before a magistrate; I heard Redgrave call to the prisoner, whose name is Godby, though he goes by the name of

               <p>Do you recollect now, in particular, whether the prisoner said any thing? - All together spoke, one and all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I beg for mercy.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the indictment charges the prisoner with returning from transportation and being at large, it is therefore incumbent upon him, to shew to the Court and Jury, that he had some lawful, or reasonable cause for that purpose; now had this man been in a tempest at sea, and been obliged to come on shore, that would, I conceive, have been a reasonable and lawful excuse, in which case, he would have surrendered himself to a peace officer as soon as possible, but so far from any such colour, this man stood in opposition to the officers of Justice, armed himself, acted with violence, and said, he would rather die than be taken, so that that excludes any possible idea of a lawful cause of being at large.</p>

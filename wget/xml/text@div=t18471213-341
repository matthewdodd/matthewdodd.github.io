                  </hi> I am the daughter of the deceased Frances Shari<lb></lb>dan—she was a widow—my father was an officer in the army—my mother at the time of her death resided at 31, Mare-street, Hackney, and had done so about nine months—she occupied the first floor—my sister Frances Johnson, her little girl, my brother, and myself, lived there also—the front room was used as the sitting-room for all the family, and my brother also slept in that room—my mother, my sister, her little girl, and myself, all slept in the back room—my sister is married, and has been separated from her husband, and living with my mother for the last two years—my brother is a clerk in the Correspondent's-office in the Excise—he was appointed by Sir John Mortlock, who was the colonel of my father's regiment—my brother need to allow my mother 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. every six weeks, out of his annual salary—he always paid that to me, sometime at the Excise-office, and sometimes he has brought it to me in Broad-street—he always paid it on the day he received his salary—I used note to be with him when he received his salary—I learned from him that he insured his life on account of my mother—when he went into the</p>

               <p>Excise, in 1829, Sir John Mortlock wished him to insure his life, in case of his death, because both my brothers were in the Excise, and if they died my mother would be unprovided for—she had no allowance from the War-office, as my father was only a captain in the militia when he died—I heard my brother state that repeatedly—Sir John gave him the situation, on purpose to provide for my mother and sisters—when I last took the half-quarterly allowance my brother said he would not then allow my mother what he had done—he told me I should never receive it again—that was the last time but one—I was ill the last time—he has repeatedly said so, and there was generally a disturbance when he paid it—he had a great objection to pay what he allowed his poor mother—he said he regretted that he had undertaken the situation, to allow this to my mother so long; he wished Sir Joha had never given him the situation; he regretted it very much—he has told my mother so repeatedly—he was quarrelling with my mother during my illness—I heard them quarrelling when I was in bed in the next room—he was very violent and angry—I do not exactly remember what he said—up to 17th Oct. my mother was in her general state of health, except that she was feeble and infirm—I should say she was sixty-six or sixty-seven years old—I never heard her state her age—the day my mother was taken ill I, was in bed in the back room, and had leeches on my head at the time—my brother had been at home on the previous night, Saturday—he did not sleep in the house that night, he went out again—on the Sunday (17th Oct.) he came again, some-where in the middle of the day—my mother was then in the sitting-room with him—my sister was with me—the little girl was in my room the chief part of the day—my brother was in the front room, the sitting-room, all day from the time he came home—I was very ill; but, as far as I can recollect, he was in the sitting-room all day—I do not recollect anything being sent for—I did not see my mother till the evening—she was then very bad; I thought her dying when she came into my room—she had been in her usual health in the morning, and got up as usual, and went into the other room before my brother came in—in the evening she was led into the bed-room by my brother—it was about six or seven o'clock, I should think—she was then vomiting very much, retching violently, and what she brought up was very black—she seemed in a stupor and could scarcely stand; my sister was in the room with me at the time—she had been with me all day—the doctor wished her to remain with me because I was so very ill—I do not think she had left me for half an hour during the whole day—my brother did not say anything when he brought my mother in—he did not speak at all—he remained, perhaps, two or three minutes—I said to him, "Oh, dear, how ill mother is! what have you been doing to her," or "giving to her?"—I do not know the exact words I used—and I said, "Mother, how bad you are, what has Stuart been doing to you?" or "what have you been doing to her?" I said so to him—he made no reply, but went out of the room immediately—my mother remained in that state of stupor all the Sunday night, I believe—the sickness continued just the same, and the next day too—she had a violent bowel complaint as well as the retching—she made no complaint—I wished her to send for the doctor, and she said, "Never mind, dear, it will soon be all over"—I believe Mr. Ayre was the first medical man who saw my mother—I sent for him—the little girl went, I believe, I think the Monday evening, but I was very ill at the time, and hardly recollect—I know it was not on the Sunday—during her illness she very often had arrow-room given her—I did not attend to her at all—I might</p>

               <p>have given her a little previous to the doctor coming, but my sister attended to her the chief part of the time previous to her death—nobody else attended her—we had no one else in the house, and I was very ill, and could not attend to her—on the Sunday after, the 24th, I got out of bed and went into the next room, and asked my brother to come in, because I thought my mother was very ill—he had been at home the whole of the previous week, except going out occasionally during the day—he had a holiday, and was at home before mother was taken ill—I think he had been in to see my mother during the week—once I asked him to come in and see her, as she was very ill—at another time I called to him as he passed by to come in and see her, and he said, "Oh, no, I cannot stop, it is no use my coming in," and he went away—she was in the same bed with me from one Sunday to the other—I had kept my bed for about eight weeks before that—I was in another bed in the same room after she was very ill—my mother was not capable of speaking on the Sunday—I do not think the prisoner came in more than once during the week, and then only for a few minutes—my mother did not speak to him or he to her—she only looked at him—I do not think he spoke to her—he went out again directly—before he came in I said, "Stuart, mother is very ill, will not you come in and see her?"—I think my mother died on 29th or 30th Oct.—my mother never spoke to me in the prisoner's presence about her illness—two or three days after she was taken ill, I accused my brother of poisoning her—I do not recol<lb></lb>lect on which day that was—it was while she was in the bed with me—I got out of bed, went into the other room, and said, "Stuart, my mother is very ill, I think you have poisoned her"—I firmly believe the words I used were, "You have poisoned your mother, she was never so ill as this before"—he made no reply—my mother was ordered arrow-root and brandy—I had some arrow-root two or three days after my mother's death—it was some of that which she had had, it and was in our room—my sister gave it me—she was going to send my niece for some, and he said, "Fanny, you had better let her have some of that in the parlour cupboard"—I was very ill before, but after I had eaten the arrow-root my tongue was very much swollen, and my throat was very sore—I do not think my tongue was swollen or my throat sore that day before I took the arrow-root—no one else ate any—my sister was there and saw it given me—I think the little girl made it for me—Mr. Randall, who is the landlord of the house, was present about a fortnight before my mother was taken ill, when there was a quarrel between my mother and brother—Mr. Randall went into the front room—I was in the bed-room—my brother came into the bed-room and struck my mother on the temple—she was in bet with me—I do not know whether he kicked against the door or rushed into the room, but he came into the room, made use of very bad expressions, and struck my mother on the temple while she was in bed with me—I jumped out of bed and screamed "Murder!"—she was asleep when he came in—it was about ten or eleven o'clock at night, and she had been in bed since about eight—he struck her on the temple several times; I do not know why—it was not a quarrel, I should have said a disturbance—there was an uproar, because the people came up to prevent my mother being killed—my mother was in possession of the policy on my brother's life—she kept it in her drawer—my brother took possession of it either when she was dying or after she was dead—I think it was on the day she was dying, or the day after; I really cannot recollect which—the policy was locked up—the key was in my mother's pocket.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184712130103"></xptr>
               <p>and he said to me, "Kate, I want that policy of mine"—I cannot recollect whether my mother was dead or dying at that time—I cannot remember when it was—he took the key himself, took the policy and went out di<lb></lb>rectly—my mother had an allowance of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, which she received from Ireland at Christmas by the post—I recollect my brother writing a letter during my mother's illness—I think it was the day before her death, but I am not certain whether it was before or after her death—there was a printed form sent with a letter to Ireland, which stated that my mother was still alive—I made an observation to my brother about the letter he was writing, and he tore it up and began another—I asked him why he wished the money-order to be sent in the name of William Stuart Sheridan instead of Frances Sheridan—(I remember now my mother was then alive; that recalls it)—I had looked over him—I think he said that he did not think his mother would last long, and if he was to sign her name she would most likely not be living—he said he thought he might as well sign it in his name, because in all probability mother would not be alive when the money was payable—I said perhaps she might rally—he said, "How do you know that?"—I said Mr. Hacon had said so, that the complaint might take a change; and he said, "No, I do not think she will."</p>

               <p>before my mother was taken so bad—I have been before a Magistrate and punished for attempting to take my husband's life—it was through my brother turning me out repeatedly—I was charged with cutting and wounding my husband, but I was false sworn—I went out a week previous to my mother being taken so bad—I cannot recollect exactly the day of the week—I put on my bonnet and shawl—I did not go to Mr. Holmer's on that occasion, I am sure—I swear I did not—I went about to see for my husband.</p>

               <p>true that after having bought the brandy, one shilling was saved till the next day, and one shilling's worth of brandy was sent for, which I gave to my poor mother, and had some myself, and my sister, who was in bed, had the rest—my mother was ailing; but the first time she was taken so seriously bad was on Sunday morning—my sister sent out her half-crown on the same day for wine—on this night my brother came home—my sister had been previously almost killed by my brother, and she had had leeches on only on the Saturday night—he came in, and almost knocked the partition in, and frightened us all very much—if he had got into the room, I do not know what would have become of us—my poor sister was very much terrified that night, and sent for a little wine—that was after the five shillings had been taken from my child—we did not sent out for brandy every night from the time my mother was taken ill till she died, we did some part of the time, the doctor ordered it—I solemnly declare I did not take any drink while I was waiting on her—I take my oath I was not lying drunk on one of the chairs in the room in which my mother was dying, nor yet in the outer room—I was not drunk—I was not lying on a chair in either of the rooms the night my mother was dying—I know that on one occasion they told me I did come in, but I was so frantic they did not wish me to be in—I believe I did go in, although I had no knowledge of it—they would not let me remain in, as I was so frantic—I was not lying asleep on one of the chairs before my mother died, or before I went out, or at all that day—I was in attendance when the last offices were per<lb></lb>formed for my mother before she was put into her coffin—I do not know that my brother pawned his clothes for the purpose of raising money to purchase linen to wrap her in—the woman who performed the last offices for my mother did not find her in a filthy, dirty state, without a rag on her—she was not left so—the poor dear soul was washed all over, according to Doctor Hacon's orders, the day he gave her over, the day before she died—that was not altogether because she was in a filthy state—he was afraid of the disorder, that something had taken place, I don't know what they term it; but it was no such thing; it was not found to be the case—she did not die without linen on her, I am certain—my sister sent for some linen herself on the day before she was so bad, the day before she died, through the disorder she had—I believe she paid for it—she had two pounds sent her from a friend where she lived, who respected her—I do not know anything about my brother pawning his clothes to get linen—I do not know Mrs. Mills—I have only seen her once—I was not present at the time my mother died; my sis<lb></lb>ter was, and my little girl—I could not stop to see her last moments—I had gone through too much sorrow—that was the only reason I went out, as the Almighty is my Judge.</p>

                  </hi> I am surgeon, at Hackney—I was called in to see the deceased on Saturday, 23rd Oct.—she was lying on her right side, in a comotose state, with her legs drawn up towards her stomach, incapable of answering any questions, with feeble pulse, clammy skin, and dark colour about her mouth, and during the time I was there she had an involuntary motion—the symptoms were such as to make me suspect something was wrong—the bed-clothes were matted over with various coloured material which she had vomited—I suspected that an irritant poison had been taken, from the great variety of stains on the bed-clothes, implying that the vomiting had been different degrees of recent blood, arising from the state of the stomach—as it remains on the stomach it becomes darker, and such vomitings I had</p>

               <p>thick fluid, which had come from the stomach itself, the gullet, the intestines, and about 1/2lb. of liver—I could not form any idea what proportion of the liver that was, as I did not see this liver—I heard it was a large one—the weight of an ordinary liver is about 4lbs.—I applied tests to cach of these parts separately to detect poison, and I detected the presence of arsenic in the intestines, and also in the liver—I produce portions of the arsenic reproduced from the intestines and liver—the other portions have been submitted to an analysis to prove that they were arsenic—I did not weigh the quantity I got from the liver, but, in my opinion, there was about two grains in that portion of the liver which I had, and about four grains in the intestines—the contents of the stomach did not contain any poison—the quantity I found would be quite sufficient to cause death—there is not more than half a grain in the tubes I have produced—the quantity I found in the liver was so large as to induce me to believe that it had been administered in successive portions—arsenic is absorbed into the system, taken up by the blood—one of the functions of the liver is to arrest anything offensive in the stomach, which is passing through by means of the blood—the portion of the liver I had might be about one-tenth part of the whole, and it is but reason<lb></lb>able to infer that the whole liver contained a similar quantity, which would be twenty grains in the whole liver—that would be enough to kill five persons, or nearly so—if such a quantity had been administered at once, it would cause immediate vomiting, and it would be thrown from the stomach, and we should not then find that quantity in the liver—I believe it was given in successive does, and found its way quietly into the system—if it was taken all at once, and retained in the stomach, rapid death would be the con<lb></lb>sequence—I believe, from the circumstance of my finding arsenic in the be<lb></lb>ginning of the intestinal canal, that there had been a does very recently administered—I think the whole I found in the intestines had been recently administered—I did not weigh it, but I take it that about six grains was the quantity I detected in the intestines and liver together—I think four grains administered at once would produce death—I have been in Court during the examination of the medical gentlemen, and have heard that this was con<lb></lb>sidered a case of cholera—the medicines administered would have a tendency to retard the effects of arsenic—lime is an antidote, and opium would tend to stay the action of the poison to a certain extent—it would tend to stay the irri<lb></lb>tation that arsenic produces, and it might, in all probability, be passed through the system without any effect—carbonate of soda, I should say, would rather tend to make arsenic more soluble, and enable it to go into the system—if arsenic alone were thrown into a fire it would produce no immediate effect, but if wrapped up in a piece of paper, the flame would be bluish.</p>

                  </hi> I went to the lodgings of the deceased on Friday morning, at nine o'clock, after her death—I had not attended her during life—a person named Mills, Miss Sheridan, and the prisoner were there—I was in the front room about ten o'clock, when the prisoner threw two little papers doubled up into the fire—the little girl was there, but she went out at the door and could not see it—he took the papers out of his waistcoat pocket—they burnt pale blue and green, and I think there was a little of a dark red—I cannot be very particular—the papers were about the size of doctors' powders—I assisted in doing what was necessary to the dead body, but another woman, named Mills, was there before me—Mr. Holmer, of the Dolphin, fetched me—I stopped there Friday, Saturday, and Monday—I went home on Saturday night and Sunday—during those three days I heard the pri<lb></lb>soner's sister, Catherine, saying, "You villain, you have poisoned my dear mother"—he made no answer—he took it very quietly, and looked about as if he was silly—on one of those occasions I asked him if he had ever had any poison; he said, yes, he had, a good while ago—I asked him what it was for; he said he had it to smell to for his head, that it was morphine—one day after I had left the place, and before he was taken into custody, I met him in Newmarket-terrace—he knew me, and called me many d— —d old b— —s; he told me that if it had not been for me, if I had not been to Dr. Tidy, it would never have come out—I was frightened, and ran away; he ran after me, but.</p>

               <p>I ran down a court in to some house, and got away from him—I had gone to Mr. Randall on the Saturday night, and afterwards to Dr. Tidy—I saw him—it was after that that I saw the prisoner—I think I saw him on the Satur<lb></lb>day night before the Monday on which he was taken—the Coroner's Jury sat on the Wednesday after the death—I am not sure it was not the same night she was buried.</p>

                  </hi> I am a undertaker, at High-street, Shoreditch. On Saturday, 30th Oct., the prisoner came to me—he said he came from Hack<lb></lb>ney—he ordered a coffin, and gave directions for the funeral of a person at Hackney—I afterwards went to the house, to make preparations for the funeral—on the Monday I went to take the ground at the Beaumont cemetery—the prisoner accompanied me part of the way—as we were going, he pointed out Dr. Tidy to me on the opposite side of the way, and I went over to speak to him—after I had done so, I went towards Beaumont cemetery and missed the prisoner—I afterwards went back, and found him at home—I told him that it was desirable, under the strong imputation that was resting upon him, as he regarded his respectability of character, that he should have an inquest called; and I gave him likewise to understand that I would not consent to bury without there was—he apparently consented to that—that was my impression—I had three different interviews with him at the house at Hackney—on one of those occasions there were feelings of anger, and evidently feelings of drink, and the single sister accused him of having killed the mother—the sisters were evi<lb></lb>dently operated on by drink—she said, "You have murdered my mother by poison"—that was said on several occasions—once he made no reply—on another occasion he said, "Mr. Yarrow, you will not believe what my sister says, because she is drunk"—those were his words, as near as I can recollect—the unmarried sister had accused him on each occasion—she appeared to me either not sober or very ill.</p>

                  </hi> I am beadle of the parish of Hackney—in Consequence of what was told me I communicated to the Coroner the fact of the death of the deceased; and an inquest was held, Nov. 3rd, at Hackney, and adjourned six times—I attended at the prisoner's house, when the surgeons were there making the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—that was after the first meeting of the Coroner's jury—the prisoner was sitting in the front room with me at the time—he seemed very much excited and alarmed, and said he was very sorry it had happened, it was calculated to ruin him; and he also stated he hoped it would not get into the newspapers; if it did, I was to point out the reporters to him, and he would pay them anything not to put it in—he kept saying every now and then, "There are persons <hi rend="italic">testing</hi> my mother," and seemed very much excited—I had seen him two days before his mother died—he called on me, and told me the Rector wanted to speak to me—I went to the Rector, and I had a paper to get signed—I took the paper back on 1st Nov., and gave it to the nice—I saw him at his house on the Tuesday, when I went to make inquiries respecting the mother's death, and told him that there were reports in the neighbourhood that something unfair had been trans<lb></lb>acted respecting his mother, and I thought it was necessary to write to the Coroner—he seemed to make an objection to it, and the undertaker too—the prisoner followed me out of the door, and said, "I do not think there is any necessity for it," he wanted me to stop a little longer, and I would not—he followed me part of the way down stairs—he left the undertaker in the room—I said I should go—the undertaker wished me to stop while he went over to the register—I would not.</p>

               <p>I am the father of the child that was killed: it was eleven months old: it died the 20th of November. I was present three minutes after this wound was received, which was about nine o'clock at night of the 5th of November: the child was all of a gore of blood: the wound was on the right side of the back bone, and was about the size of half a crown: I fetched Mr. Ogle a surgeon to it: I took up these two lads (the prisoners). First I took up Foot; he said he had no concern at all in the matter; that Adams was the person. I then took up Adams, and he owned that he fired the pistol. There was no quarrel subsisting between me or my family and Adams or Foot, or any thing of that sort: said Foot he loaded the pistol, and Adams said he directed him where to fire it: Adams said he saw a woman but did not see a child at who saw the prisoner go by and heard Foot the door: a woman was at the next door say to Adams, not that door - that door.</p>

I believe the wound to be the occasion of its death, for the said child was very hearty before. There were two of them together when the pistol was fired off, but I cannot tell who they were, and they went away directly.

               <p>I am a surgeon; I came in to see the child at about ten o'clock, there was a large contused<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712030026"></xptr> wound above the hip, from the right side of the back bone; I examined it particularly, I found every thing so exceedingly tight, that I thought it would be extremely dangerous to attempt an extraction of any thing; I probed it, it was about two inches deep, and ran obliquely upwards towards the back. On the tenth, which was five days from the accident; I took out part of the wadding, which came away very easy.</p>
               <p>What was the wadding? - Paper. And on the thirteenth, Mr. Morris, my assistant, in the evening when he dressed it found some more wadding in the wound and took it out; there were three pieces; I examined the wadding very particularly, I found it to consist of nothing but paper, the discharge was exceeding large; the child sunk every day, and on the twentieth died.</p>
               <p>What do you think was the occasion of its death? - I apprehend, the consequences of the wound; there was not strength of constitution sufficient to counteract the discharge.</p>
               <p>You have no doubt about this wound being the occasion of the child's death? - I have no doubt about the consequence of the wound being his death; there was a very great discharge; the tender age of the infant was insufficient to counteract the consequence of the discharge.</p>

               <p>From what was extracted, was it a larger quantity of paper than is usual? - I cannot particularly say that: the paper is in court.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Do you look upon the wound to be a mortal wound of itself? - It is not what we term a mortal wound, it was a wound of the muscular flesh.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did the wound penetrate through the child's cloaths, or was the body naked? - It had on a blanket and a little light bed gown; the threads of the cloaths were taken out at times, it did not come out in pieces, but the threads of it; it was torn all to pieces.</p>

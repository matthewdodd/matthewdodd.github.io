                  </hi>. I live in Barge-yard. I am part owner of the ship <hi rend="italic">Canton</hi>, which was in the West India Dock—I have more than one other partner—I had the management of the ship, and put the prisoner on board of it three weeks ago as ship<lb></lb>keeper—there were stores on board, and he had the charge of everything. On the 8th of Nov. I went on board with a police<lb></lb>officer, and saw him compare this leather with some that was on board the ship—it corresponded exactly with the leather that was on board, which was the joint property of myself and my part<lb></lb>ners—this piece of canvas is the same sort as some that was on board, but I could not swear to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the West India Dock. On the night of the 7th of Nov. I stopped the prisoner as he was coming out of the Limehouse<lb></lb>basin gate—I asked him what he had got—he said he had got nothing—I took him into the box and searched him—I found this leather round his body under his shirt—I asked him how he came by it—he said he might as well tell the truth at once, he brought it from the ship—I asked him what ship, he said the <hi rend="italic">Canton</hi>, and he was ship<lb></lb>keeper of it—I asked him if any one else was on board—he said, "No one, I have the keys and charge of everything"—I found this canvas in the seat of his trowsers—I asked him how he came by that, and he would not answer—I went the next morning on board the ship, and saw the leather that this piece was cut from in the after<lb></lb>cabin.</p>

On the 17th of November, about a quarter-past seven o'clock in the morning, I went out, leaving my wife in the back room, and the door wide open; there are four rooms on the grounds floor - the windows were all shut down; I returned about a quarter-past eight, and found the door locked - I opened it with the key, and on entering, found the kitchen door shut, which had been left open - the blind of the kitchen window was drawn half way down; it was quite down when I left - my wife returned about nine o'clock; she came into the kitchen, and went into the dairy - we had breakfast directly, and I went into the cow-house; my wife went up to our bedroom after breakfast, and gave an alarm - I then went up, found the drawers pulled out, and things scattered about; I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which have not been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you go all ever the house before you went out at seven o'clock? A.I went into all the rooms up stairs; I was in the bed-room- I met my wife while I was out, and got the key from her; we might be half an hour at breakfast - I did not leave the street-door open when I came in; I do not recollect seeing any body in the street when I came home.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH WRIGHT. I left home at half-past seven o'clock; I locked the door, and pulled the blind down all the way - the door and windows were all safe; I returned at a quarter to nine - my husband was then at home; I had met him, and given him the key - I went up stairs after breakfast, and found a half-pint blue bason (which is not ours) by the wash-hand stand; I found the drawers out, every place rummaged, and all the things about the room, and missed the property stated, all of which I had left safe when I went out, and shut a great dog in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your husband went out first? A. Yes; he left me in the dairy - I believe the door was shut; I left a quarter of an hour after him - I fastened the door myself; I do not suppose the window had been opened, though the blind had been altered - it was half an hour before we discovered the robbery; I had let nobody into the house during that time - the basin I suppose had been brought, supposing we were at home; it was impossible for any body to have got in at the door before I left, without my seeing them, as the door of the place I was in was not shut; it joins the passage - the passage comes into it.</p>

            . I live about a minute's walk from Wright's house. On 19th of November I went out, about half past seven o'clock, to fetch some coffee; I did not go by Wright's, but the other way, into the King's-road - I met the prisoner and two others; I did not know him, but saw him again, with a bundle under his arm, a few minutes after I returned home - he passed my window, as I was throwing some water out; I first met them going towards Wright's, about three minutes walk from it - they had no bundle then; Wright's place has no thorough fare - after I had been in doors a few minutes, I saw two of them go by, the prisoner having a large bundle under his right arm - they were going towards King's-road, in a direction from Wright's house; this was about five minutes to eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you sure the prisoner is the man? A. Yes, quite; I did swear to another man at the office, who was discharged - he proved he was at another place at the time; I did not swear he had the bundle - he followed the prisoner up the ground; he had a man and a boy with him - the man I swore to was before him when I met them; whether he was with them the second time, I cannot say, but there was a man going round the corner; the bundle was in a handkerchief, and appeared to contain wearing apparel.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you notice the prisoner's walk? A. Yes - he was lame in his right leg.</p>

            . I am the wife of Samuel Cotton, of Robert-street - I live forty or fifty yards from Wright. On the 19th of November, about half-past seven o'clock, I went down Cook's-gardens a short distance, but was not in sight of Wright's house; I went along King's-road, and saw the prisoner - I had never seen him before, but particularly observed his lameness, and am sure it was him; he was coming in a direction for Cook's-ground - the church clock struck eight as he passed me; he had a very large bundle under his right arm, tied in a large cotton handkerchief - he was alone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Beesley? A. Not till afterwards; she had a halfpenny worth of milk of me- she said nothing to me about this - I heard her swear to one Nicholson at the office; she said she thought he was the person - I cannot say whether she swore positively to him; she did to the prisoner. <rs id="t18291203-11-verdict61" type="verdictDescription">

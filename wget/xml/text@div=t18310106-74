               <p>WILLIAM UNETT. I live in Hayes-place, Paddington, and am assistant to my brother, John Unett, of Edgware-road - he deals in earthenware, and sells Robins' patent Royal filter. The prisoner came to the shop apparently in a hurry, on the 27th of December, and wanted me to purchase a filter; I asked him the price; he said 6s. - I pointed to some we had for sale, and asked if they were of that sort - he said Yes; I asked where he got it - he said his father had bought it in a lot at a sale in Oxford-street; I desired him to call there next day - he went out and returned in five minutes, and said that 5s. would be the lowest price he would take; I had before asked him if 6s. was the lowest, and he said he thought his father would not take less - he came again twice on the Tuesday, and my brother told him to bring it at eleven o'clock on the Wednesday morning, and he would look at it - he came on the Wednesday, about two o'clock, and asked if he should bring the filter; I said Yes, and he brought it in a sack in a quarter of an hour - Mr. Stephens, who was waiting at a neighbour's opposite, came in and asked him how he got it; he again said his father had bought it at a sale in Oxford-street, and it was part of a lot - I think he mentioned china and glass; it is worth 25s.</p>

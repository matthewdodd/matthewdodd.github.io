                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Heath, a greengrocer—on 3d December I washed out two sacks of his, and hung them on some sharp-pointed palings to dry, about two yards and a quarter from the window—they were worth about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—the house is by the roadside, near Bushy-green, Le wish am—I missed one sack—I saw it safe about half-past 2 in the afternoon, and the policeman brought it to me about half-past 3.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 95). On 3d December, about 3 o'clock, I saw the prisoners at Bushy-green—Newing left Clark, and went down a little lane at the corner of the heath; he returned to Clark, and they entered into conversation, separated again, and Newing went in one direction and Clark in the other—Newing went and lounged on the palings where two sacks were hanging, and in about a minute and a half he took one sack off—Clark was then standing by an elm-tree about twenty yards off, apparently watching him—Newing held the sack up and gave it to Clark, who held it until I took him—I took him to the station, left him there, and pursued, Newing about half a mile, took him to the station, and charged them both with stealing the sack—they denied all knowledge of each other—the prosecutor's name is on the sack.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Newing's Defence.</hi> I met Clark in Lewisham. We saw the sack lying in the roadway; I picked it up, and said, "Here is a sack! I expect it belongs to some waggon, as the wind is very high; I do not want it." He said, "Give it to me." I did so, and left him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Clark's Defence.</hi> This man picked up the sack and gave it to me; he said he thought it had blown off a cart I said, "We shall find an owner for it," and the policeman took us. I have three good characters from places where I have worked. I told the policeman to go after them, but he would not; if they had been bad characters, I dare say he would have gone.</p>

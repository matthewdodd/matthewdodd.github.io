                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Foweraker, a tobacconist. On the 12th of Nov. the prisoner came to me for half an ounce of tobacco; I served him—it came to three half-pence; he gave me a shilling; I gave him change, a sixpence, three penny-pieces, and three half-pence—I put the shilling in the till where there was nothing except coppers—the prisoner ran away immediately as I gave him the change—I took the shilling out of the till, it was bad—I ran to the door and cried, "Stop him! he has given me bad money"—the prisoner was brought back—I said, "He has given me bad money"—he said, "Hold your noise, I will give you good"—I gave him the shilling, and he kept it in his hand—a policeman was sent for, and he took it out of his hand—the prisoner had not opened his hand from the time I gave him the shilling till the policeman took it from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the senior clerks of the General Post Office—the prisoner was a letter-carrier—his district was in Goswell Street—in consequence of something that occurred, I made up a letter, on 30th May, addressed, Mr. Baker, bookseller, 20, Goswell Street, into which I put 122 penny postage stamps, 120 in one sheet, and two together—I marked them and gave the letter the same day to Smee, an officer of the Post Office—it should in the ordinary course of business have been delivered by the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>

               <p>on the morning of the 31st, between eight and nine o'clock—about half-past twelve on 31st, in consequence of information, I told the prisoner that a letter containing postage stamps, addressed to Mr. Baker, book<lb></lb>seller, 20, Goswell Street, was missing, and asked him if he knew anything about it—he said, "No"—I asked him where he lived—he said, "15, Upper Ashby Street"—I desired Rumbold to go and search his lodging—he returned in about an hour, and in the prisoner's presence produced a pocket<lb></lb>book, containing 122 postage stamps, which he said he had found at the prisoner's lodgings in the pocket of a coat, which he produced, and which the prisoner now has on—I said to the prisoner, "These postage stamps have been found at your lodging by the police-officer; where did you get them from?"—he replied, "I am very sorry, but I must plead guilty"—I iden<lb></lb>tified the stamps (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

               <p>Q. What is his business?</p>
               <p>Bridgewater. He is a <rs id="t17600116-23-viclabel125" type="occupation">grocer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17600116-23-victim222 t17600116-23-viclabel125"></join>. As I was doing business behind the counter, I was told by some customers in the shop, that the prisoner was doing what she should not do. I went to her and said, what are you at? She said nothing, but I searched her and found ten ounces of green tea upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose property it was?</p>
               <p>Bridgewater. It was the property of my master.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Bridgewater. This was on the 23d of December, or there abouts, between six and seven in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q Had she asked for any thing?</p>
               <p>Bridgewater. I don't know that she had; there were a great many customers in the shop, I suppose about twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take any thing?</p>
               <p>Bridgewater. No; I saw nothing but by information.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the tea done up in any thing?</p>
               <p>Bridgewater. No, it was loose in her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say for herself?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176001160025"></xptr>Bridgewater. She said a woman gave it to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say the woman gave it to her?</p>
               <p>Bridgewater. That I don't know; but to the best of my knowledge I think she said it was given to her in our shop.</p>
               <p>Q Are you sure it is your master's property?</p>
               <p>Bridgewater. I am very certain of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it taken out of a cannister?</p>
               <p>Bridgewater. No, it was taken out of a chest. I informed my master of it, and he ordered me to send for an officer. When the officer came, I put the tea in a paper, and he took her to the watchhouse. I had the tea tied up and sealed, which the officer has got to produce here.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name?</p>
               <p>Bridgewater. His name is Challase?</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say before the alderman?</p>
               <p>Bridgewater. She made a weak defence before the alderman, and said it was given to her by a woman in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she name that woman?</p>
               <p>Bridgewater. No. She said the woman was a stranger to her, and that she did not know her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she came to buy any tea?</p>
               <p>Bridgewater. I did not hear her say any thing of that. (The tea produced in court by the constable.)</p>
               <p>Bridgewater. This is my master's tea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I went to see after my mother, and could not find her. Then I went into the grocer's shop, to see if she was there, and a woman that was in the shop put something into my apron; I never saw that woman in my life before.</p>

            . I have known the girl at the bar about five or six years, and I believe she is an honest girl, but has not so much wit as other girls have. She served me at the time of my wife's being ill, and I never knew her to wrong me of the value of a pin. She has not wit enough to give a person a ready answer.</p>
               <p>Q. What business are her friends of?</p>
               <p>Galloway. Her mother goes to Rag Fair, and makes old shirts and aprons out of old cloth. I have known her mother these eight years, and she is a very honest woman. She has four children, is a widow, and has brought them up as well as could be expected for many years.</p>

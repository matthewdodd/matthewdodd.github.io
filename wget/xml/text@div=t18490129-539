                  </hi>. I am a carpenter and joiner. About half-past six o'clock on the evening of 16th Jan. I was coming home through Goswell-street with my hands in my great-coat pockets—I saw the prisoners and. several men and women <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> and jumping about on the path—Smith ran. into my arms—I said, "What do you do here?"—he directly turned round and began hitting me in my face several times—the women, of whom I believe Burns is one, were close at his side—I told him I would give him in charge—he challenged me to fight—I told him I would not disgrace myself with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184901290068"></xptr>
               <p>fighting with him—I kept my hands in my pockets all the time, and directly I said that he began hitting me in the face again—he then ran away into Bell-alley—I went after him rather fast, to give him in charge—Burns followed me into Bell-alley, came behind me, and struck me under the left eye and on the right temple, I suppose with a knife, saying, "You b----, I will do for you"—the two blows were given as quick as possible—I immediately fell down senseless—Smith was then running away, and was about six yards in advance—when I recovered, my face was covered with blood, and there were a great number of people and police round me—I went to a surgeon.</p>

About half-past six o'clock I saw Newton in Goswell-street, and the prisoners were twisting and twirling themselves about, and as he was coming along with his hands in his pockets, Smith fell into his arms—Newton <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him away to make room for himself, and said, "What are you <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> here?"—Smith turned round, caught hold of him by the waist, and struck him twice in the face, and challenged him to fight—Newton said he would not take his hands out of his pockets to disgrace himself to hit him, but that he would give him in charge—the prisoners then left, went down Bell-alley, and Newton followed them—Burns came by the side of him, knocked him down against a door, and stabbed him twice—I saw the knife in her hand—both stabs were given as he was falling—she said, "You b----, I will <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for you"—she then shut the knife up, and put it into her pocket—Newton remained on the ground, insensible, for two or three minutes—he bled.</p>

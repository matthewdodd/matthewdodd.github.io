On the 11th of May we lost two bottles of Madonia wine, out of the vault in Cooper's-row; that morning I had some empty bottles brought in, and the prisoner was one of the persons employed to bring them in; he carried a load of these bottles into the vault; there was nobody in the vault when I was there the last time but two of my own servants and the prisoner; as I was going to Sam's coffee-house, I saw my little boy struggling with the prisoner; I saw the boy get one bottle from him; I went up and collared him, and took another bottle from him likewise. (The wine produced). It has my seal upon it.</p>

            . I was in the vault: the prisoner left the empty bottle the first time he came into the vault; he went away for some straw; he returned with it and left that in the cellar; then he went away and returned a third time; I saw a shadow of somebody going out of the cellar; I followed him and stopped him till my master came; I took one bottle from him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any lodgers? A. No: I have apprentices who were in bed and asleep; we have a woman who comes to assist us; I have three floors in my house - I have two little sons, but I do not know whether they were at home at the time; they are sometimes at their aunt's, and sometimes at school - one of them was at home that night, if not both - I sleep with them; I was sober - I am positive one of them slept with me that night; it being three weeks or a month ago, I do not recollect; one of them was at home, because I told him I had lost my money - I have two apprentices, who are sixteen or seventeen years of age - the prisoner drank something in my house; but I did not; she had a little gin out of a decanter; I had not known her before - I was neither drunk nor sober; I had taken no liquor but brandy that night, and very likely half a pint of porter at dinner - a person might have called and taken a little gin or a little wine, and I might have some with them - I was in no house drinking, except my own - I dined at home; I had drank the brandy and water from a quarter before ten till a little after twelve o'clock, at the King's Arms, Holborn-bridge - I paid three sixpences for it, and I went home from there, and was at no other house - I had been at home before I went to the tavern, I was not so tipsy that I did not know whether I gave this to the prisoner or not; I have heard she was taken the next morning and discharged - she was at liberty for a week, she went to demand 17l. which she had in her pocket, and was taken again; I told the inspector of my loss that night, but told him not to take any notice of it, as I had had a female in my house, which I know is not a proper thing; I told him to see if he could find her, and get my money.</p>

            . On Friday, the 20th of August, I was on duty near Hampstead-road - the prisoner and another young woman were in a cab - the driver called me, and said they would not pay his fare; I said they had better go to the station-house - I there searched the prisoner, and found this watch, this 10l. note, and this money; she said she got the money from a gentleman she often met, when she left her situation at Blackwall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found a watch on her? A. Yes; the prosecutor did not claim that - I did not see him till the 1st of September; no one is here who saw him that night.</p>

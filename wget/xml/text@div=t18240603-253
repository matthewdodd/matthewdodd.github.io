            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I know the shop, No. 84, Fleet-street; the name of</p>
               <p>"R. Carlile" is over the door. I was directed by a person in the office of the Solicitor of the Treasury, to go to that shop on the 20th of May - I went, but did not see the defendant then - I went again on the 27th, and saw him then - he was standing behind the counter - I asked him for the last number of</p>
               <p>"The Republican," which had been published on the Friday preceding (this was on Thursday.) I asked him for the work - he said it was prohibited - I then said I had been there a day or two before, and the answer they gave me was, that they would send it to my address, (which was true but I did not see him then) - he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, very well, then you shall have it;" he went and brought me this number (producing it) - I paid him 6 d. for it, and marked it before it went out of my possession.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any other person serving in the shop at the time he delivered it to you - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take it from the counter, or where - A. To the best of my recollection there had been a small partition made in this shop a few days before, and he went behind that partition and brought it from there.</p>
               <p>(The Libel was here read.)</p>
               <p>MR. FRENCH addressed the Court on behalf of the defendant, to the same purport as on the former trials, and wished particularly to press upon them the reluctance evinced to sell the publication in question.</p>

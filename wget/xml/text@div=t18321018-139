On the 23rd of September, about two o'clock in the morning, I was in Whitecross-street with St. Ledger, and met a female; I went with her to <placeName id="t18321018-139-crimeloc792">Davis-court, Chequer-alley</placeName>

               <p>Q. You say the prisoner prevented the other man from taking your life? A. Yes, he laid hold of him, and shook his head at him when he made a blow at me - he held him and prevented his striking me any more; I cannot say whether the prisoner gave me any blows - when they came in the other man was in such a rage he called me an Irish b-gg-r, and said he would serve me out - that he had been served out by some Irishmen, some time before, and he would serve me out; that was after I was knocked down - they had called us Irish b-gg-rs before they entered - I was stunned so that I could not exactly tell who struck me; they left the room, and the first I noticed in the room was a Policeman; I was confined to my bed eight or nine days, from the blows - the Policeman lifted me off the floor and put me on a seat; he went out - he afterwards took me into the court, and I saw the prisoner in Head's custody; I was taken to a surgeon, who dressed my head, and afterwards to St. Bartholomew's hospital - I was there eight or nine days; I had never given them the least provocation - I think I had said, "I defy you to come in;" I had had some beer that night, but knew what I was about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. The prisoner collared the man, and prevented his beating you further? A. Yes; he laid hold of him by the collar when I was on the floor, and I received no blows after, that I know of, if I had I think I should have known it - I had stood against the street door, as well as I could, to prevent their coming in; I then left the passage and came into the parlour, as they pushed the street door in once or twice - I then attempted to keep them out of the parlour, and two men rushed in; I put up my hands to defend myslef - I will not swear I did not lay hold of them; I did not that I know of - I might have been struck either with the poker or shovel; a heavy first might injure me as much. but I really believe it was not done with a first; it was light part of the time, and then the light disappeared.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and was with May - we met a female, who took us to Davis'-court, Chequer-alley; she got a light - we were in the front parlour; I heard a noise - in six or eight minutes May went into the passage; the female closed the parlour door, and directly after, May told me there were some folks in the court who he did not like - I let him into the parlour; the party came and demanded admittance, and asked if there were any Irish b-gg-rs in there; we refused them entrance, but shortly after they rushed in at the front door, and in a few minutes demanded entrance at the parlour - we refused; I put my shoulder to the door to keep them out, but May rushed in - two men came in, a third was coming in, and struck me as he entered - the prisoner was one of the first two; I did not see him do any thing, as I had to defend myself against the third man - I saw nothing done to May; the girl had told them to keep out, and she would give them in charge unless they went off; I got out and called for an officer, and then the third man ran away - May renained in the room till I brought an officer there; May had given them no provocation - they had threatened they would serve the Irish b-gg-rs out; my back was turned to May; I saw nothing done to him, nor heard any blows given.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 22nd of September, about three o'clock in the morning, I was called from Whitecross-street into Davis'-court - I found the prosecutor alone in the room, bleeding from the head, laying on his back on the floor - I put him in a sitting posture, then went out, and was directed to the opposite house, where I took the prisoner in the first floor room - he was in company with three girls; he said he had not been out of the room for two hours - he was standing up, and I think had been drinking; I went and took the prosecutor to the station, and then to a surgeon - he appeared to have been beat about the head a good deal, and bleeding; I did not see a poker or any weapon about - I believe I had not told the prisoner what I took him for, when he said he had been in the room two hours; I believe he was under the influence of liquor, but did not appear drunk.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I heard the cries of Murder! and saw St. Ledger - he took me to the house; when we got to the door, the prisoner and another were coming out at the front door - he had the handle of a fire-shovel, and a quart pot, as it appeared to me; St. Ledger said, "Those are the two murderers, and I give charge of them;" the prisoner said, "If you say another word, I will split your bl-y scull, or crack it;" I looked into the room, saw May laying there bleeding, and during that time, they popped into the opposite house - further assistance came in a few minutes, and I and other officers went up; we found the door fast - pushed it open, and saw the prisoner in the room with three or four common prostitutes - there was no light in the room; Head turned his light on - I told the prisoner he was one of the party, and must go with us - his hands and jacket were bloody - the other was not there; I afterwards saw the prosecutor - he was bloody all over the head and face, and seemed in a very weak state - the prisoner said he was not the one who had any thing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say he was not one, or not the one? A. He said he was not one of the party who had been there; I am sure he is the man who told St. Ledger, if he said another word, he would break his neck, for I knew him by sight well.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you notice the prosecutor's wounds? A. We both went to the doctor's, and saw them dressed; there were six cuts in his head, both in the front and back.</p>

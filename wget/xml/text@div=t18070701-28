            . I am an independent man, I live in St. George's in the East. On Tuesday the 26th of May last, about a quarter after nine o'clock, I was at the end of Barbican, the corner of Golden-lane; I stopped there, resting my hand upon the post, my wife was looking at a haberdasher's shop, I was looking towards Long-lane, that she might not pass me; it was getting dark, there were several men standing behind the post in Golden-lane; I did not take notice of them, my eye being fixed along Barbican; several men rushed upon me and took me bodily away from the post, several yards down <placeName id="t18070701-28-crimeloc171">Barbican</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18070701-28-crimeloc171" type="placeName" value="Barbican"></interp>

                  <join result="offencePlace" targOrder="Y" targets="t18070701-28-off169 t18070701-28-crimeloc171"></join>; I felt a sudden twitch of my pocket and when I felt the switch I saw the motion of the prisoner's hand as soon as they had quitted me; I clapped my hand to my pocket and exclaimed that I had been robbed of my watch; the prisoner and several others went down Red Cross-street as hard as they could run; I pursued him, calling stop thief, still keeping him in sight; the prisoner was stopt; I laid hold of him; at the time he had his coat off; he gave his coat to a man that was standing on his left hand; I had hold of the prisoner with my left hand, I seized the man with my right hand; a scuffle ensued, they both got from me; I hurt my hand, it has been so bad this three weeks I do not know what to do with it hardly; the prisoner was taken in a few minutes afterwards, he was taken to a public house and there searched; there was nothing found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man. - A. The other man got off; he dropped the coat and another person picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he one of those that drove you from the post. - A. I cannot say positively that I saw him where they stood; I was not more than three yards from them, I saw them standing in Golden-lane; I never saw their faces, I was standing outside of the post by a pawnbrokers, not to hinder the foot passengers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of the party. - A. Yes, I fixed my eye upon him, he was one of the party that rushed on me; he was the man; when I felt the snatch I saw his motion, I am sure he was one of the party.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch again. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. This was past nine o'clock. - A. Yes, the clock struck nine when I was in Charterhouse-square.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dusk. - A. Yes, but it was a remarkable clear day.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were several men - how many do you think there might be. - A. I dare say there was half a dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was hurried along in that manner, I should imagine you could not take much notice - when a man is in that situation he cannot make much observation - they rushed you down Barbican. - A. No, about six yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner was the shortest man, were you in the confusion competent to ascertain which was the shortest man among them. - A. He was the shortest man, I took notice of the colour of his coat, it was a light great coat; I catched my eyes upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the colour of any body else's coat that was there. - A. There were two others with dark great coats, and some with short coats.</p>
               <p>Q. This a little astonished you. - A. Yes, and I dare say if you had been in my situation, it would have astonished you.</p>
               <p>Q. I know it would; so much so that I should not be able to say who was the shortest man - you getting among a parcel of riotous men, and losing your wife, must be very much flurried. - A. No, not at all.</p>


               <p>Q. Then you were not flurried. - A. No, I was in a frustration.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before this had you known that your watch was in your pocket. - A. When I left my friend's house, No. 58, St. John-street, just by Hicks'-hall.</p>
               <p>Q. You had your eye upon the prisoner all the time. - A. Yes, he was before me.</p>
               <p>Q. All the others were behind you. - A. No, some were before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you might have seen them; have you always given the same account - A. Exactly. When a man states the truth, he cannot deviate from it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always given the same story. - A. Yes, I think I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Never made the least deviation. - A. I do not say; I may have made a deviation in a word, the facts are the same.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost you watch at the corner of Golden-lane. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said you lost it at the corner of Barbican by Long-lane. - A. I said that end of Barbican, the corner of Golden-lane; that was correct. In an instant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010032"></xptr> I mentioned Long-lane instead of Golden-lane, and the alderman corrected me in an instant.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have not always told the same story. - A. I said not in a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon yourself positively to swear, that you saw this person, whom you never saw before in your life; that the prisoner was one of the party. - A. I will swear to the prisoner, that he was one of the party that hustled me.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the coat - A. He put it on again, it was searched, there was nothing in it.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. What coat was it. - A. A white drab long coat; his coat was brought to him again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to Mr. Wood, an enameller, the same as I am, to ask for work; I met a friend who told me my sister in Moor-lane was taken ill; I made the best of my way home, when some gentlemen took hold of me and pursued me; I took off all my clothes for them to search them; he charged another man with robbing him; he proved to be a respectable housekeeper, he let him go.</p>

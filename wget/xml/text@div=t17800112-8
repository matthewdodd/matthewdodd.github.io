               <p>On the 22d of November as I was going home to my lodging at the end of St. Giles's, a little after ten, I met that lady at the bar in <placeName id="t17800112-8-crimeloc40">Holbourn</placeName>

               <p>What part of Holbourn is that? - It is above the Bars, between Great and Little Turnstile; she asked me to give her a glass of wine, or I asked her to drink one, I cannot say which. We went into the French Horn.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to her first or she to you? - I cannot tell exactly, I believe she spoke to me first. We went into the French Horn, and had some wine and water; while we were drinking the wine and water she picked my pocket of my pocket-book; I had it when I went into the house; there was nobody in the room but she and I, only the landlord brought in the wine and water.</p>
               <p>Which pocket was it in? - My waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Were you sober or in liquor? - I was not far in liquor; I had been drinking with several friends whom I had been doing business with, but was not intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you were perfectly sober when you went into this house? - I had been drinking two or three glasses of wine with some people I had been going business with; I was not fuddled.</p>
               <p>Had you a great coat on over your waistcoat? - I had no great coat on at the time, I had this coat on.</p>
               <p>Was your coat buttoned over your waistcoat? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120023"></xptr>How long before you went into the house had you felt the pocket-book in your pocket? - I cannot tell, it was not long, I had my hand in my pocket just before I met her and felt it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you had it after you left the house you was in before you met her? - Yes, I felt it in my pocket in the street. I often feel in my pockets as I walk along the street, to see if my books and things are safe.</p>
               <p>How long were you in the house with the prisoner? - About ten or fifteen minutes. I agreed to go with this gentlewoman to her lodging; she desired me to go up the horse-ride, and she would go up the alley, and meet me in Holborn. I went like a fool, but did not meet with the lady. I missed my pocket-book, and returned immediately, and told Mr. Parry I had been robbed in his house. The horse-ride is in the yard, and there is an alley. She was to meet me in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you where she lodged or was she to shew you to her lodging? - She did not tell me, she was to shew me; I had not been out of the house above four or five minutes before I missed my pocket-book, and returned and told Mr. Parry.</p>
               <p>Did you go back into the room where you had been with her to see if you could find it? - Yes, we went and looked round the room directly but could not find it.</p>
               <p>Then it occurred to you when you missed it, that you might have dropped it in that room? - It was impossible to drop it out of my pocket unless it was pulled out. I went to the room and looked, but had no great notion that it had dropped out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Had not your waistcoat been open while you was in that room? - No, my waistcoat was not unbuttoned while I was in the room with her.</p>
               <p>What did you do on missing it? - I went to bed; I staid there all night; I asked the landlord the next day if he knew any thing of her; he said he knew nothing about her; then I staid till after dinner, to see if I could get any intelligence of her.</p>
               <p>When did you get any intelligence of her? - In four or five days, I cannot tell exactly the day.</p>
               <p>How did you hear of her? - Mr. Parry sent me a letter by the post, and I came to town immediately and got a warrant for the prisoner; she was taken before I came to town. When they sent for me to town I swore to her. She was taken before Justice Triguet, in Hart-street, Bloomsbury; she owned being with me but denied knowing any thing of the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Did you ever get your book again? - No.</p>
               <p>What was in the book? - A twenty pound bank note; I put it in that afternoon; I took it for some cattle I had sold.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the bank note was in it? - Yes; there were besides memorandums and bills and receipts in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no questions to ask him, he is very well convinced I never was near him.</p>

               <p>I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to Justice Triguet's with a charge; I had had descriptions of her and therefore took her as my prisoner; I had a warrant against her for this matter of Mr. Deverell.</p>
               <p>You took this to be the woman you had the warrant against? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was she searched? - No.</p>
               <p>Neither at that time nor any other? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you enquire for her lodging? - Yes, we found the place where she lodged.</p>
               <p>Did you search the lodging? - No.</p>
               <p>Why did not you search? - Because it was the 14th of December when I took her, it was a long while after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Upon her examination at Justice Triguet's, or at any other time did she say any thing about the robbery? - No, she only said she had been with the person drinking some mulled wine, but denied the fact.</p>

             and the prisoner came to my house about a quarter after ten at night, and had some wine and water; they staid about a quarter of an hour, then they both went away; Mr. Deverell came back in a short time and said he had lost a pocket-book. As soon as they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120024"></xptr>gone I went into the room and took the bowl and candle away. There was no pocket-book there then; nobody but me went into the room.</p>
               <p>Did you look round the room then? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you go and look in the room when Deverell came back? - I cannot swear to that, I do not recollect; I believe we did go and look into the room. I asked him why he thought the woman had taken his pocket-book from him, and he gave me his reasons.</p>
               <p>When the prosecutor came back and you searched the room you did not find any thing? - No; I told him his best way was to remain in town and I would make what enquiry I could after her.</p>
               <p>You did not know the prisoner at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know where she lodged? - No, I did not know where she lodged; I made all the enquiry I could and as soon as I heard of her wrote to Mr. Deverell in the country consequence of which he came to town.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing further of the matter? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the examination of the prisoner? - Yes; she always denied it from first to last.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I met with the prosecutor promiscuously in Holborn; he came up to me and asked me to go and drink a glass of wine at this man's house. I went in with him; he asked what I chose to drink; I said a glass of red port mulled; he sat down on one side of the table and I on the other; he pulled out half a crown and asked me if I would lie with him for that; I said I never accepted of any thing so mean as half a crown; he said it was immaterial, if I would not do it for that; he had been with two other girls that evening. He said perhaps if I took him home he might make me a present of something more. I said I could not take him home for any such money. He asked me where he could find me again; I said in Holborn; he said he would go up the horse-ride, and I went up Holborn. The prosecutor passed me afterwards in Holborn; he was very much in liquor; he said nothing to me nor I to him. I was afterwards informed that Mr. Parry charged me with taking a bank note from the prosecutor; I went to Mr. Parry's, and gave him a direction where I lived, and asked him where the prosecutor was; he said he was gone into the country, but would come to town that afternoon; I said very well, there I lodge, if he has any such thing to charge me with, he may do it any time. I was at Mr. Parry's house almost every night after the warrant was out against me. He said nothing to me. I asked him before the constable if he did not know where I lodged; he said he did; I asked him why he did not call upon me at my lodging; he said the prosecutor had been several times in town, and never came near him; that he should never have come after me if he had not met with me.</p>

               <p>To Parry. Did the prisoner come to your house to give you a direction where she lodged? - I gave it out that she had taken this bank note and that she had better come to my house; a few nights after she came in such a bullocking manner that I begged she would walk out of the house, and she might depend upon it she would hear of it again.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you where she lodged? - She did not; I heard afterwards that she lodged at one Rushworth's in Covent Garden; I said it looked bad her never coming to my house afterwards, she never was there but that once.</p>

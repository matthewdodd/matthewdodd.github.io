                  </hi>. I am in the service of John Wilfred Sadler, of Plumstead-road—an 9th April, between 5 and 6 in the evening, I served the prisoner with a glass of ale, and then went into the bar-parlour, leaving no one else there—I then saw him pass a long whip-handle twice across the counter to a shelf where there was money—I went out to see what he was doing, and he directly went away—other persons came into the bar at that time, but not into the part the prisoner was in—I called my master and mistress—my master went out after him—I missed two sovereigns and a half sovereign from the shelf—there was a pile of silver there, but it had not been touched—half a sovereign was left out of the gold—there was some sticky stuff found on the shelf where the money was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were there eight or nine persons in front of the bar when the prisoner came in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no one there when he came in, but two men and a woman came in afterwards—the man had nothing in his hand—they were in the private bar—the prisoner was in the public bar—I could see the private bar from the parlour—there is a wooden division between the two bars, but there is no glass at the top of it—there was only the counter between the prisoner and me—the bar parlour is not at the end</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Moorish Arms—on 7th April my wife called me—I went outside, and when I got about 200 yards I saw the prisoner carrying a long stick or a whip-handle—my little boy pointed him out to me—he saw me, and started to run—I called out, "Stop thief!"—a man was coming at the end of the street, and the prisoner struck him with the whip-handle, saying "Let me go," but I went up, took hold of him, and said, "You have been robbing me"—I saw him put something in his mouth—I took him by the throat, and he dropped a sovereign from his mouth on the pavement, which he got hold of again, as he was partly on the ground—I held him some time, and the police came and took him to the station—the sovereign has not been seen since—his mouth was examined at the station, and the half-sovereign dropped from it—I looked at it; it was marked with bird-lime—I examined the shelf behind the bar—there were two great marks of bird-lime just where the money had been—I missed two sovereigns and a half from the shelf—the stick was lost in the struggle—he had not got it when he was taken by the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly a police-inspector—I live at 78, Crescent-road, Plumstead—I was at the end of Spray-street, and saw the prisoner running, and carrying a whip-handle four or five feet long, and Mr. Sadler after him—I tried to stop the prisoner—he tried to stab him, but I closed with him; Mr. Sadler came up, and I saw the sovereign fall on the pave<lb></lb>ment—I attempted so pick it up, but the prisoner pushed me away, and picked it up and put it in his mouth—I do not know what became of the stick—there was a mob of one or two hundred people, but they did not help—I saw the half-sovereign drop from his mouth at the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What do you think became of the sovereign? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he swallowed it—he might have swallowed one and kept the other in his teeth—there were three or four policemen near him when the half-sovereign dropped from his mouth—it was about a couple of minutes after he entered the station—he was running fast when I saw him—I knew it was a whip-handle he had, because it was covered with leather—I was in front of him—I attempted to stop him, and gave him a sway round—I did stop him—he did not Cry "Stop thief," but the prosecutor did—when the police came up I looked for the stick, and it was gone—we struggled several minutes.</p>

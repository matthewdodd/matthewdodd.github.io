On 20th August I saw Gunn, about half-past 11 o'clock in the day, in the Ilford-road, with a waggon drawn by three horses, loaded with hops—I saw three nosebags full, and a sack full on the top of the waggon—I followed him till he came to the Rising Sun public-house—he drew up there, and when I got there I saw the sack on the shaft nearest to the public-house—the nosebags were put on the horses—while I was watching, another waggon came up and it was drawn between me and the prisoner's waggon, which prevented my seeing the sack—I waited till the prisoner started with his waggon, and then the sack was not there—the nosebags had been taken off the horses Just before the waggon started—I still followed him, and when I got to the police-station I stopped him and asked him what he had done with the sack of horse-feed—he said, "I had no sack of horse-feed"—he afterwards said, "I had a small quantity, which I put in the nosebags"—I took the nosebags off the. waggon—they were about half full when they were taken off the horses at the Rising Sub—they had not been replenished—they were In my sight all the time—I asked Mm where he baited—he said, "At a coffee-shop in Stratford"—he then afterwards said, "I did not stop to bait there, only to get a bit; 1 baited at the Rising Sun"—I went back to the Rising Sim—I found a sack in the stable, and I found a straw band—I had noticed that the sack which was on the waggon was tied with such a straw band—I also found some horse-feed, consisting of beans, chaff, and clover, in the stable—I had seen Devonian, who is ostler there; he was outside with Mr. Smith, the landlord—I said to Mr. Smith, "I want to look in your stable—I went in with him and Deveuish into the granary as they call it—when I found the horse feed, I said to Devenish, "Whose is this?"—he said", "That is mine, and everything here belongs to me"—I put the horse-feed in the sack and took it away—I afterwards showed it to Mr. Young—I saw Mr. Young find one piece of paper</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cow-keeper in Mile-end-road—Gunn had been in my employ for four or five weeks—on 20th August he had a van with three horses—he had to take three nosebags full and a sack full of fodder for the horses to eat on their journey—the horses could not empty the nose<lb></lb>bags in less than an hour—I had previously put pieces of paper in the food and I had written my name on the pieces of paper—I placed them among the fodder, and I found this fodder with the pieces of paper in it at the station—these are the papers (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>), here is my name in full on them—I never gave Gunn any authority to part with any of the food.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>Q.Should you know the note again if you was to see it? - A. Yes, I put my initials upon it before I parted with it, and it has a spot of grease upon the middle of it.</p>

A.One of the officers told Mackay to get out his bundle, and he only took up two bundles; he left the other in his bed; the next day, when the Captain came on board, he ordered me to clean out the cabin; I made Mackay's bed first, and I wondered to see the pillow lay so high at the head; I listed up the pillow, and there I saw a bundle.</p>

               <p>Q.To whom did you deliver that bundle? - A. I gave it to my master.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you find any thing? - A. The officer in my prefence took an engraved copper-plate out of the bureau.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that plate, and tell us if that is the plate he found? - A. Yes, it is; it was in one of the drawers of the bureau; his wife gave the officer the key.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.Did he not say this under and expectation of becoming a witness? - A.Not that I know of; I asked him why he would not tell me; he said, it was only wasting the young man's time to take him up; I told him the officer must take him to Bow-street, and he would undergo some examination; but while we were at the officer's house, I think Carprneal's, or at the Office, I cannot recollect which, the prisoner Foss, was also in custody; he had been apprehended; first, Catapodi said, Foss had got the Company's seal engraved; Foss was present, and heard it; he desired Foss to give up the feal, telling him they could not hurt him for it, and it was of no confequence; Foss said, he certainly had no such thing, and he did not know what Catapodi had been talking about; he offered the next morning, before the magistrate, if he would admit him an evidence, that he would tell who he got it done for.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see any thing found upon Foss? - A.There was a watch upon the table at Foss's lodgings, which I took, and delivered it to the officer; I have not seen it since; Foss told me, it was his watch, in his lodgings.</p>

               <p>Q.What did Mackay say? - A.He said, it was a good one, and the people in London did not know any thing about Scotch notes; that if he was in Scotland, there would he no hesitarion about it.</p>

               <p>Q.How many? - A. I suppose eighteen or twenty.</p>
               <p>Q.How do you know? - A. I saw them that night in his pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he say any thing more about these notes? - A.After a great deal of conversation, he shewed me the notes, and told me they were bad ones; I was very much displeased at his imposing upon me to go out and cash these bad notes for him.</p>
               <p>Q.Tell us all that he said about these bad notes? - A.He told me at length that they really were bad ones; that he was going to meet the party in Threadneedle-street on Saturday night, and if I chose to go with him, I should see the person that made them.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you go with him? - A. I went with him at last to a house called the King's Arms, or the King's Head, in Threadneedle-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he at all explain to you, before you went to the King's Head, what was his errand in London? - A.He told me it was for the purpose of getting some of these notes from Catapodi.</p>
               <p>Q.When you went with him to Threadneedle-street, who did you see there? - A.I was desired by him to go to Foss at his own house, and to say that he and Catapodi would wait for him at the King's Head, in Threadneedle-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you all meet together there? - A. We all met together.</p>
               <p>Q.What passed then? - A.The prisoner, Catapodi, did not seem much to agree to take me into company.</p>
               <p>Q.Did Mackay or Foss say any thing to that? - A.They had no objection; Mackay said, he had nothing to fear from me, that I was a friend of his.</p>
               <p>Q.Did they then permit you to stay among them? - A. Yes, they had no objection.</p>
               <p>Q.What passed then? - A.They were talking about the superscriptions of these notes, and about the feal.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see any thing produced? - A. I saw there a steel seal produced.</p>
               <p>Q.Who produced it? - A. I suppose it was Catapodi's, but I saw it in the hands of Foss.</p>
               <p>Q.Why did you suppose it was Catapodi's? - A.Because Mackay told me that Catapodi had the whole management of the business.</p>
               <p>Q.Besides the seal, what else did you observe? - A. I saw a small slip of paper, with three impressions of the seal made upon it.</p>
               <p>Q.What was said about these three impressions? - A.Mackay said these three impressions were too slight to have the desired effect upon the notes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did any body make any observation upon that? - A. Yes; Catapodi said he would after it, and recommended that a small piece of lead should be got; that they should put the note upon the lead, and stamp it on the lead, it would then have the desired effect.</p>
               <p>Q.What was said to that? - A. It was agreed upon by the whole party that they should take that method.</p>
               <p>Q.Who took away the seal then? - A.Henry Foss.</p>

               <p>Q. You have talked about notes, did you see any notes at that meeting? - A. I saw Mackay take out his pocket-book, shew some of the notes, and find fault with the superscription.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any thing else produced? - A.Nothing else at that time.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you, at any time, see any ink produced? - A.There were two phials of ink produced that night; Catapodi produced them, and gave them to Mackay; one was red, and the other black; Catapodi told me the ink he had formerly procured he thought infufficient for the purpose; then he put these two bottles into his hand, and he told him, that whatever quantity he wanted when he was in Scotland, he would send it upon his sending the money.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was to keep this ink? - A.Mackay himself.</p>
               <p>Q.For what purpose? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q.Did Mackay say whether he should want any or not? - A.He said he should have occasion for more soon.</p>
               <p>Q.More notes, or more ink, or what? - A.More notes.</p>
               <p>Q.After you had parted, and Foss taken away the seal, did you afterwards see Foss? - A. Yes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200095"></xptr>there was an appointment made the next day; Foss and Mackay were to meet at Foss's house.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you meet? - A.We did.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see what Mackay did with the notes? - A. Yes, at the meeting, the next day, he gave them to Foss.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know how many, as near as you can guess? - A.Twelve or thirteen.</p>
               <p>Q.You did not count them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see what Foss did with them after Mackay had given them to him? - A. No; he ordered Foss to go to some person with these notes.</p>
               <p>Q.For what purpose? - A.For the purpose of stamping them, as I understood from Mackay.</p>
               <p>Q.What became of Foss after this? - A.He went out, and was absent about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he bring back with him? - A.He brought some notes back, stamped, with a seal upon them.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you go home with Mackay after he had got the notes stamped? - A.I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Did Mackay look at them before you parted? - A.He did.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he say any thing about them? - A.Not till he got home to the Blue Boar; he said they were very well done.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he do with them? - A.He put them into his pocket-book; but upon putting them in, he found that three were not stamped.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you sleep together that night? - A. Yes; next morning he told me to take these notes to Foss, and desire him to get them done like the other.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you left the house, did you see Mackay do any thing? - A. I saw him on the Sunday; he got up a little before me, and came to a small table, and took out four notes, and I saw him write upon three notes from a fourth, which he had by him.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the writing part? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon after that was it that you left the house? - A.On Monday morning; I went with the three unstamped notes to Foss.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find Foss? - A.No, I found him on Tuesday morning; I delivered him three unstamped notes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see what he did with them? - A.He ordered me to wait till he returned; after he had been gone about half an hour, or twenty minutes, he returned with a bit of lead in one pocket, and a feal in the other.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see what he did with the lead and the seal? - A. Yes; he put the lead upon the ground, put the notes one by one upon the lead, then he put the seal upon them, and knocked it with a hammer, which produced the impression very clearly.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you do with them? - A. I returned to Mackay, and found he was gone on board a ship; I wished to go with him, as he promised to pay my passage.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you follow him on board the ship? - A.I did.</p>
               <p>Q.What ship was it? - A.The Osnaburgh packet.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find the ship at the wharf? - A. No, she had left the wharf; I took a boat, and overtook her; I found Mackay on board.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you deliver any thing to Mackay when you got on board? - A. Yes, the three notes.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know of any bundles? - A. Yes, he had a bundle, and I had a small bundle myself.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you keep any of those notes in your bundle? - A.No, I never had any.</p>
               <p>Q.At the time you delivered the notes to Mackay, was all the printed part done? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When you got on board the packet, you went to Dundee? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You were both apprehended at Dundee? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you taken from the ship directly on shore, or from some distance? - A. We were taken at a distance from shore in the river.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you recollect any thing happening before you got on shore? - A. I saw Mackay take out his pocket-book, and slip it over the edge of the boat.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you know what pocket-book he had at that time? - A.I think it was a red Turkey one; I never saw him with more than one.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it such a one as this? - A. Yes, I believe that is the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q.And that you saw him slip over-board? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You were taken into custody, brought up to London, and then you gave your information? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.You had no notion at all of these notes being forged? - A.Not till I was detected offering a bad note to be oashed to Read.</p>
               <p>A.You had no suspicion at all till then? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.You were a very honest man, had fallen into bad hands, and had not the least notion that any of these notes were forged? - A.I had not.</p>
               <p>Q.I dare say you can read and write? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Before that, according to your own account, you had heard some conversation about stamps? - A. No, I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q.You have given some account to day of a conversation about stamps before you went to Read? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you think London was the place in which the British Linen Company manufactured their notes? - A.No, I had no reason to think so.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you thought the notes genuine at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.If you had not thought they were genuine,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200096"></xptr>you would not have done any thing whatever respecting them? - A. No, I should have had no part in it whatever.</p>
               <p>Q.When you went, according to your own account, to Foss to get them stamped, you thought they were genuine notes? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.You said you would not have had any thing to do with them if you had known it - why did not you leave their company directly? - A.Because I could not get home; it was merely for the purpose of getting home to Scotland.</p>
               <p>Q.You went to Foss, and saw him stamp them, and you did all this merely to get home to Scotland, and that you expect to be believed? - A. I hope so.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you ever seen any of these notes in Scotland? - A.But very few of the five-pound ones.</p>
               <p>Q.As five-pound notes were searce in Scotland, you was surprised there were so many in London? - A.There were but eighteen.</p>
               <p>Q.This inflexible honesty, that was not to be overcome but by the hope of a voyage home, of course led you to give information to the Magistrate? - A.No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.When was it you first gave information about this business? - A.At Dundee.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps at that time you were in custody? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q.You know you were in custody respecting forged notes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And then you rather chose to give evidence against somebody else, than that any body should give evidence against you? - A. I did not mind who gave evidence against me.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you no fears about it for yourself? - A. No, only for fear of being disrgraced.</p>
               <p>Q.But no fear of being punished? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you gave evidence upon patriotic principles, to punish guilty men - purely for the sake of public justice? - A. I think it is very proper.</p>
               <p>Q.And you did it merely because it was proper, and not for your own safety? - A. Yes, I did.</p>

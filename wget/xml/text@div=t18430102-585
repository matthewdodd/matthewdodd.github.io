                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Janson, an architect, and live at Clapham. At ten minutes before nine o'clock in the morning of the 24th of Dec., I got into an omnibus at Land-street, in the parish of Clap<lb></lb>ham—directly I sat down I missed my purse—the omnibus started before I had time to sit down—my purse had been in my muff, which was on my hand—it contained five sovereigns and a half-sovereign, some silver and copper, amounting to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was a brown silk purse, with two white rings—it was in my right hand, and my hand was in my muff—the pri<lb></lb>soner was the conductor of the omnibus—my husband stopped the omnibus, and said, "This lady has lost her purse, therefore we can't go on"—the prisoner said, "Very well, sir "—I said, "I will look in the straw, and see if it is dropped "—the prisoner said, "It is no good looking there, it would be on the top if you had dropped it "—it has never been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gentleman's gardener, and live at Clapham. On the morning of the 24th of Dec., about a quarter before nine o'clock, I was passing, and saw the lady get into the omnibus—the gentleman followed close after her—as the gentleman was getting in, I saw a dark purse with two bright rings drop between him and the lady—I saw the prisoner pick it up, and put it in his right-hand pocket—the omnibus proceeded about thirty yards—I saw it stop, and the lady and gentleman get out—I went up—I asked the lady if she had lost her purse, and told what I had seen.</p>

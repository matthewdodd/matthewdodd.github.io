On Monday night, the 24th December, about two minutes before seven, I was at the Elephant and Castle—I saw the prisoners and another man come from the London Road—I followed them—they turned down Frances Street into Hampton Street, went a few yards up, and then stopped and joined in conversation—I ran round Hanover Street to the top of Hampton Street—Hanover Street and Hamp<lb></lb>ton Street both run from Frances Street into the Walworth Road—there is about fifty yards distance between them—when I got to the top of Hampton Street the prisoners were no longer where I had left them—I walked round and round till eight o'clock—I was then standing at the corner of Hanover Street, when I heard a heavy fall down the street—I went down and saw the prisoners coming from the railway arch on to the pavement—Metcalfe and Shepherd had two bundles of lead in their arms—as I was stepping from the pavement across the road to them they <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the lead into the road and all started off—I chased them down Hanover Street, calling out, "Police!" and, "Stop thief!"—I chased Metcalfe into Frances Street, where he was stopped and taken by Parker—I then went back to the place where I first saw them, and found two bundles of lead, weighing twenty pounds, and a quantity more—it weighed altogether 1 cwt. 74lb., and was newly cut—the next morning I went to some stables belonging to the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway, just over the fence where I had seen the prisoners, and found that a quantity of lead haft been cut from the roofs—I compared the lead with the places from which lead had been cut, and found it exactly corresponded—on the 29th of December I saw Shep<lb></lb>herd coming down the steps of the gallery of the Victoria Theatre—I followed him a short distance, stopped him, and said, "Master Shepherd, I want you for being concerned with three others in stealing a quantity of lead on Christmas Eve"—he said, "All right; I was not there"—I took him to the station—I knew all the prisoners by sight before—on the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 29th of December I went with Sergeant Newy to 8, Berners Place, Waterloo Road—Newy knocked at the bedroom door and I went to the back of the house—in a few minutes I saw the blind drawn up and Hogwood trying to get out of the window with a stick in his hand—I called out, and he ran away and got into Sergeant Newy's arms—I produce part of the lead.</p>

You must come back with me and see what is the matter"—I took him back to Hanover Street, and there met Sergeant Hann, who charged him with being concerned with three others in stealing this lead—Metcalfe said, "That remains to be proved"—I took him to the station and examined his hands—they were very dirty and marked with lead—I found this life preserver on him when I apprehended him—I did not know Hogwood previously—he passed</p>

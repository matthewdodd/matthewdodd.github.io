               <p>On the 5th of August, at ten o'clock in the morning the prisoner came up to me in Spa Fields and demanded my purse, I was exceedingly terrified; he said, your purse. I said, what did you say? He said, damn you, your money, or you are a dead woman, and he presented a knife to my breast; he told me to make haste, for he would have my money, or I should be a dead woman, I put my hand into my pocket where the silver was, and by the agitation I was in, some of it fell into my pocket again; he immediately then put his hand into my pocket, and took out the silver that remained; he wanted my ring from my finger; he swore I had rings on; and I said, I have not; he said, if I did not give it him, he would cut it off: he immediately left me. I do not know which way he went; some persons came up, and I was carried into a house, I am very sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the jury, as to what the lady has said against me is intirely false; at the same time I was in my own room at work. I am a watchmaker, and always got my bread by work. I submit whether a man must not be out of his senses, to rob at that time; I am as innocent as the Lord in heaven.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Was any person going across the fields? - No, Sir; it was in the middle of the week, the clock just struck ten.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Have you any witnesses? - I should have had one; but it pleased God to take that witness away.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. How soon after was it the prisoner was taken? - A week after, I recollected him immediately.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live at No. 21, Edward-street, Dorset-square. Early on Wednesday morning, 24th Aug. I was in Long Acre—I had no watch with me—I thought it was between 12 and 1 o'clock—I went up Angel-court to make water—it is a very dark court; while I was there a man came behind me, put his knee in my back, caught me by the neck, pulled me back, and kept me tight by the throat, while another man put both hands into my waistcoat pockets, and then into my trowsers pockets—I had an opportunity of seeing the man who held me, it was the prisoner—I was not able to speak a word while his arm was round my neck—I had 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a half sovereign in my pockets—as soon as the prisoner's hands were removed from my neck, the man who robbed me ran about half the distance to the corner of the court, and as soon as he had got that half distance the prisoner took leave of me, and ran after the other man—as soon as I got up I ran after them, crying, "Stop thief!" and "Police!"—I saw the prisoner before he got to the corner, I saw him turning round the corner (I had been thrown</p>

               <p>down on the ground on my back)—I ran after him, and when I ran out of the court I found that the police bad him—I felt the effects of the violence for a fortnight after—I had been drinking that night, I had taken a good drop, but I was not drunk—I recollect all that occurred—I did not see anything more of the man that had his bands in my pockets—the policeman took the prisoner to the station—I do not think I went with him, I do not know that I did.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, F</hi> 126). On Wednesday morning, 24th Aug., I was on duty in Long-acre, in plain clothes, about 2 o'clock—I saw the prisoner run out of Angel-court—the prosecutor ran out immediately after him, calling "Police!" "Stop thief!"—I immediately ran after the prisoner, and when I was almost close to him he turned round to meet me—I told him be must come back with me to see what he had been doing to the gentleman—he said he had not done anything to him—the prosecutor was then standing in Long-acre, at the end of the court—I brought the prisoner back to him, and he said, "That is the man that robbed me of a half sovereign and some silver"—he did not say anything else—I then told the prisoner that I was a police constable, and he must go to the station with me—when</p>

               <p>we got to the top of Bow-street, he jumped round all at once, and said, "I will we you b—before I will go to the station with you!"—he then struck me a violent blow with a stick, once on my eye and once on my ear, and ran away down Hanover-street—I sprang my rattle, and my brother constable stopped him in Hanover-street—I then took him to the station—the prosecutor had been drinking, but he seemed to know perfectly well what he was about—I searched the prisoner at the station, and found on him two half crowns and 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper.</p>

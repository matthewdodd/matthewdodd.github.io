                  </hi>. I am a confectioner's assistant, of 91, Murray-street—On 12th September, very early in the morning, or a little after midnight, I was in the City-road, and the prisoners came up to me—Jones came up first and asked me the way to Castle-street, he pressed against me—I directed him, and said, "You are getting very familiar and social for strangers"—I felt something on my thigh, and saw that my watch was out of my pocket—I said, "Is that your little game" collared him and fastened him up against the wall—Sanders, who had previously asked me if there was not a public-house called the Park, got behind me, put his left arm round my neck and held me in that position ten or twelve seconds—I called "Police!" and still held Jones against the wall—A crowd got round, and a geutleman struck Sanders on the arm to release me; he let go and ran away—I held Jones till a policeman came and gave him in custody—my watch was safe seven or eight minutes before.</p>

Q.</hi> When I came up to you, did I ask you which was the Post<lb></lb>Office coffee-house, Castle-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You asked for Castle-street—I did not catch you by the throat when you were leaving me, I caught you by the collar when I found my watch 'on my thigh—My drawing it back, took it out of your hand—There were no cabmen there, there were a few females, and one or two people—I had a parcel under my arm.</p>

               <p>Sanders' arm, and he ran away into the arms of the sergeant—I never lost sight of him for I had hold of his coat.</p>

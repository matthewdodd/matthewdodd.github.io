On the 25th of July, about a quarter after seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner and another person came together into my shop; the other person cheapened some trinkets, and bought one; the prisoner sat down upon the seat where I generally work; he bought a trinket, which the other paid for; after that he asked the other to cheapen some chains for him; then a third person came in, who had been standing outside the shop at the window; he cheapened a seal but did not buy it; he went out; the prisoner and the other person directly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130005"></xptr> followed him. I missed the two watches immediately; I followed them, and took the prisoners within ten or fifteen yards of my door. As soon as I collared the prisoner, I perceived the person who came in last began to run; I secured the prisoner, but he had not my watch upon him.</p>

               <p>I am a smith. I saw the prisoner take a watch out of the watchmaker's window, and put it into his waistcoat pocket. I was sitting in the window of a publick house opposite. He went out of the shop and gave it to one of his companions in a handkerchief; the man who received the watch ran off immediately; I ran after him, but the pavement being up I fell, and he got out of my sight before I could recover myself.</p>
               <p>Where did the prisoner stand at that time? - By the side of the prosecutor. The shop window was open; I saw them through the window.</p>
               <p>What sort of watch was it? - A yellow watch.</p>

               <p>I am a hatter and hosier. I was passing by Mr. Lambert's shop at the same time and saw the prisoner give something in a handkerchief to another man, but what it was I do not know. Then I saw Mr. Lambert come out and catch hold of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I went into this shop and bought a trinket. When I got about twenty yards from the shop the prosecutor came after me and desired me to come back; I said I would. He said he had lost two watches. I had not any. He went after the other persons, but could not catch them, so he kept me.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. What is the value of the watches? - The gilt one I was to have had four guineas for the next morning; I would not have sold the other under two guineas.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Robert Debenham The prisoner was in our employ—we had a good character with him—it was his duty to attend sales, and keep a sale-ledger—I have his sale-ledger and catalogue for 8th of Feb.—here is an entry of four lots sold to Mr. Parry, amounting to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">.</hi>—there is no entry in the sale-ledger of that amount having been received—it appears as if Mr. Parry was still debtor to that amount—it was the prisoner's duty, if he received that 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on behalf of Mr. Parry, to enter it in the column of money paid, in the credit column—if this money was paid on the 9th it ought to have been entered in his daily cash-book, not in the money-paper—we had no sale on the 9th—there would be no confusion of the sale that day—it would be the prisoner's duty to enter that 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the daily cash-book, and to account for the money the same night—he did not at that time, or any other time, account for that 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid by Mr. Parry—each clerk had a separate cash-book and separate till—there would not be anything that I know of to prevent the prisoner entering it at the time he received it—on the 15th of Feb. here are three lots debited to Mr. Postlethwaite to the amount of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is not carried into the paid column—supposing that were paid at the time of the sale, it would be the prisoner's duty to enter it into the paid column—this second column is for the money when it is paid, and that is not carried out, and it would have been the prisoner's duty to enter it on the money-paper—on the money-paper for that day there is no entry of that 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had never accounted to me for it—it was his duty to account to me every night, and I sign the cash-book for the amount—on the 18th of Jan. two lots were sold to Mr. Basely, amounting to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they are entered in the sale-book by the prisoner—they are not carried to the money account—they would not be carried there, but placed to an account we had with Mr. Basley—if it were paid at an after period the prisoner should enter it in his daily cash-book—on the 29th of Jan. Mr. Basley bought one lot for 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—supposing that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to be paid the next day, it ought to appear in the prisoner's cash-book—there is no entry of that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or of the 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was nothing to prevent the prisoner entering it—the book was before him—I know of no reason why be should not enter it—there was no sale on the 30th, and no confusion then—he has never paid that money, or accounted for it, form that time to this—he had no authority from me to mix up these payment with any other transaction whatever—he had no authority to mix it up with any transaction, when he might have bought goods for another person, or any transaction of his own—he knew well that these things were to be kept separate from all other trans<lb></lb>actions—it was for that purpose the daily cash-book was kept, and the sale<lb></lb>ledger and the money-paper—I know of no reason why the prisoner should not have made the entry at the time he received the money, and paid it over to me.</p>

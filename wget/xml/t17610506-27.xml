               <p>Elizabeth Smith. I belong to Sir Charles Buck. We missed several things at the fire in <placeName id="t17610506-27-crimeloc146">Glass-house-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17610506-27-crimeloc146" type="placeName" value="Glass-house-street"></interp>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see them, or either of them, since you missed them?</p>
               <p>E. Smith. I saw them again at justice Fielding's. I cannot swear to the ring, I believe it to be Sir Charles's property.</p>
               <p>Jane Barker. I bought a gown sprigged with flowers, and a capuchin, of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>J. Barker. I cannot say to the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago?</p>
               <p>J. Barker. It may be near a fortnight ago?</p>
               <p>Q. Was it since the fire in Glass-house-street?</p>
               <p>J Barker. It was since that. [A gown produced in court.] This is the gown.</p>
               <p>Q. to E. Smith. Look at that gown. Do you know it?</p>
               <p>E. Smith. This is my property, the same I lost at the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>J. Barker. I don't know that ever I saw him before?</p>
               <p>Q. Do you deal in such things?</p>
               <p>J. Barker. I deal in buying and selling of cloaths. The prisoner lived within four doors of us. I knew his wife, but not him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before justice Fielding with him?</p>
               <p>J. Barker. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say there?</p>
               <p>J Barker. He said a man gave them him in a bundle at the corner of Saville row.</p>
               <p>James Mortimore. I am a constable. When I took the prisoner he denied the fact.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take him?</p>
               <p>Mortimore. I took him in Leicester-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>Mortimore. He is a chairman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him?</p>
               <p>Mortimore. I did. I found nothing at all upon him. I carried him before justice Fielding. [He produced a gold ring.] I had this ring from Mrs. Barker.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176105060059"></xptr>Q. to Mrs. Barker. Did you deliver this ring to the constable?</p>
               <p>J. Barker. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you it?</p>
               <p>J. Barker. I had it of the prisoner's wife. The prisoner said he knew nothing of the ring when I produced it before the justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I carried a lady home one night, and picked up this bundle in the street, and the very next morning I sold that gown to this woman. I did not know what was in the bundle, till I opened it, no more than the man in the moon.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>William Smith. I have known the prisoner 15 years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>Smith. I never knew any harm by him.</p>
               <p>Moses Oates. I have known him five years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character?</p>
               <p>Oates. An honest industrious man as ever lived.</p>
               <p>Daniel Burr. I have known him some time. I never knew any ill of him.</p>
               <p>John Lion. I have known him between 10 and 11 years. My lady Cooper uses my house. He has carried her some years.</p>
               <p>Richard Bourn. I have known him 15 years. He lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been his behaviour?</p>
               <p>Bourn. I never knew any thing of him but what was just and honest. He was so to me.</p>
               <p>James Dove. I have known him five years.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been his character?</p>
               <p>Dove. I never heard any ill of him in my lifetime.</p>
               <p>A witness. I have known him seven years. He carries several people of quality. I know nothing of him but what is just and honest.</p>
               <p>John Goodwin. I am his brother. I never knew any thing of him besides that of an honest character. How this came I cannot tell.</p>

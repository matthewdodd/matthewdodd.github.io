I am chief clerk and cashier to Higgins, Eagle &amp; Co.—I keep the books of the firm, and have them all here—the course of business is to enter the goods supplied to customers in the journal, and the goods so supplied and entered are posted to the debit of the customer in the ledger—when goods were paid for in cash it was the duty of the person</p>

               <p>holding the prisoner's position to debit himself in the cash-book with that amount, which would be posted to the credit of the customer's account in the ledger—in ordinary transactions goods were supplied and money paid, but in cases where acceptances are given the course is that the acceptances shall be entered to the debit of the customer the same as cash—that item so entered to the debit would be carried to the credit of the customer's account in the ledger, the same as cash, and a folio would be entered intimating that it had been carried into the cash-book—whether the prisoner would keep those acceptances in his cash-box or pay them into the bank, would vary according to circumstances—if the acceptance was discounted before it came to maturity, it would sometimes be taken up by a cheque of the firm, but not always—where it was taken up by a cheque of the firm a credit entry for the amount would appear on the credit side of the cash-book, and where the customer's cheque or money is received to take up the acceptance, it would appear on the debit side—where an acceptance is taken up by a cheque of the firm, there would be a credit entry in the cash-book, and a debit entry of the money received from the customers—it is our practice to put what we term exchange folios, a folio opposite the debit, indicating where the credit is made, and a folio opposite the credit, intimating where the debit is made—this would not be a ledger transaction—in the case where an acceptance is dishonoured, a cheque would be drawn by the firm, and entered on the credit side of the cash-book—where the bill is dishonored, the credit would be carried to the customer's account, which would be charged with it—the credit entry would have the folio of the ledger, and the entry in the ledger would have, the folio of the cash-book credit—when the customer paid the money it would appear on the debit side of the cash-book, and would be posted on the credit side of the ledger to the customer's credit, whose account would then be square, and the transaction in the cash-book would appear, the prisoner debiting himself with the acceptance, and crediting himself with the cheque or money to take up the acceptance—in McDarby's account here is a debit of 139<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for goods supplied between September 19th and October 19th inclusive—the cash-book containing the entry of McDarby's acceptances is missing—I last saw it in the autumn of 1867, in the prisoner's possession, but have not been able to find it since—McDarby's account is credited in the ledger with this acceptance, and bean a folio referring to the missing cash-book—McDarby's account stands debited with goods and credited by the acceptance which had been dis<lb></lb>counted—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is drawn in the prisoner's writing, and I find that be credits himself with it in March, 1866—it is the cheque given by the firm to pay McDarby's acceptance, and therefore that item appears to the credit of the prisoner's account—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), given by McDarby to take up his acceptance, is not debited in the prisoner's account—it nowhere appears to his debit—I find on the credit side the exchange folio 29, but at folio 29 on the debit side there is no entry—that folio 29 is a fictitious entry—in the course of writing, the figures indicating the folio would be made after the corresponding debit entry; it would not be made till he had made the entry on the debit side—this cheque of McDarby's did go through the prosecutor's bank—the prisoner's cash balance would be made up of the money in the bank, plus the money in the cash-box, and the amount of the cash balance would appear according to the debits in the cash-book—if any sum was not entered to the debit the cash balance would be so much less, and although the cheque might be carried to the cash</p>

               <p>nothing to do with the accounts—the stock in hand remaining unsold in 1867 was about 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and at the end of 1866 it was about the same—we do not value it at invoice prices, we put an actual value, according to the state of the market—if goods have increased in value, we take the increased value, and if lessened, the lesser value—the value is what the firm would have to give if ther went into the market and bought it on that day; the market price—a deficiency of 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not the correct term, it is not a de<lb></lb>ficiency on the transactions of the year's business, but it is a discrepancy, which is not accounted for by comparing the sales and profit on the sales with the expenses and outgoings—we arrived at it by comparing Mr. Edwards' books with Mr. Tester's, and therefore, there was a check so far as those books were concerned, in comparing the profit with the expenses-book, there is a discrepancy of about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; not a deficiency on the year's trading, but debiting the expenses, there is something wrong in the result—that discrepancy would not be at all affected by the variation of the market—this is the definite result, it has nothing to do with the diminished value of the goods—a balance sheet was struck at the end of 1866—that shows a deficiency, in the same manner as 1867, of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the balance sheet con<lb></lb>sists of the entire transactions of one year—we have premises in the Curtain Road—I will pledge my oath that in that balance sheet for 1866 a deficiency is shown—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the balance sheet for 1867; but it will not show the amount; it shows a loss, in 1867, of 446<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that re<lb></lb>presents the amount unaccounted for between profits and expenses—we took the bad debts at a valuation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You value them at 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., suppose they were to produce 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that would lessen the amount? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it would not show in that year, it would show in the following year—the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. does not include the dis<lb></lb>crepancy of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the previous year—the balance less 446<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. means that comparing the profits made, which are ascertained from various books, and the expenses compared with the profits, there is an amount of 446<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. unaccounted for—during the whole of this time the prisoner's accounts were not checked or audited by me—they were partially checked by Mr. Hutchinson, but to what extent I am not able to say—I was sometimes in the habit of taking money from the prisoner, and giving him an I O U; but the practice invariably was that in receiving money for my private purposes, the amounts were entered in the cash-book, and initialed by myself, to show that I had received the money—the practice ought always to have been so, and it was so, with very rare exceptions—I believe my partners occasionally gave I O U's for money—Mr. Tester also kept the private ledger for the firm—he did not assist in the warehouse; he may have done so voluntarily, but it was not part of his usual work.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Instead of going to your bank, you would take your own money from Tester, and give him an acknowledgment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; almost invariably the amount was entered in the cash-book, and initialed by us—it would go to our private accounts, and he would get credit for it—Mr. Hutchinson used to call for the cash balance occasionally, and the balance would be made up by the amount in the bank, and the amount in the cash-box—he was liable to be called upon at any time for the cash balance—when we made up our account, I put on one side our expenses and outgoings, and on the other our sales and profits, and comparing the one with the other, I find in one year 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in the other 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., less than there ought to be.</p>

I am one of the firm of Higgins, Eagle &amp; Hutchinson—in January last the prisoner called me into the counting-house, and said that he objected very much to Mr. Hutchinson going over the books, that they were all right, and he considered it casting a reflection on him; and he talked of resigning—Mr. Hutchinson was ill—he came down twice a week, and then Mr. Edwards went on—the prisoner asked for a partnership, which we did not entertain for a moment; and then he gave notice, in March, 1868.</p>

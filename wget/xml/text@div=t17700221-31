On the 13th of this instant, about a quarter past eight, my servant called me down; I found about a dozen people in my warehouse. They informed me, they had taken the prisoner, who had stole this piece of cotton, (produced in court) my property. They told me, another with him had escaped. I sent my footboy for a constable. Here is my stamp upon it, the pattern is my own; no other Draper has the pattern but myself; there are twenty-eight yards and a half of it. The real value of it, as it stands me in, is fifty-three shillings and four pence.</p>

            . We opened shop about seven. I think it was about a quarter past eight I saw the prisoner standing on the inside the warehouse, near the door. I was near the farther end; there was no other person in the warehouse but him and I. Soon after, a person halloed to me, and said, Your piece is gone. I looked up, and saw the prisoner was not in the warehouse.</p>

            . Last Tuesday was seven-night I was crying old clothes in the city. I saw four or five fellows run past Mr. Saxby's door, and one go in and take a piece of linen or cotton, and give it to another. I was on the other side the way, and his back was towards me. I do not know who it was.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This evidence did swear before Mr. alderman Crosby, that he did see this prisoner take the piece of cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. to Emanuel. Did you give such an account before the alderman?</p>
               <p>Emanuel. I can't tell, because I have got a great family.</p>
               <p>Q. Would your having a great family cause you to forget what you saw so lately?</p>
               <p>Emanuel. Yes, sometimes.</p>
               <p>W. Lovit. I was at work in my master's shop in Gutter-lane. I heard this Jew cry out, stop thief! I ran out. He said, There he goes, that is he, pointing to the prisoner. I ran; the cloth lay on the ground; I trod upon that, and followed the prisoner into a court; there I took him. I brought him back to this Emanuel; the Jew. He told me, he saw the prisoner take the piece of cloth out of Mr. Saxby's shop. The prisoner said, he was not the thief. The Jew said, You are the thief; I saw you take it out, and give it to another man at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. to Emanuel. You are sworn to tell the truth; declare it as you ought to do.</p>
               <p>Emanuel. I can't say I saw the prisoner's face when he took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the man that took it, upon your oath?</p>
               <p>Emanuel. I do not know.</p>

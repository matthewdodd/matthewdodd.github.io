                  </hi>. I live at No. 11, London-road. The prisoner was my service—on the morning of the 27th of Jan. I went up stairs and saw my husband's watch safe in the bed-room—the prisoner was at that time gone out on an errand—I left the room, leaving the watch on the table, and put the clothes-basket at the room door, ready to be brought down—I went down and saw the prisoner put her hand to the mat at the street door, in order to shut it—I told her to take a can of water up stairs, put it down at the room door, and bring down the clothes-basket, but not to go into the room—she came down and I desired her to go for some honey to a shop over the way—I stood by the clothes-basket till she came back—she gave it into my hand and I sent her then to Mr. Bruton's mother's, No 30, Joiner-street—she went there to wash our clothes and took the clothes-basket with her—she left me about half-past ten o'clock, and was to remain there till dinner time—I went up stairs immediately, and my husband's watch was gone—I went up I am sure in one minute—there were other persons in the house—Mr. Bailey and his mother and sister, and one servant belonging to the house, whose name is Emma—she was in the coffee-room at the lower part of the house—I am not aware whether she left the house about that time—I very seldom saw the girl—I did not hear the street door shut or open during the time I was going up stairs—I was going to dress—I went straight to the table where the watch was—I am confident there was not time for any person to have gone out of the house in that short time—I could hear the street door shut or open in any room in the house—I am confident no one went out—when I missed the watch I went to Mr. Bruton, who was in the coffee-room, and he went to Joiner-street—I saw the watch produced by Mordy, the next night.</p>

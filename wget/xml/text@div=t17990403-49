             sworn. - On the 18th of March I was ordered to come on board the ship to attend my business.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business? - A. Selling old hats.</p>
               <p>Q. Ordered by whom? - A. By the mate of the ship, that was at seven o'clock on Monday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030032"></xptr>evening, he wanted a couple of hats; I finished my business, and went towards home, and as I came through Houndsditch, the prisoner at the bar saw me go along with a bag under my arm, and a hat in my hand; he called after me, Jew, will you buy a hat; as I was in the habit of buying and selling old hats, I told him I could not see it by the dark, I must look at it by the light, it was about eight o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Not before that; I went home with the prisoner to my habitation; he asked me half-a-guinea for it, I gave him nine shillings; I offered it for sale to one Mr. Salmon, a tallow-chandler, he offered me six shillings and another hat worth about two shillings; I went out with some old hats upon the quay, saw Mr. Littler, I asked him whether he would buy a hat; he looked at one, it would not suit, he looked at another, it would not suit, then he looked at another, and that would not suit; I then pulled a hat off my head, and said, sir, will you buy this, it was undressed; Mr. Littler viewed the hat, and he immediately swore that the hat belonged to him; I was charged with the hat before the Lord-Mayor, and I told him how I came by the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you afterwards light of the prisoner at the bar? - A. As I was out upon bail, I saw the prisoner in Widegate-alley, Bishopsgate-street, and I saw an officer nigh at hand of the name of Jewell, a broker; he took charge of the prisoner, and brought him before the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were out upon bail, charged with this offence yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he with you in your house? - A. About five minutes, to the best of my knowledge: when the prisoner was taken by the officer, he asked him to give an account of how he came by the hat, and asked him if he sold Mr. Chapman a hat upon the 18th of March; the prisoner said, I sold him a hat, and what of that; he was then given in charge to another officer, and he told the other officer that he had sold me the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the officer? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Littler). Q. Did Chapman tell you that the prisoner had admitted to the constable that he had sold him the hat? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Chapman. He told the Lord-Mayor that he sold me the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Littler). Were you present when the prisoner was before the Lord Mayor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his examination taken in writing? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know nothing of either of the parties, or the hat.</p>

                  </hi>. On Monday and Tuesday, the 9th and 10th. of No<lb></lb>vember, I was lodging at 19, Church Lane—the prisoner had been lodging in that house about five weeks—about 10 o'clock, on the morning of the 10th, I was standing by the fire in the kitchen lighting my pipe; the prisoner came up and made two plunges with a knife at my left shoulder—I turned round sharply and threw my arm up as I saw his hand over me, and I received the blow on my arm—I did not see the knife till after I had received the blow, and then I saw it in his hand—he did not say anything—I shouted out that I was stabbed; the blood came—Lee and another man they call "<hi rend="italic">Tyke</hi>," came up, and Lee took the knife from him—I went to the police-station—I had spoken to the prisoner on the morning of the 9th when I was having my breakfast—he had the same knife in his hands twisting it about, and he said he would bury it in the heart of a constable who had locked him up three times, and I said "Get up, you d——d old rat, and let me have my breakfast"—this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the kitchen of this lodging house on the 10th November—I went to get a light for my pipe about 1.15 a.m.—I saw the prisoner sitting down on the floor when I went in, and he was picked up and placed on a form by two men—Flynn was up <hi rend="italic">again</hi> the fireplace—the prisoner ran up to him and made an attempt to strike at him; he put his left arm up the second time and said "I am stabbed; he has got a knife"—I turned the prisoner down on the floor and picked up the knife from under the form—the first time he attempted to strike Flynn on the shoulder, and then he struck him on the arm—he did not say a word—I was not two minutes in the place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at 4, High Street, Bloomsbury—on Tuesday morning, 10th November, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I went to the police-station in George Street, St. Giles's, and found Flynn there—he had lost a great deal of blood; his coat was cut on the shoulder, but there was no wound on his flesh there—on the left fore arm there was a deep punctured wound, with an enormous quantity of blood infused into the cellular tissue of the arm; the nerve, I judge, to have been divided, because the fingers were and are now paralyzed, and I think will remain so permanently—I judge that an artery was cut by the effusion of blood into the fore arm and the extensor muscle of the fore arm—this knife is the sort of instrument by which it could be done—there was a stain of blood on it</p>

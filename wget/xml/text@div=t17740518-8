               <p>Q. Did you ever find your clothes again?</p>
               <p>Bruce. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not toss up at all?</p>
               <p>Bruce. Yes; I told them I would have nothing to do with them. My bundle contained the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them); I told the landlord they had robbed me; he threatned if I made a disturbance to send for a constable and send me to gaol. I got hold of a piece of the money they called guineas; it is a counterfeit.</p>

            . I live in King-street, Tower-hill, the Queen's Head; I remember the two prisoners and the prosecutor being at my house on the 7th of May; the prosecutor had a handkerchief when he came in; they were in the kitchen; there was nobody there but the prisoners, the prosecutor, and another; after the men were gone, the prosecutor said, landlord, the man has gone away with my clothes; I asked what man; he said the man that was gone away; he had been gone some time.</p>


               <p>Q. Which of the men was it that was gone out?</p>
               <p>Andrews. Mecum. The prisoners had been in the house that day before; there was a man standing by him; I asked him if he was concerned in taking the clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you threaten the prosecutor that if be made any disturbance you would send him to gaol?</p>
               <p>Andrews. He said he had lost the clothes at gaming; he said they laid twenty pounds against his clothes, that they named a halfpenny three times out of four; I said if I had known as how they had been gaming, I would have sent for an officer, and sent them to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bruce. Do you hear what this man says, is it true?</p>
               <p>Bruce. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand he had been gaming with them, or they gaming among themselves?</p>
               <p>Andrews. He said he lost his clothes by gaming and they ran away with them afterwards.</p>

               <p>Mecum's Defence.</p>
               <p>I went with this man to Tower-hill; we went into a public house, and there we met with Bruce; Bruce and I tossed up for a pint of beer; then Bruce said he would not toss up for any more beer, he would bet his clothes against some money; I betted twenty guineas against his clothes, and won them; when I had won them I asked him if I should have them, and he gave them to me, and said they were mine, I had won them; the bundle was not opened; he said they were worth twenty guineas.</p>
               <p>Newland's Defence.</p>
               <p>I met the prisoner on Tower-hill; I thought he was an old ship-mate of mine; when I found my mistake I asked him to have part of a pint of beer; we went into the Queen's Head; there was Mecum and another in the box tossing up for a pint of beer; Bruce was drawn in to toss for another pint; after this they ageed to toss for the clothes against a sum of money; I have forgot the sum. He owned before two proper witnesses of the Surry militia that he had won the clothes. I know nothing of the gaming, or gambling, or correspondence one way or other: I am a baker, and am in the Surry militia.</p>

I am single and am living at 37, White Street, Long Lane—at 11.30 on Saturday night I met the prisoner and he treated me with drink, and We went together to a coffee-house in Blackfriars Road, and we went into a room by ourselves—he gave me some money and asked me to stay all night, and when I declined he commenced rowing, and before I was aware of it I felt blood coming from my chest—my dress was undone—I said "My God! what have you done?"—he rushed out on to the landing and cried "Landlord! Landlord! come and see what I have done. I've done it," and produced a white-handled pen-knife as the landlord came up, who kept him till a policeman came—I was taken to the hospital in a cab.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoners into custody. I took Read at his house in North-street, and questioned him how he came by the plates found at Cook's; he said he had them from a lady, but refused to tell who she was. I found a pair of boots, some flowerpots and a china cup, at the cottage of one King. I took Gentle the same evening, and found three keys on him; he said one was the key of his box at his master's, and the others were keys of two boxes which he had at King's cottage, who was also in Mr. Mortlock's employ. One of them was a skeleton key, the wards were filed out. He then acknowledged that it was not the key of his box, but the key of his master's desk, and that he filed out the wards himself to fit his master's desk. I found it did open the desk. When I returned from King's I told him what I had found; he said they were all his master's property, he had taken them and had robbed his master of a great deal more, and had given nearly all the property to Read, who disposed of it, and brought him his share of the money; that he had received about 80 l. as his share, and gave nearly all of it to a young woman named Wilmot, who he was about to be married to. I searched her boxes where she was in service, and found a china cup, a smelling bottle, with a book of a Saving Bank, as a receipt for 75 l. Wilmot came into the presence of Gentle, and said she had the money, cup and smelling-bottle from him. He acknowledged it, and said it was Mr. Mortlock's property, and the money was the produce of the stolen goods. I said nothing to induce him to confess, and the Magistrate reasoned with him on the impropriety of signing his confession - I saw them both sign them.</p>

I resided at No. 14 and 19 in North-street, Manchester-square, at the time, and used to advertize the articles as the property of a lady embarrassed, in the Morning Post. I sold six services of plates to Mr. Cook, No. 123, Wardour-street, for ten guineas, with three china jars, five other jars, six basons and covers. I represented them as belonging to a lady. In consequence of distress, I planned with Gentle the mode of robbing Mr. Mortlock, and I agreed to give him half the articles sold for.</p>

               <p>GENTLE'S Defence. I lived five years with the prosecutor. I had only 1 l. a week, and I think I deserved 28 s. or 30 s. I throw myself upon your mercy.</p>
               <p>READ'S Defence (written). I stand before you a dreadful example of the consequences arising from a master overstepping his line of duty, by depriving a servant unjustly of the character due to his services. Previous to my entering the employ of my prosecutor, I had lived fifteen years in some of the first families in London. I served my prosecutor for three years, in a situation of considerable confidence, with fidelity, and left him with assurances of support in placing me in business, and to which my father added the offer to him of 200 l. to promote that object. From some motives, of which I am ignorant, I was suddenly deprived of my prosecutor's and my father's flattering support, and found myself divested of friends, character, and employ. By casual employment, and some money saved by industry, I waited in hopes of the offer of some other situation, till becoming deeply embarrassed, I became involved in the charges which has led to the present indictment. My prosecutor having known my family for nearly forty years, and myself from childhood, deprived of the testimony of my friends from the influence of my prosecutor over their minds, I throw myself on the mercy of your Lordship and a Jury of my countrymen, and shall bow with humble submission to their judgment.</p>

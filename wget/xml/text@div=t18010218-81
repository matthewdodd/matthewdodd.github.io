               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.How many coils<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180050"></xptr>of rope did you receive on account of Messrs. Hibbert and Company? - A. I don't know.</p>

               <p>Q.This coil of rope being left in the rackle-house, did you put it into the Commerce alone? - A. No; with other coils of rope, upon the 19th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, one mark was rather defaced, the chalk mark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that likely to be defaced by moving the rope away? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any rope put on board the Commerce lighter? - A. I did, but I do not recollect the mark; I was to take the Commerce down the River to the West Indian.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Batt go with you? - A. Yes; we went down from Wiggin's-quay, to Deptford; after we had delivered some goods on board the Ann, we delivered the remainder on board the West Indian.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do with the Commerce afterwards? - A. I brought her up to the ship called the Portland, at Wapping, and made her fast to the Portland, and came a-shore about nine o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.Where did the Portland lay at this time? - A. At Wapping.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the Saturday night? - A. Yes; I did not go on board the lighter for several days afterwards; the night was dark when I quitted her.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Were any small packages on board your vessel? - A. Yes; there were some under the locker, and I felt about that I might not leave any behind.</p>
               <p>JOHN GOTTIN sworn. I am a surveyor to the Thames Police Institution: At one o'clock in the morning of the 19th of January, I went on board a lighter loaded with sugar, lying along-side the Enterprize West Indiaman, I don't know who the lighter belonged to, she was in the employ of Mr. Briant; on looking under the stern sheets, I observed a coil of cordage matted and packed; from that situation, I considered it as being illegally obtained; I put a man on board the Enterprize, to see who came and fetched this lighter away: in the morning, between eight and nine o'clock, the prisoner,

            , came on board the lighter to take her away; I stepped into the lighter, and requested he would let me look down the sore peak, which was locked; he said he could not, for he had not the keys; I asked him if he knew of any thing down aft; he said, yes, there was a coil of cordage, or some cordage; I asked him how he came by it; he told me he took it out of a lighter belonging to Mr. Ogle; I asked him how he came to do so, what reason he had for taking it out of Mr. Ogle's lighter; he said, because it was in his craft; I asked him if he had any directions with respect to that particular coil of cordage, or whether he had a general direction, if he should meet with such a coil of cordage in such a situation; he said he intended to take it to Mr. Ogle, but that he had no directions at all; this proving not satisfactory, I took him and the cordage to the Police-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the other prisoner? - A. I did not; I looked at the mark, and I saw it marked R. S. B. with a w at top, and No. 10 at the bottom; I could not discover the mark at first, it being dark; it had been rolled in the dirt, and by some means had been defaced.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has had the custody of the rope? - A. I have had it ever since, till this morning I delivered it to the officer of the Court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. As soon as the prisoner, Davidson, came on board, you asked him what he had got aft? - A. Yes, and he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not ask him who was with him? - A. He said, Ferguson was the person who was with him, and helped him to take the coil of rope out of the lighter.</p>
               <p>JOHN BRIANT sworn. - Q. Were the two prisoners in your service upon the 13th of January? - A. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. In what lighter? - A. I do not pretend to do any business at the water-side; my watermen do all the business.</p>
               <p>JOHN GILMAN sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the Thames Police-office; I apprehended Ferguson in consequence of a warrant from the office: nothing particularly passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was upon the information that was given by the other man, that the warrant was granted? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. In whose employ were you in the month of January? - A. In the employ of Mr. Briant.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Davidson in his service likewise? - A. Yes; on the 13th I was at work in the lug-boat: on Sunday, the 11th, I went down about half past eleven o'clock on board the Friendship lighter.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you, on that day, see any lighter belonging to Mr. Ogle? - A. Yes, the Commerce; she was laying<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180051"></xptr>a-stern of the ship called the Portland; we went on board that lighter, as we had occasion to hand the hurdles over that lighter to put them in our own, and there we found a coil of rope.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or Davidson do any thing with that rope? - A. Yes, we took it out of the lighter for safety.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you put it? - A. We put it down out stern sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to alter the mark that was upon that rope in any one respect? - A.Not at all; as we took it we left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any difficulty in pulling off the mark? - A.We could have pulled it off with our hands.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the mark upon? - A. Upon a mat; we took it only with a view of bringing it to Mr. Ogle, when the lighter came up;  Davidson told me that he should bring the lighter up on the Thursday morning, and then he would take it himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You and Davidson were employed by Mr. Ogle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You received no direction from Messrs. Ogle to take care of their property? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.What day of the month was this? - A. It was upon the 11th.</p>
               <p>Q. You had the rope in your possession all Sunday, Monday night, and Tuesday morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew where Messrs. Ogle lived? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you take the pains to find out Messrs. Ogle? - A. No, I had other business to do; it was done with no other intent but honesty.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night were you taken up? - A.Between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had all day on Monday and Tuesday, and yet you told niether Messrs. Ogle, or made any enquiry about them - Upon your oath, did you mention it either to Mr. Ogle or his servants, or any one member living, besides the prisoner at the bar, that you had found it? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Upon your oath, the reason why you did not take any means to tell Mr. Ogle, was, because Davidson said he would go himself and give it Mr. Ogle? - A. He said, I know Mr. Ogle, I know him to be an honest man, I will give it to Mr. Ogle.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know where Mr. Ogle lives? - A. I do not, more than a child unborn.</p>

             sworn. - I am a lighterman and waterman; the prisoners were taken into custody on the 13th of January, on a Tuesday; on the Sunday morning I saw this coil of rope in a lighter called the Commerce; it laid in the middle of the lighter for every body to see; I saw it was a light rope.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Did you take particular notice of this coil of rope? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen it now? - A. I saw it rolled into Court; there is the mark I made with my knife at the time, to see whether it was a coil of rope; the man that was along with me thought it was a mat of brimstone.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never discovered any other mark, except that you put upon it yourself? - A.None at all.</p>
               <p>Q.How long have you known Davidson? - A. I have known him since I was first apprentice.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.When did you first hear that either of those prisoners were taken up? - A. Not till a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what they were taken up for? - A. I heard that they were taken up for a coil of rope, it was at a public-house; it was mentioned to one Walker; I told 
               <persName id="t18010218-81-person541">Walker</persName>
             that I had been such a coil of rope, and Walker said, I will give your name, and Robert Barrowby's name; I had seen Walker every day for a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what account was it that you mentioned to 
               <persName id="t18010218-81-person542">Walker</persName>
             that you had seen such a coil of rope? - A. I told him the night before he gave me the subpoena; I did not know the men were taken to the Compter, nor nothing else.</p>

               <p>ROBERT BARROWBY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a waterman, I know Tunk; I knew Davidson before he was taken up, which was upon Tuesday, January 13.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been on the River the Sunday before that? - A. Yes, I was on board a sloop called the Jacob, which was bound for Dieppe, in France; we had occasion to go on board a lighter to make a rope fast, it was the Commerce, Tunk was with me; I saw something laying at the bottom; he stepped down into the lighter, and saw it was a coil of rope, (the coil of rope produced); it is as near like that I saw in the lighter as any one I can see; I did not take notice of any mark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.This coil of rope, when you saw it, was lying in the bottom of the Commerce? - A. Yes; I knew who the coil of rope belonged to, though Mr. Ogle's name was not upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying it was Mr. Ogle's? - A. Mr. Ogle's name was upon the craft, and I supposed the coil of rope belonged to Mr. Ogle; I could not tell whom it belonged to.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you took pains to enquire? - A.Not in the least, I heard no more about it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a very good character. <rs id="t18010218-81-verdict443" type="verdictDescription">

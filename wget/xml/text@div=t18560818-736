                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman. I was passing along Thames-street, on Thursday, 17th July, about half past 2 o'clock in the day; I had a little canvas bag in my pocket—I took it out to pay a man for two herrings—I returned the bag into my pocket again—there was about four shillings in it—I went towards Upper Thames-street—the prisoner was standing against a wall, within about a couple of doors of No. 122, Lower Thames-street, and there were two men standing parallel with him—one was just off the kerb, and the other on the kerb—when I came up they closed together, and I could not pass through—I stood a moment, and told them I wanted to go through—the prisoner took hold of my left arm and gave me a violent pinch, and with his other hand he took my bag out of my pocket, and passed it to the other two—I did not see him pass it to them, but he passed by them to go towards the wall in Thames-street—he then passed down Dark House-lane—I called out to him, and said, "You have robbed me"—I called out, "Stop thief!"—a postman went after him—I followed, and called, "Stop thief!"—he was stopped by the people before I could reach him, and a policeman took him—I never got my bag again—there was nothing found on him—I am quite certain he is the man that took it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You were asked before the Magistrate, whether I was the person that took your money, and you said, "No." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No; said nothing of the kind—I said I was positive you were the man.</p>

                  </hi>. On that Thursday, I was near to Lower Thames-street—I heard a cry of, "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner, to the best of my belief, running away—I attempted to catch him—he had this coat on his arm—I caught the coat—he left it with me, and went on—he is the man who was running away from the cry of, "Stop thief!"—there were three or four after him, but none before him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I deny all knowledge of this coat; it is a boy's coat; I was going towards the Steam Boat Pier, and saw a crowd; the prosecutor came up and accused me of robbing him; I said, "You are mistaken;" I walked on, and he followed, and gave me into custody.</p>

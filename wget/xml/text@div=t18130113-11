            . I am a constable of the city of London. On the 21st of December last, I was in West-street, West Smithfield, about half past five in the evening, I saw the prisoner. I was in company with another constable; that constable is since dead. The prisoner passed me. I perceived that he had something concealed under his coat. I stopped him, and asked him, what he had. He replied, nothing. Yes, said I, you have nothing. I opened his coat, and found these pieces of brass underneath his coat. I took him into a house, and searched him. He had one of these two pieces of brass-in his breeches pocket, this piece of brass in his waistcoat pocket, and this piece of brass in his hat, wrapped up in his pocket handkerchief. I immediately took him in custody, and found out where he worked, and where the property was stolen from.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by the Mint—on Wednesday night, 24th March, about 10 o'clock, I went to the Windsor Castle beer-house, at the corner of Hoxton-square, with Inspector Fife, and policemen Boulby and Miller—on our entering, the prisoner, who was inside the door, immediately stood up, and I said, "Mrs. England, I have received instructions to look after you; you are suspected of dealing largely in counterfeit coin"—I saw her move her left arm under her cloak—Miller seized it, and she dropped from her left hand a paper packet, part of</p>

               <p>which fell on the seat, and part on the ground—Fife picked up a por<lb></lb>tion of it—four packets; one containing seven half-crowns; two containing seven shillings each, and one containing ten half-crowns, separately wrapped up, and on the floor was a loose half-crown and four shillings, all counter<lb></lb>feit—Boulby said, "She has dropped this black bag," meaning the prisoner's daughter, (<hi rend="italic">Seepage</hi> 446)—I said, "Pick it up, and give it to me"—he did—I opened it—it contained seven counterfeit half-crowns, separately wrapped, and two counterfeit shillings—the half-crowns and one of the shillings cor<lb></lb>respond in date with those the prisoner dropped, and paper was <hi rend="italic">lapped</hi> between each coin—I took the prisoner to the station—she resisted very much.</p>

On 14th March, about 9 at night, I was in Hoxton-market, and saw the prisoner and her daughter walking together—I followed them to the Windsor Castle—I then met Brannan—we found the prisoner sitting behind the door—Brannan said, "Well, Mrs. England"—she imme<lb></lb>diately got up—he seized her right arm, and I seized her left—she dropped a parcel, which burst—Fife picked it up, and I saw the money taken out of it—she was very violent, and said that somebody else had thrown it down—she said, "Allow me to put my shawl on; I have got no more bad money about me"—I told her I could not let her hands go.</p>

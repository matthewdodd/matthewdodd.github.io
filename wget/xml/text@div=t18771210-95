                  </hi>. I am a marine modeller, of 7, Crown Court, Went-worth Street, Whitechapel—I lived with the prisoner's wife after he deserted her—on Thursday night, 22nd November, about eight o'clock, the prisoner came rushing up the stairs and burst my door open—he had a knife open in his hand, and said he intended to commit murder—he stabbed me in the cheek—I struggled with him and tried to defend myself with a piece of iron which was lying in the fender—I made a blow at him—it must have struck him on the head—it was in the dark, for he kicked over the table with the candle on it—I then received a stab in the shoulder, and again in the muscles of the arm—I closed with him and threw him across the bed, holding him down—he then stabbed me again in the thigh—I took the knife from him, and in doing so was cut on the knuckles and wrist—I found myself getting weak from loss of blood, and I let him go—his wife ran for a policeman, and when she came back he armed himself with a pair of scissors which was lying on the table and made a thrust at her, but did not hit her—he then ran</p>

               <p>downstairs—I went to the hospital and had my wounds dressed—the prisoner was taken, and I gave him in charge—on the way to the station he said "I ain't settled you, but I mean to settle you; and I am only very sorry I did not serve her the same"—I did not encourage his wife to leave him—I had been living with her about three months—before that I was paying her rent and my own too—I gave the knife to the policeman.</p>

I am a surgeon of 2, Spital-Square—on the evening of 22nd November I was called to Commercial Street to the pro<lb></lb>secutor, who was suffering from eight wounds about the body—the prin<lb></lb>cipal wound was a large wound on the right cheek extending from the outer angle of the right eye to the angle of the mouth; it was about 3 1/2 inches in length, severing all the muscles, tissues, and vessels on that side of the face—the other wounds were <hi rend="italic">over</hi> the bridge of the nose, a small incised wound about an inch long on the right shoulder, a punctured wound on the left upper arm, two wounds on the outside of the left wrist, one outside the left thigh, and one incised wound across the middle finger of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> left hand—such an instrument as this would inflict such wounds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a paper-hanger, and carry on business in Newgate-street. I acted as one of the trustees of Mr. Denham, the iron<lb></lb>monger, in Bull and Mouth-street—the prisoner was in the service of the trustees—among other duties that he had to perform, he had to collect and receive money on our account—he was to set down in the book what he received and to account to me every Saturday night—there was a day-book, a cash-book, and a till-book, which are here—there is no entry in either of them of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received by the prisoner of Mr. Curtis on the week ending</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who introduced the prisoner to the concern? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Burrell, one of the trustees—Mr. Brown was not the person to receive money—he is dead—I never received money through Brown's hands, and do not know that he received any—I have looked into the books to see whether either of these sums are entered there in the following week—I find no such sums entered throughout the whole books—I remember the prisoner going away ill—I cannot say exactly when it was—I do not know that the elder Denham received money from the prisoner while he was in the shop—Brown has sent in an account—I do not recollect that I authorized my solicitor to write to the prisoner requesting his account that it might be settled—I directed him to request the prisoner's attendance—I do not know that he was then in the Ophthalmic Institution—I do not think he was—I distinctly say that I have looked through the books and do not find any account of the sums in question.</p>

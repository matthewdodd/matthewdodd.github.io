                  </hi>. I live in Gloucester-terrace, West<lb></lb>green, Tottenham. The prisoner was in my service for three months—I discharged her on Sunday night, 24th June, for stopping out after time—I had told her I should not allow her to come into my house—I had warned her about it on two previous occasions—she left with an order from me to return the next day for her box and money—she did not come till Tuesday morning, imme<lb></lb>diately after I had gone out—I had left orders that her box should not be given to her, nor should she be paid till she came in the evening and saw me—I had called at the station, and a policeman came to my house—the prisoner came about 7 o'clock in the evening, and I told her that some one had been robbing me, and I was anxious that she should be perfectly clear, and if she would allow me to see her box I could give her a character—I asked her if she had any objection to have her box searched—she said she had no reason against having her box searched, but, on the contrary, I was welcome to search her box, there was nothing in it—I told the other servant to call the policeman, and he came and went up stairs with me and the prisoner to search</p>

               <p>her box—she opened her box herself, and turned out a number of things, and endeavoured to secrete those things belonging to me under her dress—we found a towel marked with my name, and two handkerchiefs belonging to my wife, with her mark on them, and a number of other things, my pro<lb></lb>perty, with no mark—I gave her in charge—some starch was found, which she placed under her shawl—when she was requested to stand up and shake herself, these things fell—the towel and handkerchief appeared to be my property—I said, "There is no doubt now, Delaney, who has been robbing me, and I have no alternative, in justice to society and myself, but to give you into charge"—I cannot recollect anything that she said—she brought back a petticoat of her mistress's that she stated she had been wearing—she stated something afterwards at the police court about the towel and handkerchiefs—she might say something to my wife about the towel and handkerchiefs when we found them, but nothing that I recollect.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she say something, or did she not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect anything; she was very much confused—you do not suppose a woman would stand and say nothing—she might say many things, but I do not recollect—she said at the police station that the towel was one that her mistress had given her to use, and she did not know how the handkerchiefs got in her box—Mrs. Thwaites was present when the officer and I searched the prisoner's box—she is not here—I do not know that I have stated before that the prisoner endeavoured to secrete some things under her dress—I have never been before a counsel till now—I was before a Magistrate, but he desired me to state my case in few words—there were some other things found that I have no doubt were my property—I stated that before the police, but I also said I should be very sorry to swear to anything that had no mark—the prisoner left me on Sunday night—I discharged her for stopping out an hour and a quarter after time—I dis<lb></lb>charged her then and there—I did not allow her to remain till Monday morning—she returned at a quarter past 6 o'clock on Sunday night—she was to have been home at 5 o'clock—I did not pay her her wages when I discharged her; she did not ask for them—I told her to call the next day, and she should have them—she did not call till early in the morning on Tuesday, immediately after I had left—she was requested to come in the evening, and she did, about 7 o'clock—I did not see her in the morning—I believe she did not then make application for her wages, she only saw a servant—I suspected her before I discharged her on Sunday night—she did not ask for her wages on Tuesday evening—I told her I was prepared to pay her, and asked her if she would allow her box to be searched—she said she had not the slightest objection—her box was in her room up stairs—she went up stairs with me and the constable, and produced the key and opened the box herself—I had not told her what I suspected her of stealing—she turned most of the things out Of the box herself—the servant who lived with me previous to this prisoner I think remained about two years—I paid her all her wages at the time she left; every penny I owed her, as far as I recollect—the prisoner came to us about three months ago, and previous to that we had three servants—we have only two now—the one that I discharged, left because I reduced my establishment—this is the first time I ever made a charge against any servant for robbing me—no one ever summoned me to the County Court for wages—I have had servants ten years—the prisoner brought back a petticoat on Tuesday; she said she had put it on—it was Mrs. Thwaites's practice to give the servants a towel when they wanted it for their own personal use—the prisoner said this towel was</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, N</hi> 44). I was called to go to Mr. Thwaites's house; I stood by while the prisoner searched the box, she seemed in a very agitated state—first of all she said there was nothing in her box, afterwards she unlocked the box, and turned out this towel, and these handkerchiefs, which were identified—she did not give any excuse when she took them out—Mr. Thwaites said, "That is mine;" and then the handkerchiefs, she said, "They are mine"—the prisoner did not say how they got there.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was this mentioned before?<hi rend="italic"> A</hi>.

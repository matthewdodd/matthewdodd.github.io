                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> If I was there on the 29th March, and offered a bad shilling, and the young man tarred me in the way he says, is it likely I should go on the next Saturday night and give him another; if I did I could expect nothing else but that I should get into the station. I get my living by exchanging articles of hardware for old clothes. I was coming home and went into the public-house, not with the intention of changing Anything, but I thought I had three halfpence in my pocket, and when I got in I found I only had an old and new halfpenny, and thought it was three halfpence. I gave the sixpence for the gin. He never told me that I had given him a bad sixpence, and I did not know it; so I had no occasion to go out My wife came to the door to speak to me, and that is why I turned round. I am not the man who was in the house at all on the 29th, and I never offered him the bad shilling.</p>

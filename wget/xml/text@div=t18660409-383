                  </hi>. I am a stationer, at 35, City-road—in April last I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> about a horse, in consequence of which advertisement I applied at Milton's Livery stables in Mount-street—I found the prisoner Matthew there—I saw a horse there and agreed to leave my horse and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the horse which I took away—I was to pay 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—my horse was worth 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he could sell it for that—I was to have the horse for trial—I found the horse was lame and took it back and found Matthew there—he said he had lent my horse to a man in the country—I ultimately got my horse back again and £5., and left the horse that I had had with Harman—that was the 1st of May, 1865—at that time he got this I. O. U. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides the 5<hi rend="italic">l.—Read</hi>: "John C. Tacy, I promise to pay the sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week from this date, G. Milton, for M. Milton"—I signed the other document dated the same day—he would not allow me to write it—that was, Received of Mr. M. H. Milton the sum of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 26th April, 1865, signed John C. Tacy"—I see these words are added, "Which cancels the transaction arranged between me and M. Milton"—I am quite certain these words were not on the document when I signed it—I took the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., being told that I should not get anything else—my man was there and saw me sign the receipt—after that I applied to Matthew for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "You have broken the contract between me and you, and entered into a transaction with my father, I shall not pay you anything; if you see my father, very likely he may pay you the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I told him I should put it in the hands of my solicitor—I took out a summons at the County Court and went there on 27th September—I was present when the case was heard but was not examined that day—it was adjourned till 3d October—on 3d October I was present and was examined—while I was being examined this document was put into my hands by Matthew's attorney—both prisoners were there—it was put into my hands in the same state that I have just seen it—I at once detected the addition on reading it over—this document</p>

I am in Mr. Tacy's service—I went to Mount-street with him—he sent me first after seeing the advertisement—I went again the same day with Mr. Tacy—I saw Matthew there—Mr. Tacy, in my presence, arranged with him to leave his horse and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and take the horse I had seen there—we saw the horse was lame when we were driving him home, and afterwards he got still more lame—I then took it back and saw Matthew—I told him about its being lame—he said that our horse had gone away, that he had left it with some one in the country, and it would not be home for a day or two, and we must keep his horse till it came back—we afterwards got back our own horse—I saw Harman—I saw the I. O. U. and the receipt given by Mr. Tacy when the horse was returned—the receipt was not in this shape when Mr. Tacy gave it me; it ended with John C. Tacy.</p>

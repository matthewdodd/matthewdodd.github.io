I had been to Fisher-street in the day, I gave the men some beer for finishing the job, the plaisterers and I were going home together in Dyot-street; I think it was two girls followed us; I went into a house that belonged to my master, and asked them how they got on there; we had a pint of half ale and half porter; this girl asked me to go with her, I refused; it was quite against my will; I am a married man and have got four children. We came out of that house, and this girl followed me; she asked me to go with her, she unbuttoned my pantaloons, I buttoned them up again; then she went to kiss me; she took my watch out and ran away. This was in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. I was never drunk in my life, but whatever I had to do I could do. When she had got my watch she ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never recovered your watch - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in company with her - A. About an hour.</p>

They came and took me; I never saw the watch with my eyes.</p>

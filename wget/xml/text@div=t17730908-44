            ; to the best of my knowledge this is the watch I sold him two years ago; the name seems to have been erased, and another put in; to the best of my judgment it is the watch; if I was indulged to take it to pieces I could certainly tell whether the name has been erased.</p>
               <p>Q. How long would you be in taking it to pieces?</p>
               <p>Stoddard. Ten minutes in a convenient place. (He takes the watch home and returns with it in a short time).</p>
               <p>Q. Have you examined the watch?</p>
               <p>Stoddard. Yes; I have taken it to pieces; I can swear positively that it is my work, though the name is erased.</p>

               <p>The evidence said at the Justice's I did not steal the watch, but the stole it himself.</p>

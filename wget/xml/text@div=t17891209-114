            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long? - About five months ago; I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Do you know how he came by his death? - I cannot say particularly; I know he was in a room, called the strong room.</p>
               <p>How long before he died, was he confined in the strong room? - I was in bed, and came out of the prison before he died, and how long it was before, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You do not at all know what was the occasion of his death? - I heard the deceased say, that that place would be his death, or words to that effect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long have you been out of the Fleet Prison? - Perhaps three months, or not so much.</p>
               <p>You was discharged by the Thatched House Society; of course you have not been at the Fleet lately? - Yes, I was sent for within this four or five days, by Mr. Barkley.</p>
               <p>You have not talked with any other on this subject in the Fleet Prison? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Was you in Chancery-lane last night, or with Mr. Jackson yesterday? - I was, not on this business: what carried me to the fleet, was, Mr. Barkley's sending for me.</p>
               <p>Tell me, when this man was put into the strong room, was it not in the summer time, in the month of July? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Was you examined before the Coroner? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Are you any relation to the deceased Hart? - None at all.</p>
               <p>On the 24th of July, Mr. Hart was put into the strong room? - I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>Do you know that Mr. Hart was a very drunken man; used spirits very much? - I know he would get drunk sometimes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that he was not as notorious a drunken, debauched man,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090121"></xptr>as ever lived on God's earth? - I do not know that; the man would get drunk sometimes.</p>
               <p>On the 24th of July, this man was put into the strong room; he was out when you left the gaol? - I cannot say; I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Have you been out a month, two months, or three months, or how long? - I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>On your oath, was not you discharged in the month of August? - I believe I was.</p>
               <p>Do you not know that this man left the strong room on the 8th of August, or at least was it not early in the month of August he was turned out of the strong room? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>How long was he in? - When I got up on Friday morning, he was in.</p>
               <p>And he was put out on the 8th of August, and did not he live till the 24th of October: pray what sort of a place is this strong room? - It is a room like a cellar, almost, rather under ground; I suppose about three feet and a half.</p>
               <p>How high? - I never measured it.</p>
               <p>During the time, was there not people that lived there by choice nine or ten months together, and do not you know that Mr. Jackson lived in the room with Mr. Hart? - He was put in the night before Mr. Hart was.</p>
               <p>And was not Mr. Hart put in because he swore he would pull down the gaol, if Mr. Jackson was not let out? - I said before I was in bed when he was put in.</p>
               <p>Is not this strong room as big as fourteen rooms on the same floor, in which prisoners live with their families; has it not a fire place, and had not he a four post bedstead in it? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Do you not believe he died by being confined in that strong room? - I do.</p>
               <p>What effect had it on him? - When he came out he was not so well as when he went in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. But he lived on till October? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How often did you see him sober in that time? - I have not to my knowledge seen him once, because I left the prison shortly after.</p>

On Monday morning, 16th September, I was on duty in Botolph-lane, near Mr. Baylis's warehouse—it was about twenty minutes or a quarter to 3 o'clock, in my judgment—in passing those premises I heard somebody whispering or quietly talking, and a rattling of papers—I still listened to it and heard some one inside say, "Ted" or "Ned," I won't be sure which it was—not being aware but what some one was living on the premises, I went to a house adjoining, or within one door of it, rung the bell and asked—after that a ladder was got, and I and Sergeant Turner got in at the first-floor window—we first saw that a</p>

               <p>square of glass had been broken, and a half-penny lay beneath it in the, private passage—we got into the warehouse and found all the desks broken open—we then went up stairs—I found this box, knife, two screw drivers and this iron wedge (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); and up stairs this other box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with the two bundles of cigars in it, and this boot (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) lying nearly alongside of it—one of the screw drivers was lying on the desk, not in the box—the iron chisel was lying in the counting-house, but I could not say exactly where, because I did not pick it up—it was not in the cigar box—I put them in the box to take care of them—I saw a hole, where any one could have got in; that was up in the top of all—I did not get out at that hole—at about ten minutes past 6, I went to another warehouse, about two warehouses off—I did not go along the roof—I went to Thames-street and down a lane before then, and underneath a barge I saw Evans taken out by another constable just as I got there—I went down to the station and from there I came back to another warehouse, where I found these three pain of boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were all wet and dirty—Evans afterwards said at the station-house, "That is my pair" (<hi rend="italic">pointing to a pair</hi>)—he said, "Yes will find two pair and an odd one."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Police-sergeant</hi>, 576). I went on this Monday morning, the 16th, to Mr. Baylis's premises—Offer was there when I got there—I went from information that I received—I saw several desks broken open, and proceeded to make a search after the thieves—I went to the top of the house and found two tiles removed; I removed three more and broken away some of the woodwork, and I and Sergeant Turner passed through the aperture—I proceeded over the roof of about twenty houses till I got to the top landing window of 120, Pudding-lane, where I saw footmarks on the outer sill; one as from a foot with a stocking on, and one the marks of a person's toes—that was a private dwelling-house—I looked over the parapet and found a police-constable stationed there below—I called out to keep the door—I then got in at the window, and saw the marks as of some persons wiping their feet on the mat—I was followed by two constables—I told one to stop at the window and I hastened down stairs; when I got within six stairs of the bottom, I heard the bolt slip; the front door opened and I saw the prisoner Murray leave the house—I followed him, kept sight of him, and saw him stopped in Lower Thames-street by constable Tibben<lb></lb>ham—I sent him to the station by Tibbenham; I afterwards went to the station, where I saw Evans in custody as well—whilst I was telling to the station-sergeant haw I followed them, Evans said to me, "Ah! hid I met you in the house you would not be here now"—I saw a pair of shoes and a black cap picked up outside the door from which Murray went—the shoes are identified by Mr. Baylis; the cup is not identified by anybody—I believe the house is 120, Lower Thames-street, but the door is in Pudding-lane—</p>

               <p>Murray had not cap on, I think, when he was taken; I will not be sure—he had so shoes—at the Mansion-house, when the boots were being tried on the prisoners, Evans reached over and said, "These are my shoes; I will not deny them."</p>

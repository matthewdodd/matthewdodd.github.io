The Prisoner then came in, and ask'd what was the Matter? and the Child told him. The Prisoner bid the Deceas'd go out of his House, she said she would not, and call'd him Names, and was very abusive: With that, he took her by the Arm to lead her out; she struggled, and being in Liquor, hit her Foot against the Door, fell with her Breast upon a low Chair, and from thence with her Head against the Grates. She got up again, and said she had hurt herself sadly; she turn'd pale. The Prisoner sent immediately for a Surgeon, who let her Blood, but she dy'd in half an Hour. She would frequently be drunk, and pretend to be in Fits to fright us.</p>
               <p>Miss Rogers. The Deceas'd sent me down Stairs for a Chair and a Shovel; and as I was coming up with them, she swept the Dust in my Eyes. Pray don't sweep it in my Eyes, says I; but I will, says she, because it's my Pleasure. Then I'll tell my Father, says I, for you know he wont suffer such Things; if we do any thing amiss, you ought to acquaint him with it, and he'll correct us. I don't care a Pin for you nor your Father neither, says she. And then my Father came in, and ask'd what was the Matter? and I told him. This is always the Trade, says my Father, when I am cut of the Way; you can never let the Children alone. She said she would do so again if she had a mind to it. My Father told her, then she should not stay in his House any longer. But she would, she said, and gave my Father a great many ill Words; and so my Father took her by the Arm to lead her out. She was very full of Liquor, and stagger'd much; her Foot hitch'd against the Door, and she fell with her Stomach against the Chair, and then with her Temple against the Grate.</p>

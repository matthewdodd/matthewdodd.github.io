On the 27th of June, at a quarter past one o'clock, the two prisoners came in together; the man desired to look at some blue silk handkerchiefs; the woman took a seat, and the man stood beside her; I took a piece of handkerchief out of the window, he examined it, and desired to look at some others - he opened one piece, and covered the others that were on the counter; he paid me 4s. 6d. for one, and I saw the woman slip her hand under the piece I had opened - the man then said he did not wish to have that one, but another; I said I would exchange it - he said, No, and they went out; I missed the handkerchiefs, and pursued them - I took hold of the female, and brought her back - she made some resistance. and said she was not going to run away; I took hold of her two hands in the shop, and at that moment saw the piece fall from her.</p>

            . I am a patrol, and was sent for to Mr. Fisher's, and found the female prisoner there; she cried, and said she knew nothing about it; I was going with her across Finsbury-square, the man came up, and said,"What is the matter?" she said she was going to the office for nothing; he said, "What are you about?" I said, I was an officer, and if he made any attempt to oppose me, I would take him also; he wanted to fight me, and I took him to the office - just as we got there, he put put his head on one side, and said he would give me 2l. to make it right; I found the handkerchief he had bought, in the woman's basket - he said that was his property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MARY TAYLOR. I went to buy a handkerchief - the man followed me, and said I must go back; I went back, and the young man in the shop was told to throw the handkerchiefs on one side; this piece of handkerchiefs laid on the floor, and he said, "There it is."</p>
               <p>JOHN ALDRED COOPER. I desired the young man to move the other handkerchiefs, that this piece might not mix with them - she dropped this; I did not see it fall, but I am certain it was not on the floor when I went out, because I passed the same ground in going out and coming in; she could not have brushed it from the counter, for they were removed before she got back.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then she had left the shop? A. Yes - and I missed the piece, pursued, and brought her back - after some time she dropped it.</p>

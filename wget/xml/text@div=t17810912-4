               <p>I am sister to Mrs. Webb; I live with her. Upon the 22d of July, a little before ten, I heard a noise in the dining-room; afterwards I heard a still greater noise, upon which the maid and I went up into the dining-room, and then into the two pair of stairs room; there I missed a gown and some foul linen: the maid then went up into the garret; she said somebody had been there: I ran down stairs, and sent out for the neighbours. There was an uproar in the street. Some people came in soon afterwards, and said a bundle of linen had fell from the house, and had hit a woman on the shoulder; and that two men were taken up. I lost the things laid in the indictment to be my property.</p>

               <p>Upon the 22d of July, at about a quarter before ten o'clock, coming along Rathbone-place, a bundle fell from a house upon me; I don't know whether it was from No. 1, or No. 2. I knocked at Capt. Fremantle's door, and told them somebody was a-top of the house: they went up, and found the top of the cieling in the garret broke away, so that a man could come into the house, but there was nobody there. The servant looked at the things, and said they were not his master's property; I left my name and place of abode with the servant, and I took the bundle away with me. Mrs. Webb sent to me, and owned the things.</p>

               <p>Upon the 22d of July, we were alarmed in Oxford-road, between ten and eleven o'clock, with the cry of Thieves! we got the watchman, and went up stairs. We found some tiles had been taken off the corner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120006"></xptr> near a trap-door, of the next house to my master's, so that a man might put in his arm and unbolt the door; upon touching the trap-door, it fell down. The watchman went in, and said he saw two men: I went in and seized one of the prisoners, and the watchman the other; they were under the stairs. I saw this silver spoon sticking out of Bland's breeches-pocket (producing it). I asked him, how he came by it: he said, a man gave it him. Afterwards he said, If you will not hurt me, I will tell the whole truth. They were both without their hats and shoes.</p>

I went to go up upon the tiles, but it was so slippery that I could not get up. They told me to take my shoes off: I did so, and laid them down, and my hat; the man said he would take care of them. Coming by some of the stacks of chimnies, I saw some things lying; I stooped to pick them up; some men came up and laid hold of me, and said I was one of the thieves.</p>

            . I live in Baldwin's gardens. The Prisoner came to my Shop about three o'Clock on the Saturday, and she offered me the Stockings to sale; I saw her pull them from under her Petticoat. I did suppose she had stole them. I sent to Mr Forth, my Neighbour, to know if he had lost any thing; in the mean time she tore the Mark off, and went into Mr Wilson's to pawn them, and there she was took. She told me she dealt in them, and she went about the Street to sell them; I said there were Shopkeepers, I did not chuse to deal with such. She was taken before Justice Poulson, and she confess'd she took them out of Mr Forth's Shop.</p>

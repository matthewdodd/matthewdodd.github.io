             I was in Petticoat lane, November 1. I met with this woman in the street, about five minutes past ten at night, we stood together, and we had not talked together above four minutes in an alley, call'd <placeName id="t17571207-13-crimeloc71">Harrow Alley</placeName>

I ran after her, and call'd the watch. I took hold of her in a minute or two after. She had got to another woman, her companion, to whom I saw her deliver something; the other went away. She was called to Aldgate watch-house and searched, but no watch was found. We took her before Mr. Clear an Alsop, where she denied it. The next day I heard I might have my watch again, on paying half a guinea, and saying nothing about it; I sent the half guinea, and had it again.</p>

               <p>Q Are you sure you had the watch when you was with her?</p>
               <p>Musgrove. I am positive of it, because I look'd at it when I first went into her company. ( The watch produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>I had been drinking at the Three Pidgeons, and coming out I met this man, who laid hold on me, and call'd watch, and said I had got his watch. I said, sure the man is mad! and said, I'll go to the watch-house, or any where with you. They searched me there, but found nothing. I am as innocent as a dove, and never saw the watch with my eyes.</p>

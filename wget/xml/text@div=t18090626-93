               <p>Q. How old are you - A. About twenty years old. On Saturday the 18th of June, about half after eleven o'clock, I was coming by <placeName id="t18090626-93-crimeloc545">the King's Head, St. Giles's</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you sit down in the room - A. No, it was just by the door; I stood by the side of them. I gave each of them a glass of gin, and I had one; they asked me what o'clock it was, I told them it wanted about a quarter to twelve; Cartwright asked me to let her look at it, I told her I would not; she put my thumb back and forced it out of my hand herself; I asked her for the watch, she would not give it me; she put it down her bosom, and said she had it not; I said if you do not give it me, I will charge the watch with you. This happened just inside the door; the door was bolted when we were inside, because they shut up a little after eleven. Kite and Barrett unbolted the door and ran away. I had hold of Cartwright's hand; when the watchman came, I took her to the watchhouse. When I went to Marlbourough-street, Kite and Barrett were there. I told the constable to put them in; one of them struck me and gave me a black eye; the other would have struck me, but the people prevented her. I knew them all three before. I am sure of their persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not the watch been found - A. No; because these two other girls ran away directly. I gave two pound for the watch.</p>

            . I am a watchman, I was crying the hour of twelve o'clock; the prosecutor gave me charge of Cartwright for robbing him of his watch; the others were not there, when I came up the watchhouse keeper searched her; nothing was found on her.</p>
               <p>Cartwright's Defence. I know no further of the women than living in the neighbourhood. I am an unfortunate woman. I told Johnson he had better go home, he said he would go home; he said if you do not go home, I will charge the watchman with you, for being out in disorderly hours; he caught hold of me, put his hand in my bosom. I was searched in a most clandestine manner, on account of that they could not find the property on me. He never asserted that any person was with me at office the first time, no person was drinking with me but him. I was outside of the door when he said I had got his watch; lord, says I, do not say that, the watchman will take me to the watchhouse. The justice asked him if there was any accomplice, he said no; I put the watch in my bosom. The moment he accused me of it, he gave charge of me to the watch directly.</p>
               <p>Q. to Johnson. Did you say before the justice that there was no more than that woman - A. No, I said there was three in company.</p>

               <p>Barrett's Defence. I never saw the man till I saw him on the Monday morning.</p>

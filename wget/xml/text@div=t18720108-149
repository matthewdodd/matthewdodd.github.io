I am the prisoner's wife, and live at 11, Ferdinand Place—I have not lived with him for eleven months—on 18th December, I met the prisoner, and went into the Buck's Head public-house—we were on pretty good terms—he said he had heard I had been married to a man of the name of Jeckel, seven weeks, and I said, in a joke, "Yes I have"—this was after we went into the public-house—we had a few-words—he asked me whether I was married, and I said yes, I was—he then drew his knife, and stabbed me in the neck—he was very tipsy—this is the knife—I am living with Joe Jeckel now.</p>

I live at 49, Whitfield Street, Tottenham Court Road—at 6.45, on 18th December, I was in the Buck's Head—I saw the prisoner and his wife come in—they had a quartern of gin—some words took place between them, and I saw the prisoner draw his right hand from his pocket, walk up to the woman, and put his hand up to her neck—I saw the knife—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw the wound lay open—I called to the landlord.</p>

                  </hi>. I am proprietor of the Pantechnicon, in Belgrave-square I had a carriage there belonging to General Swaine, on the 18th of June—the imperial was attached to the carriage—the prisoner had been in my employ two or three months—I received intelligence, and asked him where the trowsers were, which he took out of the imperial—he said he did not know—I asked if he had taken any thing else out—he said, "No;" he denied it for some considerable time—I then asked where the key was—he said he knew nothing about it—after some further accusation, he said he had found a key which opened it—I got on the top of the carriage, and looked at the lock—being well acquainted with locks, I said, "I am quite certain you could not have found a key which would open this—where did you get it?"—he then said he had found a key in the street, and filed the wards out to make it fit, and taken out two or three pairs of trowers, four or five waiscoats, a coat, and a telescope—that part of the property was at home, part he had pledged, and part, he believed, was still in the Pantech<lb></lb>nicon—I gave him into custody.</p>

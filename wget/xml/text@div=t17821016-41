               <p>About one in the afternoon, on the 14th of September, I saw the prisoner concealing a cask under a shop window, against St. Catherine's Bridge, when I returned he was gone, and the cask was put under the shelf of the window, bouge-wise on its belly; I examined the cask, and found Mr. Calvert's mark on it; I took the cask on my shoulder and was carrying it to my house, I met the prisoner at the door, and took him; I knew him by sight before; he said he was ordered by an officer to fetch that cask. I found it was taken from <placeName id="t17821016-41-crimeloc213">Mr. Calvert's wharf</placeName>

               <p>Court. Have you seen the cask at the wharf? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. You know it from nothing but being directed for Calvert, and Co. and brand marked? - No.</p>

               <p>I went from Mr. Nelson, a cyder merchant, to get some empty casks to go to Harrison's wharf, which were marked, and I happened to take this; I was not sober, I did not pretend to hide it; I did not take it to steal it. My master had several of the same size.</p>

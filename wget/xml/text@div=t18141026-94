               <p>JENKINS WILLIANS. On Friday the 2nd of October, I saw the prisoner unpin a pair of stockings, that were against the door, they were under cover in the passage; he brought them into the shop he stood close to the counter, with the stockings in his hand, nobody behind the counter could see the stockings in his hand; be kept them concealed before the counter; he asked for something on the counter, and then he asked for change of a twenty pound note; he did not tender the note. I answered, I could not change it; the shopman was serving a customer with ribbons. I saw the prisoner take from the box, a coloured ribbon, and then he asked the shopman to let him see some white ribbon; it was shewed to him; he bought one yard, and paid sixpence for it. I saw him put his hand into the box, and take a piece of white ribbon. I then sent for an officer. I went round the counter, and would not let the prisoner go. He asked me what I wanted with him; I said only my own, he threw the stockings on the counter, and said if I would give him change he would pay me for them. I asked him for the note; he said he would not give it me. Then the officer came, and took the ribbon out of his pocket. These are the two pieces of ribbon, and these are the stockings they are my masters property.</p>

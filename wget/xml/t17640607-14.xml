When I came there, she had got another lock, and locked the door, but I got in, and missed the bed and kettle: she owned she had taken and pawned them; I insisted she should go with me, where I found the bed, but she would not say where the kettle was: she said another woman carried that to pawn; the bed is here.</p>

               <p>My husband said, if I would not go with a man that took the bed, he would kill me, and the child within me; so I went and brought him the money. The man was a stranger to me: my husband said he had bought the bed of Mr. Simpkin.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. That gentlewoman was at my house with another person; they begged very hard; something was talked of about a guinea and a half: but I said I must have the consent of the grand jury before I could do it.</p>

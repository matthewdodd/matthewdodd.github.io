             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Lambeth-street office: On the 18th of December, I had information from Brown, the accomplice, that they had sold some tools at Baker's house, an old iron-shop, in Rosemary-lane, which they had stolen from Mr. Kindred's. Griffiths and I went there, and Griffiths and Baker went into a back place, while I went into a little room, where I found this small saw, (produces it); I asked Baker where he got it; he said he bought it of Mr. Mainwaring, the maker; I looked, and saw the name of Harrison on it, and took Baker into custody; in the evening, Smith and I went again, and he found a tenon saw, in a little cupboard, nearly covered with rags, as if it was concealed. On the 20th I went again, with the prosecutor, and found several things, which he owned, from among a vast number of tools which were there. Brown informed me that Mines had kept some nails, a gimlet, and two hammers, for his own use; upon which I went to his room, on Saltpetre-bank, and found them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. You found the large saw hanging up? - A. Yes; but it was very dark.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that not the prisoner Baker's workshop, and did you not find the things on his workbench? - A. We found part of them on a bench full of rags, and old junk, and those kind of things; the prisoner Baker calls himself a carpenter, but I don't think he is; I did not see a shaving, or any wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not time to have removed the things, before you went the second time? - A. Yes; but he must have removed a great many more if he had.</p>

               <p>JOHN BROWN sworn. - I have been examined before on the former trials. On Saturday, November the 27th, about two or three o'clock in the morning, Mines, James, and myself, went to Redman's-row, and then got over the wall belonging to Mr. Kindred; James opened the window of the work-shop, went in and handed-out two large planes, a large saw, and tenon saw, and the other articles, and we took them home to Saltpetre-bank, to the house of

            , and he desired me, in the morning, to go and sell them; I took half of them to Baker's, and he asked me if that was all I had; I said, no; he asked me whether I was staunch or not, meaning whether I would tell; I said, yes, and went back and got the others; then he gave me nine shillings and sixpence for the whole, except the nails, the gimlet, and the hammers, which were left at Mines's. James had a a pocket-book, and coming across the fields he opened it, and threw a parcel of papers out, and after that, he threw the book away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.Had you visited any other house that night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120063"></xptr>Q.When you took those things to Baker's, do you know where he put them; or whether he mixed them with any other tools? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.You were taken up for some other offence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What day did you sell the tools? - A. On a Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never said it was on a Sunday? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body present when you sold them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.You never gave any account of this till you were taken up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>(The articles produced, and identified).</p>
               <p>The prisoners James and Mines, declined making any defence.</p>
               <p>Baker's defence. Brown came to me on a Sunday, and asked me if I would buy some tools; being in the cabinet line myself, and having a wife, two children, and a mother, to support, I bought them for my own use, to save buying new ones; he came on Monday morning, and I gave him what he asked for them.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner, Baker.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PURCELL sworn. - I am a bricklayer, and have known Baker ten years: On Sunday the 28th of November last, I saw Brown at his house, and heard him say something about carpenter's tools that had come out of pawn, and that he had bought them with an intention of going to work, but could not get any, and wanted money, therefore wished to sell them. Baker said he did not make a practice of buying things on a Sunday, and desired him to go about his business, and I saw no more of him. Baker keeps an old iron-shop, and carries on business as a carpenter, and when he is not employed he assists his wife in the shop.</p>
               <p>Baker called four other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

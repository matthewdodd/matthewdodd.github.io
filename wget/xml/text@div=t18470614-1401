                  </hi>. I keep the Macclesfield Arm in the City-road. On the 16th of may I left the keys of my cellar in the door—after a temporary absence they were brought to my wife by one of my servants—I suspected I had been robbed—my wife said, "We have found some port wine in a pot in the kitchen"—I went down in the cellar and found a pipe of wine with the tap dripping—I concluded the win had been drawn from there—I searched and found this bottle of wine in the copper—I placed a person to see who came to fetch it, he detected the prisoner, who was in my service, coming for it—I went down and took it from the prisoner—the pipe of wine was on draught—I have not compared it with the wine in the bottle.</p>

                  </hi>. On 16th of May Mr. Dudley asked me to watch the copper—at a quarter before twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner came, took the wine out of the copper, went up the kitchen stairs, passed the bar, and went on the second stair towards her own bedroom—I laid hold of her and called Mr. Dudley—she got away from me—in going down, I got her again—Mr. Dudley came and took the wine from her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I came down in the kitchen; the cellar door was open; I told the pot-boy so, he told me to shut it, I did so; I then saw this wine in a pint pot; I thought it was laid there more for me than any one else; I put it into a bottle, and put it there from six to twelve o'clock, only to see who put it there for me; I took it out of the copper, and this man got hold of me.</p>

On the 13th of February he came to my master's house and desired to see me; I went to the door; he said he was very glad to see me; I said I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177404130015"></xptr> forbid him my acquaintance some time ago, and should not ask him in; he said he did not desire to be asked in, but said he had some particular business with me; I told him I was busy; he said he would come again in half an hour; he came again and I took a walk with him from <placeName id="t17740413-31-crimeloc146">Twickenham</placeName>

Then he laid hold of me and d - d my eyes, and said if I did not lend it him he would blow my brains out; he then put his hand on my breeches pocket and said here is money; then he put his hand in my waistcoat pocket and took out the half-pence and ran away; he said he was going to Richmond. On the 12th of March he came to my master's; I was then in town; when I came home, the maid told me such a person had been enquiring for me; by the description she gave of him, I knew it was the prisoner; I went in pursuit of him; I ran three or four miles before I overtook him; I took him at Brentford; I charged a constable with him, and had him before Sir

I am a widow—I keep the Duke of Cambridge public-house, Upper Kennington Lane—between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning of 8th May I was awoke by hearing a noise, and came down to see what was the matter—I found a constable there and the prisoner in custody—the prisoner said he was a stranger in London, and I asked him if he was a stranger, how he knew I was Mrs. Hendy—he had got through the back kitchen window, which had been fastened the previous, night—they are usually locked up safe—the drawers had all been opened and turned over in disorder—the opera glass and spoon were taken out—they are worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were safe when I went to bed—there had' been an attempt to break open the door of the bar-parlour—there was an iron instrument, a poker, a bar broken in two and a domince.</p>

On the morning 8th May, about 2.45 I was passing the Duke of Cambridge—I heard a noise inside, stopped, listened, thought there was something wrong, went round to the back kitchen window and saw it open—I got assistance, called up the inmates and saw the prisoner in the parlour—I asked him what he had done, he said nothing, I took him from his hiding-place, I said "What are you up to there"—he made no reply—I found this knife behind him which would go between the frame of a window to put the fastner back—this lantern and articles were found—the drawers had been ransacked and the things shifted about—the lantern was found in the passage near the bar-parlour—he had got the doors sufficiently far open for you to get your fingers in—he had broken the hammer.</p>

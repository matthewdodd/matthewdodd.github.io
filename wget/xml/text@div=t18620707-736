                  </hi>. On 9th March, I met the prisoner in the Fulham-road—he told me that he had a good mind to let me have something—I said that it would be better for him to let me pass—he said that he would not, and he knocked me down and kicked me in the side—a young man named Conlan came up and took him from me, and I went to a policeman—the prisoner went in and fetched a screw-wrench—he followed me to the door of a house with it, and struck me on the back of the knee—I got into the house, and he stopped outside, swearing he would have my life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It was not a screw-wrench; it was a small spanner. This man summoned me to the police-court some time before; there was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., half a day's wages, coming to me. He did not like to pay me, and I got fighting with him. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I was not fighting with him; I wanted to get away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> It was because I would not swear what he wanted that all this happened. He got me to go to the Court to prove damages between him and the landlord of two or three houses. He did not like me because I did not take a false oath, and that is the reason of this. We got boxing outside my door, and when I got the upper hand he went for the police. Two men came against me, and I took out this spanner to protect myself The police came out against me, and I went about three-quarters of a mile. I returned back when I saw the police, and said to them, "You have got no cause to take me; I have done nothing, only taken my own part." The policemen drew their staves. One of them hit me, and I hit him with the spanner. They both had their staves drawn before I raised my hand to them. As I could not go to the station on account of my five children, he hit me on the mouth and pulled me down. I have got six cuts on my head. He fractured my arm, and broke my finger in two places.</p>

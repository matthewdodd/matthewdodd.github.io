               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this coat, waistcoat, and shirt. - A. On the 23d of March, the prisoner at the bar came to my house and said he wanted a ship; I asked him if ever he had been to sea, he said no; I told him I could do nothing with him; he said he was in great distress; seeing him a decent young man, I said to him you shall be in my house, I will give you victtuals and drink until you can get a situation; on the Friday following I was informed we had been robbed; I asked the prisoner, and he acknowledged he had stole the things. I promised him forgiveness, and do not wish to hurt him now.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must not tell me any thing he said, after you had this conversation with the lad; did you go with him any where. - A. Yes, he pointed out the place where he took them; I found every thing. I think he did it through necessity.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you permitted him to wear them. - A. I told him he might put any thing on.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

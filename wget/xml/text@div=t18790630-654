                  </hi>. I am the Record-keeper at the Office of the Vicar-General to the Archbishop of Canterbury at Doctors' Commons—on the 18th October last a man came to my office giving the name of Thomas Charles Price, and applied for a marriage licence—I made this note at the time: he described himself as a widower, of Forest Gate, Essex, and Amelia Sarah Hastie as a spinster, of St. Peter's, Croydon, and a minor, or rather of the age of 18 and upwards, that she had no father, no mother, and no guardian; that he wished the marriage to take place at St. Peter's, Croydon, she having resided there for the last 15 days—T then prepared this affidavit; I filled it up from his instructions, read it over to him, and he signed it in my presence T. C. Price—I then either took or sent it to Dr Robertson, the surrogate, to be sworn, and on his return with it either I or one of the clerks would make out the marriage licence—I find Dr. Robertson's signature to the affidavit—the marriage licence was filled up by one of the clerks; it bears the seal of the Vicar-General, and the signature of Mr. Hassard, the principal Registrar of the Arch<lb></lb>bishop, and it bears my initials—then, in the ordinary course, the person would pay 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the price of the licence, and it would be delivered to him after being read over to him to see that it was correct—I do not identify the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk at St. Peter's Church, South Croydon—on Friday, 18th October, late in the evening, in consequence of some information from my wife, I arranged for a wedding to take place next morning—about a quarter past nine next morning I was fetched to the church—I met the prisoner in the churchyard—he said he had come to be married—I said I would open the church in a few minutes, and I admitted him and another man, two girls, and a woman—one of the girls was Amelia Sarah Hastie—I saw her afterwards at the police-court, and she is here now—the prisoner went with me into the vestry—I asked him for the licence, and he gave me the one produced—I then proceeded to enter into the register from the licence—I produce the original register—I entered the whole of it before the ceremony. (<hi rend="italic">This described the lady as aged 18, the daughter of Walter Thomas Hastie, Admiralty Clerk.</hi>) The age is not stated in the licence; I got that, the father's name, and all the particulars from him, and put them down as he gave them—at that time I believe I was alone with him in the vestry, he was standing close by and saw what I wrote—I noticed that the lady looked very young and spoke to Mr. White, the clergyman, about it, and he took the licence in his hand and looked at it, and said "Is this licence correct?" or some words to that effect—the prisoner said "Yes"—he stammered very much, he has an impediment in his speech, but he said it was quite correct—sir. White said, "You are sure it is all right?"—he said, "Yes, sir"—we then proceeded into the church, and the marriage was solemnised—all the parties afterwards came into the vestry, and the prisoner signed the register, Miss Hastie next, Mr. Horne next, and his wife was about to sign, but I refused to take her signature as her husband had signed, and I asked the girl to sign, and she signed Rose Rimmell.</p>

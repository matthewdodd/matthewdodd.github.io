On the 20th of October, going through the warehouses, at the request of the elders, to intercept any felony of the kind; I discovered several bags of sugar cut open and plundered of a considerable quantity, accordingly I acquainted the elders of it, they desired me to watch, accordingly I did, on a pile of sugars, and I see the prisoner at the bar come to a bag, No. 848, and took the sugar out which I have in my possession; I then see him take it out of a bag, and put it into a handkerchief, he was then coming out of that warehouse, and going into another, and I followed him and caught him by the collar, and said, you have been thieving of sugar; I struggled with him for a minute, however I held him too fast, and he said if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280021"></xptr>would let him go he would give me any thing, I told him then as I had been employed on that business, if he had been my father I would not let him go; I kept fast hold of him, and took him to the counting house.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was in the counting house? - A Mr. Vaughan, an elder there; when I took him to the counting house I sent for a revenue officer to come and search him, but before the officer came to search the prisoner, he took the property out of his pocket, and he gave it into my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at the time that he gave it you? - He said it was the first time he was ever guilty of the like, and he did not know what the devil possessed him. He was then taken by the constable to the counter, and before the Lord Mayor. This is the same sugar that he gave me, tied up in his own handkerchief, inside of the paper; I cannot tell the value of the property, there has not been any sold under sixpence or eight pence a pound.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the quantity that is there? - One pound and fifteen ounces, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. You were present before my Lord Mayor, and he was committed? - I was; he pleaded when he was before the Lord Mayor, that he had got the gripes, and that he took it to sweeten a little beer with.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the examination taken in writing? - Yes, I think it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You told this man when he asked you to let him go, that if he was your father you would not; you wanted to get a guinea? - I cannot say as to that, I believe the honourable East India company would reward every man according to their merits, I can say that this is the sixth man that I have taken, and been the cause of taking, and I have had but one guinea yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual to give a guinea for every man that is apprehended? - At times it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it understood so amongst you? - I don't know, it is not understood so by me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you have had a sale of the East India company? - I think it was about three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that this sugar was not sold? - I will, nor never a bit of sugar in that cellar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Whether there had been a sale there or not, are you sure that you see the prisoner at the bar take it out of the bag? - I am; and after it was lodged in the hands of the constable, I had the curiosity to weigh that bag, and it weighed eight pounds deficient of the landing weight.</p>

               <p>I am deputy elder of the warehouse; it is my duty to see that every man is at his station, and to take account of goods to prevent as much as possible any embezzlement; going round a corner I found a deal of plunder out of a bag, 848; I immediately went up to the counting house and mentioned it, it was there that we agreed to place a trusty person to watch, and Rickman was the person pitched upon.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the sugar? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it weigh? - One pound fifteen ownccs; it was weighed at a grocer's near the warehouse. I compared it with the bag 848, and it appeared to be the same quality, and there was eight pounds efficient in that bag.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Is it usual for these men to be searched when they are coming out? - They are. But this man was taken between three and four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not this man say that he had picked up this property in this place? - I never heard it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The sugar laid all abroad, and I picked the sugar up to carry it to the counting house, and going through the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280022"></xptr>warehouse the man stopped me, because the bag lay in such a state; the bag lay tore all to pieces almost.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses who gave him very good character.</p>

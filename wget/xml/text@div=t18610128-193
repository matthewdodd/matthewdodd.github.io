                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, keeping the Castle public-house, Portugal-street, Lincolns-inn-fields—in the month of October, I had a bill of exchange brought to me—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., drawn by Mr. Appleyard, and accepted by George Hildebrand-Mr. Apple-yard was a lodger of mine—he was in my debt for lodging and different purposes, something over that amount; Mr. Hildebrand was a gentleman who allowed him a certain amount of money, and he gave me the bill for my debt—I know the defendant, he was a regular evening customer at my house—he knew that the bill was coming, from conversation between Appleyard and me—a week or eightdays before the bill came to maturity, the defendant and I were speaking about the bill, and he stated that he would give me the money for the bill, the full amount, which money I consented to hold for a certain time; and if he could get the money from Hildebrand, he should keep it, and I should keep the money I had; if not, I should return the money at any time he called for it—he told me that with me there might be some excuse, there might be a defence; but as against him a third party holding the bill, there could be no defence, as he had given consideration for it—I consented to that arrangement—the defendant gave me 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 78.—he said, "I must go into the City to present this bill, it will cost me something, allow me 38."—I said, "very well, anything that is reasonable," and I did allow him the 38.—he did not sign this memorandum at that time—this memorandum was given the day the bill came to maturity—the defendant told me that he went into the City, and presented the bill, and that it was dishonoured—a Mr. Wiseman came to my house that same evening and presented a notice of dishonour—the following morning T took this memorandum to the defendant—I paid him back the 231. 108., and he signed this memorandum and also wrote this at his office, before 11 o'clock in the morning—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "October 24th, 1860.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>.<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having paid him the money, did you take that receipt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I took that receipt away with me—he signed it, but the stamp was not then on it—I brought it from his office, and in the course of the day I put the stamp on it myself, and when he came in the evening, he signed over the stamp—I was not satisfied with the paper without a stamp upon it, from something I heard—he put his name twice, and his name over the stamp was written in the evening—there is no signature under the stamp—he signed it here and here (<hi rend="italic">pointing to the paper</hi>)—he did not sign the receipt at. his office, and I was not satisfied.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have known this old gentleman a good many years, have you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, about six or seven months—this memorandum, commencing, "Dear Sir," I took from my house to Hart's office on the morning of 24th—he signed the receipt at my house in the evening—he came there alone—I had written the receipt before he came—that was all written when I took it to him in the morning—all was written in the morning except the signature over the stamp—I have not stated before that he signed "H. Hart" at the foot of the receipt in the morning; but I was not satisfied, because there was no stamp on it, and got him to sign it over again in the evening—this, which purports to be a receipt, was' written at the time when he signed "H. Hart" above here—that was done at his office—I did not notice the paper so much till I brought it away, and then a friend of mine who wrote it, said it would not do—that was Mr. Le Neve—he is a law stationer—he is not here—I knew what the contents of the paper were when I procured the defendant's signature to it—he said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101280055"></xptr>
               <p>that what he wrote on the opposite side was quite sufficient for me—I did not get him to sign over the stamp in the morning—I thought of that afterwards—I did not think it necessary to ask him to sign it in the morning—I asked the barmaid to watch for his coming in the evening, and before he went into the parlour, as was his ordinary rule, he came into my little parlour and signed over the receipt—he had not been in the house five minutes then—my barmaid is here who saw him sign it—he was as sober as he is now, I never saw him the worse for drink—he staid till 12 o'clock that night: after signing the paper—he came about 9; that was his usual time; he came every evening—this "I hereby undertake to pay," was written by the defendant at his office in the morning—I did not ask him to write it—he said, "I will give you something to satisfy you," and he wrote that—I was proceeded against with regard to the, bill, but the matter has been stopped, Mr. Appleyard came and said, "Let us be friends," and stopped the action—a writ was issued against me—it was an action of trover for unlawfully detaining the bill—I never had the bill—Mr. Hart would not give it up; it was impounded in the County Court—the action was not brought against me in the name of Hart—he admitted at the County Court that the signatures were his own—he did not say that he did not know what he was signing at the time—the judge put the paper in his hand three different times, and asked him if they were his signatures, and he said, "Yes, they are "—the judge asked how he could account for its coming from me, and he said, "I cannot account for it in any way; he brought the money in the morning"—he said at first that I put the money on the table, then that he saw it in my hand, and he said he must have signed it inadvertently, and I must have stolen it from his office—I don't know anything about this endorsement of "cash, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." on the I.O.U.; I never saw that till now—I gave the L.O.U.—it is in my writing—I don't know in whose handwriting the endorsement of "cash, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." is; it is not mine; I never saw it before—no messenger from the defendant applied to me for the payment of this 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before the summons was issued—there was a messenger came, but she did not come for that—I saw her—Mr. Hart was in the habit of sending to me for small amounts of money—she did not say a word about coming from Mr. Hart for payment of the balance of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she brought a note to me—I don't know where it is—on his (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a note that came from him; it was one of this kind—it may not have been this note—I have received notice to produce it, but I have not got it and cannot tell where it is; perhaps it is burnt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Hart, Castello—send word if seen by you.")—I am quite certain he signed this receipt when he first came in—the barmaid was waiting till he should come in—he did not go into the parlour, and he had nothing to drink; he came directly into my private parlour and signed this receipt before he went</p>

               <p>into the public parlour at all—at the time the action of trover was brought against me, the defendant was suing Mr. Hildebrand, and he had possession of the bill—the I.O.U. was submitted to the judge at the County Court.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember what the defendant stated about this paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> His utterance is not very distinct—he certainly made many statements—he said at one time that the prosecutor held the money in his hand, and at another time that he put it on the table; that he wrote the receipt expecting to receive the money, and that afterwards Mr. Merton persuaded him to hold the bill, and the money was not paid to him—I don't remember that he made any other statement—he made several statements which I do not remember—I have no note of his stating how Mr. Merton got possession of the paper.</p>

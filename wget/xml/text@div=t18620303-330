On Tuesday, 14th January, I went to the prisoner Taylor's shop, at High-street, Homerton—it is a butcher's shop, with a slaughter house in the rear—I asked him if he slaughtered two beasts on Thursday night—he hesitated for a moment, and then said, "Yes, I did"—I said, "Were they two cows?"—he said, "Yes, they were cows"—I said, "Were they in calf?"—he said, "Yes, they were in calf"—I said, "What colour were they?"—he said, "One was black with white spots, and the other was a dark and lightish colour, mixed colour"—I said, "How did you come by them?"—he said, "A tall middle aged man brought them to me, and asked me to slaughter them for him"—I said, "Do you know the man?"—he said, "No, I do not"—I said, "Did ever you see him before?"—he said, "No, not to my knowledge"—he did not give me any address of the man—I said, "What did you do with the carcases?"—he said, "I took them to Newgate market, and sold them to a Mr. Thorpe"—I said, "What did you do with the skins?"—he said, "I took them with me"—I said, "What did you do with the tripes and offals?"—he said, "Oh, I took them all away together"—I said, "Did you sell the heads to the same man you sold the carcases to?"—he said, "No, I took the heads to Leadenhall market, and sold them to Mr. Gardner's man"—I said, "Did you receive the money for the carcases?"—he said, "Yes; on the following Monday I received the money from Mr. Thorpe, in the market"—I said, "Did you receive the money for the heads?"—he said, "Yes; I went to the New cattle-market on the Monday, and received the money from Mr. Gardner"—I then asked him if he would consent to go with me to Mr. Rumball's house; he said, "Yes," and went with me—he is the owner of the cows—while there, a bill was shown to him, describing the two cows which had been stolen; and he then said, "The two cows I slaughtered answer this description"—he was then given into custody by Mr. James Rumball—I cautioned the prisoner, and said he need not my anything more unless he liked, and took him to the station—on the 19th I went to Witt's house, at Fisher-place, Homerton—I saw him there, and told him I was going to take him in custody on suspicion of being concerned with Taylor, in stealing two cows—he said, "Well, I will tell the truth; I went to Taylor's house on that night; he said he had two cows, and asked me to help him slaughter them: I did so, and don't know what became of them."</p>

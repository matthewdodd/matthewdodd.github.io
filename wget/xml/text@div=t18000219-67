               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober? - A. I was not drunk, I knew very well what I said and did; I had been at two or three public-houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did it happen? - A. I do not know the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you so drunk you could not tell that? - A. I am a stranger in the place; I have not been in town above a week; I met with the prisoners in the street, and they desired me to go into a house with them, which I did; I went with them into a public-house; I am sure the prisoners are the same women; we staid a few minutes; we had a glass of something a-piece; it was some wine-vaults; when we came out, I meant to go home into Wood-street, and I thought I was going the right way; and as I went along, one got before me and the other behind me, and stopped me; the prisoner Brown got her hand under my coat, and took out my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your watch in your sob? - A. No; in my waistcoat pocket; I thought it would be safer, with my great coat on. I felt it go, and I laid hold of her arm, and she directly gave it to the other woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you not have prevented her giving it to the other woman? - A. No; then the other woman gave it to Brown again directly; I called the watchman as hard as I could, and the watchman came and laid hold of them both, and took them to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they searched? - A. No; I saw Brown drop the watch, as they were taking them to the watch-house; Mr. Hancock shewed me the watch at the watch-house; I know it to be mine; it is marked G.M. in the outer-case and the inner-case.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Agar. (Counsel for Johnston.) Q. According to this account, Johnston did nothing? - A. The other gave her the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes, and she would not have it; she returned it again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to swear that Johnston ever offered to touch you? - A. She was behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. She never attempted to take your watch? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking a good deal? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, how many public houses had you been in? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, upon your oath, were you not in several public-houses, drinking with these women? - A. I had been in two.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, can you tell, within a pint, how much rum or brandy you had with them? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking before you met with them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Brown stood before you, did you know what she was about? - A. No, I did not; or I would not have suffered her to take it.</p>
               <p>- HANCOCK sworn. - I am a hosier, in Milk-street: Last Saturday night, I was coming home, after the clock struck twelve; when I came to the end of Mitre-court, I heard a violent outcry of, do not rob me, do not rob me; I had the came in my hand that I have now, and I stepped into the court, and saw the man struggling with the two woman at the bar, it was rather dark; there was another little man with them, Morley was calling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180002190050"></xptr>out, that they had robbed him of his watch; the women began to call him fool, and said that he was drunk, and there was a scene of confusion; I enquired of the man who he was, and he said, he was a watchman; I then desired him to conduct them to the watch-house immediately; we got on with considerable difficulty to Aldermanbury, and there she dropped the watch down by her side; I picked it up, and went on with them to the watch-house; Morley there charged Brown with taking it from him; when it was communicated that I had the watch, he was asked if he should know it, he said, yes, it was marked G.M.; I produced the watch to the constable of the night, and the prosecutor claimed it; they were afterwards conveyed to Giltspur-street Compter, but they were very unruly both of them, and it was with very great difficulty that they were got there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown. Q. Could you distinguish whether it was dropped by the prosecutor, or by me? - A. I did not see her hand; I saw it drop by her side.</p>
               <p>The WATCHMAN sworn. - I heard the prosecutor call, watch; I went up, and saw them scuffling together; I laid hold of Brown, and took her along, and the prosecutor took her along, as far as Lad-lane, and then the other watchman took her; he said, he had lost his watch, and they had it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Agar. Q. He was very drunk, was he not? - A. No, he did not stagger, nor nothing at all.</p>

               <p>Brown's defence. He wanted me to take half-a-guinea to go home and sleep with me; he took us up Mitre-court, and behaved in a very rude impudent manner; then he said, he had lost his watch, at another public-house; we went to two or three public-houses, and had a glass of pepper-mint at each, and he drank brandy; I know nothing at all of the watch, it must have dropped from himself.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Johnston called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

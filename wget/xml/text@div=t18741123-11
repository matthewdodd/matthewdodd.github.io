                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 92). On the evening of 21st October, from information I received I went to Gravel Lane—I there saw a van standing before the prisoner Howe's shop, No. 117; he is a retail coal dealer—Sutton and Feasey were there, and Howe was inside his shop—the name of "Rickett, Smith &amp; Co." was on both sides of the van and in front, in large letters, and the prices of the coal, 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when I passed again Feasey was in the act of shooting some sacks of coals into a compartment in Howe's shop—at that time I saw two or three sacks in the van—Sutton was standing at the tail of the van shifting them—I went back into Houndsditch, which was about fifty yards, to get the assistance of a man in uniform—I then returned to the shop—Sutton was then in the act of lifting the sacks from the ground into the van—after speaking to him I asked Howe whether he had got any invoice—he said "No, I never ordered the coals; the man asked me to buy them. I was going to give him 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them; I can buy the same coals for 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said "It is very singular that you should buy of a man in the street for 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when you can get them for 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the usual way"—I then left Howe and Sutton in the custody of two officers while I went to Fenchurch Street—I asked Sutton in Howe's presence for his delivery book—he gave it me, and I produce it—I pointed out an entry to him of the name of Scott, 17, Fenchurch Street, and asked him what it referred to—he said that he had two tons of coal to deliver there—I went there and saw the housekeeper, and saw four vans outside the door, and from what I stated the housekeeper had the sacks counted in my presence—there were eighty sacks—I then went with the housekeeper into Mr. Scott's office—Jones, White, Feasey, and Lucy presented their delivery books for signature—the housekeeper declined to sign them—they each said that they had delivered their coals—I asked them where the other man was—I did not know Sutton's name at that time—they said they did not know—I after wards took Feasey into custody—at the station that night, when the charge was taken, Howe remarked that he was going to give 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the coals—Sutton replied "Don't talk like that; we offered them to you for <hi rend="italic">ll.</hi>, and you were only going to give us 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and you were afterwards going to make it 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old next March—I was employed by Mr. Howe to carry out coals—I was in the shop with John when a man came and asked for Mr. Howe—the son called his father up from downs tairs—he came up—the man said to him "Governor I have a ton of good coals to sell, I have been to a place with two tons, they have only taken one ton in because they have not sufficient room for the other, if we take them back there will double carriage"—master asked where did he fetch them from—he said from Rickett and Smith's—master asked him what was the price of them—the coalman pulled a book out of his pocket, saying "25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to dealers"—master asked him where they were; he said at the top of the street—master went to look at them, and when they both came back with the coals master told him to shoot them—when he had part of them shot master asked him for a bill—he said he had none, he had lost the bill—master told him to go back to the office and fetch a bill—he said the office closed at 5 o'clock, he would fetch one tomorrow—master said if he did not fetch a bill he would go himself and pay the money—the coal man said "Don't do that, I will fetch a bill in the morning"—he then went outside and he was counting some of the sacks while the other was taking the coals in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not think there was anything wrong in the transaction—I was sitting down in the shop—I was attending very carefully to what was being said—I did not hear young Howe give his evidence—I was in Court—I know that I have told word for word what he told—we have not talked over together what we could prove—I was not called at tile Police Court—master has been out on bail since last Session—he did not speak to me at all about what I had to say—I told Mr. Pratt (<hi rend="italic">the solicitor's clerk</hi>) what I could say and he took it down—I had not told my master before that what I could say—since I spoke to Mr. Pratt I have spoken to young Howe about what I was going to say to-day; I came here with him to-day—we did not talk about what we were going to say—I did not write it down—my master left the shop for about five minutes and then came back with Sutton and the cart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have told the truth—I heard what I have stated pass about the coal—master was taken into custody on Wednesday and was before the Magistrate on the Thursday—I was there—he was in custody from the Thursday to the Monday, when he was before the Magistrate again—during that time I had not seen him—I made my statement to Mr. Pratt on the Thursday I think at Basinghall Street, at Mr. Buchanan's office—that was before I went to the Police Court—I had not seen my. master between the time of his being taken into custody and my going to Mr. Buchanan's office. (<hi rend="italic">The witness was desired by the</hi> Court <hi rend="italic">to repeat his evidence, which he did in precisely the same terms.</hi>)</p>

               <p>I was downstairs with him—I followed him up into the shop in about two minutes—I found the coal man there—he said "Governor, I have got a ton of good coals I will sell you"—Howe said "Where are they?"—he said "At the top of the street," and he went and looked at them—before he went he asked how much—he said "25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., " pulling out a book—when they came back he told him to shoot them—when they were most all shot he asked him for a bill, so that he could go up stairs and get him the money—he said he had none, for he had lost it—Howe said if ha had not got one he should take the money to the office—he said "Don't do that, I will bring you one to-morrow morning."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was a book like the one produced that the man pulled out—I did not see what was inside it—I did not see whether Howe looked at it or not—I was not at the Police Court—I had other business to attend to—the coals were not all shot when he asked about the bill; there were two or three sacks to be shot.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Buchanan, of Basinghall Street, and have charge of the criminal cases—I was acting on his behalf in this charge against Mr. Howe—he was arrested on Wednesday night, the 21st—he was brought up in custody on 22nd and remanded till 26th—on the morning of the 22nd I had Mr. Howe's statement, and I had each of the lads separately in the room—I was present at the Court on the 22nd; Mr. Buchanan at tended—I was prepared with the witnesses on the 26th—the prisoner's statement was taken down by Mr. Buchanan—he is an old client of his—I took the evidence of the two boys on the Thursday morning after—I took the prisoner's statement, but not in writing, I did not think it necessary, it was so exactly similar to what the prisoner told me—Mr. Buchanan after wards took it down in writing to instruct counsel—that was done between the Thursday and the Monday.</p>

I went down stairs to seek for a patrol, the patrol found a half-guinea, and three shillings, under the grate, amongst the ashes; I can swear to one of the shillings.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrol: Last Wednesday morning, about a quarter before two o'clock, I was going my round in the Almonry, I met the prosecutor, he told me he had been robbed of half-a-guinea, and three shillings; he said he should know the girl again; I went into the room, and searched in the tea-pot, and every where I could think of; at last I found the half-guinea, and three shillings, amongst the ashes under the grate; he described one of the shillings to me as being marked with No. 8, and an H.

               <p>Prisoner's defence. The man went with me, and that shilling that he has sworn to is the shilling he gave me; the other money I found upon the bed after he was gone. <rs id="t17980523-36-verdict191" type="verdictDescription">

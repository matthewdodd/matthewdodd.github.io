             asked me to fight (I had never seen him before) - I would not fight, and when I went to go out of the street, the other man knocked me down - I do not know the man who knocked me down, I only know Doyle - I do not know whether the one who knocked me down was in company with the other - after they knocked me down, they took three half-crowns, three shillings, and a sixpence out of my left hand coat pocket - I cannot say who took it; I had 1s. 6d. in my right hand pocket, they did not take that - Nelling saw it all; I have been in London five months - both the men ran away after taking my money; and a little while afterwards I went after a policeman, and he took Doyle the same night; they struck me in the face and ear when they knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not there a regular fight between you and one of the men? A. No; I was not abusing the King - I did not d-n the King of England; I did not say that the King was married to a German lady, and that the Germans had a right to do what they liked in England; that was not the way the battle began - I will swear I said nothing about the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050021"></xptr>King nor the Queen either - I had been with the girl in a public-house, in Plough-court, before the row began - I had not been drinking, only dancing; the room was full of people - there were plenty of people in the street when the fight was going on.</p>

             (through an interpreter). I was at the public-house with the prosecutor on a Saturday in August - I do not know the day of the month; I left the public-house with him, and as soon as we came into Essex-street, Mahony asked him to fight - there were four of them together; the prosecutor did not say any thing to them before they asked him to fight - one of them knocked him down; he got up and told me somebody had taken his money; I did not see it taken; I had seen him shortly before with 11s. and 1s. 6d. - as soon as they knocked him down they ran away - I did not see them do any thing; I went down Whitechapel to look for a policeman; I can tell the person of any of the men except the one who knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you understand English? A. I speak it a little; Bender understands a few words; he told the English in the German language that he would not fight - I have known him two years; I knew him over in my own country - he was paying for drink at the public-house when I saw the money; there was a good many there who he asked to drink, I had some, and Bender took a little - there was a few words before he was knocked down, but not about the King and Queen - when the prisoner knocked him down he said, "A German b-r, why don't you go over to your own country?" Bender heard that; it was said in English; Bender made no answer to it.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was on duty on this Saturday in Essex-street, Whitechapel; I don't recollect the day of the month - I was not present when this took place; I met one of our policemen with a young man, in consequence of what they said, I went into the Rose and Crown, Essex-street; I saw Doyle there, but the man who went with me did not know him; I came out to go to the place where the prosecutor was knocked down, and Doyle followed us to the place; I received information from a person who was standing by, and I asked Bender if that was one of them, he turned round and said it was; Doyle heard that, and said he knew nothing of it - I took him into custody, searched him, found nothing on him at all - I apprehended Mahony on the Monday following; I found nothing on him but 3d. and a duplicate; I knew both the prisoners very well, I had seen them on the Saturday before the robbery two or three times, they were at the Rose and Crown in Essex-street together, about eleven o'clock that evening, but I can't say whether they were in company.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I was in Catherine Wheel-court, Essex-street, at eleven o'clock - my wife was there; there were three of us there - I saw the prosecutor there with two females dressed in the foreign fashion - I saw Mahony there - I did not hear Bender say any thing about King William - I saw Mahony and Bender talking together, but did not understand what they said - I was passing out of the court into Essex-street, and did not notice - I did not know what language they talked - I saw the prosecutor go into Essex-street, Mahony followed and put himself in an attitude of sparring, and while I stood there the other prisoner came up, and knocked the prosecutor down - I am positive it was not Mahony that knocked him down - I heard the other prisoner say, he could knock him down if anybody else could not - I believe that was in reply to something that passed in the court - the prosecutor was not down a second before he ran into Whitechapel.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You say the prosecutor was not down a moment? A. No, not before he recovered himself and ran into Whitechapel, and I pursued him leaving the prisoner Mahony with his wife - I was near him when he was knocked down - neither of the prisoners were near him when he was down, they were across the street; Mahony was talking to his wife - there was a lamp, but not exactly close to it - I swear nobody touched him when he was down; I was close enough to be certain neither of them were near him after he was down.</p>

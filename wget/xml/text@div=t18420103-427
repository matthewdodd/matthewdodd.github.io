                  </hi>. I am a boot-maker, and live in the Poultry. On the 22nd of December, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was in my shop and heard a noise—I turned round and saw the prisoner, who had come about a yard and a half into the shop, going out with two odd boots—I followed and gave him in charge, about five yards from the door, to a policeman, who took them from him—these produced are them.</p>

I was on duty—I heard a call of "Stop him"—the prisoner passed me at that moment—I took him, and found the boots in his possession—as I took him along I asked the manner he was going to dispose of them—he said as they were odd ones, he should get 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, but if they had been a pair he should have 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked what shop he was in the habit of taking them to—he said the shop where he sold them could match all kind of boots, and would take in any thing at a regular price.</p>

I am the daughter of James Croft, who keeps the Swan at Waltham-green—on 18th July, about a quarter to 3 o'clock, the prisoner came for a glass of ale, which came to threehalfpence; he gave me a shilling—I gave him sixpence and fourpence halfpenny change—I put the shilling in the front compartment of the till, where there was only a sixpence and a fourpenny-piece—the prisoner left, and five or ten minutes afterwards Mr. Abbott and Mr. Parry came in—I then looked at the shilling and found it was bad—there was no other there—no one else had been serving in the bar; I wad there all the time—I saw Pike bite the shilling—he went out and came back with the prisoner, and said, "Is this the man?" and I said, "Yes," and he was given in custody—I gave the shilling to Pike.</p>

I am a greengrocer of Waltham-green—on 18th July I was at the corner of Water ford-road, and heard the prisoner say to two other men, "There is four for you, and five for you" giving them something wrapped in paper—they went away, and I followed them—I first went to my house, and then to Waltham-green—I passed the prisoner close to the White Hart, where he was standing for a few minutes—he afterwards crossed the road and went into the urinal at the King's Head; he stooped down, put something down, and walked out to the Swan public-house first</p>

               <p>and then to the Swan tap—they are distinct; one is a beer shop, and the other a public-house—after he left he went into the watering-place again, stooped down in the same corner, walked out, and went towards London—I am certain he did not make water there either time—I kept the watering-place in sight; nobody else went in—I afterwards saw Mr. Abbott and told him to go there—I saw him go and take something up, and he brought across six bad shillings wrapped up in separate papers, and a piece of paper round the whole—I went to the Swan and then to the Swan tap—in cones<lb></lb>quence of what I said the barman left the Swan tap, and I looked in the till and saw a bad shilling and some small money—I saw Abbott give the six bad shillings to the sergeant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sawyer, of 51, Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square—on 20th November, about a quarter past 11 o'clock, I was looking out of the window of the top room of the Manor-house, and saw the prisoner standing in Princes-street—the prosecutor came up; and I saw her take something from under her shawl and throw it in his face—I thought it was water, and that it was done in jest—the prosecutor stooped his head, cried out "Oh", and dropped something which he had in his right hand—when I got near him, I saw that vitriol had been thrown in his face—he was taken to a doctor's, and then to the hospital.</p>

I am a hackney-carriage driver, of 14, Rodney-row, Old Kent-road—on the evening of 19th December I had been sleeping in the stable in the yard—the prisoner's husband took my cab out at about a quarter past ten on the morning of the 20th—I went out at about a quarter-past eleven and met the prisoner—I never spoke to her and she never spoke to me, but she deliberately took a tumbler from under her apron and threw it into my face—I had this hat on at the time (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it produced all these injuries on my face—I had known her about a month previously—I was with her on the Friday previous at the York hotel, Waterloo-road; her husband was there, but he left—she had a pawn ticket of mine at her house—I had pawned something to save them their rent, and she asked me to come in, she was on the bed with her child in her arms, I was swinging on the door, and said, "No"—I came out and she followed me into Stam<lb></lb>ford-street—she wanted me to give her something to eat, and pay for her room for her for a short time, but I would not do it—I went away and went to the Victoria theatre by myself—I saw her and her husband at a coffee stall that night, we were all joking and laughing—I saw her husband on Sunday and told him what she wanted me to do—we parted, and on Monday morning this accident happened.</p>

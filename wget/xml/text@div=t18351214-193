                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live in Houndsditch. The prisoner was in my employ errand-boy for about three months, up to the time he was apprehended. On Tuesday, the 24th of November, I marked some silver, and left it in the till, which is secured by a patent lock—I locked it—on the following morning, about ten o'clock, I missed two shillings and some copper from it—the copper was not marked—I went for a constable—the prisoner was searched in my per seance, and one shilling of the marked money found on him; also some copper money, and a sixpence, not marked—I had not been to the till after lock. ing it—I kept the key in my browsers' pocket—I never marked any money before—the till had not been opened for business that morning.</p>

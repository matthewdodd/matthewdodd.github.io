On the 22d I was informed, about half after eleven o'clock, that captain Kington's servant was taken to Bow-street by a pawnbroker; I went to Bow-street, and I found captain Kington and the prisoner there; I know no more about it.</p>

            's, he asked ten guineas for it: seeing the watch a very valuable one. I asked him how he came by it; he said he had just arrived from Ireland, and had received it for a year's wages in Ireland, for the sum of twenty-five guineas; I asked him whom he lived with there; he said, with a captain Sherwood, who lived at the Exchange coffee-house; I then interrogated him still closer, doubting the watch to be his, and he then said he gave twenty-five guineas for it, that it was his watch: by his varying in his story, I doubted what he said, and I sent for an officer; he seemed inclined to make off, and I went round on the other side of the counter to prevent his running off; when an officer came, I gave charge of him; he then desired that the officer might go with him to his master, who, he said, lived in Craven-street; when we came to the end of Henrietta-street, he attempted to make off; the constable called to me, and requested me to keep close behind, for he found some difficulty in holding him fast, and, passing a hair-dresser, he holloaed out, Mr. Foxhall; we then came as far as the Old Hummums, and he laid hold of the rails, but we at last disengaged him from them, and took him to Carpmeal's, in Bow-street; I asked Mr. Foxhall if he knew who was his master; he said, yes, it was the Hon. Mr. Kington, who lodged at the New Hummums; I then said to the constable, it would be the most prudent thing to go to the New Hummums, to see if he lived there; I went up stairs, and found Mr. Kington; I carried the watch, and that was the way Mr. Kington came to know about it.

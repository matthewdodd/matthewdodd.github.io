I went up to my drawers for a pair of sheets, and found they were gone; I also missed the articles stated in the indictment, they are worth 4l. The prisoner slept in the garret, in going up to his room, he must pass the room where the property was; I always keep the door locked, but had left it open on that day and the day before. I saw the watch again the next day after I had missed it. I had seen the things safe three days before.</p>

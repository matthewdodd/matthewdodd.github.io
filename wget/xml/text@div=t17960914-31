               <p>Q. Then how do you know that some other person might not have had these planes, and the prisoner afterwards came into the possession of these planes by honest means? - A. I am very sure nobody could go into the room without my knowing it.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that he who had access to the room did not take them out? - A. Yes; I can swear it very safely.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to his lodgings did not he very readily give them up to you? - A. No; I was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your first husband? - A. A carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. You know all the tools belonging to a carpenter? - A. No; if I am a carpenter's wife, I am not a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear to all the tools your husband had as a carpenter? - A. I really believe I can very safely; because he always put his name upon every tool he had.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer belonging to Lambeth-street; eighteen planes, and a drawing-square, were delivered to me at the office by Mr. Amis, on Friday the 1st of July. (Produce them).</p>
               <p>Amis. These are the tools I delivered to the officer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. These are the planes that were claimed by Mrs. Parmenter? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Perhaps, at the time you delivered them to the constable, you marked them? - A. They have the stamp of Mrs. Parmenter's first husband upon them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is the mark? - A. Thropp, her first husband's name.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Parmenter. I know these were my husband's planes, as my husband stamped them all with his name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You were always present when your husband disposed of his planes? - A. I can swear that he never parted with any.</p>
               <p>Q. Had all your planes that mark upon them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he never parted with any that had his mark upon them? - A. I can swear he never did, because he had a son that he was bringing up to the trade.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not count how many tools he had? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear he never parted with any tools with that name upon it? - A. I am sure he never did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My master and I had all these planes to work with three quarters of a year in his shop.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Amis.) Q. He says they were worked with in your shop? - A. No; they never were in my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual for carpenters to have tools of their own independent of their master? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he had none of these tools at work in your shop? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Will you swear you have not used tools with this name upon them? - A. I will not: I was at work three weeks at the house before I employed the prisoner; I borrowed two or three ogees of her because I would not go home to fetch them, and I returned them to her again; the prisoner was not at work for me then, he came to work for me in July 1795, and I discharged him in June 1796.(The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.)</p>
               <p>Jury. (To the Prosecutrix.) Q. Had you seen them in the box after the death of your husband? - A. Yes; at the time that Mr. Amis worked at my house, when he wanted to buy them.</p>

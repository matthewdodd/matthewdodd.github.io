             sworn. - I am a carpenter: Last Friday was a fortnight, as I was returning home from my work, I heard a voice crying out, Thomas; upon that, I saw a man coming over a sence, near the corner of a house adjoining the prosecutor's, the prisoner is the man; he then turned into the court where the front door opened; I followed him, and the woman of the house opened the door, she laid hold of him, and said, that was the man; he did not make any resistance; a neighbour and she held him while her husband went for an officer; I then left them.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BARKER sworn. - Last Friday was a fortnight, in the evening, as I was coming down Princes-court, I heard a noise, and saw Mrs. George holding a man by the collar; I assisted to secure him till her husband got an officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been at a shipmate's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120022"></xptr>house in Virginia-row, I heard a cry of stop thief, and they stopped me.(A person in the gallery requested to be heard by the Court. - He is sworn).</p>
               <p>On Friday, the 23d of June, my sister-in-law came to me, and told me a man was taken up for stealing something out of the garden; I have lived four years in the neighbourhood, and never changed a word with Mrs. George; when my sister had told me this, I went to them, I said, I would advise you to get an officer, there is no sufficient evidence to prove that any body saw it, by all means get an officer; accordingly they got an officer; Barker and I were standing at the door, I said to him, how was it; why, says he, I went up to the door, and Mrs. George laid hold of him, and said, this is the man; says he, I laid hold of him too; let me go, says the prisoner; no, says he, I will be d-d if I let you go before the husband comes; then an officer was got, and they were soliciting him to own it; how it terminated after that I cannot presume to tell; I said, I should like to see how it was, for he seemed to be very innocent; says Mrs. George, he was on this board getting over into the other yard; it was so low, that she might have laid hold of his coat and pulled him back again; he might have gone four different ways, one towards the Bird-cage, at Hackney, with more case than he could have come round to the front of the house.</p>

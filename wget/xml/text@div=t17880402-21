               <p>On Saturday, the 22d of March, about one o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner go into the window without a bundle, and come out with one; he was in about five minutes; I went to Mrs. Wilson, and told her, and she missed the things immediately; I had seen the prisoner walking to and fro' most of the morning; he was taken up on the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the boy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To Prosecutrix. Were any of your things found upon the prisoner? - No; before the Justice he said, I could not have my things, but if I made a charge of them, he must pay for them.</p>
               <p>How long before Rebecca Singleton told you of this, had you seen your things? - Not ten minutes before.</p>

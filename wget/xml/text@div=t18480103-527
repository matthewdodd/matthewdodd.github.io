                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Kinsey—we live in Charles-street, Woolwich—the prisoner is my sister—I took her into my house, as she was in great distress, about a fortnight all but two days before she robbed me. On 20th Dec. I had a sovereign, two half-sovereigns, and five shillings in my little work-box on the drawers in my bed-room—the box was not locked—about one o'clock I went the back way into my bed-room, and saw the drawers open—I looked, and missed a new dress that I had never had on, from the bottom drawer, a white petticoat, a shawl, a boa, and some stock<lb></lb>ings from my bed-room—I missed all the articles and the money from the box—I had seen the whole safe the same morning—the prisoner was then gone.</p>

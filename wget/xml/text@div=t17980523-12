               <p>- CLARKE sworn. - I lived as footman with Mr. Hartley, in <placeName id="t17980523-12-crimeloc61">Devonshire-street, Portland-place</placeName>

While he was eating, I had occasion to answer the bell several times, nobody but myself being in the kitchen at that time; I did not miss the fork that night, he stopped about an hour. The next morning I missed the fork, I enquired amongst my fellow servants, they did not know any thing about it; the prisoner had told me that he would be the next morning at a public-house, the corner of Quebec-street, to give me more information concerning this situation; missing the fork I went to meet him, but he did not come to the time appointed; I saw no more of him till evening; after dinner I met him in Portland place, I told him we had missed such a thing, and he strongly denied having it; I asked him if he would go with me to the butler, and satisfy him that he had not it; he said he would after he had been to Upper Harley-street; he went there, the person was not at home; then he would not go with me, he said, he had got to go to Upper Grosvenor-street, the person was not at home there; and then he would not go; then we went to Curzon-street, May-fair, and then I got him to go with me; he would not go in then, he said, I might send the butler out to him, for he would not go in; I went, and in the mean time he ran away, and I saw no more of him till the fifth of May, when he was brought to Marlborough-street Office.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM FOX sworn. - I am a dealer in silver: The prisoner came to me on Friday evening, the 4th of May, and asked me if I bought old silver, to which I replied in the affirmative; he then produced some part of a fork; I suspected it was stole; I asked him how he got it; he told me it was his own, that he was a servant out of place, that he had received it of another gentleman's servant to sell; I told him, that was not likely, and begged him to tell me the truth; he said, if I must have the truth, he found it in Wimpole-street; I told him, I did not believe either of his stories. I sent for an officer, and he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Clarke. I cannot swear positively to the fork, I can produce another like it, they were both made by one maker; I bought a fork in the room of it, which cost me twenty-seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I picked it up the corner of Wimpole-street.</p>

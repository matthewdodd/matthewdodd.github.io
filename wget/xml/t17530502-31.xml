               <p>Pratt. I have known him two years and upwards; I enquired among the pawnbrokers, and found it in the possession of Mr. Gibbons, a pawnbroker. ( Produced in court, and deposed to by an Elephant's head for a crest, &amp;c.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gibbons. I think the prisoner brought this spoon on Monday the 19th of March to pawn; he wanted 6 s. on it; I asked him whose it was; he said it was his own; I asked him if he had any more; he said he had three; I asked him who he bought them of; he told me Mr. Johnson, a Pawnbroker, and that he gave 9 s. a piece for 'em. I weighed it, it weighed 2 ounces, then I said, I hoped the others were a great deal bigger than this, if he gave that money for them; he said they were a great deal bigger (and this was worth much more than nine shillings, I was satisfied he had not bought them for that money); so I said I would stop it: he told me his name was

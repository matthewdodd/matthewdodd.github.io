               <p>I am an officer of the city. On the 20th of November Foxley came to me and said, he had lost his watch and asked me to go along with him and apprehend the prisoner; I told him I was obliged to go to the Mansion house; he said, he expected to see him at twelve o'clock; says I, do you seize him, when I came back I found he had taken the man; I went before the Lord Mayor and he was discharged and nothing found on him. On some other occasion his master had desired me to get some duplicates of blankets which he had lost, he said, he had made away with them; I saw his wife and him fumbling in a box together; I catched hold of the box, and I found this duplicate in her hussiff in the box, pledged on Wednesday night after he had been turned up by the Lord Mayor; the maker's name was on the duplicate, which the prosecutor told me; I acquainted the prosecutor; he went with me to the pawnbroker's and said, it was his watch.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150170"></xptr>Prisoner. The person that you took the duplicate from was not my wife, nor did belong to me nor was it my room. - You called her your wife, and you lodged there.</p>
               <p>Mr. BAKER sworn.</p>
               <p>I live with Mr. Harrison the corner of Tottenham court road, opposite great Russel-street; I know the prisoner. On the 20th of November, between eight and nine in the evening, he came to me to pledge a silver watch; I am sure I took it of that man; I took it in for 12 s. 6 d. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord this man accuses me of my apartment belonging to me, it does not; I never took the room nor lodged in it, nor paid rent for it; I took my linen to wash there once a week; I had no property in the box.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to pawn them? - I did not.</p>

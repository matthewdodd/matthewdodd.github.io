On 8th Jan., between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, I left two friends in High Street, Borough, and turned up Chapel Place—there is a narrow pas<lb></lb>sage that you have to go through, and just about the end of the passage I was knocked down by two men, both of them knelt upon me—one put his hand over my mouth to prevent my calling out, while the other cut the right hand pocket of my trousers and took out 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a knife and a comb—I called out as soon as I could—they left me on the ground—a policeman came shortly afterwards and picked me up—I felt in my pocket, and my money and knife and comb were gone—I went to the police station about half-past 1 o'clock, and saw the two prisoners there, but I could not swear to them—I saw my knife and comb—I had a cap on my head which I lost—the police<lb></lb>man had it at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Thome of Chapel Court—on 8th Jan., about 12 o'clock at night, I was in my own house—I heard the screams of a woman about a quarter before 1 o'clock—I went out to see what it was, and a woman went out of the passage followed by the two prisoners, and another man who had a stick in his hand—I heard one of the men say "There is an old <hi rend="italic">bloke"</hi>—the woman screamed and called murder and police, and the men called her very abusive names—the prisoners and she were together, and she called police and murder and said "Ma'am they will rob you; they are thieves and robbers"—I went in my house, and I heard a man call "police"—I went to the door and the three men were coming up the passage towards me—I heard one of them say distinctly, "I have got the <hi rend="italic">browns"</hi>—they came under the gas light, and Saunders had some silver and copper in his hand—I called out "Thieves and robbers" and they ran down to the public house and went in at the side door of the Blue Eyed Maid, kept by Walker—I went into my house, and in five minutes I came out and saw the policeman—the men had all three caps on, the first time—the last time, I did not observe—I saw the constable search about and pick up a cap and a comb—I went in again—the three men went into the public house—I saw the two prisoners at the station about 2 o'clock.</p>

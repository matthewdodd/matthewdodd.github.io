I have been a pawnbroker but have retired, and five at Norchfleet, in Kent I have some premise's in Clerkenwell, and was building a wall—the prisoner is a bricklayer—I employed him to do this on the 5th of July—the house joins the wall-Millen, my agent, had he letting of it—I do not know whether the house was festened—I lost a bed and bolster out of my house—I did not give him leave to take them.</p>

                  </hi>. I was agent of the prosecutor. I missed the things Sunday—the last time I saw them was on Thursday—I then fastened the house, and left all secure—I nailed the cellar flap down, and that was broken up—this bed and bolster were taken away, and a good deal of other property of brass work—I saw the prisoner about the premises re<lb></lb>pairing the wall previous to the Sunday, between the Thursday and the Sunday—I was present when the bed and bolster were found in the pri<lb></lb>soner's house, in New-court, Peter's-lane—the prisoner was at home—we net him previously to going to his house, and accused him of certain pro<lb></lb>perty being lost—he said all was right—Mr. Roberts asked him what was right—he said, "Your sashes, and soon"—we then went to his house, and found the bed on his bedstead—I then accused him of taking the things—he said the place was broken open in the night, and he took it there for security—he knew where I lived—I cannot tell whether he knew I was the prosecutor's agent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bonnet-manufacturer, of High-street, Shoreditch. Maria Borreman was my servant. On 24th Oct. I spoke to her, and her box was searched by a constable, and these ribbons and cap-fronts found in it, and a piece of paper which had covered a draper's parcel, with the prisoner's address on it—I gave the girl in charge, and went to the prisoner's house, 5, Trafalgar-road, Dalston, between ten and eleven o'clock in the day—she came to the door—I said, "Is your name Hawkins?"—she said, "Yes; I believe you are after Maria"—I said, "My name is Freestone; I believe you are the aunt of Maria, who lives with me"—she said, "No; I am a distant relation"—I said, "She has been robbing me, and I believe you have some boxes here belonging to her"—she said she had one that was in the front kitchen—she was very much agitated—I said I did not wish to injure her, and told her to compose herself—I went into the kitchen—the box was locked—the policeman opened it with a key taken from Borreman—we found</p>

               <p>in it some towels, with my mark, and a roll of ribbon—I said, "Is this all?"—she said, 'Yes"—I said, "Are you positive?"—she-said, "Yes"—I said, "I am satisfied to the contrary; I have two letters, which prove you have two silk dresses here belonging to Maria," and insisted on searching the house—she said we had no right—I told the officer to proceed—she said, "There is ano<lb></lb>ther box at the top of the stairs, on the landing," she took me there and showed it me—the policeman unlocked it with one of the keys, and found upwards of 900 yards of ribbon, some straw trimming, a small portion of lace, and some silk cord—some of the ribbon is worth 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard, but taking it at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. it is worth 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is new, and cut off in lengths of three or four yards each, from pieces which I have brought here—here are also a dozen rolls of ribbon, some with thirty-six yards, and some less—this parcel was found behind the door of the children's room, at the bottom of a basket of dirty clothes—it contained a handkerchief, a pair of stockings, (from which the mark had been tried to be erased,) and some ribbons and flowers—there were two bonnets on the bed—I said, "That is one of our ribbons"—we had bonnets trimmed with it, and if they do not sell, we take the ribbon off—she said, "Maria gave me that, and said one of the young ladies at your house gave it her"—that is nt ver done, it would be put on a lower-priced bonnet—in a cupboard in the front sitting-room I found a black silk dress, worth 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 38<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I had silk like it—my servant slept in the house, and had no occasion to have a trunk at the prisoner's—three or four other boxes, locked, were pointed out as belonging to her—I found in them some books, (one of which I identify,) some plaid silk for a dress, some new stockings and boots—there was nothing which was not under lock and key, but the ribbon on the bonnet and the parcel behind the door—the value of the things I identify is from 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., independent of those in the three or four boxes.</p>

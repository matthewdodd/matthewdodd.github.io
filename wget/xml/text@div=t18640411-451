I am a lighterman at 132, Long-alley—early on the morning of 9th March I was in Long-alley, outside the prosecutor's door—they shut at 12—it was after the time of shutting up, and I went up the court to the back yard door—I found it open—I could not get in and I went into the water closet—I then heard two men's voices, whispering—I did not hear what they said—I don't know what became of them—the closet is in he yard, and the men were in the yard—the doors of the house were all hut—I called out, "What are you doing there?" and the men ran away through the back yard door—the house had not been disturbed at all.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 125). I was on duty in Bloomfield-street, on 4th March, in the neighbourhood of Long-alley—I saw all three of the prisoners together, coming out of the end of Eldon-street, about a quarter past 2 in the morning—they were walking in a hurried manner—as soon as they had passed me, I saw the last witness, and from what he said I followed them up Liverpool-street, and took Rushton into custody—I halload out" Stop thief," which brought several other constables to the spot—Arnold and McDermott ran up towards Bishopsgate-street—Eldon-street is about twenty or thirty yards from Malpass's beershop—I pursued Rushton along New Broad-street, and while doing so I saw him throw something away—I apprehended him—I took him back to that place, and found this chisel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—two other constables then brought up Arnold and Mc'Dermott—these galoshes were found in Rushton's pocket, with two knives, a door key, a watch and chain, and some silent matches.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

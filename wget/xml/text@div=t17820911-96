The prisoner Layfoe was in the same room, sitting on a chair near the door; he had this file in his hand, (producing a file), and when he saw me he immediately dropped a piece of money that he was filing the edges of like a sixpence; the file he laid on a chair, there lay upon the chair by the side of him a parcel of unfinished sixpences and shillings, in the window near Weatherby these lay, which appear to have been already filed, (more sixpences and shillings) on the window where Weatherby was at work, were two sixpences and a shilling the sixpences and shilling had been filed, and rubbed with this cloth and sand-paper (produces the shilling that Weatherby was at work on) there are four shillings I that found in the back window in the same room, and three sixpences by them. We found crucibles, metal, sand paper, and aquafortis, and files; here are the patterns from which the good ones are made; the sand was already damped, and some of it had been used, there was some metal on the mantle-piece, the crucibles were quite hot; the two prisoners were without their coats, Weatherby had his shirt sleeves tucked up, and Layfoe had his coat tucked up, but not his shirt; one of them had his slippers on, I cannot say which, their hands were dirty: I saw them both very plainly at work, one had a sixpence, and the other had a shilling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. I think you say the outward door was wide open? - Yes; I let myself in.</p>
               <p>The door of the room was shut, but not fastened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And they used no violence? - Behaved as civil as could be; they said, it was all over.</p>
               <p>Did they not tell you they had been playing at skettles? - No.</p>
               <p>Did they not tell you the room belonged to one Cresswell? - No; I have heard it belonged to him, I have seen him once since.</p>
               <p>Why any other man might not have taken up a shilling as well as this Weatherby? - I do not know, I should not chuse to do it myself.</p>
               <p>You are wiser than him, do you swear that when you came into the room, these men were actually at work? - I do swear it positively, Sir.</p>
               <p>I should suppose a very innocent man might rub shilling ? - Weatherby was rubbing a shilling with them nippers; he said he was a dead man, and it did not signify making any words.</p>

               <p>Prisoners counsel. I believe there was a cutlass drawn against the prisoners, therefore it was a no great wonder, he should suppose himself a dead man, seeing two such gentlemen as you with a drawn cutlass? - The short one was in his slippers, and I swear Weatherby was a work.</p>

               <p>What is the process that these people that coin make use of Sir? - This is a flask that they put the sand in, whatever is cast is laid in the bottom, and they put the sand in, and crush the sand down, they put in the other part of the sand and put in the flask and crush it together: the crucibles are to melt metal in; next they take them out of the flask and scour them, and file them to take the roughness from the edge till they come smooth, then put them into aqua fortis, then rubbed in sand and water it leaves a stain in black, afterwards it is scoured, it takes out the stain and leaves white behind it (looks at the money) one of these is a good shilling this crooked one, and here is the pattern of the other; these are all good ones, this is one that has been cast, and this is one it was cast from, here is another of the same.</p>

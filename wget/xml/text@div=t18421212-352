                  </hi>. I am honorary secretary of the Friendly Loan Society, in Leicester-square. Mr. John Abel Smith is a proprietor and a trustee—there are three other trustees—the society is enrolled under the 3rd and 4th of Victoria—in Oct. and Nov., 1841, the prisoner, D. H. Nelson, was acting as clerk and cashier in the employ of the society, at a salary—on the 27th of Oct., 1841, 1 handed him this cheque—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—for disbursements to be made by him for the purposes of the society—this cheque is endorsed u his own handwriting, as having received it—on Monday, the 1st of Nov., 1841, I was at the society's office till twenty minutes to eleven o'clock in the evening—I left the agent, D. H. Nelson, there, and a clerk—next day, Tues<lb></lb>day, the 2nd of Nov., D. H. Nelson came to me at half-past two, at the Tower, where I have a department—he said that 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, in gold and notes, had been taken out of his till—he said there were four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-notes, and the rest in gold—I knew the till he was speaking of—he kept the key of it—it was a till that opened as a drawer under the counter of the office—he said there was no appearance of the lock having been forced, or anything done to it, that he had locked the till when he left the office about twelve o'clock on</p>

               <p>the over night, and the gold, silver, and notes, were then in it—he said the gold and notes had been taken, but the silver had not been touched—he said he had been to the Bank to stop the payment of the notes, and bad desired them to address the letters to me at the society's office—I gave him a letter to the treasurer, and he went away with it—he afterwards handed me this paper, at my request—(it must have been the same evening,) as I requested him to give me the numbers and dates of the missing Bank-notes, and he gave me this—I put the memorandum in red ink into my pocket—I left the Tower at four, and went directly to the office—I examined, and found there was no symptoms of any force having been applied to the lock or the till from where the money had been taken—I then examined the drawer underneath, and found there was an aperture underneath, where a person could put their hand in and take the gold and notes, or any money from the drawer, but I found it so very dusty that there was no symptom of any person having taken any—the till ran in a groove, and this aperture was on the left hand—I found the only way in which it could be approached, was by putting the hand in from the side, but it was my opinion as it was so dusty, that no person's hand had been there recently.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a traveller, and live at Cloudesley-terrace, Islington—on Saturday evening, 14th May, about half-past 8 o'clock, I was going down Commercial-street, Whitechapel, and saw the prisoners standing near the corner—they pressed upon me—Flynn was in front of me and Cousins in the rear—Flynn seized the brequet chain of my watch and I seized the guard chain, which I held fast, but the brequet chain being slight, it broke away—Cousins tried to knock my hat over my face, but knocked it off instead, and I believe I dealt him a heavy blow with my right hand on his cheek,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186406060041"></xptr>
               <p>and he kicked me very severely in the groin—I had seized Flynn by the left tail of his coat, but in consequence of the kick was obliged to release my hold, and a large rent was made in the coat by a severe struggle between us—they both escaped.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With which hand did you catch your watch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My left, but I let go of it to seize Flynn, and to my great surprise, I found it hanging in this position, but they carried away the brequet chain, seal, and key—I shouted for the police—they came up immediately, and I described the prisoners; they are the men.</p>

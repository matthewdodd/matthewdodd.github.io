On Monday, 26th July, I went to 8, Burdett Street, Westminster Bridge Road, a house occupied by a Mrs. Pear—I went into a room there, and found six sheets, a chemise, two bed-gowns, and other things, marked "West London Union"—the sheets were nearly new; they appeared to have been used once or twice—after words took those things to the union, and there saw Sarah Hardy, who has since died—I had a communication with her, and showed the things to her—on the evening of 20th August, I received two sheets and a pillow-case, also marked "West London Union," from a woman named Godsell—I took the prisoner into custody on 26th July, at Brentwood—I did not take Sarah Hardy into custody—she was before the Magistrate and was committed for trial for stealing the things—I know that she is dead.</p>

I was not in possession of the articles, as the home belonged to my mother, and I acted under her instructions; the things belonged to her. I went there as a lodger of her's after I lost my wife.</p>

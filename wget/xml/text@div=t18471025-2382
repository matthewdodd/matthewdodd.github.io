                  </hi> I have three partners—our house is in the precinct of the Savoy—we pay rent and taxes—Mr. Walter resides there—it is his dwelling-house—the prisoner was in our service since the end of April—on the 21st of Oct., in consequence of information I called him into my room—my partners were present, and an officer—I proposed to search his lodgings—he said he had no objection—he went with me and the officer to his resi<lb></lb>dence in London-wall—I saw a female there, whom he introduced as his wife—we made a search on Thursday, and found the books and prints that are now here—I know them to be our property principally—there may be one or two that are not—he said some were given to him by Mr. Hoare, and some were lent him by Mr. Roach, who is a person in our employ—he said he had some paintings, he imagined he had sold them to Mr. Rowland, he did not know whose they were, they were given to him by Mr. Roach to sell, and he had sold them—he went with us to Mr. Rowland's, who produced two of the paintings—they were ours—they had not been sold—I am positive the books are ours by the price in them, and the letter corresponds with our mark—some of them are not marked.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner come from Mr. Hoare to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I should call most of these prints soiled, but these two are in a saleable condition—he has not always told us one tale in reference to these prints and paintings—he told me these two were given him by Mr. Hoare, and the same two he said were given him by Mr. Roach for sale—he said the books were lent him by Mr. Roach, that he had sold the paintings to Mr. Rowland before we knew who had taken them, and that those paintings were given him by Roach to sell—Roach was in our employ in the same way as the prisoner is, in keeping the prints and looking after them—he may re<lb></lb>ceive a few shillings a week more than the prisoner—he had been in our employ about a fortnight or three weeks before the prisoner came—I gave Roach into custody, and his lodgings were searched—it was on a Wednesday we discovered the robbery—Mr. Roach was aware we had missed the property—I am not aware whether the prisoner knew it—we found one engraving at Mr. Roach's lodging, which he said he bought of the prisoner for a shilling—this is it—it is an engraving of the crucifixion—I do not know the value of it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, F</hi> 62.) I went to Mr. Ackerman's on the 21st of Oct.—I saw the prisoner—it was proposed to search his box and lodgings, there was not objection—he told me he sold some printings for Mr. Roach about three months ago, at Mr. Rowland's—I asked him how be received them of Mr. Roach—he said, "Sometimes by night, and sometimes by day"—Mr. Roach was called up, and stoutly denied it—I went to the pri<lb></lb>soner's lodgings, and found the books he said Mr. Roach lent him—there were one or two prints in frames—he said Mr. Hoare had given him them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He displayed the greatest readiness to give every in<lb></lb>formation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; all his statement about the pictures, and about Mr. Roach, was voluntary—we had no clue to Mr. Rowland's but what the prisoner said—when we went to his room I saw his wife go to a drawer, take some pictures out, and put them under here cloak—she was walking about the room—some of the pictures were in a box in the bed-room—they have a bed-room and a sitting-room—Mr. Roach was in custody an hour or two till we took the prisoner.</p>

             was very glad to see me, and when I had drank tea with her several times, she ask'd me if my aunt had no clothes that I could bring her: I told her my aunt had none. Then she heard that my aunt had the care of Mr. North's house, and she ask'd me to let them in to take some things away: she said it was not the first time she had been in houses in that manner, that I need not be afraid, and if I would not let her in, she would tell my aunt that I had ask'd her to come and rob the house. At last I agreed to let them in, and Reynolds and his wife came one Wednesday morning. Mr. Baker went out of town that morning in a chaise, to carry a puppy, and they waited about the door 'till he and my aunt went out. Then I let them in, and after they were in the house, they bid me shew them where the money was: I said I believ'd there was none except there was any in Mr. Baker's bureau, which was in the house-keeper's room. They went into the room, and

He took out the stay and the gown and gave them to his wife; but before this, he told me he would kill me if I did not set fire to the papers in the bureau to prevent discovery, so I was forced to do it. After the papers were lighted I shut the lid of the bureau, and then they went up stairs and took the other things.

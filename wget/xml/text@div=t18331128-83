               <p>Messrs. ADOLPHUS, SHEPHERD, and SCARLETT, conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>LADY WINTERTON. On the 22th of October, I was at Brighton, and had occasion to make a remittance to Miss Cowles in London; (looking at a letter) I wrote this letter, and inclosed in it three sovereigns - I wrapped them up in a very little bit of silver paper, and pinned the paper to the letter - I sealed the letter after enclosing the sovereigns in it - I was in a very great hurry about it - I sealed it, and think I came into the room again to look at it - I placed this little spot of wax, I know, underneath it, to keep it, and the wax is still there not broken - I gave it to the footman to give to the coachman; the letter now appears to be directed to No. 11, Manchester-street; I put No. 1, on it - I think the I must have been altered to 11 since I sent it to the Post-office; I think I directed it to No. 1 - I saw the letter at Bow-street some time ago, and three sovereigns were then in it - I cannot swear the letter was not in the same condition when I saw it at Bow-street as when I sent it to the post - I cannot swear the seal was not in the same state at Bow-street, as when I sent it to the Post-office; it had not been opened; it was opened at the office; I saw it before it was opened; it was handed to me before it was opened; it appeared rather different to what it was when it left me, because it had been tossed about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the seal look as if it had remained untouched or unbroken? A. I cannot swear one way or the other; when it was opened there, three sovereigns were in it - I cannot swear whether they were the three sovereigns I sent - the piece of silver paper was not in it; it might have dropped out - I saw the letter opened at the office; when it was opened I did not see the silver paper in it - I pinned it when I put it into the letter; I had wrapped the sovereigns in the silver paper, and pinned the silver paper to the letter - Miss Cowles, to whom I directed the letter, at that time lived at No. 1.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. I believe your ladyship has said, the sovereigns in the letter at Bow-street were not other sovereigns than those you put in the letter? A. I cannot say whether they were or not; I was in a great hurry when I put them into the letter, and put them in a very small piece of silver paper; I do not think it was as large as the palm of my hand; it was half as large; it was single paper, very thin - I was in a hurry at the time I pinned the paper to the letter; I think I pinned it to the letter; I cannot swear whether I did it so, as to prevent it falling out of the letter - I did not seal the ends of the letter - if I had addressed the letter without any money in it at all, I think it would have been exactly in the same state - I do not see any pin-holes in the letter - I will undertake to say I put a pin in the silver paper; I can only speak to the best of my recollection - I thought I pinned it - I have carefully examined the letter; I do not see a pin-hole - I sealed the letter with the same seal that is here; this is the identical impression of the seal I used; it has a plough on it; it is not my common seal, but it is the seal I sealed the letter with; I have no doubt but this is the identical impression I made on the seal of the letter - the words on the seal are "Speed the -" I stated at the office that I sealed the letter with black wax, but I said as I did not write in my own name, that I might have taken the red wax instead of the black - I am in mourning, and in the habit of using black wax, and I have no doubt I have used black wax, as it has my seal, and I use paper with a black edge - I put No. I on the letter - I was in a great hurry at the time I wrote the direction - I was in as great a hurry when I thought I pinned the silver paper to the letter - I conclude I was in a greater hurry when I wrote the address - I think I did not put two one's on the outside of the letter; any thing is possible - to the best of my recollection I only put one; I can only swear according to my recollection; I am almost sure I did not put two ones, to my recollection I only put one. I admit it might be possible - I gave it to the footman, and directed him to give it to the coach-man, who was to put it into the post-office.</p>

               <p>Q. I beg to ask whether you can swear, looking at the letter, which of those one's is your ladyship's? A. It appears to me that is the one next to the M - there is no material difference between that and the other - when I gave the letter to the footman, I desired him to tell the coachman it was a money-letter, and he must take care of it - the letter was in a very dirty condition and unopened when I saw it at Bow-street; I cannot swear that it was in a different condition to what it was when I gave it to the footman at Brighton; it was not so clean as when it was out of my hands, at the time it was sealed- the silver paper might have dropped out - it was plain the sovereigns had not dropped out, for they were in the letter when I saw it at Bow-street - the three sovereigns certainly might have dropped out accidentally.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You put the three sovereigns into a bit of silver paper? A. I did; that silver paper entirely covered the sovereigns, and formed an envelope for them, but it was very thin - I put the sovereigns and paper inside the letter, enclosed them in the front of the letter where the writing was, and turned up the ends afterwards- I directed the letter to Miss Louisa Cowles, No. 1, Manchester-street - I had no intention at all of sending to No.11 - this place was not cut when I first saw the letter at Bow-street; it was cut there - I did not perceive any silver paper or pin when I saw the letter at Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were not examined at the police-office? A. No; I was not there - I was not called on for some time after the letter was given into my hands to tell anybody about the state of the letter - I do not know how long ago it is - the examination at Bow-street, took place last week - I was not called on, except her ladyship asking me if I gave it to the coachman - I should think that is nearly a month ago - I told her I gave it to the coachman - I cannot say whether she asked me whether there was only one figure of 1 on it - the letter was sent on the 22nd of October and a few days after that, she asked me whether I took it to the post, or gave it to the coachman - I do not think she asked me any questions about the outside of the letter - I cannot say whether I have told anybody before to day, what I have said about the outside of the letter - I did not observe when I took the letter, whether there was anything in it or not - Lady Winterton told me it was a money letter - I know there was only one I on it, because I looked at the address - I did not examine it, only the address - I did not examine it at all; I only looked at it and saw what the address was - I looked at it carefully enough to see what the address was - I looked at it carefully enough to swear there was only one I on it, and not two, I am positive - I think I gave it to the coachman immediately that I brought it down from her ladyship, but I cannot swear that positively.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was the letter out of your possession from the time you received it, till you gave it to the coachman? A. No; I gave it to him in exactly the same state as I received it fromher - I should have gone to Bow-street, if her ladyship, or the solicitor desired me.</p>

            . I am coachman to Lady Winterton and was so on the 22nd of October - on that day I received a letter from Court to take to the post - I think it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening - I took it to the post-office directly, and put it into the letter box - I read the address on the letter - (looking at it) this is the letter - it was directed to No. 1; this is No. 11; there was only one 1 on it I am quite sure - it felt as if money was in the letter - I did not hear any gingle - if there was money in it, it was not loose - I put it into the office in the same state as I received it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did the footman say to you? A. He told me to take it to the post-office, and take care of it for there was money in it - I do not know the exact time the post goes out - I believe the box closes at nine o'clock - I took it to the post office directly - her ladyship's house is within a quarter of a mile of the post-office - I was not employed doing anything at the time the footman gave it to me - I supposed by the weight of the letter there was as much as two or three sovereigns in it - I am at times in the habit of examining my mistress's letters - I did not shake this letter about - I put it to the post office - I had no curiosity to know whether there were two or three sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the goodness to tell me which of these figures was on the letter when it came to your hands? A. I believe the first 1; the nearest to the figure 2, to the best of my knowledge - I cannot undertake to swear that - I cannot write very well myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the price of a single letter A. 8d.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. I understand you to say the I nearest the figure 2 (which has been put on at the postoffice,) is the one which was on it when it came into your hands? A. I think so; I cannot see any difference between the two figures.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the general post-office. On the 23rd of October, I was clerk of the money book - a letter put in at Brighton on the 22nd would reach the London post-office the next morning - when money letters arrive at the office they are entered in a book - I have that book here - I find on the 23rd of October, an entry of a money letter, in my own hand writing, "Brighton - Cowles, 1, Manchester-street" - we number each letter as we enter them in a book - I have entered this letter No, 7 - this letter bears the same address that I copied except being now No. 11 - it is the letter I copied into the book - I should think it was not No. 11 then - I do not think it probable, that I should put I so clearly as this is, for 11, but I cannot swear it - there was no other Brighton letters that morning, with the same address - when we enter an address of this kind we make out a receipt for the letter carrier to take to the person for whom the letter is addressed - those receipts are distributed through the office to the letter carriers - they are sorted as letters - when I copy the address of the letter in the money book, I keep the letter for a certain time, and when the letter carrier brings me a receipt agreeing with the address in my book, I give him the money letter - as soon as he gets the money letter from me, it is his duty to sign the book as an acknowledgment of having received it - it is the letter carrier's duty to come for the letter when he receives the receipt, and on shewing me the receipt I look to see if it corresponds with the letter I am to deliver up; I then give him the letter and he puts his signature in the book as having received it, and I return him back the receipt - he has to take it to the party to whom the letter is addressed, for them to sign as his own security, that they have received the letter - there is the signature to the address of the letter in this book - it is J. Borrett; I should think it is the prisoner's signature but I do not know his hand-writing - the signature under the address, signifies that he has received the money letter corresponding with that address.</p>

             cross-examined. Q. I suppose mistakes sometimes are made in the Post-office? A. Certainly - the postage of a letter sent from Brighton with three sovereigns inclosed is 2s. - we always enter money letters in the book - letters do go sometimes without being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280061"></xptr>entered, but three sovereigns would be too heavy to escape observation - when I entered the letter in the book, to the best of my belief I should say, that the figure one next to Manchester-street was on it - I cannot say that this is the one - I swear according to the best of my belief - I did not examine the letter particularly - I have not much time to examine them, only to know if there is any hard cash in them - I knew there was gold or silver in it - I should say it was three sovereigns - it was very heavy, but I could not tell whether it was two or three - there was some hard cash in the letter, if not it would have been written on it, that there was no cash in it - there was some thing hard - I could not see whether it was sovereigns or shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How many letters may you enter in the course of a morning? A. From fifty to a hundred - I have about an hour and a half to enter them in - hardly that sometimes - this was not a very heavy morning - there were seventy-five letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear that that morning, you did not enter number one, instead of number eleven? A. I cannot - I certainly might have made the mistake - I am not infallible - nobody checks the entry - it is examined with the receipt; it is a mere hurried entry of my own - a receipt is written out from the letter, not from the book, and given over to be sorted as letters - the letter carrier keeps the receipt - the letter carriers bring the receipts to me, and they are returned to him to get signed - the receipt is given over to the sorters, to sort as letters, and when the carrier receives the receipt, he brings it to me, and if it corresponds with the receipt he has the letter - the receipt does not come into my hands again - I cannot swear the receipt ever went into the prisoner's hands, as two or three hundred men are there - it is evident the carrier came and here is his receipt for the letter - we sometimes keep a money letter in our hands half an hour, and sometimes twenty minutes before we give it to the carrier - when all the letters are sorted, they come for the letters, and bring the receipts.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. When you parted with the receipt and letter, did you give it to the person who signed the book for it. A. I did, that I am sure of - I copied the entry in the book from the letter, and also the receipt from the letter - if I copied the letter wrong, I did so twice - it is not probable that I should copy it wrong twice; it is possible - my object is to copy them correctly - I have been clerk there about a year and a half - the paper does not indicate it to be a double letter - if a letter weighs a full ounce, the charge is 2s. 8d. - they charge according to the weight, at all events - a large sheet of paper would be equally the same, if it contained any inclosure, if it was weighed - this is charged as a treble letter - they don't weigh them except they exceed an ounce - they judge from the thickness, whether it contains one or two inclosures - this letter of itself would be charged single without the sovereigns - if the money were separate we should be able to know how many pieces of money were in it, but if together, we could not, because some people put so much wax - it would be hap hazard very often - three pieces of money in a letter would be liable to be charged 2s. - if the person at Brighton had told the post-master at Brighton that it contained three pieces of money he would charge 2s. - if it don't weigh an ounce they only charge 2s.</p>

               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. Don't they frequently make mistakes at the office in charging letters? A. Certainly.</p>

            . On the 22nd of October, I lived at No. 1, Manchester-Street, with my mother - I expected a remittance of three sovereigns from Lady Winterton at Brighton - I did not receive a letter at that time from her Ladyship.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. For what purpose did you expect the remittance? A. I don't know - it was not in payment of a debt from her to me - I suppose it belonged to me - if it had come to hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear if that money had come to your hands, that it would have belonged to you, and been your property? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Lady Winterton to send the money to you? A. It was on her brother's account; he lives in Regent's-park - if I had received the money, I should have done as I pleased with it; I should have kept it for my own use, to lay out as I pleased - it would have been a present from her brother to me - I did not receive the letter - I have never lived at No. 11, Manchester-street - I don't recollect whether I was at home on the 23rd, when this letter should have arrived; I cannot say whether I was or not; I might have been out - I have lived at No. 1, about four months, and was living there between the 22nd, and 24th of October; I am known there by the name of Louisa Cowles - I have never gone by any other name, nor in any other place; nor was my mother known by any other name.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If you had received the money, should you have to give an account of it to Lady Winterton's brother, or have spent it in what you pleased? A. Spent it in my own pleasure - I did not receive the letter at all.</p>

            ; she lived with me at No. 1, Manchester-street on the 22nd of October, I had lived there about four months in October; I never received any letter by the general-post at that place, directed either to myself or my daughter - I expected Lady Winterton would make a remittance to my daughter or myself; I never received that remittance - I was not at home on the 23rd; I saw the letter at the General Post-office - in consequence of not receiving a remittance, my daughter wrote to Lady Winterton in a few days, and an answer arrived to that letter by a friend - in consequence of what I heard, I spoke to the prisoner as the postman on the beat; I spoke to him on the 31st of October, in the evening when he was going to ring his bell; I asked him if he had ever had a letter addressed to Mrs. Cowles, No. 1, Manchester-street; he said, "No ma'am, I did not know a lady lived there by that name" - he did not say he had a letter directed to that name at No. 11, in that street; he said he would do all in his power to find it for me, and let me know the following morning - when I asked him about it, I said it was a double letter - I saw him the following morning when he was delivering his letters; I accosted him at the door, and said,"Postman, have you found my letter?" he was very much affected, and said, "I am very uneasy about your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280062"></xptr>letter, ma'am - I have signed for your letter, ma'am, and must have had it; and I have mislaid it, ma'am, or given it to a Mr. Hart by mistake"; Mr. Hart is a gentleman living in the same house with me, who was in the habit of having a great many letters every morning -(he had been out of town several days at Brighton) - I said, "Postman, has Mr. Hart got my letter then?" he said, "No, ma'am, he has not; but there is a possibility of such a thing by mistake; as he has so many; there is a possibility of it having been given to him by mistake" - I told him I had written to the General Post-office, which he regretted very much; he said so - I had written after I had seen him the night before - he requested I would have the goodness to write again to Mr. Critchett, and say there was no blame to be attached to him, and he would look for the letter; he said he would look among his papers at home, and look for the letter, and call on me again that evening, or the following morning; I fixed for him to call on the following morning - when he came his round with the letters, he said he was sorry, and would rather look up the money than lose his situation - I said it was a small amount, and I hoped it was not lost; I believe I said it was three sovereigns; we parted then - I waited till eleven o'clock on the following morning, and I heard that he called after I left home - I did not see him at my house that morning; I went to the General Post-office at eleven o'clock and stated my complaint to the solicitor, and the prisoner was brought before me; this was on Saturday, the 2nd of November - inquiry was made of him concerning the letter in my presence - and he pulled the letter out of his pocket instantly, and gave it to the solicitor, Mr. Peacock - he was examined then by Mr. Peacock; the examination was taken down in writing - Mr. Peacock asked him why he kept it so long; he said he had mislaid it; and did not know he had it till then - I believe that was all he said - he said he had offered it at No. 11, and it was refused there - he did not state what sort of a person he offered it to at that moment; I believe that is all that occurred before Mr. Peacock - I was present at Bow-street when Sarah Payne was there, and he said she was the person he had offered it to; I believe this was said in the public office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you lived at No. 1, Manchester-street? A. About four months; and have not received a single letter from the General Post-office while there, nor has my daughter either; I was quite a stranger to the postman, and he was quite a stranger to my name, and to my daughter's name too; he did not know such a person was living there; I was out the day the letter should have come, but when I came home, I inquired if a postman had brought a letter; I was out walking with my daughter that day - I cannot exactly say where we were walking; the letter might have been presented unknown to us - the money was intended for my daughter, but I am in the habit of receiving it for her, because she is under age - she is between fifteen and sixteen; all that is my daughter's I consider my own, because she is under age; if the £3 had come to her hand, she would have delivered it over to me instantly; I was at that time expecting a remittance from Lady Winterton - I did not know whether it would be addressed to my daughter or myself; if it had came to hand, my daughter would instantly have given it up to me; she acts as a child at present; I never lived in Lady Winterton's service, and am no relation to her; the £3 was to be appropriated to educate my daughter with, or do as I liked with; when I inquired of the postman about the letter, I asked if he had a letter directed to Mrs. Cowles, No. 1, Manchester-street; he said, "No, Ma'am; I did not know a lady lived there by that name; but I will do all in my power, Ma'am, to find it for you and let you know to-morrow morning;" he did not deny next morning that he had had the letter - he said he was very uneasy about my letter, that he had signed to it, and must have had it; Mr. Hart had been in the habit of meeting the postman in the street, and taking all the letters he had for himself at that address; Mr. Hart was at Brighton on the day the inquiry was made, and his letters were again directed to him at Brighton; Mr. Hart was in town on the 23rd of October, and would meet the postman that day and take his own letters; he said he had mislaid it or given it to Mr. Hart by mistake; I did not see the prisoner again, till I saw him at the General Post-office; when I first saw him, I accosted him in the street, he did not mention Mr. Hart's name the first time - the second time I saw him, I accosted him at the door, to know if he had found it; he said, "No, I am very uneasy about your letter, I have signed to your letter and must have had it, and have mislaid it or given it to Mr. Hart." I said to him, "Postman, has Mr. Hart got my letter." he said, "No Ma'am, he has not, but there was a possibility of such a thing, he has so many;" when I saw him at the Post-office, he did not hesitate about pulling the letter out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time of day were you at the Post-office? A. I was there about twelve o'clock, having left home about eleven o'clock; he had promised to call on me that morning, but did not do so.</p>
               <p>JAMES AUSTIN. I am an inspector of letter-carriers, at the General Post-office; about the 1st of November, I remember a complaint of a letter directed to Miss Louisa Cowles, not having arrived; I questioned the prisoner on the subject - I told him the letter was directed to Miss

            , and asked if he recollected having had such a letter; he said he had no recollection of it; I repeated the question again, and he gave me the same answer; I repeated the question again; I said, "It is stated that a letter was sent from Brighton, directed to Miss Louisa Cowles, containing three sovereigns;" he said a third time he did not recollect it; I said it was very odd he could not recollect, because the letter was said to contain three sovereigns; he said he had no recollection of it; I said "Come with me and go and see the money book;" he did so - and I opened the money book in his presence, and pointed out to him where the letter was entered, and the signature, and asked him, "Is this your signature?" he said, "Yes;" I then said to him, "Now don't you recollect?" he said, "No;" and we went back to the letter-carrier's office from which we came, and I said, "Now don't you recollect?" and he said, "No Sir, if I have had such a letter, I may by mistake have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280063"></xptr>delivered it to a Mr. Hart, with his letters;" he said Hart lived at No. 1, Manchester-street - here is written on the letter, "Not known at No. 11, Manchester-street;" to the best of my belief, this is the prisoner's hand-writing; he was desired to come back on the morning that I first questioned him; he did so, about the middle of the day - I desired him to attend at twelve o'clock the following day, which he did not do, neither was he there at one o'clock; and about twenty minutes after one o'clock, as he had not returned, I went in pursuit of him; he came that day I think, about two o'clock; he would be done delivering his letters, about half-past ten or eleven o'clock and was desired to attend at twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have been in the witness-box before? A. Yes; I was shown that hand-writing; it was merely to prove the prisoner's hand-writing to that book - to the best of my belief, it is his hand-writing - I have no doubt about the signature to the receipt, in the money-book - I have no doubt about this writing on the letter being his; he has written on the letter, "Not known at 11, Manchester-street, 
               <persName id="t18331128-83-person907">J. </persName>
            Borrett" - that is the usual mode in which letter-carriers endorse a letter, when the person cannot be found - if he had presented the letter at No. 11, Manchester-street, and it was refused there, and no such person was to be found, it would be his duty to hold it in his possession twenty-one days; that is before he sends it to the Dead Letter-office - I asked him about the letter three times before I showed him the book; his answer was, that he had no recollection of it - when I showed him the signature in the book, he did not hesitate, in the least, to say "This is my signature"- the prisoner was desired to come back on the same day as I first questioned him about the letter, and he came back that day, according to my orders, about the middle of the day - his delivery is about two miles and a half from the Post-office - I appointed for him to come the next day at twelve o'clock, and he came back about two o'clock; but I was not in the office at the time, as I had gone after him.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q. When a carrier gets a money-letter, he takes a receipt to the clerk of the money-book, and receives the letter, and enters his signature in the money-book as having received it? A. Yes; he should keep the receipt as a proof that he had delivered the letter - if he cannot find the person it is addressed to, the receipt and the letter should be together in his possession.</p>

            . I am inspector of letter-carriers at the Post-office. On Saturday, the 2nd of November, I expected the prisoner to come to me at the Post-office at 12 o'clock; he came about two o'clock - I and he then went to Mr. Peacock's office; I was expecting him for the purpose of going to Mr. Peacock's office - as we went along to the office he said, "Thank God, I have found the letter!" I said, "What letter?" he said, "The letter containing the sovereigns;" and when we got to Mr. Peacock's office, I mentioned to Mr. Peacock what he had told me, and he put his hand into his side-pocket, and took out the letter - I saw it - (looking at it) this is the letter - there was written on the face of it "Not known at No. 11, Manchester-street, 
               <persName id="t18331128-83-person909">J. </persName>
            Borrett," as it has now - he gave it to Mr. Peacock, who asked him where he found it; he said, in a little desk in his room - Mr. Peacock asked him where the receipt was, he said, he had looked for it, but could not find it anywhere.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you acquainted with the course of his duty, with respect to letters refused to be taken in? A. Yes; if he had taken the letter to No. 11, Manchester-street, and the answer "Not known" was given, it would be his duty to keep it in his possession three weeks; he was at liberty to keep the letter until the 13th - it may have happened to me to be two hours after my appointment at times.</p>
               <p>Mr. SHEPHERD. Q. Although it is the duty of a carrier to keep a letter twenty-one days, if he cannot find to keep a letter twenty-one days, if he cannot find the person - is it his duty to deny all knowledge of it, if he is asked about it? A. Certainly not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you saw the letter at the Post-office it was entire? A.

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You did not observe the letter particularly at the office? A. I did not; it was cut open with a knife being put in at the end, and carefully opened afterwards; it was opened at the top of the part which turns down at the seal - it is precisely now in the same state as when it was opened, except that there are no sovereigns in it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say No. 11, Manchester-street is the address on the letter; whether that address had been altered you cannot tell? A. I cannot - there were three sovereigns in it when it was opened; they were loose - the letter was opened on the table in the office - they were loose in the centre of the letter.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you saw it before, was there anything in it which indicted that it contained sovereigns? A.

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. From within a fortnight of your being at Bow-street, if such a thing happened to you, could you have forgotten it? A. I could not; I receive the letters, but there are no inmates in the house but my master and family, and two more servants.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever refuse any letter since you have been there? A. I have, since I have been to Bow-street - a letter came the other day; I turned a letter away one letter two months before I was at Bow-street, that was presented by the prisoner - I took it up to mistress - she said, it was not her's, and I took it back to him - that was not the letter now produced.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Postoffice. (looking at the letter) I cut this letter open at Bow-street, on Friday last; I cut it at the top, and found three sovereigns in it; it is in every respect as it was then - there were three sovereigns loose in it, without any silver paper or pin - before I cut it open, I examined it; I thought it had been previously opened - the letter had been actually torn open without breaking the seal, as letters usually are, with the exception of breaking the seal; that would not have disturbed the impression, if opened with care - if the sheet of paper was perfect when sent from Brighton, it is evident the letter must have been opened before I cut it open - I can hardly explain why, it is better seen than expressed (handing it to the Jury) this seal has been lifted up, and it has been fastened down with wax - if the sheet of paper was perfect before, it is impossible for the wax to have adhered to this fold - there is an opening underneath the seal; it appears to have been torn open - that hole penetrates to the outside of the fold, the outside of the inner half-sheet; not into it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The cutting or opening goes through more than one fold? A. Only through one thickness of the paper - this inner part has been torn since by accident by the Countess.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean this hole? A. Yes; that was torn by Lady Winterton - before that was no opening there; there was not the slightest opening from the outer envelope to the inner envelope - when the sovereigns were found in the letter they were perfectly enclosed in it; I could not have shaken them out; they could not have been shaken out and replaced - if the sheet of paper had been perfect when it was written, it must have been opened since - I have seen imperfect sheets of paper; it is possible imperfect paper might find its way to the Countess - the imperfection must have been where the outer half-sheet adheres to the inner one; I cannot swear this was not originally imperfect, nor undertake to swear that this was not done by putting on the seal in a hurry; if Lady Winterton had put the seal on in a hurry, and the wax had gone on both folds, the paper must have been discoloured, and that is not the case - the wax could not penetrate through paper without burning it; it could not burn without being discoloured; it is possible the wax might go through both sides of the paper without the flame, but the paper must have been discoloured by heat; it is not discoloured with the black sealing-wax - the injury does not extend through both folds of the paper - I will undertake to swear this injury was not produced by tearing open the letter as I opened it myself, and am prepared to swear it - I should say the sovereigns could be got out; if the paper was not injured previous to the sovereigns being enclosed the paper must have been opened and re-sealed - the letter has been opened in my opinion; consequently any thing could have been got out.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. A. In your opinion, the letter must have been opened before you opened it? A. Certainly; during thirteen years experience in the Post-office, I have had to inspect a great many letters which have been opened in a similar manner to this; that fact is well known to persons in confidential employments in the Post-office - it would not be made generally known in the office.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say under the seal there is a slit? A. Yes; when that slit was first made I could open a letter in precisely the same way as any other letter; by opening the letter I could take the whole contents out - to a common observer it is possible to cover over that part, so as to conceal that it had been opened - it would not be possible to draw out the ends of the letter; in that case the ends would have been rumpled; it would not be possible to draw out the ends of the letter, so as for the sovereigns to fall out, without the cut, not without there being any appearance of it, which there is not - the part under the seal exhibits marks as if the letter had been entirely opened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Look at a small spot of black sealing-wax near the seal; has that ever been broken at all? A. On my oath, I cannot say; there is no impression on it, nor is the paper torn - it is impossible to say whether that small spot of wax, near the seal, has ever been opened at all; I have no belief on the subject; it is so trifling - if I put another piece of wax in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280065"></xptr>the same manner, I could open it and close it again so that nobody could perceive it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Suppose there to have been a small spot of wax at the place which it has been opened at, is it perfectly easy to put on another small spot of black wax? A. It would be easy to be done, but I conceive a small knife would open that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Suppose that small piece of wax was broken, could it be replaced by another piece, so as to exhibit the same appearance as it does now? A. Yes; I should say it might.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMMERS to LADY WINTERTON. Q. I beg to call your attention to that small piece of black wax; does that appear to have been put on purposely, or dropped casually? A. I put it on purposely; it appears exactly in the same state as I put it on, except that it has been broken in Court now, except that breaking it adhered a little before - it does not appear to me to be the least altered - I will not swear that I did not open the seal of the letter after it had been sealed, and before it left my hands, because I was in such a great hurry, and it is a long time ago - I cannot swear I did not open it after it had been sealed, and re-seal it before it went to the office.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you first sealed the letter did you put the little bit of black wax on it for double security? A. Yes; I put it on after I put the large seal on - I have been considering and I really cannot swear I did not open the letter after I put on both pieces of wax - I was in a great hurry - I did not wish my own seal attached to it, and I considered what seal I should put on it - when I first wrote it I had just entered my house at Brighton; and left the room, as I wanted to give some orders and might have opened the letter again; on reflection and consideration, I think I added the little spot of black wax afterwards - there is no impression on the small piece of wax - I cannot say it might not have been opened and replaced by another piece of wax; but it being so small a quantity of wax, it don't appear to have been touched - if I opened the letter I did not take out the silver paper.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you put the small piece of wax on, did you put it underneath the paper or only on the top? A. I placed it in this way; I have opened a letter sealed with wax and resealed it again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave the case in the hands of my counsel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to the prosecutors. The prisoner came to look at some diamond pins—I spoke to him in French—I showed him some—he did not appear satisfied—he said he wanted to look at va<lb></lb>rious sizes—I took out a paper which contained a large quantity of dia<lb></lb>monds—he put his hands on them, which I requested him not to do—he then spoke about a pair of diamond ear-rings, which he said he would ex<lb></lb>change and he wanted to know what I would allow him for them—he said he would look in another day—I showed him the paper of diamonds which we had from Mr. Desvignes—I had not counted them, but I had every reason to believe the paper contained seventy-eight—I do not know of any having been sold—after he was gone, I examined it, and it con<lb></lb>tined seventy-seven—I did not go after him, but I sent a person to watch where he went to—I saw him in Queen-street, with Mr. Williams—I asked him, in the French language, where the diamond was that he had taken from our shop, and he said Mr. Williams had got it.</p>

On the 10th of May I was going from home - it was about half-past ten o'clock at night when I was going down Grosvenor-place; I met a girl there, and went home with her - she was a woman of the town; that woman is not here; I went home with her to a court in <placeName id="t18280529-54-crimeloc292">Pye-street, Westminster</placeName>

I said I was in no hurry, I would sit there a little; I went to the beside, and began to undo my shoes; she then got up, went out of the room, and said, "I will return in a few minutes; don't you go away:" then in came a man and woman - that was the prisoners Anderson and Young; I did not see the girl again till she was in custody - there was only one bed in the room; Young said, "What are you doing here?" I said I came there with a girl: she said, "You must go out of here; this room belongs to me - you must go and look for the girl:" I said I should not go out of the room - I had paid for the room; I refused to go out; the man and woman went out, and returned; while I was putting on my shoes Young returned into the room, and two men with her, Anderson and the other prisoner - she had both the male prisoner with her; they said, "Now we will see whether you will go out or not;" with that they seized hold of me, Anderson on my right, and Morris on my left - one held each arm, and they began to kick me; after they began kicking me, Anderson put his right hand into my right-hand breeches pocket, where the sovereign was, wrapped up in a bit of paper; while his hand was in my pocket, the woman struck me across the shoulder with a stick which I had brought into the room, and which belonged to an umbrella - the stick broke in two; the other man kicked me, and Anderson had his right hand in my breeches pocket - he turned my pocket inside out; they dragged me out into the court - my knee-cap was put out by their kicks, and my ribs were very much hurt; I called out Watch! and Murder! and received another kick on my left ribs - that was given to me by Morris.</p>
               <p>Q. Did anybody come to your assistance? A. Not at that time; after that Anderson said, "Let me kill the b-g-r out of the way;" Morris said, "We will serve him out;" I then received another kick in the ribs; they then dragged me out of the court into the street, and left me.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from the spot where you were in the street? A. It is not a very long court, about the length of this Court; Dempsey, (the watchman) and another man, came up to my assistance; I had then been laying in the street nearly a quarter of an hour - I could not get up in consequence of the injury I had received; they asked me what was the matter; I told them I had been ill-used: they asked me where the house was; I said if they would assist me I would take them to the room where it happened; they carried me there; when we got there the door was locked outside with a padlock; the watchman said he would break it open; I said, "Before you break it open I will give you a description of the room, so that you may know I tell you of the right room:" they broke the door open, and found nobody there; they then carried me to the watch-house, and from there to the Westminster Infirmary - I was bled there, examined, and dressed; all the beds in the Infirmary were occupied - there was no coach, and the men carried me home; my knee-pan was set.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see either of the prisoner? A. This happened on Saturday, and on the next Monday I was fetched to the office, and saw Anderson, Young, and the girl who had taken me there; the girl was discharged; I have found one handkerchief and one shoe - my shoe was left in the room; I did not see it found - it had come off with their pulling me about; I have found one handkerchief which was stolen from me - it was produced at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the girl whom you had met, and Anderson and Young, were you quite certain of their persons? A. I was, and spoke positively to them; I am quite certain I cannot be mistaken in their persons: the Magistrate asked if I should know the other man - Morris was fetched into the office, as he was waiting outside; he was fetched in, and I was certain of him, and spoke positively to him - I am quite certain of him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Pray, are you a married man? A. No; I met the girl at half-past ten o'clock - it commenced about eleven; I was not in anybody's employ at the time.</p>


               <p>Q. I do not mean were you going to work at the time, but had you got a master? A. Yes; I get 2s. 4d. a day; nobody here saw me with the sovereign, that I know of; I told the girl I had a sovereign, that I know of; I had taken a pint of beer at the White Horse public-house, Knightsbridge - this happened at Westminster; I went all the way, from home to Westminster - the woman met me in Grosvenor-place; I had drank nothing but the porter all day, except a pint of table-beer; I did not go into any public-house with the girl I met - she asked me to go, but I did not; that girl is here, but not in Court; I drank no gin with her - I did not taste gin that day; I would swear I drank no gin that night if I were on my death-bed; the stick had been taken out of an umbrella.</p>
               <p>Q. When these men came into the room, did you strike either of them with your stick, in the first instance? A. I did not; I had never seen Anderson before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the row over altogether? A. About twelve o'clock, or it might be a little after; I had been in the room about twenty minutes before the men came in; they might be in the room knocking and scuffling together a quarter of an hour - I will swear it was five minutes and more; they had their hats on. I received my wages on Saturday morning, from Mr. Howell, the watch-house-keeper of Mary-le-bone; he was my employer - he had given me a sovereign and 9s. 4d.; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in the habit of going to places with women who pick you up, when you are quite sober? A. No - I had never seen her before, to my knowledge; I did not tell her I had a sister who kept a house of accommodation, nor anything of the kind. I told her I had a sister who followed that business, the same as she was.</p>
               <p>Q. That kept a b-w-y-house? A. Yes, who had kept one; I have not seen her for a long time, and know nothing about her. I have been a porter at Mr. Vin's oil-shop, at Knightsbridge, for twelve months, and have worked in the Park twelve months; Howell paid me the money because I have been a watchman there this last two months; I was not on duty on this night, but I was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290048"></xptr>watchman; when I want to miss a night I have leave - I had been a watchman about three months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MORRIS. Q. Did I offer to meddle with you when I came into the room? A. Yes, when they both came in together.</p>
               <p>Q. You said I had another coat on - I have none but this? A. I observed his coat; he had a different loose coat on over the one he has now, a light coloured loose coat, and I could see the same coat he has on now under it, and the same waistcoat; I looked strictly at him when he came in, for I thought I was going to suffer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner YOUNG. Q. Did I not come into the room a second time, and take some in off the mantel-piece, which you had sent for? A. No; I had not sent for any gin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner YOUNG. You sent into us on Sunday morning, by this man (Morris), that if we would give you 1l. you would make it up. Witness. I never saw that man on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MORRIS. I am that man; he sent me into them. Witness. I sent no such message whatever; I did not know they were taken till the officer came up to my room to see how I was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you send any message by anybody to these people, that if they gave you 1l. you would not go on with the prosecution? A. No; Morris' brother came to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner YOUNG. Q. Can you swear you saw me the second time in the room? A. Yes; I am certain that she hit me with a stick.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prosecutor some time after twelve o'clock on Saturday night, in Old Pye-street; he was sitting down on the ground, with his legs stretched out: he was about ten yards from the corner of the court where the robbery happened; I had heard a faint call of Watch! before I saw him - when I came up he was not able to stand; he appeared in great pain, as if he had been hurt - he complained of his loins, and that he thought his thigh was broken; I asked him how it happened - he gave the same account he has now, and said he had lost a sovereign, the handkerchiefs, and one shoe, and if we would assist him to the room he would show us where it was; the witness, I, and another man carried him to the room - he was quite unable to walk; the room was padlocked outside; he said there were raddishes and onions on the table, and a pot of water at the foot of the bed; we broke the door open, and found the raddishes, onions, and water as he had described - his description was accurate.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see either of the prisoners? A. I came from the Infirmary, after seeing him bled; in an hour and three quarters or two hours; I called Phillips, and we went into the court, and found the door which we had broken open was bolted inside; I went for a light, leaving Phillips at the door; they opened the door when we knocked, and we found Morris and a woman, who stated that she was his wife - she answered the description of the woman the prosecutor had said took him there, and there was a boy in the room with them; Johnson saw the woman on Monday, and said she was the woman who took him there - they declared their innocence. About half an hour after I took Morris, I found Anderson and Young in the second house from where I found the others; we found Anderson and Young in bed in the parlour, and there was another woman also in the bed; Anderson had all his clothes on but his coat. The prosecutor saw them on Monday morning, before the Magistrate, and identified them directly he got into the lobby; Morris pleaded his innocence so strongly at the watch-house, when we took him there, and not having a white coat on, like a coachman, as Johnson had described him; I was rather doubtful of him - when he dressed himself he put on the same coat as he has now, but the side of his waistcoat was torn down; I never could find a white coat, and on that account the constable did not think right to detain him. When we gave evidence before the Magistrate he was about the office, and was fetched in; the prosecutor said, "That is the man, but he had a white upper coat on;" I was present when Phillips found a handkerchief on the bed where Anderson was laying; the prosecutor identified it, and said it had never been hemmed on one side, and I found it so; we found three or four handkerchiefs - Phillips kept them; Johnson claimed this one - it has not been hemmed on one side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you smell the prosecutor's breath that night? A. I did not exactly smell his breath - I was near enough to him to smell if he had been in liquor; he did not smell of liquor in the least; I never said so - I could not say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other watchman, in your presence, say so? A. Never, to my recollection; Phillips never was with the prosecutor; Wakefield helped to carry him - I do not recollect Anderson being searched - I did not search him - I think Phillips did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In your judgement had the prosecutor any appearance of being intoxicated? A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MORRIS. I asked the watchman what Hospital the man was at when I was discharged; I at first asked him to have something to drink; he said he did not mind; it was about four o'clock in the morning - we went and had half a pint of gin.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at No. 17, Old Pye-street, within one hundred and fifty yards of the court - I was returning home between eleven and twelve o'clock, and heard the cry of Murder! I went to the spot and found Johnson lying at the front door of a house in Pye-street - he appeared to be in pain, as if he was hurt; but not at all affected by liquor - I assisted in taking him to the door of a house where he directed us; the door was padlocked outside - I afterwards carried him to the watch-house; he was not able to walk.</p>
               <p>ANDERSON'S Defence. When I came down I met Morris, who said, "There is a man in my house who has bolted the door;" I said, "Let us go and see who it is;" we went and found the door bolted - I asked them to open it; no answer was given; I asked them to open the door - no answer was made; but a man was inside - I pushed against the door; it went open and I entered - the man immediately hit me over the head with a stick; I directly laid hold of the stick, and twisted it out of his hands - he kicked at me; I laid hold of him, and pulled him out - that is all I did to him.</p>
               <p>YOUNG'S Defence. I have nothing more to say; I never saw the man after I went out of the room the first time.</p>
               <p>MORRIS' Defence. When I came home from work I met Anderson, and said to him, "You can come to work with me in the morning if you like;" he said, he had been working at the Haymarket all day; I said,"There is a man in my room;" he said, "Let us go and see who it is;" he knocked at the door, no answer was given - he knocked again; and there was no answer - he pushed the door open and the man struck him with a stick; as to my laying hand on him or touching him I did not - I had no coat but this one on.</p>

            . I am not related to the prisoner Morris. I live at No. 53, Old Pye-street; at the time this matter happened I lived in the court in Old Pye-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you live in the room the officer found padlocked? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Johnson? are you the person who picked him up and asked him to come to your room? A. I never asked him, he asked me to take him there; I have come to speak the truth, and nothing but the truth - I am not Morris' wife; I was living with George Morris.</p>
               <p>Q. And took another man to the same room? A. Yes; he did not wish me to take him to an accommmodation house, as he said, his sister kept a house - I said, he could not stop; he said, he did not want to stop - I am an unfortunate girl - I left him in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What! leave a perfect stranger in the room? A. Yes; he was tipsy; I told him when I went in, that he could not stop but for a few minutes; he said, he did not want to stop - he gave me 2s.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not stay to see him leave the room? A. Because he would not go out; I asked him to go out - he said, he should not; he was very tipsy.</p>
               <p>Q. Attend to what you are saying; though you are in a state of prostitution, do not add perjury to prostitution - three witnesses who saw him, swear positively he was quite sober? A. I do not know whether he was shamming it, but he appeared to me to be tipsy.</p>
               <p>Q. Take care what you say, for you are liable to be committed for perjury; and to be transported if found guilty; now, tell me what you mean to say on this occasion - mind, your words will be taken down, and if you speak false, I shall certainly commit you for perjury? A. I met the prosecutor in Grosvenor-place, about half-past nine o'clock; he at first had a kind of white stick in his hand - he hit me with the stick; I turned to him and said, "What do you mean by hitting me?" he said,"Will you have any gin;" I was talking to a groom at the time - I turned round and asked, what he meant by hitting me; he said nothing; he said, "Will you have any gin?" I said, "I don't mind;" we went to the Feathers public-house, and had a quartern of gin; he drank two glasses, and I drank one, and as we came out, a man was standing with radishes and onions; a watchman was passing - he said, "I say, ask the watchman for a light;" the watchman said, "There is one, you may get it" - well, he got a light, and he bought some radishes and onions; he asked if I would take him home - I said, I could not take him home, but would take him to an accommodation house - he said he could not go to an accommodation house; for his sister kept an accommodation house.</p>
               <p>Q. And you took him to the room you and this man lived in? A. Yes; and he said he would give me 3s. to stop a few minutes - he gave me 2s. 4 1/2d., and when he gave me the 2s. he said he would stop all night. I said, "I told you, you could not stop;" he said, he would - I said, he could not; I left the room a short time - and while I was gone, the door was bolted; I came back and said, "Let me in;" he said, he would let nobody in - I said, "It is me;" he said, "You shall not come in" - I left the room, and did not go again till two o'clock; when I went at two o'clock, the man was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290050"></xptr>gone, and my bed was turned upside down, and the bed in the middle of the room - I did not speak to anybody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the three prisoners after you left the room? A. No; I did not tell them the man was there - I do not know how they found it out.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to stay away two hours? A. I was engaged with a gentleman at another house; a blue handkerchief was claimed on Mary Young's bed; and I saw that handkerchief on Young's bed on the Friday morning - I had only known Young two days.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that handkerchief; is that the handkerchief you mean to speak to? A. That is the handkerchief I saw Young have on Friday morning - I was not intimate with her; I did not examine the handkerchief - she was tossing it about in this way, and she tore it by hanging it on a nail; I cannot say who mended it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JOHNSON. On my oath I mended that handkerchief myself about a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Witness. I only know it by the handkerchief being sewn in the middle; that is all I know it by - it is not exactly in the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine it? A. No; I merely saw it in her hand - I swear to it only by its being torn in the middle; I do not know whether it was hemmed - but it was torn in the middle.</p>

            ; I have been their clerk twelve years. Mr. Robert Atcheson has kept cash there about two years; I sometimes pay the drafts which are presented. On the 2d of August the prisoner came to our house in Birchin-lane, Cornhill, and presented a check for 225l., I thought it was not Mr. Atcheson's hand-writing, and asked him where he got it; he said a gentleman came to Mr. Davison's, his master, gave him the check, and asked him to go to the banking-house and receive it for him; I showed it to Mr. Burgess, who stood by me, the prisoner was present; in consequence of what passed between us Mr. Burgess asked the prisoner to walk into the counting-house, which he did - I do not know what passed (looking at the check), This is the one presented. I have a perfect knowledge of Mr. Atcheson's hand-writing from seeing and paying his drafts, I have every means of judging, and believe it not to be his hand-writing, it does not resemble it much, the signature does not in the least resemble it; as soon as I saw it I thought it was a forgery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I do not know whether the prisoner has brought drafts to our house before; he presented it in the usual way, and showed no inclination to escape; we were about two minutes conversing about it. When asked concerning it, he immediately gave the account which I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. If he had been disposed to run out could he - A. There were several persons between him and the door; he might, perhaps, have escaped.</p>
               <p>MR. W M. HUGH BURGESS. I am one of the partners in the house, Robinson has given the names correct. I know Mr. Atcheson's hand-writing(looks at the check), I do not believe it to be his hand-writing; the prisoner was brought to me when it was presented, and said he had presented it for payment. I desired him to walk into the counting-house, told him it was a forgery, and asked him where he got it; he said he was standing at his master's door, when a person came up and said he owed his master some money, that he had a check on a banking-house in the city, and that he must get him to receive it for him. I do not immediately recollect the very words. I do not know whether he said the man said "You must go and receive the check for me, or you must go with me and receive it"-the impression upon my mind was that the man wanted him to receive it for him. I think I asked him where he was to meet the man again - He said "in some street by here;" I asked him what street? - after a great deal of hesitation and confusion, he said Nicholas-lane, he believed. I believe I asked him if he was to meet him at the Black Boy public-house - He said "Yes," I believe. I am not sure whether I asked him about the public-house, but I am sure he said Nicholas-lane. I told him I must send for a constable. When the constable came, I desired him to describe the dress of the man to him. I then desired the constable to go into Nicholas-lane, and see if he could find a person of that description. He came back in two or three minutes, saying he could not find any such person-the prisoner was present. Mr. Davison lives in Fleet-street, which is about a mile from my house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long did he stay in your house before the constable took him away - A. About ten minutes. I do not recollect whether he said any thing when the constable said he could not find the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was about one or two o'clock. The house was in full business. He would have found it difficult to escape.</p>

             SMITH. I am a constable. On the 2d of August I was sent for, and found the prisoner with Mr. Burgess, who stated the check to be a forgery. The prisoner said a man gave it to him. I asked him what sort of a man he was? He said he was about my height, but not so stout, and dressed in a black coat, blue Wellington pantaloons, and boots. I asked him where he left him? he said, it was at the bottom of the lane - I said, in Lombard-street? he said, No; at a public-house at the bottom of the lane; he said the man was to wait at the public-house for him - He said he did not know the sign. I asked him if it was the public-house just across the way, and told him that was the Black Boy; I told him it was crossing the lane at he bottom. He said that must be it by the description. I left him with Mr. Burgess, and went to the house to see if I could find a man answering that description - I could not. I looked both right and left about the street, in my way to the house, and in the tap-room and parlour in the house - I made no inquiry there. I saw the waiter; there was only one gentleman there. I got another officer to mind the prisoner, while I searched the house better; I returned with the prisoner to the public-house. He went willingly with me. I looked over, and saw the same persons as before - He said that was the house he meant. I asked the prisoner if he was sure the man had a black coat on? he said Yes. The gentleman that was there was dressed all in black; I thought I would bring him to the door to shew him to the prisoner, he had black pantaloons on; the prisoner said that was not him. I said I could wait no longer, and took him to the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Might there not have been a person whom you did not see - A. There might.</p>
               <p>Q.When you went out, might not a person see you come out - A. They could not know me. There might have been a person waiting, who might have got to the public-house as soon as I could.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Atcheson.(looking at the check). I do not believe it to be his handwriting. I have seen him write frequently - I have been thirteen years with him. I have not the least doubt that it is not his hand-writing. He is a solicitor, and employs Mr. Davison as his printer. I do not know whether Mr. Atcheson ever paid Mr. Davison a check.</p>

             M'GREGOR. I am errand-boy to Mr. Davison, printer, in Lombard-street, Whitefriars. The prisoner was employed to hang the sheets up to dry when they came out of the press, and to give out the gatherings. We had a work printing in the office, entitled the Picture of Paris. On the morning of the day that he was taken up he sent me to Charing-cross with a letter, it was directed to Mr. Dejean, 33, Charing-cross, I was to wait for an answer. When I got there, I was told that he did not reside there, but that he might be found in Thanet-place, Temple-bar. I took it there, and found Mr. Dejean; he gave me a message, that he could not give it to the prisoner unless he came himself, or sent a letter by the two-penny post, informing him which road he meant to take to go to Cambray-this was all he said to me. I returned, and delivered his message to the prisoner, who said, "Very well." I asked him if it was for himself (I meant the passport - I only guessed it by what Mr. Dejean said). The prisoner said it was for a soldier named Brown. I did not see the letter, though I carried it-(looks at it) - I cannot say whether this is it or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never saw the inside of the letter. The prisoner did not tell me to keep it a secret-he never shewed me the contents of it; the prisoner said it was for Brown.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DEJEAN. I am a foreigner, and contract to convey persons to France (looks at the letter). This was brought to me by the last witness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The direction is torn off - A. Yes, I put it in my pocket with other letters. I receive a great many letters - I know it to be the same by the contents; I tore the address off when I gave it to the boy. I believe the boy asked me for the letter he delivered to me in the name of Brown. I had no other of that name. I believe I asked him if it was the letter. I am certain it is the same by its contents-(read).</p>
               <p>SIR,</p>
               <p>As I understand you convey passengers who wish to visit France, and your charge is nine Napoleons; as business calls me there, I have no objection to agree to your proposition to carry me and a female, round by Calais to Cambray. Return an answer, with particulars, by the-bearer.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Davison, printer, Whitefriars. In August last the prisoner was in his employ-he keeps cash at Brooks's, in Chancery-lane, and at Messrs. Williams's and Co. - Mr. Atcheson is a customer of Mr. Davison's. He has paid us checks on his banker's. The prisoner has been employed to carry money to Messrs. Williams's, and to receive it also. From Mr. Atcheson's checks going through that house, the prisoner had the means of knowing that Messrs. Williams were also his banker's. The prisoner was taken up on the 2d of 
               <persName id="t18170917-55-person393">August. On</persName>
             that day I went to him in consequence of receiving a letter-he was then in Giltspur-street Compter. I asked him on what charge he was apprehended? he said, at dinner-time a man called at Mr. Davison's, and inquired if he was at home, saying he had 50l. to pay him, and asked who he was to leave it with? that he (the prisoner) told him there was no person to take it but himself, that the man said he must go with him into the city to get the check changed; that they went together-when they came near the banker's, the man gave the check into his hands, and while the man went to get a draught of porter, he was to get it cashed, and bring the man the money; and that on presenting it he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170018"></xptr>was told it was a forgery, in consequence of which he was apprehended. I asked him if he ever saw the man before? he said, No. His letter to me made the same statement. The Guide to Paris was printed at our office-the prisoner had an opportunity of seeing it, he would have to hang the sheets up to dry-there is a reference to Mr. Dejean, in the Haymarket. I do not know that the prisoner had any order from my master to go to Paris.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. This is the sixth edition of the Picture of Paris; many thousands persons might have the same knowledge of Mr. Dejean as the prisoner. It was not his employment to read. The prisoner had been in the office upwards of four years, andhad a very good character.</p>
               <p>ANN BIRCH. I keep the Black-Boy public-house, at the end of Nicholas-lane, Lombard-street. On the 2d of August, about ten o'clock in the morning, several persons were in my passage - I cannot say whether any man dressed in a black coat, Wellington pantaloons, and boots, came there or not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man dressed in a black coat and blue pantaloons called at my master's, saying he wanted to pay 50l., and asked who he was to pay it to; I told him there was nobody but myself - He asked me to give the difference of the check, saying it was a very good one - He wished it was for a 1000l. After some persuasion, I consented to go with him to receive it at the banker's. As we went along, he said I was to go and receive it, while he went and had a drop of beer - I was told it was a forgery.</p>

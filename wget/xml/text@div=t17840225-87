            , I live in Great Russell-street, Bloomsbury, on the 27th of January last, I lost this trunk with the contents of it, (the things which are mentioned in the indictment were it it), I had been to fetch them from Hammersmith, and was carrying them to my lodgings, I packed them that day, and brought them from Mr. Scott's at Hammersmith, they had been there a great while; I saw the trunk put into the coach; it was stolen out of the coach, I locked a trunk, and came in the Hammersmith coach, I stopped at the White Horse Cellar about six, and then I called a hackney coach, and brought them in the coach with me; I stopped at Mr. Sice's the boot-maker's, the corner of <placeName id="t17840225-87-crimeloc445">Air-street, Piccadilly</placeName>

               <p>Court. Was the other glass down on the opposite side of the coach? - I cannot say, the opposite door was open.</p>
               <p>Was the glass up or down? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You could see through the coach? - The prisoner had just gained himself upright when I saw him, just got the trunk on his right-shoulder.</p>
               <p>Was his back to you, or his face? - As he took it out of the coach door he immediately crossed over, I did not see his face, I just saw him sideways and his back, I run after him, and cried stop thief! and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250165"></xptr> immediately took down Eagle-street, several people came to my assistance near to him, he went a few yards, and was so closely pursued by a gentleman that he dropped the trunk, he ran away, and was brought back to me immediately: I saw his side-face, and I saw his person.</p>

               <p>Can you speak with certainty as to the prisoner, whether that is the man? - I am very sure of it, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>How long was it before he was taken after he ran away? - About three or four minutes, I did not see him taken.</p>
               <p>As soon as he was brought back to you, did it immediately strike you that he was the person? - It did.</p>
               <p>Was you quite clear of it then? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to the prisoner? - Nothing particular, only asking how he could do it, I did not wish to have any thing to do with him, but the people that were with me insisted on my taking him to a Justice, I have had the trunk in my possession ever since, the things are in it.</p>

I then looked before and behind me, and saw nobody, she ran towards the kennel, and I saw a man about the middle of the road with a trunk on his shoulder, the prisoner is the man, I am sure of it, when I first got sight of him; he was half way up Eagle-street, I followed him.</p>
               <p>Did you ever lose sight of him? - No, not I till laid hold of him, being pursued he threw the trunk down at the top of Eagle-street.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to the prisoner? - No, as the lady was in possession of the trunk, I followed him, he rather made a struggle, there were some people coming along, and he made up towards York-street, or St. James's Church, and as he turned, I caught hold of him by the right-breast, he asked me what I laid hold of him for, I kept him till he was committed.</p>

               <p>Court. Was that the trunk you put into your coach? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The trunk deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Court to Cumming. Did you take notice of the trunk? - Not then I did not.</p>
               <p>What passed after that? - She ordered me to let her out, and I took the little trunk and carried it into the shop, and she then ordered me to take a large trunk out of my boot and carry it in; this I left in the coach, when I was taking that other trunk out of the boot, I saw this prisoner, that very man, walk backwards and forwards by the side of my coach, and he went and stood about three or four yards behind the coach against the post, and when I was dragging this heavy trunk up the steps, I missed this man from the post, I had some suspicion, I took hold of the lady, says I, Madam, I should be much obliged to you to go and look at the coach; and as I came out, I heard a piece of work in the street, and the trunk was missing, I ran across Piccadilly down Eagle-street, and caught hold of the trunk, I am sure that is the trunk, I did not see it thrown down; I am sure the prisoner is the same man that was walking by my coach.</p>

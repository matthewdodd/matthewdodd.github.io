                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Reyman, and live in Bond-place, Bond-street, Commercial-road, in the parish of Lambeth. I am the prisoner's mother—he is a slater's labourer. On Sunday night, the 10th of January, I fastened the house up, at about half-past eight o'clock—I locked the door—there is no back door—the window was fastened with a catch, and a nail put into the frame to keep—it together—I went to bed about half-past eight o'clock—there was nobody in the house, but my husband and myself—we both went to bed at the same time—say husband came down first in the morning, but he is not here—he is very ill—he went down about half-past six o'clock, and called me down—I came down directly after him, and found the street door partly open—the lock was not forced—on examining I found the window had been broken—the middle pane of the upper frame had been put in, and three pieces in the bottom pane were broken out to admit an arm to unfasten the window—it was perfectly safe when I went to bed—the window was shut down again, and the door open—before I went to bed I had put my son Jeremiah's shirt, which I had washed for him, on the back of a chair, towards the fire to air it—he does not sleep in the house—it was gone, and the provisions which I had laid in for the week were gone—there were two ounces, of tea, one pound of sugar, very nearly one pound of butter the best part of a half-quartern loaf, and about one pound and a half or two pounds of pork—they were taken from the cupboard, which was not locked I am sure they were they when I went to bed—I do not know where the prisoner lodged—he was sometimes at home, and sometimes not—a</p>

               <p>pair of gloves belonging to his brothers, and a basket were also gone—I saw the prisoner at the station-house on Monday, the 11th of January, and identified the shirt he had on to be the shirt I had bung at the fire that night—I can swear to it—I had cut the collar down, and sewn a piece on it—I know it by my own work—it is my son Jeremiah's—the prisoner was in the habit of coming to my house, back wards and forwards, and we gave him shelter when he wanted it—he was not in service at this time—he was always at liberty to come to the house when he wished.</p>

One of the Boys swore, that hearing, a Noise, he went up with some others and heard Wilson say to the other Prisoner, Hold him, Sarah till I go and call my Husband. But the Prosecutor swore his Rings were put under his Door a little-time after and that he had them again. The Prisoners (especially Wilson) endeavour'd to represent it a Malicious Prosecution, the Effect of Mr. Adam's peevish morose Temper, and related some Circumstances to confirm it, which the Jury considering, <rs id="t17160517-25-verdict117" type="verdictDescription">

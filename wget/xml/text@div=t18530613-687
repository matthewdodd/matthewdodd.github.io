                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Heritage, who keeps a beer shop in Rope maker-street, Finsbury. On Tuesday, 24th March, about half past 2 or 20 minutes to 3 o'clock, I saw my husband's watch hanging in the bar parlour—shortly before I missed it a boy came in—I cannot swear that the prisoner is the lad, but I know him very well by his serving in his father's shop—the lad said he had dropped a penny down the area; I said, "If you come in the morning you shall have it;" he went outside, and presently three boys came in—I am not certain whether the first boy was one of them, or whether the prisoner was one of them—they asked for a pint of beer, I served them—they were outside the bar—they wanted some bread and cheese—I did not like their appearance, and would not give them any; upon which they went out and brought some in, and asked me to let them have a knife, which I did—I kept my eye on them, but my parlour is dark—I cannot swear to either of them, but have every reason to believe the prisoner is one of them—one of them asked me to let him go into the yard; I said he might go; when he got into the passage the dog interfered with him, and fearing the dog might do him an injury I went to him, leaving no one in the place; when I came back the other two boys we're gone; the boy who had gone to the yard went after them, and I then missed my watch—I went to the station directly—this is the watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), I saw it on the following Thursday at the pawnbroker's—the boy never went into the yard, the dog would not let him; he only went into the passage.</p>

I beard of this robbery, and on 8th June took the prisoner at his father's house, 67, Chiswell-street—I told him he was charged with being concerned, with two others, in stealing a watch from a beer shop—he made no answer—I asked him where he was the day before the Derby day, in the afternoon; he said he was out, but he did not know where he was—I took him to Mrs. Heritage, who said in his presence, "That is one of the boys"—he made no reply—I took him to the station, searched him, and found 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Case, a tailor, of Ropemaker-street, opposite Mr. Heritage's. On Tuesday, 24th May, I was at work there between half-past 2 and 8 o'clock, and saw three boys go in to Mr. Heritage's—the prisoner is one of them—I know him by sight well, and have no doubt of him—one came out first, and went down the street, and about two minutes afterwards the other two, of whom the prisoner was one, came out together—the prisoner was the last that came out—I had seen him before in the neighbourhood—Mrs. Heritage did not come out till after they had gone down the street—then she came over and told us—I did say before the Magistrate, "I cannot swear to the prisoner as one of the boys," but 1 have no doubt about it—I believe he is the boy.</p>

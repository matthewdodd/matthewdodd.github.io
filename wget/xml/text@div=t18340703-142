               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At what time did you see the sacks taken from the cart? A. About two o'clock - it was broad daylight - it was about three hundred yards from the station-house - Constable at once acknowledged that Crouch's van had been there - he never attempted to deny it - he said there was a hurry of business that day - I do not know that there was such a hurry of business that the men were not allowed to have their dinner - the men gave fair straight-forward answers.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you ascertained whether there was any hurry that day? A. There was - it was not a hurry that would excuse such an omission as that - Constable has been in my employ sixteen or eighteen years, and Parker six or seven - I have three or four other men regularly in my employ, and many others occasionally - Samuel Weller was a porter at my house that day, and I think he has been so since - he had been occasionally employed by my foreman before - he was taken as a witness before the Grand Jury, but it was for the purpose of the prisoners, I think - I did not inquire of him whether that was a hurried day or not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there not more corn like this in the kingdom? A. I dare say there is a good deal - this corn is particularly long - there may be thousands of quarters of this sort - it is Irish oats.</p>

(Read.) "The prisoner Hilton says, I received sacks for thirteen quarters of my master - I only received thirteen quarters of corn from Mr. Lucas's granary; but at Stones-end, a man whom I know by sight but not by name, asked me to carry two sacks of corn for him, and pitch them at the Elephant, which I did."</p>

               <p>COURT to Mr. LUCAS. Q. What kind of sacks had you in your granary? A. All sorts, almost - I think I might say no flour sacks of my own - I am not aware whether I had any with the name of "Allen" on them.</p>
               <p>COURT to J. V. CROUCH. Q. What kind of sacks did you give Hilton? A. Some of my own, and some with odd marks - I do not know whether I had any with the name of"Allen" on them - I have known Hilton for nearly four years, he had a very good character.</p>

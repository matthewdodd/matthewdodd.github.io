I was minding the house on the morning of the 5th of October; as Mrs. Holland was moving out, she left these fixtures for the landlord; the prisoner lodged in the house - he came down stairs and demanded the key of the street-door, which I gave to him, till he got his goods out - I went away to fetch a witness, to see that the stoves were there; returned in five minutes; he answered me out of the window, and said, he should let no one in - I went away - I am sure I left all the fixtures right; there were six stoves.</p>

            . I am the wile of Thomas Holland; the prisoner lodged with us at Bromley's-buildings; we occupied the house about four months and a fortnight, as quarterly tenants; it was a new house; we bought the stoves, and left them behind, in part payment to the landlord; I left Roberts and her cousin in care of the house, till they got their goods out; they were two friends, but did not lodge there - I left the fixtures there on the 5th and did not return till the Tuesday evening following; the stoves were then gone; I have since seen two, which I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your husband is here? A. Yes, I valued the fixtures at fifty shillings; we owed one quarter and a half's rent - 10l.; it was 30l. a year - we left a water-but, blinds, stoves, and other things, valued altogether at 5l. - the landlord agreed we should pay the rest as we could afterwards; we took some of of our things away by daylight, and some at night; we did not tell the landlord we were going to move; the prisoner lodged in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got any money since he was taken up? A. A young man named Chapman gave me five shillings for my trouble, for the two days which he took me about; he said, he did not wish me to go about with him, and lose my time - on a Monday morning I called to see his mother, whom I knew - she was there - he wanted me to see the prisoner's mother - I said I did not mind seeing her - he said, he wished me to satisfy her how the stoves went - I went with him, and he gave me five shillings, saying, he did not wish me to lose my time for nothing - on my oath, that is what he gave it me for; he wanted me to keep out of the way, but did not give me the five shillings for that - I never said, I would not prosecute the prisoner, as I thought my husband was more to blame than him - I did not promise him anything, it was too late - I wanted him to place the stoves back before I went to the officer; but then it was gone too far.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not move your goods, to keep the landlord out of the rent? A. I did it to prevent losing my goods, but not to cheat him - I was not able to pay him - the prisoner works at the shoe-business; he is married, and I believe he has two children.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is your landlord's name? A. Mr. Keaton - I have spoken to him since, about paying the rent; he sent to say we must pay for the stoves, as they were gone; Chapman said he knew the prisoner and his friends wanted me to see his mother, to ease her mind - I had then been before the Magistrate, and it was too late to settle it; he gave me the 5s. for my trouble in walking about to find the mother - the prisoner furnished his room himself, and had not moved his goods. I left this woman in the house till he could move them.</p>

            . I am a green-grocer. I went to the prisoner after a pair of boots; he asked me to assist in moving the stoves - I do not know what day it was; I took some chairs and crockery, and some stoves; I took two stoves, and saw him take two or three - there were six altogether; we took them to a broker's shop, not far off - I saw four taken to the broker's; the prisoner pulled them out of the fire-place with his hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go by accident to the house? A. Yes - there was no furniture left but what was in his room; I do not know what time of the day it was - he did not send for me: a person had sent for their boots - he did not tell me to keep it a secret. I was a stranger to him - he said he was left there without furniture, landlord or anything.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Great Carter-lane, Doctors' Commons. I have known the prisoner three years. On the 5th of October he brought me four stoves; he said he had taken a house, and should put in better ones, for they were worn out, and were of no use to him; I paid him 17s. for them - I had bought things of him before, and knew him to be honest. The prosecutor saw them at my door, and owned them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You gave 17s.? A. Yes, and sold two of them for 6s. each - I gave the full value.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Fixtures, left as such, are of more value then when moved? A. Certainly - there is the bricklayer's work; some charge 4s. or 5s. for setting a stove. They were large old-fashioned stoves - I would not set them in my own room.</p>

            . I was present when the prisoner demanded the key of my cousin, Roberts; he said he wanted it to get his goods out - the stoves were all safe then: he came to me before I left the house, and asked if I had seen Mr. or Mrs. Holland - I asked if he wanted to give them up the key; he said he would not give it up unless he was paid for it; he said if I saw Mr. or Mrs. Holland, would I ask them to give him a receipt for the stoves, for he wished to purchase them; this was on the Wednesday, nearly a week afterwards; I told him Holland had left them for the landlord.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then, a week afterwards, he was walking about publicly, and wishing to see Holland? - A. Yes; the stoves would nearly have discharged the debt; I do not know how much they owed; I am not related to Holland - he keeps one of my children. I was left a widow, with three. I did not know the stoves were taken when I saw the prisoner.</p>

            . I live in Radnor-street, St. Luke's. I have seen Mr. Holland outside the Court to-night. On Monday last I called at Mr. Adey's - a woman came in, whom I did not know before, and talked about the prisoner - that is the woman (pointing to the prosecutrix); she said she believed he was persuaded to it, and all she wanted was the stoves returned; I told her I did not know the case, for I was two hundred miles off at the time, but the family were respectable, and I made no doubt if he had taken them wrongfully they would be returned - she said that was all she wished, and that the witness had said a great deal more then was true; she then went with me to his mother, and wished to have a receipt on a stamp to show to her husband, or she should not feel satisfied; I said that was nothing but honour, and accordingly wrote it, but told her it was nought; she then said she could not walk about for nothing, and must have something for shoe-leather; I gave her 5s., and she went home satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give her the receipt for? A. For the stoves, which she said he had moved - I drew the receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not say the stoves had been moved against her will, and unknown to her? A. Yes; I gave her the 5s. for her trouble, but I considered it on the stoves; I dictated the receipt myself - I did not then know he was in custody. This is the receipt - (read.)</p>
               <p>This is to prove and satisfy Mr. Holland, that six stoves now removed from the house of the said Mr. Holland, at No. 4, Bromley's-buildings, by Charles Huslett, on the 5th of October, are to be replaced on his receiving his liberty, to which John Chapman, of Radnor-street, and his sister has placed the sum of 3l. 10s. to be paid.</p>

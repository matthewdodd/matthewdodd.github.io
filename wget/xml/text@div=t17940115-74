After a few minutes he said he did not want to behave ill to me, or any gentleman, he would take his wages; I paid him two pounds seven shillings and three-pence for the six weeks, presently afterwards he went; I did not know that he was gone for good till I made an enquiry of one of our men, when I was informed he had taken his clothes, as I was giving him instructions to take care that he left his clothes behind.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge, that he took them away? - Yes, as you shall find presently. This was on Monday, I thought that he would recollect himself on Tuesday and return them; on Wednesday morning I sent after him, he had lived two years at Islington, and I thought I should have scent of him in some of the public houses there, which I did; he came with our man to the house, the moment I saw him I said young man, you and I must go to Bow-street; he had no objection he said, and I gave him a little time to consider of it; I went into the counting house, and there I stopped for about five or ten minutes, when I came out I said to him, will you or will you not give up the clothes? he said he would not, he consented to give all up but one suit, the suit he went away in. We went to Bow-street together, I told my story, and he in justification of himself said that I gave him the clothes, this was a new livery made within four days after he came.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given him the clothes? - No, I had not, I was to give him eighteen guineas a year, and two suits of clothes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150201"></xptr>Q. This livery was you to give it wholly to him, or was he to wear them a whole year? - I made no other agreement than eighteen guineas a year and two suits of clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. And this suit was made four days after he came? - Not three days, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. What may the value of them be? - Somewhere about a pound, I dare say they are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp Mr. Kastevan, you told my lord that the agreement was eighteen guineas a year, and two suits of clothes.</p>

            Did it happen to you before this, for any servant to go away without a month's wages? - Never</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever require your livery of your servant when he went away? - This is the first servant I ever kept in livery.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever an idea when you gave him the livery, of taking it away from him? - Would I take and clothe a man that shall be only six weeks with me. I made no agreement about it.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to this man, did not this man himself require a month's wages? do you believe, on your oath, that if you had given him his month's wages, he would have taken his livery? - He said he would take his clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the man say, pay me my month's wages and I will give you your livery up? - He did not say so to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not he say that he would have his clothes after you refused the month's wages? did he say any thing about his livery till this? - I never conceived that he would have thought of taking them away.</p>

               <p>On the 6th of this month, the prisoner at the bar, went out about one o'clock (I live with Mr. Kastevan) and he came home rather intoxicated with liquor; my master found he was not able to do his work, came down into the shop, the prisoner soon followed him; my master paid him his wages, he mentioned something about a months wages; he went up stairs and he came down again, he went down stairs again to the kitchen to the family, and master went up stairs to dinner, we in the shop were shutting up the shop, and the prisoner went away with the things while we were shutting up the shop. On Wednesday morning following, I was sent by master to see if I could find him at Islington, I went to two public houses, at one of the houses I was informed that he was gone to Dr. Saunders's, at Highbury.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150202"></xptr>I went to Dr. Saunders's and did ask for him there, but I found him at a public house in Islington, he was sitting down drinking some purl with his friend, reading the news Paper; when he saw me he said, John are you come after me, I made him an answer that I was, he said he was looking in the paper to see if he could see any thing about any place; he asked me what my master said about him? I told him he was surprised he did not return the clothes home, he made an answer, that my master had given him the clothes, and that he would not return any of them except the great coat, which he would return if he would give him a month's wages; he took this hat off his head, and said he cannot hurt me, I know a young man that has done the like; he came along with me, coming home the other side of Sadler's Wells, he said if I had stopped a little longer, he had been off in the country, and I should not have seen any more of him; from thence I took him to my master's shop, and there were a few words passed between him and master's brother, but I was not present at the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. knap. When you saw him go out you was shutting up the shop? - Yes, and during the time master was at dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the prisoner then talking about a month's wages? - He did not say any thing about a month's wages, he said he would take the clothes away unless master would pay him a month's wages.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had an idea that he was entitled to these clothes? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say, when his master had refused to pay him his month's wages. that he would then take his clothes? - He said he would then take his clothes if in case he did not have the month's wages.</p>

               <p>Q. From that you understood that he meant it was the custom of servants so to do? - I took it in that light.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp addressed the court, that under the circumstances of this case, there was no case to go to a jury. But the court thought otherwise. And the prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

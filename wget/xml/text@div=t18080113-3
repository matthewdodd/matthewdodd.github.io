            . I went with the last witness' husband on the 18th of December in the evening, to the sign of the Angel, opposite Whitechapel church; there we found Mrs. Ward and the prisoner in a strong dispute; Mrs. Ward told me that the gown that the prisoner had got on was her gown. I took her in custody and put her in the watchhouse; I insisted of her taking the gown off and putting her own gown on.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she her own gown about her at that time. - A. No, she sent for it.</p>

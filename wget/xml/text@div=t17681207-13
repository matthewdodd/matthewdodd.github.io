            . I keep a cloaths-shop in Field-Lane. The prisoner came to my shop with two shirts the last day of October, between eight and nine in the morning; I bought them of her for 3 s 6 d. As soon as I had bought them, she said she had more linen, which she had contracted for with a carpenter in Salisbury-Court, but had not money to pay for them all at once. She asked me if I should be at home, she would soon be with me with more. She went away, and, in a little better than a quarter of an hour, she came again with four more; I bid her 9 s. for them; she took them away, and in about ten minutes she brought them again, and said, she had been at three shops, and had 9 s. bid at each, but as I was the first bidder, I should have them; I looked at them, and said, you say you bought them of a carpenter in Salisbury-Court, Fleet-Street; before I pay for them, I'll send my man with you to see that you had them there. I delivered half a guinea to my man to pay for them, if he found it so, and they went away together. My man came back and told me, she would go no farther after she got out of the lane. I saw no more of her till the Wednesday morning. She then brought two or three cloaths-people, who said they saw her buy them, and claimed the linen. I took her to Justice Girdler, who committed her to New Prison. I then advertised the shirts, and

               <p>I was coming home by Exeter-Change; I met a man like a coachman, he asked me if I bought cloaths? I said yes. He said he had some old shirts to sell, he asked 15 s. 6 d. for six; we agreed for half a guinea in gold, and eighteen-pence in silver. I came to Mr. Chapelow and sold him two; I know no more of their being than any one in court. I never said such a word as Mr. Chapelow says. I have taken a great many pounds of him.</p>
               <p>Chapelow. I never dealt with the prisoner in my life before, to my knowledge.</p>

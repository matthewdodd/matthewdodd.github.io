On the 11th of March, in the morning, I went out to take a walk, I came back about half after eight in the morning, the men were gone from their work. When I came up to the street door the prisoner was coming out of the passage with a shovel, he had it by his side; he had removed it about two yards from where it hung up; when he saw me he jumped back and threw the shovel down against the partition; he advanced to the door and said can you give me a job; I said you rascal, I will thank you not to steal my shovels; I gave him a kick on the backside, and told him to go about his business; he called me very shameful names; then I said I will charge a constable with you. This is the shovel he had by his side; it is mine.</p>
               <p>- BRUMMIS. I saw this man come in very softly in the passage of my uncle's house; he took down the shovel and went towards the door with it; my uncle came and met him with it; when he saw my uncle he threw it against the partition; my uncle sent for a constable.</p>

I went up to Mr. Fowler's steps, I knocked at the wainscot, nobody answered me; I returned back and clapped my hand upon a place, but as to touching any thing else I never did. When I came to the last step I met Mr. Fowler; I asked him for a job; directly, he said you villain, you are come a thieving; he gave me a kick; I said what do you kick me for; he sent for a constable; I was taken to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120067"></xptr>the watchhouse.</p>

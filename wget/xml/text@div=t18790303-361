                  </hi>. I am a beershop keeper, of 68, Vauxhall Walk—at the end of October last I received some instructions from Mr. Arthur relating to the Brewers' Public-house, 10, Gibbon Street, Deptford, which was then empty—I went into occupation of the premises early in November—the house was then fit to carry on business in; the windows were in, the sign-boards up, the bar fittings in order, and the metal top in its place—the first floor above the bar was supported by an iron standard; that was in its place, and there was a panel cabinet separating the bar parlour from the bar—the gas-fittings were in their places—I put Chapman and Wood in possession—on 20th November I received a telegram, went to the premises, and saw my two men outside and a van there loaded with the fixtures and fittings from the inside, with a carman in charge of it whose name I do not know—I examined the premises when the van left, and found everything was removed; the house was completely gutted—this photograph (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) represents the premises as they are now—everything was pulled to pieces recklessly, torn out; the gas-fittings were torn away, the partition between the bar-parlour and the bar torn down, and the sign-boards taken away—I then followed the van, stopped the carman, and said, "Where are you going to take the things?"—he said, "I am going to take them to Mr. Harris's house"—I had a policeman with me, who took the carman's name and address—I never had any conversation with Harris in reference to the destruction</p>

               <p>of the premises, but I saw him outside at the beginning of November—I said, "The house is shut up "—he said, "Yes, I want to let it"—I said, "Do you?"—he said, "Yes, I can let this house"—I said, "I am looking after a house"—he said, "I could let you in for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—we went and had some drink together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I took possession for Mr. Arthur, of the Phœnix Brewery—I cannot recollect the date—no one was in the house; I pushed the front door with my hand, and it opened—there seemed to be a strut behind it, but not properly put up—that was on Friday, and I remained till Saturday at dinner-time, and left Chapman and Wood in possession, and I found them there when I went again on, I think, the following Monday—I went again when I received the telegram; I could not get in as there were other men inside; I got more men, and retook possession—I remember going to the Centurion Public-house, High Street, Deptford—I did not get any men there, nor did I go in and say that I wanted a dozen men—I do not know Charles Buck; I did not ask him if he wanted to earn 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not engage some men to attend at 8.30 next morning for the purpose of breaking into the Two Brewers—I went there about 7 next morning—I did not borrow a hammer from a wood-yard—I went over the back premises; I was the captain, the agent, the army followed me—the back door was not broken open; the glass was broken, but I did not break-it, nor did any of the invading forces—I leaned in through the broken door and unbolted it, and the army followed—I opened the front door, but a lot of people did not come in—the men did not proceed under my orders to pull down the bar, nor did they do so—they did not take the sashes out—there was not a van outside—Harris was not there—the premises were in a perfect state when I entered, and when I left they were in the same state as when I turned Harris's man out—I mean that when I turned this army in no damage was done; not one single article was displaced—I do not know Buck by name, I may know him by sight—I did not give anybody 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor was any money given by my direction; I engaged the men at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day on the day I took possession to stop and hold possession of the premises; I do not know the date; I put them in for three days—I did not try and pull the shutters down in the prisoner's presence; I put my hand in the door and had it smashed, and a man took me in charge after tearing all my clothes off my back—I was not the worse for drink, but I was excited, having had my hand smashed—I had had three glasses of whisky with Harris, three threes; if Loveday says that I was the worse for drink it is not true—the inspector would not take the charge—I hit at Harris, but it did not hit him—Loveday did not interfere and prevent my repeating it—Harris went to the station with me and wanted to charge me, but the inspector told him it must be done by summons—I got possession of the premises; I did not take notice of the dates, as I never thought it would come to this, knowing that the house belonged to the Brewery.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187903030044"></xptr>
               <p>an hour—the door was shut, and I did not see what was being done in the house—the van drew up in the same position, and Harris said "Pull the things down"—one of the men came and said "There is some lead piping, Mr. Harris; what are we to do with it?"—he said "Sell it, and get your<lb></lb>selves some beer," and they took him at his word—the second van-load was half-gallon cans and pints and quarts and signboards—a man was asleep at the back of it—Mr. Harris was with the van when it drove away—I had seen the premises before the damage was done, and when I went in on the 21st the iron stancheon had been taken away, and I fell down the hole—the partition was taken away and the gas-fittings were removed; also the signboards bar the one over the middle of the window—the windows were all taken out bar one, the front one.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am quite sure the deed was executed before I received possession from Sparks—Mr. Power had been in possession before that, and I let him in, as I let Mr. Burchell in previously. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHITTOCH</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was here called upon his subpoena to produce tlie deed from himself to tfie Defendant, and declined to do so; but a draft of it was produced by a solicitor, showing that it was for 41 years from Midsummer, 1875.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I purchased the interest of Mr. Burchell and Sparks for 5,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went round the premises first—they were in a sound and proper condition for carrying on business—I have seen them since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not aware at the time I purchased them that there had been any forfeiture by reason oi breach of covenant—I was not aware that there had been a breach of the covenant to insure the premises in the Westminster Fire Office—I was given to understand that insurances were existing—the whole of the law matters are done by Messrs. Burchell—I have not personally insured the premises since September—if it was done, it was done by my solicitor—I was not aware that the previous quarter's rent was unpaid—I was aware that the Michaelmas rent was unpaid, and it has never been paid, because the premises were wrecked—I was not aware that at the time of my purchase the licences had lapsed—they were in existence—they were, I believe, in the name of Samuel Sparks—I do not know whether they were then transferred to the defendant—Mr. Tustin manages the leases—I had not read the covenants—Mr. Fustin on my behalf left Mr. Power in possession after 12th October, and no one else representing my interest between then and 7th November—I should think Samuel Sparks was his brother's <hi rend="italic">alter ego</hi>, or right-hand or deputy—I heard that Harris had taken</p>

               <p>some men and turned out our Mr. Power, and given Sparks some money—I have not seen our Mr. Power here to-day or Samuel Sparks—the information I had was that Sparks and Harris were conspiring together to get this pro<lb></lb>perty under a clause in the lease by hook or by crook—I never saw Samuel Sparks writing, and cannot say whether this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his signature, nor do I know the other writing here—Powell was paid by us up to 7th or 14th November.</p>

                  </hi>. I am parish constable at St. Nicholas and St. Paul, Deptford—on 28th October the defendant and Samuel Sparks came to my house, and wished me to go and make the official change at the Two Brewers, and witness the signatures—it is part of my duty to attend to these transfers—I went to the Two Brewers—it was closed—no business was being transacted—we were not able to complete the transfer that day, but I went on a subse<lb></lb>quent occasion with Harris and Sparks—Harris gave me 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I paid 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Sparks and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Power—I cannot tell you what for—I saw no documents; there was so much talking going on, I could not enter into it—I was present when Harris took possession—I attended the licensing session on November 12th, and a transfer of the licence was made from Sparks to Harris—Sparks did not attend; Harris was there—I did not see Harris's name painted up afterwards, but I saw him at the premises—I also saw the people who were put in to repair the premises—I knew one of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, and the freeholder of the Two Brewers, and the lessor of the lease of 14th August, 1875, to Mr. Harris—the fixtures and fittings were mine—I always had trouble to get the rent, and I always distrained, except for the first quarter—on 26th October I had again signed a warrant to levy a distress for the rent due at Michaelmas, and was about to put in a man named Booker, who had been put in before, but Harris paid the rent and the execution of the warrant was avoided—subse<lb></lb>quently to that Harris put some men in to do some repairs to the place—I was aware of the transfer from Sparks to Harris after it was done, and was aware of Harris's intention to carry on the business—I am agent to the Westminster Fire Office, which is the one designated in the lease; there was a default, and the policy would have lapsed if I had not secured it—the payment due on 29th September remained unpaid till 21st November, and I paid it within the time necessary to keep it alive, within 15 days after the 29th—I paid it on account of the lessee—I did not know then who had the interest in the premises—I had not been requested to do it; I did it simply to save the policy, not to save a forfeiture of the lease, in whose ever hands it might be—I paid it in my own interest; if I had not done it I should have lost it—I saw on the evening of November 20th that the fixtures and fittings were taken down and removed; they were and are my property—I have adopted a civil remedy for the loss I have sustained, and that is now pending—I have also brought an action of adjustment for breaches of covenant; one breach of covenant is 21 days having elapsed without payment of the rent, and another is the non-payment of the policy—I have never countenanced or sanctioned the present proceedings—I am aware that there had been a quarrel about this property between the defendant and the prosecutor's representatives.</p>

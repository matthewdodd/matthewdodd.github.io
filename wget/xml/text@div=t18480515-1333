                  </hi> I am in the service of Mr. Putley, a silversmith, at Newington-causeway. On 5th Feb. the prisoner came with this watch, and motioned with his hands that it would not go—he left it, and said he must have it by twelve o'clock—he came about halt-past eleven or twelve, but did not have it then—about half-past one he came again, and paid half-a-crown for it—that was not enough, and he promised to come again on the Saturday—he came again on the Monday with another man, and paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have not doubt he is the person.</p>

                  </hi> On Sunday, 6th Feb., I saw the prisoner—he came past me and said something about a watch—I thought by his motions that it was in pawn—I went with him on Monday to Mr. Putley's, and paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for cleaning the watch, and afterwards pawned it for him, in Bermondsey-street, for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he said he wanted to go to Liverpool to get his pay—this is the watch—he received the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I kept the ticket for the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I had advanced him.</p>

               <p>Q. What time in the morning were you alarmed, and by whom - A. About half after five, by the watchman. I got up instantly; on my coming down stairs, I found the street door open, and my servants in the shop; it was quite dark at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was up last the night before - A. That I can hardly tell; I was not; but I rather think the servants were. I went to bed myself at about half past ten; all was then safe, I am convinced. The door was fast before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you discover by what means the people got in - A. At the top of the house, by taking a pane of glass out of the lead, and then undoing the flap.</p>
               <p>Q. How could they get at the top of your house - A. From an adjoining empty house.</p>
               <p>Q. What is this flap at the top of hour house - A. It is a wooden shutter, with a flap to it; it is secured by this hook, and a pane of glass had been taken out, and the hook removed, and then the flap could be opened. The only way I can suppose is, that they must have got over both houses to get into the gutter at the side of my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you found the front door open - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks of violence - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the key left inside the door usually - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know, could persons who had entered at the top of the house, get out of the street door by means of the key being on the inside - A. Yes. I missed two spoons, from the kitchen, a silver sauce ladle, and other articles of plate; but none of them have been found at all. A Bow-street officer came to us, and told us he had apprehended a man with part of the property. Out of the shop, I missed several shawls, six scarfs, seven gowns, twelve yards of sarsnet, five yards of crape, three silk stockings,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250018"></xptr>a black cloak, fourteen silk handkerchiefs, and a yard of green baize. We have got the things that were taken from the shop. but the silver things are not come-at-able.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of your family sleep in the place where the persons broke in - A. I have three maids, who slept in the adjoining room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The flap leads to the leads on the top of the house. I know my servants had not been using the leads to dry clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your man used these leads to dry the things in your business - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here - A. No; I could not bring him; he is Clarke's father. I took Clarke in because his father had a bad leg, and discharged him about two months ago, for stealing a shawl.</p>
               <p>THOMAS EDWARDS. I am a watchman; Brook-street is in my beat. I was crying half past five on the morning of the 14th of this month, in Brook-street; a man going past asked me what the time was? I told him. I just turned round, and at the other end of the street, I saw a man cross the road with a bundle under his arm. Knowing he had not passed me in the street, I guissed all could not be right, and ran after him; coming up to Mr. March's door, I perceived it was open: I saw two bundles laying on a table, and that made me suspect there was some one in the house. I sprang my rattle, and called for assistance; when they came up, we went into the house. I found the drawers had been opened, and a quantity of things taken out. We examined the lower part of the house, with the shop and parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. March with you at this time - A. No. I rang the bell, to alarm Mr. March and the family; there were two other watchmen with me at this time. I asked the servant girl if she had locked the door when she went to bed.</p>
               <p>COURT. But we can't hear what she said.</p>
               <p>Witness. I then requested Mr. March to go along with me to the upper part of the house. When we got to the lap of the house, there is a kind of a workshop, with a ladder going up to this flap, that has been described. On the top of the leads, I found an old knife. The night before the robbery was a wet night; so that the knife must have been brought there on the night of the robbery, for it was quite bright.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the morning of the 14th, I was in Catherine-street, in the Strand, at about seven o'clock. I know the prisoner Thompson well. I perceived the prisoner Clarke, in company with another man, who is not in custody; the other man was carrying this bundle; I saw them talking together, and evidently in company with each other; I was close by Eagle-court. I went up to them, and asked them if that was Eagle-court; they told me yes. I went up it a little way, and then returned, and watched them; they were then joined by Thompson. The man who is not in custody, then gave the bundle to Thompson; then they all three went into Eagle-court. I laid hold of Thompson; he then had the bundle, and the others ran away, On searching him, I found a pair of black silk stockings, and a letter directed to</p>
               <p>"Mr. Marsh, silk dyer;" these were in his great coat pocket. After I had locked Thompson up, I went with Ruthwin, and we found out where Mr. Marsh lived, and told him what I have now told. In consequence of information I received there, I went in company with Ruthwin, to Somers Town, and apprehended Clarke in his lodgings. I saw Ruthwin take some silk fringe from a cupboard.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in company with Mackay, when we apprehended Clarke; he had a lodging at Somers Town; we apprehended him between eight and nine o'clock; we met him just coming out; we desired him to torn back, and he unlocked the door, and let us in; Mackay put the handcuffs on immediately. In one corner I found a pair of boots pulled off quite wet, and he said he had not been out at all. I also found this silk fringe in a cupboard. I took two handkerchiefs out of his hat; he asked me for one of them, as he said, to hide the handcuffs; I told him if he was not ashamed to break into a man's house, he need not be ashamed of the consequences.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marsh. That is my silk frings. One of my servants is here now, who can swear to all the articles.</p>

I, and two other servants, were up last in the house; I am sure the street door was fast; we all went to bed together; we did not get up the next morning until the alarm was given. The female servants used not to dry clothes out on these leads. I don't think a female could open the flap.

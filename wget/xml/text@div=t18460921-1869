                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Newton, a butcher, at Hackney. On the 5th of Sept., my little boy took out a goat's-chain to play with—I heard that there had been a dispute between him and the prisoner about the chain—I went to the prisoner's house—he was not at home—when he came home I asked him for the chain—he said I should not have it—he should not give it up till my little boy had given him a book which belonged to his boy—I said I had not seen a book, but if there was such a thing I would give it up when I got home—I have never seen it—he told me to get out of his house—I was standing in the passage of the house at the front door—he only occupied two rooms—other persons have a right <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the passage as well as he—I was not in his room—I said I should not go till I got the chain—he laid hold of my arms, put his nails into my arms, and pushed me against the wall twice—he then threw his arms round my neck, threw me against the wainscot, and then kicked me in my back while I was on the floor—Mr. Hockley's sisters were there—some one rose me up by my gown, and some one said, "Get up you b—, you are not hurt"—Hockley put his arms round me, and took me to my door—two females put me out of the door, not the prisoner—I was thrown down a second time by the prisoner, and kicked in the body, but I do not know who by—I was senseless—I was carried home, and a doctor was sent for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am twelve years old, and live with my mother. I went with her to the prisoner's house about the chain—I stood outside while my mother went in—the door was open—I saw the prisoner take hold of my mother's arms, knock her against the wall, put his hand round her neck, throw her down, and kick her in the body—the door was then shut by the prisoner—a man brought ray mother to the door, and opened it—I went for a policeman, who came and took the prisoner into custody—a man and woman took my mother home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hatter, and live in Victoria-street, Hoxton. On the 5th of Sept., about ten minutes to one o'clock, I was coming out of my house, which is in the same street as the prisoner lives—I saw several people, and heard a cry of "Murder!" I went, and saw Mrs. Newton standing against the wainscot in the prisoner's passage, crying and moaning, as if she was seriously hurt—I had scarcely been there a minute when the prisoner came, took her by both arms, and gave her a severe shaking—he threw her down and kicked her several times in the lower part of her stomach—that was the second attack—I did not see the first—a man was heard coming down stairs, and the prisoner then caught hold trf her, pushed her out into the street, took her about two or three houses off, and left her there—I saw the prisoner talking to two or three persons afterwards—he smiled, and seemed to make a deal of fun about</p>

               <p>it—a man and woman assisted Mrs. Newton—she was not able to walk, and a chair was brought—she placed both her hands as if she was injured in the lower part of her person—I should say she was very much hurt indeed—I saw more than three or four kicks—I did not know the prisoner or prosecutrix before.</p>

I went to Victoria-street, and saw Mrs. Newton—she was very faint, and in great pain—I took the prisoner into custody, and told him the charge—he said Mrs. Newton came to his house about a chain, and refused to go out, that he took her by both arms and put her out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Hackney. On the 5th of Sept., by Sergeant Hockley's request, I went to Mrs. Newton—she wasjnst recovering from syncope, from excess of pain—on examination, I found on the left side of the abdomen great tumefaction—her arms appeared as if a person had nipped them with his nails—it is most likely kicks or blows produced the wounds.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in West-street, Somers-town. The prisoner was in my service upwards of two years, and I always had a good opinion of him—in consequence of what my son told me I was induced to watch him on Saturday evening, the 8th of January, when the foreman called him to be paid—he had his hat on—he threw it into the back part of the shop, where he was accustomed to sit at his work, and went up stairs—I followed him up, and called the young man into the shop to bring his hat up stairs—(I had previously seen the contents of the hat)—on being brought up, it contained fourteen pieces of leather, which he had stolen, and set apart in the shop, covered over with a bit of rag to conceal them—I said, "Saunders, what do you think of this?"—he said he was sorry—I told him' if he would confess whether he had stolen any thing previous, how he had disposed of it, and to whom, I would deal mildly with him, I did not wish to prosecute him—we have many such pieces of leather as these on our premises.</p>

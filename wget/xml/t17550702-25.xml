               <p>Cheively. No, but I saw Mr. Vale's servant come by my door, and hip to the prisoner, who was going from his shop. She stopped, he said now madam I have catched you; he brought her back to his master's door, I followed him, he desired to know what she had got under her apron; she unturned it from over her arm, there I saw these three pieces of lace, and took them; she seemed to be in a great confusion, and denied the taking the lace, and said; a woman had thrown it into her lap. I put my seal upon them, after I had put them in a paper, and they have not been opened till I came into court.</p>

I am journeyman to the prosecutor; the prisoner came to our shop to buy some lace; I shewed her some, I saw her take two of the pieces, and suffered her to go out of the shop about ten yards; then called her back, and we found three pieces upon her, all my master's property. She was taken before the justice, there she told me a woman had thrown it into her apron.</p>

            . I live in Hornsey-road. On the 4th of November, about half-past four o'clock, I was passing by the Maiden-head, public-house, Battle-bridge, and saw a poney in a cart, which the prisoner was driving - another person was with him, but the prisoner had the reins. A young man was asking if he would sell the poney; the prisoner said "Yes, for 3 l.;" the man offered 2 l. which they refused. I went up to the prisoner, and asked what he wanted for it - he said 3 l. - I bid him 2 l. 10 s.; he hesitated, and then said, I should have it. I paid him the money - he went into the public-house, and brought out half a pint of liquor. I am positive of his person - they put the harness in the cart, and dragged it towards Tottenham-court-road. I took the poney home, and in about four days, lent it to Day, as his own horse was ill - he was riding it, and it was claimed. I went to Smithfield, and delivered it to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. I work as a bricklayer, and also as a labourer. I do not call myself a horse-dealer. I have bought four poneys within the last two years. I was in 
               <persName id="t18241202-93-person602">Mr. Stansfield</persName>
            's service, and was dismissed for bad conduct, and for getting drunk. I worked for

             - his garden was robbed, and he said very likely I might have had a hand in it - I was not sent away for it. I saw several witnesses attending for the prisoner at the office - one offered to swear that he was at her house at the time.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you acquainted with him before? A. No, nor the other man. I have since seen the other man in Golden-lane; he ran off, and I after him, but he got away.</p>

            . I am not related to the witness. I drove her, the prisoner, and his mother, to Plumbstead, on the 3d of November, from the Bricklayers' Arms, about half-past one o'clock, and got back about half-past eleven. When they got there they went to their friends, and left the prisoner with me; they returned, and took us to their friends to tea.</p>

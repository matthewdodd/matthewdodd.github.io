On 6th September, I took six horses to Mr. Ram<lb></lb>say's field, on the Great Northern-road; amongst them was a bay mare—I lost that mare on the Friday following, the 13th—it was shown to me that same day by Mr. Ramsay and sergeant Sawyer, and I identified her as mine—she bad two or three white marks and a tuft of hair on the throat—she had had some shoes put on at Mr. Jackson's, at Finchley, and I examined her and found she had on the same shoes—I can swear it was my mare—I valued her at 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but she is worth more.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, S</hi> 24). On Thursday morning I heard of the loss of the horses from the field—I went to the toll-gate and made inquiries—I afterwards saw Crouch—he made a communication to me, and gave me a description of a person—I then went with Mr. Ramsay to all the other toll-gates from Whetstone to Holloway, and traced up to London—we got to Islington about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, but the toll collector, who had been on duty the night before, was not there then, and I had to stop till 8 o'clock in the evening to see him—next day I was with Mr. Ramsay in the Caledonian-road, and saw the prisoner riding a bay mare—it was the one that was afterwards identified by Mr. Harrington—I followed him to a public-house opposite Caledonian School—he got off there—a man spoke to him—he gave the mare up to a boy outside, and went into the house to get something to drink—I went and looked at the mare, and saw she corres<lb></lb>ponded with the description that was given—Mr. Ramsay went to find the prosecutor, and when the prisoner came out I asked him if the horse was his—he said it was—I asked where he bought it—he said he bought it the morning previous at Harlow-bush Fair—I asked him at what time—he told me about 9 o'clock in the morning—I asked which way he went to Harlow-bush—he said from King's-cross station to Barnet by the half-past 6 morning train, and that he arrived at Barnet by 7; that he then went to Barnet fair-fields, as he thought the fair was not over, to purchase a horse; and, the fair being over, he saw two gipsies in the fields where the fair was held, and he asked them if. they could sell him a horse; that they told him they had not one there to suit him, but they could take him to a place where they could get him a useful mare—he said he then went with them to Harlow-bush—I asked him which way he went—he said he walked up the hill through Barnet—I asked him which way ho turned when he got to Barnet—he said, "To the left"—I said, "You say you walked there, how</p>

               <p>far should you think it is?"—he said, "Seven or eight miles"—I then told him I believed that was the mare that was stolen from Mr. Ramsay's field, in Whetstone, about 11 o'clock on Wednesday night, and that his answers did not satisfy me; that I knew Harlow-bush to be twenty miles on the right of Barnet, and it was impossible for him to get there in the time, and he must accompany me to the station as the owner was sent for—I took him to the station in the Caledonian-road, and the prosecutor came and identified the mare—I then conveyed the prisoner to Whetstone and charged him—he repeated the same story there as before—on searching him, I found this toll ticket, issued at Holloway gate—it contains the figures 12, 9, which, I believe, means the 12th day of the 9th month—Thursday was the 12th—a person passing through that gate after 12 o'clock on Wednesday night would receive such a ticket—Harlow-bush is twenty miles on the right of Barnet—if he had got to Barnet by 7 o'clock, he could not have to Harlot bush by 9.</p>

After we got there I saw two black horses and two bay ones; I looked at them, and picked this bay mare, the one now in the street; I asked the price; they asked six guineas; I said I would not give it, I would give five; they would not take less than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I said I would split the difference and give 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; they said they would take it; that was all I agreed to pay, and did pay. They took the horses up to London; one of them rode the black horse and led the other; I rode up to Islington gate in the same cart I rode from Barnet, I and the other gipsy, and the cart passed them on the road; one said we would meet them through Islington gate; we stopped at a public-house, through the gate, till they came; the gipsy that brought the horses through the gate had a hand kerchief and a ticket; they left me the ticket and handkerchief, by dropping it; they said I could have it, so I picked up the ticket and handkerchief and put them into my pocket; they tied the two black horses and the hay behind the cart and left me with this mare, and said, 'Good afternoon, I wish you good luck with the mare, I hope she will do you service; that was a 11; I made my way home'")</p>

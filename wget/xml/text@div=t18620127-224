                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. James Hunton, the pro<lb></lb>prietor of Bull's library, in Holles-street, Cavendish-square—on 17th Decem<lb></lb>ber the prisoner came to our shop and paid a quarter's subscription for old books—for that subscription he would be allowed six volumes of old books—I gave him six at that time—on 23rd December he changed some of them—on 8th January I had some business with Mr. Kimpton, a bookseller of Great Turnstile, Holborn—I recognised three books of ours on Mr. Kimpton's table—in consequence of that we communicated with Ser<lb></lb>geant White—these are the three books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are the "Seven Lamps of Architecture," and the fourth and fifth volumes of "Ruskin's Modern Painters"—they belong to Mr. Hunton—we should value them at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the "Modern Painters" is a very expensive work.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201270015"></xptr>
               <p>and we have only one other copy of "The Seven Lamps of Architecture," and one other copy of volume five of the "Modern Painters"—I am quite satisfied we have no surplus copy of volume four—I am certain that no other copy has been sold—I have the management of the sale department—I have been with Mr. Hunton eight years in London, and four in the country—the date of the work is 1856, but volume five was published after that—here are three volumes that do not belong to us—it was on 17th December, 1861, that the prisoner first became a subscriber—he subscribed for six old volumes—we call them old volumes if they have been published six or eight months—the subscription would expire on 17th March, 1862—I served him on the first occasion, and saw him served on the second and third—I did not on the fourth—I saw him served with these books—I recognise them—we bind them in a particular way, different from other libraries—I swear this is our binding—we are bookbinders as well as booksellers—we bind for other people, but not like this—we should not refuse to bind in this manner for other persons if it was desired, but it has never been asked for—I do not say that we have never bound another book like this, but not of this work, certainly—we sometimes make inquiries of persons who apply to become subscribers, not always—it is generally sufficient to give the name and address, and then books are supplied in the regular manner—we keep entries of the books that are sent out—I have a record here of the books which the prisoner had, copied from the ledger—we also enter the books that are returned, at the time they are returned—if a subscriber wished to exchange a book for a more valuable one in the possession of another subscriber, he would have to ask our consent before it could be exchanged—Mr. Hunton would be the person to refer to—he is not here—any person who presents a book to have changed for a subscriber, we should exchange it—the books that were given out to the prisoner were, the fourth and fifth volumes of "Modern Painters," "The Seven Lamps of Architecture," "Du Chaillu's Explorations in Africa," "The Ingoldsby Legends," first series, and the first volume of "North and South"—if a book warn damaged it would be bound again if it was of any value; it would depend on circumstances—these books were not for sale at Mr. Kimpton's—they were lying on the table.</p>

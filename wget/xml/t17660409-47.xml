I told him we had. He said that parcel was stolen out of the waggon; he said he suspected the 2 prisoners, and desired me to go to the house where he had information of it, saying there was such a parcel, but the direction was torn off. I went and saw it, at the Fox in Fox-court. The 2 prisoners were taken up, and carried before my Lord-Mayor, there we opened the parcel; in it we found our bill of parcels, which answered to the things.

             brought this parcel to me on the 1st of March, betwixt 10 and 11 o'clock, and desired he might leave it, and said he would fetch it in 10 minutes, for his waggon was gone before, and he should have anger if he did not take care of it; the other prisoner was with him; they were not in their soldiers cloaths, they were both dressed like countrymen. When they had been gone about half an hour, I began to be very uneasy; I found the direction was torn off, and the bottom of the letters left upon the paper: I saw they had opened a corner, to see what was in it. I sent for a neighbour, and told him of it. He said, Don't trouble yourself with it, you may have a great deal of trouble. Soon after Lamball came in, and asked for it. I said I would not part with it, till I had been before a justice of the peace. I went to secure my tankard, and How said to Lamball, Go and fetch the man that gave it you: he went out. Then I said to How, Don't you think this is stolen, by the direction being taken off? Said he, I know nothing of it. I said to him, Pray where does your waggon stand? He said, At Temple-bar. I said, You mean Holborn-bars. He said, Yes, I do. Then he said, Madam, do not part with it: for, depend upon it, it is stolen; and away he went. I went out to see for him, and they were both standing together in the middle of the road. I found afterwards, they had used to load this waggon. My Lord-Mayor ordered me to take the parcel into my custody till it was produced here, which I did.</p>

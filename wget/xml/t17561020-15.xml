            . I came from Portsmouth on Saturday last. The next day I went from the Borough to Chelsea, where I am a pensioner, and coming back again between seven and eight o'clock at night, I met the prisoner in <placeName id="t17561020-15-crimeloc71">Westminster</placeName>

She took me to an empty house, where I sat down, and had a fit. Her candle went out, and she went out to get it lighted; but not returning, I began to search my pockets, and missed my watch, a gold ring, nine guineas, twelve shillings, and my silver buckles out of my shoes. I went and call'd out, I had been rob'd. The people came about, and I described the prisoner so well that they took me to the house where she lodged; but she was not to be found. I got a warrant and constable the next day, and search'd the house, and was told she and another woman were gone by water. We took water and went to Lombard-Street, and found them in a silversmith's shop selling a gold ring; but that was not mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any of your things again ?</p>
               <p>Duncan. No, I did not. She had some silver about her, but none of my things. She told me yesterday in the prison that I gave her the buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain the prisoner is the woman?</p>
               <p>Duncan. To the best of my knowledge I believe she is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I never saw the prosecutor till I was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you subject to its ?</p>
               <p>Duncan. I am, and was discharged out of the service on that occasion.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman S</hi> 8). On Tuesday morning, 7th November, about 2.30, I was on duty in Mary Terrace, High Street, Camden Town, and saw the prisoner go into the garden of No. 4—he remained three or four minutes, and I heard a slight noise—I looked round, and saw the prisoner just dropping from a window—he reached over, and took something from the window sill—he then ran away, and I ran after him—I did not lose sight of him—I caught him within 25 yards—he dropped this jug as he ran—I took him back to the house, and said "What was that you dropped?"—he said "Nothing"—there was not a soul near—I found the window open, and said "I suppose this is where you got it from"—he said "No, I was not in this garden at all, I was in the garden of No. 3 to seek a friend"—I called the landlady, who identified the jug—two patches of white were on the knees of the prisoner's trousers—it is a white window sill.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He appeared to have been drinking in the fore-part of the day, but he knew what he was about—the sill is about 3ft. 6 in. from the ground—he told me that he was in the service of Mr. Grusaett, of the Eton Tavern, Haverstock Hill, as potman, and I believe that is true—the house is about four yards from the road—there are several houses with female servants there.</p>

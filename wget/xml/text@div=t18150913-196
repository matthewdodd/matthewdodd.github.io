            . On the 22nd of July, I saw the prisoner at the bar, standing on the stairs in my house; when she saw me, she came and said, I have brought you six shillings for the things you have sold this morning. I told her she must be mistaken; whilst I was talking to her, I saw my husband's great coat in a basket she had in her hand. I took her into the kitchen; and took out the coat, and then there was a black net scarf, and some candlesticks. The scarf had been in a drawer in the back first floor room; that drawer was not locked. The great coat was hanging up in that room. There were other things which were not meddled with. I sent for a constable, who is here with the property. I don't think the lace would sell for one pound; but it would be difficult to get it second hand for that money; my husband's coat is worth about one pound.</p>

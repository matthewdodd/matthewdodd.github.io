I said, "Oh! no, Mr. Rowley; it is perfectly safe here, let it stand;" I went home, and in the course of the evening it was brought back to my warehouse - I had not ordered it to be sent; I had my stock taken, and found a very large deficiency - I immediately ordered Fell to quit my premises in five minutes; he kept out of the way for about a fortnight - I went and sent for him, but could not find him; he was advertised by the parish, and taken - I know the cask to be mine by the carrier's brand-mark on it; it was one of one hundred barrels imported from Limerick; Fell had no authority to sell my goods.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. On the 24th of March, a little after three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw Fell rolling a barrel of pork from our cellar, towards Wapping-dock; I lost sight of him at near the gun-dock - he was going towards Rowley's; I went home and reported what I had seen - I went after him again, and saw him pitch it into Mr. Rowley's shop; there was a young man at the further end of the shop - I saw Fell talking to him; I then came away; and told master when he came home - I afterwards saw the cask, and believe it to be the same - it was full.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How near were you to the cask at any time? A. Within four or five yards; I did not particularly examine it - I did not see him take it from the cellar; I knew it by the brandmark.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go to the warehouse to see if any casks were missing? A. Yes, and missed it - I had stowed it away a day or two before myself, and had seen it there that very day about half-past six o'clock - this one stood in front of the others.</p>

            . I am cooper to the prosecutors. - On the 24th of March, about half-past three o'clock, Fell asked me to go down into the cellar, to help him roll out a barrel of pork - we do not always use the crane; master was not at home - Fell first asked me, where Storey. the clerk, was; I said at the public-house: he then said"Come down and help me with a barrel of pork out of the cellar, it is a good time;" I helped him - he then asked me to roll it for him to Rowley's shop - I would not, and then he said he was the best man himself to roll it; and accordingly he did; he said "D - n your eyes, you are as bad as I am;" I had some suspicion that all was not right - I went over to Brown and told him what had happened; I did not see where he took it to - the brandmark on it was "Reading, Limerick." I did not see him take it more than twenty or thirty yards: it came back the same evening - I am sure it was the same cask, I can swear to it: he said I was as bad as he was, and liable to be transported - it was taken from a pile of about one hundred others.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Then it was not standing by itself? A. No; it was in the pile - my master allows me a piece of pork, when I want it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever fined 40s. for stealing pork? A. Yes, but Fell, the foreman, gave it to me; he and I were together - it was eighteen months ago; I did not tell master of this till I was taken to the Police-office - I was never taken up before - I had no quarrel with Fell.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Fell fined at the time you were? A. No - he went away; we were only going through the docks to give a bit of pork to the foreman of the wine<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030073"></xptr>department, for some wine: I never told master that Fell was concerned.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK to ROBERT LINKLATER. Q. Do not you know that it was Rowley who sent the cask home? A. I do not know; he came to me that evening, after it had come, and told me he had sent it home; he went over the way then - I made no charge against him at that time; he continued in his business: Fell was taken about a month ago, and the Magistrate issued a summons for Rowley, by my desire - there were three hearings; I do not think there were more - Rowley did not attend at one of them; he attended once as a witness - I went to the office one evening, in consequence of a notice, but he did not come, and nothing was done, as Mr. Humphries, my solicitor, ordered me not to do anything unless he was there; Rowley was there that night, and attended two or three times after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply to an attorney named Dodd? A. No. I know him very well; he did not act as my attorney; I was never in Mr. Harmer's office in my life - I do not know where it is; I did not send Dodd to Rowley's at any time; I know he went there - that might be a week after the discovery - it was before any examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not Dodd now acting as your attorney? A. No: Mr. Humphries is my attorney - Dodd did not attend before the Magistrate, as my attorney; he may have been there; he told me afterwards that he had been to Rowley, and I approved of what he said, but I did not apply to him - when Rowley came to me, nothing passed about anything but the cask: I took hold of the chain of the crane and said,"The cask could not be taken out without this;' no other conversation passed to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not in the first instance forget that Rowley had called on you? A. Yes; I had entirely forgotten it, but I recollected it when he mentioned it: I do not recollect any other conversation passing.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Are you sure no conversation passed respecting his dealing with Fell for two or three years? A. Not a sentence; I attended all the examinations.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you understand by Rowley saying, you did not want it? A. I understood him to mean that Fell had received it as a present from some other person, and I did not want to purchase it - that was the impression on my mind; I said it was curious to take casks from my foreman without coming to me, as I did not live three hundred yards off - he did not say what he gave for it - Dodd told me he had information that Rowley had sent money to Fell, and ordered him to keep out of the way while I was looking for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that what you approved of? A. Why, I thought I could not convict him without having Fell, and I thought it was necessary for me to have information, whether he was out of the way; and Dodd said he would call to know that: I approved of his calling, as it saved me trouble; he said he would call and ask Rowley that; I think he called afterwards, and told me he had been to Rowley. I did not authorize Dodd to go to Rowley and say he should be prosecuted unless he paid 1000l.; on my oath I never did; nor did Dodd tell me he had made such a communication: Rowley did not say Fell had told him he had the cask from the master of a vessel.</p>

            . I am occasionally employed as attorney for the prosecutor; but on this prosecution I never was employed profssionally by him; I am subpoenaed here for the prisoners; I called on Rowley three times; I did not communicate with the prosecutor before I called - the first time was a fortnight or three weeks after the 24th of March; I saw Rowley in his counting-house, and told him I understood he knew where Fell, Mr. Linklater's late foreman was, as it was reported he had given him money to go out of town; he denied it, and asked if Linklater intended to prosecute Fell; I said I believed he did, but he was away - he then asked if he intended to prosecute him; I said I did not know; that I had no instruction to call on him, but I had merely called to get this question answered and to see some receipts which he had; the prosecutor's son is articled to me; I am continually calling on him: Rowley asked me if Fell could turn King's evidence against him; I told him he could - he said he did not care for that, as he had plenty of receipts for some empty casks which he had received, and he pulled one from a file - it was for empty casks, and signed John Fell; he then asked me how much property was lost from Linklater's premises; I said the books were at an accountants in the City, and I believed 2,000l. worth of provisons were said to be lost from the stock; he said he had not had above 100l. worth, nor so much, and asked me what would settle the affair; I told him I had no authority to call on him, and advised him to go to his friends, consult some professional man, and get the best advice he could; I afterwards saw Linklater, and said, I do not know whether I have done right - but I have been to Rowley's to get information about Fell and look at some receips: I called on Rowley again - he appeared much dejected, said he had been speaking to his friends, and asked me if the thing could he settled; I said No, he could not buy Mr. Linklater I was sure - he said, "If I was to send a friend of mine, who is a friend of Linklater's, would it nothave great weight?" I said it might, but I had nothing to do with it, I called as a friend; I called again, and there were two persons in the shop, one was a lad and the other an elderly person, whose name I understood to be Mitchell; Rowley then said he had been into the country. but had not found any friend who he could call one, who would go to Mr. Linklater on the business, and here the conversation ended; we were shut in the counting-house; the two persons were not present; when we came out into the shop, Rowley said, "I cannot find 1,000l.;" I said, I do not know what you mean, for I supposed he was going to make some evidence of my being there; I had said nothing about 1,000l.; I said in these peoples' presence, that I had no authority from Mr. Linklater for calling, and in point of fact, I was blamed by him for going there.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. How long have you been a professional man? A. Nine years; I was not a friend of Rowley's - I saw Linklater the evening I had the first conversation, and told him about the receipts; I did not think there was any occasion to tell him more.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you conceal any part of the conversation? A. Rowley being a neighbour of Linklater's, I did not wish to irritate Linklater's feelings; the second interview was four or five days afterwards - I called to do everything in my power to avoid a prosecution; as Rowley had friends in the neighbourhood, I thought the best way would be to send an intimate friend of his to Linklater, to prevent a prosecution.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030074"></xptr>Q. On your oath did you not, yourself, mention the 1000l.? A. Yes: Rowley asked what would settle it; I said I could not enter into it - he asked if 100l. or 200l. would settle it; I said No, nor 1000l. either: I mentioned one or two of these circumstances to Linklater, and he blamed me for going, as I had no authority; I did not mention the 1000l. to him - my object was to settle it without a compromise.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, did you not say, in the presence of the two persons in the shop, that it was Mr. Linklater's wish that Rowley should deposit 1000l. till his books were examined? A. No, nor did I say Rowley was to make up what was deficient; nor anything to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Rowley say, "If you have any proposition to make you had better put it into writing," and then he could consult his friends? A. I do not remember it, I assure you; if it did pass it must have occurred in the hurry, when he called me, as I was going out, and said, "I cannot find 1000l." - I swear I never heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you not say, you should commit yourself as a professional man by doing it? A. No: I went to Mr. Harmer to appoint a time for Linklater to come to him; I had told Linklater I should go to Mr. Harmer's, and he assented to it: I went, and Mr. Harmer told me he was engaged in the case, and next day I went with Linklater to Mr. Humphries - I did not attend at the office; I never told Linklater what had passed between me and Rowley, respecting making up the books and the 1000l. - I do not think I did, but really I cannot charge my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you went to Mr. Harmer, you had no desire to settle it? A. No; the truth is, Rowley's character had been pretty well blown about the neighbourhood, and it was known on 'Change, and if Linklater had not prosecuted, he would have suffered in his character himself.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were subpoenaed on the prisoner's behalf? A. Yes; I called the second and third time at Rowley's request; he said nothing more to me about money than I have stated.</p>
               <p>FELL's Defence. I never did anything but what the clerk directed; as to master's loss I cannot be accountable - I understand they have found 800l. worth since I have been confined; I was not out of the way at all - the clerk is the guilty man; he cannot be found: McNamara told me Dodd had him into the parlour, and gave him two glasses of wine to get all he could out of him.</p>
               <p>ROWLEY's Defence. Dodd came three times to me to make a compromise, and if I would do that they would forbear the prosecution: I said I was innocent, and would not give 1d., he might do his worst; I asked him to put it down in writing - he said, as a professional man he should be committing himself.</p>
               <p>MR. LINKLATER. I do not know where my clerk is now - he has been with two accountants, but has been unwell; I suppose he is at home - he left word that he was not well; I have not sent for him since I have dismissed him; there is a delinquency, but I have not proof to bring it forward; Fell was advertised for leaving his wife and child.</p>

             re-examined. Dodd never gave me any wine.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He said you were as liable to be transported as he was? A. Yes - that was when I refused to help him to Rowley's with it.</p>
               <p>CHARLES ADAMS. I am shopman to Mr. Rowley, and have been so this twelve months; he has been in his shop till this morning, and has surrendered. I remember Dodd coming to him three times - he said he came from Mr. Linklater - that Linklater had lost property to the amount of 1000l., and wished. Mr. Rowley to deposit 1000l. in a certain person's hands till the books were examined, and then to make up the deficiency; Rowley asked him to give him a statement in writing, and said he would consult his friends - Dodd replied, that being a professional man be should commit himself by so doing; this was at the second interview - he came again after that, and I heard him say,"Have you done anything, but I did not hear the answer, as they went into the counting-house.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How often have you seen Fell at Rowley's? A. Not more than three or four times, or it may be five or six: I never saw him bring anything but the harrel of pork in question.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it get back? A. Mr. Linklater said he would send his man for it, but Rowley said he would send it for him, and he sent it between five and six o'clock. When the pork came Mr. Rowley looked out of the counting-house, and told Fell to leave it and call some other time, as he was busy then, he would open it, and see what he could give for it - he was not in the habit of buying such things; I have seen empty casks there - I knew Fell was in the prosecutor's service: I never knew him bring any beef; Mitchell was present at the third interview; nothing was said then but, "Have you done anything?"</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. The cask came between three and five o'clock? A. Yes - it had not been examined when it was found by the prosecutor; a man named Edwards, who was in our employ, took it back.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the empty casks bought of? A. I went for some of them; I went to Mr. Linklater's, and asked for Fell - if he was not there I went to the public-house.</p>

            . I assist Rowley in his business, and know Fell; he is foreman to Mr. Linklater - I have gone there to give orders for empty casks, and Mr. Linklater's servants brought them. I saw Dodd at Rowley's once, but did not hear what passed.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How often were you at Rowley's? A. Almost daily for nine or ten months; I sometimes saw Fell there two or three times a week, when casks have been ordered; he came to cooper sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Mr. Linklater respecting any order? A. I have: Rowley never sent me there for brands - I have been sent for the cooper.</p>

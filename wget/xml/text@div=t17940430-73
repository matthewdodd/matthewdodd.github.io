On Thursday the 6th day of March, between the hours of five and six, I happened to be at my work, a little distance from my house, and a message came to me that a thief had been in the house and had stole a great coat belonging to my lodger, and a caddy of mine; I work about five hundred yards off, at a shop of Mr. Wilson's, as I heard the news I laid down my tools and went towards my house, and before I got to my house, between three and four doors off it, I met the prisoner at the bar, in custody of the constable, and the constable had the property; Mr. Gerot is a French gentleman, that lodges in my parlour.

               <p>The last witness is my father. I saw the prisoner coming out of my father's house, with the tea caddy; I was not in the house at the time, I was about the door with the child; when he came out of the passage he had the great coat under his left arm, and the tea caddy open, not locked up, under his left arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these things kept? - in the front parlour that Mr. Gerot occupies. I stopped him in the entry myself, and he was detained till the constable came, I called the postman to my assistance, who was going by.</p>

               <p>Q. How did the prisoner behave? - He said nothing to me; I said hold of him by the collar, and he begged my pardon, and that was all; he did not abuse me, he laid the things down on the mat in the entry of the passage. I am positive to the great coat, because it was in the parlour but a few minutes before, with the caddy; I see him delivered into the constable's hands, by the postman.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I produce a tea caddy and a great coat, I received them and the prisoner likewise, in a house, about three doors from Mr. Penzattee's, at one Mr. Sealy's house, a grocer's.</p>

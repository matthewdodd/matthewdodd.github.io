                  </hi>. On Monday, the 9th of January, Sharpe, my foreman, told me something—we called the prisoner up, after he had passed through one of the gates into the ware-room, and asked him if he had any metal about him—he said no, he had not—he was then told that metal had been found secreted in different places, that some of it was gone, and from circumstances we suspected he had taken it—he said he had not—I said, "Send for an officer"—he then said, yes, he had some metal about him, and took out a piece, I think, from his side pocket, and said that was all he had—the officer found more metal upon him in different parts—this is it—some is copper, some brass, and some lead—I have more than one partner—we are largely in the copper and metal line—some of this is old metal, some is faulty casting, but it would be of the same use as the others—after the officer found several pieces about him, he again said that was all he had about him—I said, "Look in his hat," and in his hat some more was found—one of our workmen had found some secreted away, and it went away from time to time—there was no other man in the yard that afternoon, but the one who had given the information.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> We find these pieces about, and when we are at work about the premises we throw it any where handy, and when we have an oppor<lb></lb>tunity we take them into the cellar, by Mr. W. Pontifex's orders—during the last week I suppose I took 6 cwt.—the pieces that I had about me I bad brought to take into the cellar, and before I could take them I was called up. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> We have gates from the yard to the factory, and he had passed these gates before he was called up.</p>

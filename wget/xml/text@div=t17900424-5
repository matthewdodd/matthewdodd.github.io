               <p>When you went up stairs did you examine that chest? - I saw it examined; the woman to whom this property belonged, was brought, the chest was not locked, and the things were gone out, and the chest was clear; the blanket dragged on his heels; I saw the things in the chest, that very day; I produce a boy's little green skirt, I have nothing else, the other things are all at sea.</p>
               <p>Court. Pray when you returned to your house, did you make any observation on your door? - It had been broke open by force, there were two little bits of wood chipped away; the thing which the lock shuts into was copper, and that was quite out on the floor.</p>

               <p>Did you leave a good fire when you went out? - Not a very good one, but a middleing one; for as I went out, I had a candle in my right hand, and I saw them at the door, and I shut to the door for a minute, because I was afraid; then I had my candle in my hand, by which I had been working, the door is but just by; as I came back I had no light but the fire.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had you much fire? - It was middling, there was not a great fire, nor a very small fire; it was a moon-light night.</p>

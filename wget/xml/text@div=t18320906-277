I produce some articles, which I got at a pawnbroker's shop - the prisoner took them in, but did not pawn them; I took them from his hat, and one shirt was on his back - this was on the 4th of August - I asked him if the two shirts on the counter were his; he said Yes - I asked if they were marked; he said Yes - I asked him his name, and he said Edward Connelly; as I was taking him, he threw a duplicate behind him, and I found 5s. on him.</p>

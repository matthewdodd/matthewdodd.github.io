(which the prisoner had before told me he had done)—he said, "No"—I then said to the prisoner, "What has become of the sashes?"—he said they were in a room he was living in, next door—I afterwards went to the station, and saw the prisoner there—I said to him, "If you don't think proper to answer me, don't do so; I wish to know where you have taken the property, that the officer may follow it?"—he said, "I shall tell the Lord Mayor to-morrow morning"—the other man who was there said, "Three carts have been sold to Mr. Folgate, for 33<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—the prisoner said, "It is correct"—I said, "What have you done with the lead?"—he said, "I have had no lead."</p>

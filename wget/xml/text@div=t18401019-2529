                  </hi>. I am a manufacturer of cutlery at Sheffield. On the 8th of October, I sent some cases of cutlery in a deal box, by Messrs. Pickford, directed to Mrs. Bouverie, Paris, to the care of Messrs. Swaine and Co., Piccadilly—it contained a number of razors and pen-knives—in consequence of information, I came to town last Monday, and saw the case which is here—there were three paper parcels, each containing razors enclosed in another paper—from one of the parcels I missed some razors—the outer envelope had been taken off, which was sealed, and was missing—one razor has been taken out of one parcel, and four out of another—the inner parcels were not sealed, but they had evidently been opened—the case was produced to me at the station-house—there were twenty razors in all in the envelope.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Pickford and Co,—I am engaged in checking off the parcels which come by the railroad—on Saturday morning I remember this case coming—it was in a sound and proper state when it came from the wagon—it was the prisoner's business to truck away parcels which come by the wagon to the warehouse—he and Ely were so employed that morning with the other men—I afterwards received information from Ely, and went down to where the box had been placed, in what we style the "Bank"—I found the box broken open and ap<lb></lb>parently a parcel or two gone—I brought it up against the checking box, and kept it there about a quarter of an hour—in about five minutes after, the prisoner came on the bank, and I accused him of breaking the box open—he positively denied it—about ten minutes after I accused him again of it, and a porter, named Killick, stepped up, and said, if he did know any thing of the parcels, why did he not give them up—he made no reply, but walked down the warehouse—Killick followed close after him, and I fol<lb></lb>lowed him, and just as I got to the bottom of the warehouse, I saw the prisoner deliver three small parcels to Killick, who gave them to me—I replaced them in the box, took it into the M office, locked it, and delivered the key to one of the clerks—I heard Killick say to the prisoner, "Then you did know where the parcels were, why did not you give them up?"—he said, because he was ashamed.</p>

I am fourteen years old, and live with my fa<lb></lb>ther, John Blackburn, a milkman, at No. 22, Short's-gardens, Drury-lane He only occupies the bottom of the house—the landlord does not live on the premises—there is no internal communication between my father's rooms and the other lodgers' rooms—the prisoners lived in a passage which joins the house, just as you go out into the yard—on Tuesday the 10th of November, I and my father got up about four o'clock in the morning—I noticed a box lying under the bed in the parlour—we fast-end the door by a padlock and a stock-lock—we then went to the cow-house at the bottom of the street—the street-door was left open, as it usually is—there is a passage through the house—I returned in half an hour, before my father, to get a light, and found the street-door half shut, and the prisoners in the passage carrying the box which had been under the bed, between them down the passage—they were coming out with it—I saw them come out of the bed-room, which is the parlour, and they were coming through the shop with it—there was a ring on one side of the box—one of them held it at each corner, and the other held the other end—they went down the passage with it, and attempted to put it over the wall which is between our yard and theirs—they lived next door—they had got a step-ladder on the other side of the wall—I saw that—when they saw me they put the box down—only one of them tried to put it over—she lifted it up to the other—I called to my father in the street, and then Halen got over the wall into her own premises—M'Clewer stopped in the passage, and put her shawl over her head to conceal her face—I pulled it off her face—I saw Ann Page, she stopped at the door while I went to get a policeman, and M'Clewer rushed out while I was gone—she pushed by me, and then she went back again, and stopped till I was gone—I fetched Taylor—I do not know what was in the box.</p>

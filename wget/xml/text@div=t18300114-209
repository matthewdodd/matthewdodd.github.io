            . I am inspector of the Islington watch. On the 17th of December I was with a patrol at the foot of the canal bridge, and saw the two prisoners coming out of Mr. Rhodes's brick-field - I got off my horse and asked Cakes what he did in the field; he said he was looking for work - I examined his pockets, and found two fowls; the patrol searched Hatton, and found two fowls in his pocket, and a quantity of snares - this was about a mile and a half from the prosecutor's; I showed him the same fowls, and he owned them.</p>
               <p>JOHN LOYEDER. I was with Morgan - what he has stated is correct; the fowls were dead.</p>

On the evening of the 16th of December, his fowls were all safe in a cow-house, which opened in the yard - it had two doors, one was locked, and the other latched and bolted, and has a strong chain; I fastened it up at five o'clock in the evening - next morning I went, and they had got the fastenings of the door undone which was not locked, and six fowls were gone: I saw four of them at the watch-house, and knew them all, but one more particularly; here is the cock's head and leg - he had lost one eye, and was lame in the foot; I know nothing of the prisoners.</p>

            . I am a letter-founder, and live at No. 3, West-street. On a Monday or Tuesday night, a fortnight before Christmas, I was standing outside the door, about twelve o'clock, and saw this wooden legged man (the prosecutor) come out of the chandler's-shop, No. 3, where I lodge - he had been there for a quartern loaf; he said he was killed, he was dead - he went to his own shop, which is about twenty yards further, and asked his wife for a knife, saying."That d-d Alexander has killed me; I will die under him this night" - during this time the prisoner went a contrary way towards Smithfield; he was in the chandler's-shop when Levy went out - I saw him leave the shop while Levy was gone for the knife - I saw nothing more; but Levy returned and pushed the shop door open, saying, "Where is that d-d rogue?"</p>

I said, No - I did not see these witnesses there; seven or eight persons were in the shop, and I made an excuse to go in for a half-quartern loaf - the watchman said it was dangerous to go in there.</p>

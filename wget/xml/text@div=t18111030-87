I searched her and found only a shilling and a few halfpence.</p>

My lord and gentlemen of the jury, the awful predicament I now stand in, has so agitated my mind and worked upon my feelings, that I have scarce power to appear before your lordships and this honourable court. On the night of the 9th of October, I in company with my sister were met by the prosecutor between two and three in the afternoon, he said we should have something to drink, we went into the house at the corner of Golden Lane, during the time we were drinking in the house, the brother of the prosecutor came in, we left this house and went to the Britannia, we all were drinking freely. I and my sister went home to fetch my bonnet, to go to Sadlers Wells, it being full we could not get in, we went to the John of Jerusalem, the prosecutor took his watch and his book out of his pocket. I put it in my bosom, I kept it safe, the prosecutor requested me to go home with him, finding myself unwell I returned him his book and his watch and went home.</p>

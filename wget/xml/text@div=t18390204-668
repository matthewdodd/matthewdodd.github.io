                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live in Weston-street, Penton<lb></lb>ville. On the 8th of January, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was in Guildford-street, and saw a baker's barrow at the end of Lamb's Conduit-alone street—the barrow was closed, but it was a baker's barrow, standing—I saw the prisoner walking from Caroline-place up towards Lamb's Conduit-street—he passed by the barrow, and under the wall stood a baker's basket—he took up the basket, and went back to the barrow with it—he seemed to be watching, as though he was looking for somebody or something—this took my attention, and when he got to the barrow he put the basket down, opened the barrow, put his hand in, took out a quantity of bread, and put it in the basket—he did that a second time, and then he went round to the head of the barrow, and took out some more—I cannot tell how many loaves he took in all, I should think about thirteen, which he put into the basket—he then took one more in his hand, and put the basket on his shoulder—he then walked up Lamb's Conduit-street, and went down Great Ormond-street—I was going the same way on busi<lb></lb>ness, and I went on and met a policeman—I told him my suspicion—I then left them—I am sure the prisoner is the man I left with the basket when I gave information to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 44.) I was spoken to by the witness on the 8th of January—he pointed out the prisoner at a distance, with a loaf in his band, and a basket on his shoulder—there was no other man but the prisoner with a loaf and a basket—I followed the prisoner on to Blooms-bury-square, and he put down the basket, went with one loaf to a gentle<lb></lb>man's door, and pretended to deliver it, but no one came—he then went into the hall, parted the loaf in two, and put part in his hat and part in his pocket—I then went up to him, and asked what he was going to do with the bread—he said, "Eat it, to be sure"—I asked where he got it—he said he bought it, and it was his own—I found twelve loaves in the basket, and this is the broken one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of William Walter Gilbertson: he is a baker—I was out, with my barrow, on the 8th of January, and left it at the corner of Lamb's Conduit-street and Guildford-street, about ten o'clock—I was away for ten or fifteen minutes—when I came back I did not notice any thing, but went on with my barrow till I met the witness Tucker, and received information—I then missed thirteen loaves—these are them—this one is cottage bread—I have no doubt it is my master's.</p>

               <p>Was you present when he was brought? - Yes; he first said, that his cousin gave him the money; then he said, he worked for it; it appeared he had lain out in that week, in one way or the other, upwards of twenty pounds, with what he got out of pawn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long have you known him? - A great while; he has worked for me ever since the beginning of April; I have heard say his wife and him have lived very creditable; but very much reduced.</p>
               <p>You have told us that this man had the things in pawn which he redeemed? - So he told us; I am sure I saw the money on Wednesday the 11th of October; I had put it into the top drawer or the bureau; it was my husband's money; he did not know there was so much as there was; he might know perhaps there was twenty pounds; for I have worked very hard these three years, because I have a small<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250205"></xptr> family; I did not tell him every thing; my husband never went to that drawer at all.</p>
               <p>How much rent had you to pay? - Twenty-five shillings and nine-pence; and to our cow master about eight pounds; we had between nine and ten to pay.</p>
               <p>How long ago was it that your husband borrowed five guineas towards paying his rent? - He never brought five guineas since I was married; I never said so to any body.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Earle, a shoemaker? - I do; my husband buys his shoes of him.</p>
               <p>How lately had he occasion to buy shoes of him? - I do not know; about six weeks ago he had a pair, and paid him.</p>
               <p>You do not know now that he applied to Mr. Earle on credit, and said, he was ceedingly distressed? - No, he did not, I am sure; I have been in the milk way about three years; my husband was a coachman; and when we came into business, I had seventeen guineas; we had saved almost fifteen pounds; my husband carries a pair of pails, and I carry two kettles, that carries a good deal of milk.</p>
               <p>Have you lately sold any of your furniture or clothes or things? - No, nothing in the world.</p>

               <p>What account did he give of himself how he got that twenty pounds? - First, he said, he had it of his cousin; then he denied it, and said, it was money that he earned at three-halfpence an hour of Mrs. May; the prisoner was very mean and ragged, and was quite destitute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was this money kept in a locked drawer? - Yes; I seldom went to it; I did not know the sum; I never applied to any body for five guineas; I never wanted it.</p>
               <p>Have you never said that you have? - No, Sir; I know Mr. Earle; he is my shoemaker; I never applied to him for credit for any thing; I had no suspicion of the prisoner; I have known him since he came to work for Mrs. May; I knew him in the life time of his wife.</p>
               <p>Court. This money was yours, you did not take it yourself? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. His work was laborious? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner these nine years; I was with him when he bought them things; I cannot tell the day of the month upon my word; he only came to me and asked me to take a walk with him.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you went to the Justice's? - To the best of my knowledge it was six or seven days; I am not sure.</p>
               <p>In that day where did you go? - I went to Mr. I forget his name, opposite the Middlesex hospital; he told me he was going to take a watch out of pawn, and some waistcoats; I went to no other pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I worked for Mrs. May seven months; and I laid the money by; she almost always gave me victuals then; and when I had done work for her I went on messages; I slept in a gentleman's house in Portman-square; that saved my money; that was something every week; I had a few things of my wife's that I sold; and I laid the money by, thinking to get me two or three things.</p>
               <p>Court. Then how came you to lay it out all on a sudden; to lay it all out and get drunk, that does not agree well with the character of an industrious sober man? - I was afraid of losing the things; I never was down in Mrs. Kensington's kitchen in my life; if ever I was down, it was for a little milk for Mrs. May; I never saw a farthing of the money in my life.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Paddington-street, Mary-le-bone; I keep a house there; I am married; I have known him between seven and eight years; he has been employed by me the whole time his wife washed for my family, at her own habitation; he is remarkably sober, honest, and industrious, so much so, that whenever my mother had any business to execute, that she could not repose trust in a common porter, or even her own servants, she used to say, she would send for honest Cloud.</p>
               <p>I believe that was his general name? - Yes; and if the clergyman of the parish had been in town, he would have appeared for him; when I heard he was taken up, I asked the prosecutrix how she came to have so much money by her; and she said, her husband had borrowed five guineas towards making up his rent; that was the way she accounted for having so much money.</p>
               <p>Where was this conversation? - At the woman's where he mangled.</p>
               <p>Was any body else present? - Captain Seymore.</p>
               <p>Captain Seymore. I went with Mrs. Hudson, to enquire into the merits of the case; and that woman, I think I heard her say, she had thirty guineas in her possession; and I made reply to her, I rather think it is too large a sum for you to have together at one time, living in a cellar, in great poverty, as you appear to me; I do not recollect that she made any reply.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect hearing any thing about borrowing five guineas? - No, not from her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Where is it your live, madam? - No. 9, Paddington-street.</p>
               <p>Are you married or single? - My husband is gone to India.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Captain Seymore? - Fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Then he and you being acquainted, went to this house? - Yes, Sir, we went first to the clergyman's; all the neighbourhood were interested for him; Mrs. May was present; and she recommended them as objects of charity to me, having lost their money; I never knew any thing of the people before; they seemed to be in a great state of poverty; four small children, in such indigence, as not to be able to realize thirty-one guineas; I did not go into their cellar; the children were all brought up to me to excite charity; the woman was very shabby, and very poor, and the children I did not look to see whether they were ragged.</p>
               <p>What was it that impressed you with the idea of poverty? - Living in a milk cellar, and being brought to me with four small children; I told them, if the man was found guilty, they certainly would be paid by his being condemned; if he was not, his friends would make it up; the man's wife has been dead a year and a half; I have known him very near eight years; my mother died a year before Mrs. Cloud died, of the same complaint; he has mangled for me; this man, by his honest, good character, has recommended the woman to half the business she has; he brought the linen backwards and forwards to my house; and I took his recommendation of her as a washer-woman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mrs. May. Has this man recommended you to any family? - Yes, to two or three; I mangled for Mrs. Hudson; he fetched and carried all my linen; I frequently gave him his victuals, and frequently asked him when he would not accept; he certainly appeared to be a saving, frugal fellow; I was present part<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250208"></xptr> of the time when Mrs. Hudson came; I cannot recollect about the five guineas; the prosecutrix had four children; I am very positive she had the money; she shewed it to me a month or two before.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know this Mrs. Hudson? - I never had the pleasure of seeing the lady above once or twice before.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Kensington. Mrs. Hudson came into the shop, and a gentleman with her; I cried and said, it was a great loss; I said it was a great loss to us, as we had seven or eight guineas to pay to our cow-keeper; she said, it would be a great charity to make a collection for us.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two more witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

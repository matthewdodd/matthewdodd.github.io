                  </hi>. I am a tarpauling manufacturer, at Walworth. The prisoner was in my service—between 19th May and 2nd June, I gave him out 400 yards of canvas to make up—there were 193 yards at one time of Osnaburg canvas—he cut the goods out at my place, and made them at his own, in lengths of seven yards for wagon-covers, to be dressed afterwards—he was also to give part of it to a man named Wurr—I have only got two covers back, except what have been found at the pawnbroker's—on 17th June, I gave instructions to the police to look after him, and on the same day his wife brought me some duplicates—I saw the prisoner the same day, and gave him into custody—he said he was very sorry for what he had done—this part (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is what he ought to have delivered to Wurr—this case has not been tried before this Sessions—he was indicted for stealing eight or nine other articles—the Recorder had a doubt whether that indictment could be sustained—he detained the prisoner, and ordered me to indict him for misdemeanor on this lot of property.</p>

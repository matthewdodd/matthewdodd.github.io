                  </hi>. I am an acting surveyor of the Customs, and live at No. 83, Prince's-road, Bermondsey—I knew the deceased very well. On 11th April last, I saw him about 8 o'clock in the morning; we were on duty together during the whole of the day—he was my waterman—he appeared perfectly well that day—I had known him for sixteen years; he appeared a very healthy man—I was not then aware of his having received a gun-shot wound—I left him at the water-side between 4 and 5 o'clock that afternoon, and went home—I saw him again about 5 o'clock; he came to my house in company with the prisoner, who charged the deceased with having stolen a cloak, and also with having contraband goods in a bag which he was carrying—the deceased had a cloak with him; he was in uniform—I asked the prisoner who and what he was—he said that he was one of the detectives, and he wished to examine the bag, stating that the deceased had taken Jesse Wilson, and that he should be revenged—there is a person called Jesse Wilson, who has been several times convicted of smuggling—I told the prisoner to be quiet, and that if he was one of the detectives, we would go to the police station with him, and there he could examine the bag—we left for the purpose <hi rend="italic">of</hi> going to the station; when we had got about one hundred yards up the street, the prisoner asked if we intended to go to the police station; I told him that I was Gampton's superior officer, it was a very serious charge, and I should go there—upon that he came to a stand still all at once, and while the deceased was in the act of turning his face round, the prisoner struck him right and left on the head, and knocked him down; he hit him on both sides of the head—I cannot positively say whether he struck him on the face—after knocking</p>

               <p>him down he fell upon him—I laid hold of him to pull him off, and while I was pulling him away he kicked him, I think, in the chest, but I would not be certain where—when Gampton fell, he fell backwards—I think his head struck the ground—the blows were severe ones—while I had hold of the prisoner he attempted to strike me—I let him go, and he ran away—Gampton got up himself—he staggered as if he was in liquor—we both followed the prisoner, and saw him taken into custody by inspector Bolas—I did not know the prisoner before—I saw Gampton next morning, at the Southwark police court—he appeared very much agitated and in very great pain—he complained to me of pain in the head and face—I heard the prisoner say before the Magistrate that he was sorry for what had occurred, and he was tipsy—I saw Gampton twice afterwards before he left duty; he still complained of pain in the head and general weakness.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I am medical inspector of the Customs. I knew the deceased very well for nearly seven years—I had ample opportunity of forming an opinion as to the state of his health—his general health was good; he came to me in the morning of 29th May last—I examined his head—above and behind the left ear there were faint marks of ecchymosis, in the last stage; I mean discoloration by the effusion of blood; I observed nothing else—he complained of intense pain on that side of the head—he had a faltering gait, and his vision was slightly impaired—I concluded that he was labouring under pressure on the brain, and I inferred that it was from violence from the discoloration: there had been a blow or violence of some kind—I ordered him home immediately, to be kept quiet in a dark room, and I saw him again in the evening—he was then in bed—I continued to attend him until 1st July—on commencing my attendance upon him I immediately put him under a course of treatment, under which he seemed, for some time, to recover—the treatment was directed to the pressure on the brain—he seemed to improve considerably for about a week—he was kept perfectly quiet in a dark room—about 11th or 12th June the symptoms turned, the legs became again very tremulous, his speech faltered, and his reason began to be affected—he gradually grew worse after that; his reason became gradually more impaired, the symptoms of paralysis or palsy increased, the urine and other dejections were occasionally passed in bed, and he became</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he in a very excitable condition on 29th May, When you saw him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Rather so, not particularly; he had the excitement of irritative fever from the compression, none beyond that—I attributed it to pressure on the brain at that time—I applied no surgical means to relieve that—an injury to the spinal marrow would not produce the same effects; it would produce a different class of symptoms; it would not affect the nerves of the brain, it would produce paralysis of the limbs—it might secondarily affect the brain sympathetically—the discoloration was the only outward symptom; that might have resulted from any force applied to the surface—I did not think it desirable to bleed him—he was not very bright when be first came to me; that is to say, he answered hesitatingly, and his memory seemed to be deficient—it was about 11th or 12th June that he began to get incoherent—he was not of a delicate habit of body, he was a man of good frame; his general health was good up to 11th April—he had occasionally a cold or diarrhoea, and things incident to most men—I was not then aware that he had received a gun-shot wound some years before—I am now aware of it; I was not present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination.</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident medical officer of St. Luke's Hospital. I saw the deceased there on 1st July—he had delusions both of sight and hearing, and he had a reeling, faltering gait, like a drunken man—his speech was hesitating, a good deal affected, and his manner was nervous and agitated—he was evidently suffering from pressure on the brain, or it might hare been <hi rend="italic">disintegration</hi> of the brain, some morbid alteration of structure—I examined him every day—I examined his head, I think, the morning after he came in—I observed a little thickening under the scalp, which was the remaining evidence of a bruise—I put him under a course of treatment generally; to relieve the symptoms of the head—he gradually improved after the first few days up to the commencement of Aug., when we considered him well—he was to have been discharged about the 19th of that month—after the 8th a change took place, he gradually became more dull—he did not seem to be very joyful at the idea of going out, and then symptoms of pressure on the brain again gradually appeared; he got worse—he was treated for it unsuccessfully, and he died on 17th Aug.—I afterwards made an examination of his head and body—there was nothing material the matter with the body—on removing the scalp I found a shot flattened on the frontal bone, just over the right eye; it was about one-eighth of an inch in diameter, or rather more, as it was flattened—it did not penetrate the skull—I removed the skull cap, and on opening the dura mater I discovered a large clot of blood in the arachnoid membrane, the next membrane to the dura mater—the arachnoid is a double membrane, and the clot was between the two layers of the arachnoid; it occupied almost the whole of the surface of the left hemisphere of the brain—the pressure on the brain from that would be very great indeed—I think that pressure was quite sufficient to account for the symptoms I observed—that clot of blood had arisen from the rupture of a vessel of the brain—I have no doubt at all about it—it must have been caused by a blow of some kind; a blow on any part of the head sufficiently violent would do it—I could not form an opinion as to the exact time at which that clot had been formed, but it must have been some time, because it was partially invested in a false membrane; it occupied the whole of the left side of the head, some part of it was under the mark—in the <hi rend="italic">pons varolii</hi> I found another</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185309190101"></xptr>
               <p>clot of blood; that is at the base of the brain—that was also an old one in the process of absorption—it was about the centre of the middle of the base of the brain—my opinion is that was caused by the same violence that caused the other—they were simultaneous—that would no doubt affect the gait; the latter perhaps more particularly, as that part is supposed to preside over the motion of the body.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the shot anything to do with the cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing on earth; or with the appearances I observed in the head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If I understand you rightly, when first you saw him all you could say was that some morbid action had set in in the brain; you could not tell whether it was a morbid disease, or the result of violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> it was not easy to say at that time whether it was the result of disintegration or not—I did not find any vessel of the brain ruptured, but that might have escaped me—vessels of the brain may be ruptured by great excitement without any actual violence, if the vessels are diseased—emotion would hardly rupture a healthy vessel; strong emotion, or excitement, might do so. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the large clot of blood covered the surface of the membrane; supposing that clot of blood had been the result of a blow, do you think a man could attend to his business, labouring under that for five or six weeks afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, yes, probably be might; perhaps not with so much effusion as he had when he died, but with a great amount of effusion—the amount I found killed him—I am hardly able to say whether, he could have continued attending to his business with that amount of effusion, he might; the brain bears a great deal of equal pressure; no morbid action bad been set up in the brain, nothing organic—I have no doubt the effusion was in some measure absorbed or relieved in the first instance, and there was subsequently an increased effusion, probably from the same cause; it might have been from some other cause—he had no other blow while with me—he was not subject to violent fits—I attended him continually up to the time of his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What length of time would account for the false membrane? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say such a membrane might have been formed in a couple of months perhaps, or three months, they vary very much—from finding no rupture, I concluded that the effusion was from a very small vessel; it very often happens that you cannot find the aperture—if a large vessel had been ruptured the pressure on the brain would have been more sudden, and would have destroyed life sooner—finding no rupture, I should conclude that it was slowly progressing; under those circumstances a man would be more likely to be able to go about his business, and we should have the better chance of relieving it; it might afterwards go on increasing.</p>

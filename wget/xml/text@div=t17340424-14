            . Last Tuesday Night, I made fast the Window-shutters of Mr. Bothomly's House - 'tis a Corner House in <placeName id="t17340424-14-crimeloc65">King-street in St. Ann's Westminster</placeName>

I call'd out, Who's there? But Nobody answer'd - At 3 o' Clock the Watchman came by. I call'd to him, and bid him see if the Window-shutters next King-street were shut - He said, Yes, but the Bar was down, and the Pin was in the Window. Then lighting a Candle, I found the Shutters close, but the Sash within was thrown up. We searched in the Wash-house below Stairs, and looking up the Chimney, there stood the Prisoner upon a Wooden-perch. Here's the Thief, says I, stay Watchman and I'll call more help. So I got 2 more Watchmen, and carried the Prisoner to the Watch-house, where this Window-Curtain was found upon him - He had liv'd a <rs id="t17340424-14-deflabel66" type="occupation">Servant</rs>

He had seven Shillings a Week and his Diet, as I have now. He said he got in, to get some Victuals, and took the Curtain to wrap it in. I told him, he knew my Master kept no Victuals in the House, but order'd all to be given away - I had key'd the Pin of the Window my self, when I went to Bed; but the Spring of the Key was broke, so that in turning the Pin round, the Key dropt out.</p>
               <p>- Denton, Watchman. Mr. Westridge call'd me, to see if the Window was fast; I told him the Bar was down. He let me in. I saw the Sash was quite up. In the Wash-house Chimney, we found the Prisoner with his Shoes down at the Heels. He said, he was a Fool for coming there.</p>

            . I was call'd at 3, and found the Prisoner standing on a Bar 5 or 6 Foot up the Chimney. He cry'd out, and desired we'd let him come down; and then he said he'd tell us how he came there. So when he was got down he told us, he was a Fool and only came to get some Victuals.</p>

            , Beadle. At past 3 the Prisoner was brought to the Watch-house all over Soot. I search'd him, and found upon him this Curtain, a Cabbage-net. 4 Redherring's, a Huswife and a Thimble.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I own I was in the House, but the Sash was lifted up before.</p>
               <p>Juryman. Does the Pin go thro' the Shutter?</p>
               <p>Westridge. No; the Shutters are fastned with a Bar, and the Pin goes thro' the Bar and Jamb of the Window. So that he could put the Pin in the hole, and then go in, and pull the Shutters close after him.</p>

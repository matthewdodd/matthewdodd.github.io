                  </hi>. I am a labourer on the Spirit Quay of the London Docks. On the 18th of July I was at the Dock where some Indian rubber was left under my charge—I have heard the prisoner had been a labourer in the Docks—he came there on the 18th—these three pieces of rubber fell off a cask—the prisoner came and stood against the door—I saw him take these three pieces of rubber in his arms, and I gave information of it.</p>

            , for 56 l. Rent, due to Mr. Huggins, October 23d, 1 Bedstead with Sacking Bottom, &amp;c. I gave Mr. Bambridge a particular Account of the Value, in order for his disposing of them, the 2d Inventory consisted of the Plate, China, Rings, &amp;c. with precious Stones and wearing Apparel, which was all made up, Mr. Bambridge being told by me, that it was not usual to Distrain necessary wearing Apparel, he said, set down such and such things sufficient to do so: I brought them in at first 30 l. Mr. Bambridge thought that too much, alledging there was Charges attending the Appraisement, and so I brought it in at 27 l. 16 s. 9 d. It is customary to have two Appraisors, but there was none but my self - after the Appraisement, I saw Mr. Bambridge put some of the things in his Pocket, as the Silver Tea Spoons, Rings, and small things, the rest, wearing Apparel, &amp;c. into a Portmantua; there was a Brush found which is used for cleaning of Diamonds, upon which Mr. Bambridge said he believ'd there must be Diamonds, after that, looking every where, found the Rings, Mrs. Barkley look'd very Chagrin during this Rifling, and was turn'd on the Common-Side, without a Bed to lie on, and had not a Bed all the time of my Imprisonment, she was afterwards very much out of Order, talked wildly, would assert that the Lord Harcourt was not Dead, but would punish such Rogues as robb'd her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bambridge, desir'd this Evidence to tell the Court if he did not order him to put every thing down, who answer'd, he did, but added, that if he had had Money, he would have given 30 l. for the Goods himself, because he knew them to be worth so much, that he lower'd the price to 27 l. at Bambridges's desire; being ask'd what Conversation he heard at that time, he answer'd, Mr. Bambridge told Mrs. Berkley, that it was a Shame she should have there and not pay her Rent, for she had good comings In, Mrs. Berkley said, the House was the King's, and if the King sent her there she would pay no Rent; Turner said, that he had made several Distresses before, with Pindar, the Chamberlain, who Mr. Bambridge said was indicted that he might not be an Evidence for him, but was told that he was a Principal concern'd.</p>
               <p>This Evidence being ask'd what Trade Pindar was of, he answer'd a Distiller, and that there was one they call'd Constable at both Seizures, but Pindar knew nothing of the Value of Household Goods.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Bambridge desir'd this Evidence might be ask'd if he did not propose to Barkley to send to some Friend to pay her Rent, and save her Goods, who answer'd, he did.</p>

               <p>I was a Prisoner in the Fleet on the Common Side, and saw the prisoner at the Bar at Mrs. Barkelys Door, about 6 o'Clock at Night, the latter end of October, I believe it might be the 27th. (there was 2 Padlocks on the Door, Pindar had the Key of one, and Mrs. Barkely the Key of the other; Barns, by order, fetched a Hammer to break it off; Bambridge gave orders to Pindar to unlock the Door. There was Turner, Barns, Bambridge, my self, Pindar, and a Constable, as they called him, (he had a short Staff) but I never saw him before, nor since. Mrs. Barkley was fetched up from the Common Side to open the Door, but she refusing it, they broke her Door open with a Poker, (Mrs. Barkley said it was a Robbery, and hoped Bambridge would be brought to Justice for it) when they got in, they took an Account of a few Goods when required Mrs. Barkley to open her Boxes (2 of which were locked, the other nailed) Bambridge broke them open himself, and some of the Goods were taken out by Mr. Turner, as Appraiser, and the other part by Bambridge: When the Goods were Appraised, they were all carried away by order of Mr. Bambridge; I carried the Bed into the Lumber Room, and afterwards carried it to Dorset-Stairs, to go to Wandsworth - the Rings, Bambridge put into his Pocket, for fear they should be lost in the Boxes, the wearing Apparel, &amp;c. Was put up into a Portmantua, Mrs. Barkely was by, and Scolded all the while, and said it was a Robbery, (being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172912030020"></xptr> asked what he see Bambridge put in his Pocket) said, 2 Gold Seals, an Emrald, some Stones, a Garnet, 2 Gold Rings, one a Stone Ring, but never saw any of them afterwards; Bambridge found a little Brush, and said, he believed there must be Diamonds, at first he said the Goods were going to a Sale, and bid me go to the Wandsworth Waterman, the Easy-chair was left with Mr. Turner to clean, and then I carried it to Wills Coffee-House: (Mr. Bambridge desired that this Evidence might be asked, if there was no talk about Rent) he said there was; (desired be might be asked when the Goods were carried out) answered, about 6 Days after they had been in the Lumber Room, but they were locked up, and Bambridge kept the Key, asked if he did not send the Goods out of the Prison publickly, said, he did, asked if Mrs. Barkley was not the Room all the while, answer'd, I am not positive, for after Mrs. Barkley's Bed was carried out, you sent me to fetch a nasty Bed that Mrs. Barkley would not lye upon, there were better in the Room, which you sent away afterwards.</p>

Mr. Bambridge asked, if the Rings, &amp;c. were not shown in the Coffee-Room afterwards, Mr. Savage said, they were? but added that it was in a private Room, and none but his own Company there.</p>

             of Greek-street for soda water. The prisoner was the person who received the orders of my man.</p>
               <p>Q. In the Spring of this year did he happen to call upon you for any sum of money for Mr. Johnson for soda water - A. Yes, two pounds sixteen shillings; I think he first applied about February; I told him I believed it was paid; he assured me upon his honor it was not. I told him the person that conducted my business had delivered up all the receipts; he assured me it was not discharged, and I had no reason to doubt his integrity; I told him if he would call again in a few days I should be able to meet with the person who had conducted my business; I should be able to ask him more fully upon the subject; upon that he went away. In about a week he came again; he brought me a letter purporting to be writ by Mr. Johnson; stating that he requested immediate payment of the money, or he should prosecute him, and discharge him from his situation; I then told him to make my best respectful compliments to Mr. Johnson, if in the course of three days I did not see this man that carried on that part of my business, I would then pay it.</p>
               <p>COURT. What was the name of the man who attended your business. - A.

            . I think the defendant said he would deliver that message to Mr. Johnson, but he was that kind of positive character it would be of no use; he left me, and returned in the afternoon of the same day, he then presented me a summons, and said Mr. Johnson's compliments, he believed that was the best way of settling this; I did not attend the summons; one of the commissioners sent their compliments, and fixed another day, on which my son attended; I paid the defendant on the 17th of March; he said he had positive instructions from Mr. Johnson unless I paid he should take out an execution. This is the receipt.</p>

Mr. Hitchen, that lives by the Red-house, happened to come out; upon that they ran away. I flew to him for protection. I went next morning to Mr. Hitchen, to know if he knew either of the men; he said, he believed he should know them again if he saw them; whilst I was in his shop, the two prisoners went by; he said he believed them to be the men. My father and I went out directly; I laid hold of Williams, and said, you villain, what have you done with my hat and wig you robbed me of last night? He said, he did not rob me of my hat and wig. I said, I insist upon carrying you before a magistrate; then he said, my comrade has it upon his head. (This is my hat, producing it.)</p>

            . On Tuesday the 31st of July, I was going from my house to the Red-house. Opposite the Red-house, I heard the most bitter imprecations imaginable. I staid some time upon the foot pavement; when I moved forwards, they disengaged themselves from him, and he ran to me, and said he was robbed; I asked him of what; he said, of his hat and wig, by these two people. I described the two prisoners at the bar, as to their size and dress; the beadle want in pursuit of them, but could not find them. I told him I could he positive to the people, when I saw them again; whilst I was describing them to the prosecutor and his father, the two prisoners came by; I said them are the two lads that robbed you last night; they followed, and took them, and brought them to my house. I told them I was sorry for them, I was afraid they would be hanged; one of them said, he did not value being hanged of a farthing.</p>

               <p>I work in King's-head court, at Mr. Wright's, a watch-case maker. I came home on Tuesday night to my mother's, at Tower-hill. My mother sent me over the water; I staid to supper; on going down Thames-street, I walked in the cart way, it was very dark; I kicked something before I pick'd it up, and it was this hat. I told my mother I found it; she said, a find is no robbery, nobody can hurt you for it. My mother longed for some fish; I went to Billingsgate to see if my cousin had bought her some. I was not afraid; I had the hat upon my head; the man stopt me, and said, he believed the hat was his; I said I found it.</p>

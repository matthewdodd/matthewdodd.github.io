            . I live near to Jacobs. On Tuesday last, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner (whom I knew before) near the shop - I saw him go into Jacobs' shop, and come out with a roll of cloth - he went up Pell-street with it. I and my brother pursued; he did not run - he dropped it in Pell-street - we had not called out; he was pursued and brought back by a young lad - my brother was nearer to him than I was. I am sure I saw him with it.</p>

            . In consequence of what my brother said I pursued the prisoner into Pell-street, where I saw him walking with the cloth over his shoulder. I walked sharply after him, but not so fast as him - he turned round twice, and looked very hard at me. I began to run after him then, and he ran - I called Stop thief! three or four times - he dropped the cloth, and continued running. I picked the cloth up - he was stopped by two or three persons, and got away again; a boy came down the street with a basket of coals, which he threw over him, and he fell down. I secured and took him back to Jacobs' shop, without loosing sight of him.</p>

            . I am a headborough. Mr. Nathan gave the prisoner into my charge, with the cloth, which I produce.</p>
               <p>GABRIEL JACOBS. I know this cloth by two holes in it - in consequence of this hole, I cut it at the head end - it measures 131/2 yards, and cost me 22s. 6d. a yard, and is worth that. I have often seen the prisoner bring patterns to match at my shop - my shop is part of the dwelling-house.</p>

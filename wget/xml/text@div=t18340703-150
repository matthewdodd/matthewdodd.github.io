            . I am a conveyancer, living in Blomfield-street - the prisoner was my clerk about nine or ten months, and left me on the 12th of May - I sent him that evening to collect some rents at the west end of the town - he did not return - he had given me no notice - I saw him again about the 3rd of June, at the station-house - I had not seen him in the interval - I never gave him that cheque for any purpose - I know nothing of it - I never saw it before the transaction in question - I do not know William Harrison - the name of Temple on the back is not my handwriting, it is very little like mine - I know the prisoner's handwriting, and believe the whole of the cheque to be his handwriting - I cannot say whether the name on the back is written by him, but I rather think by the general character of the writing that it is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say you believe the whole of that writing to be his? A. Yes, I do - the whole, except the banker's name across - that certainly is not his - I have had no treaty with the prisoner about settling this matter - I swear that I never asked him if he would work it out - he submitted to me that he would do it - I said that was out of the question - I never said if he would work it out I would pay the money to the prosecutor - he submitted to me that he would work out the money which he had received, and not accounted for - I said that was out of the question, on account of the amount - the prisoner's father lives in Castle-street, Holborn - the prisoner was taken into custody on the 3d of June - I have been to his father's house since that, about a fortnight ago - I think only once, since the 3d of June - I was there before, making inquiry about him - my object in going there was to tell the father I was very much surprised at his having recommended his son to me, with a knowledge, that in an office he had been in before mine, he had abstracted money from his employers - I saw nobody but the father - I never talked to him about settling it - nor ever asked him to settle it - I swear that most solemnly - my profession leads me to advance money, and issue advertisements for the loan of money - I am a money lender, and a certificated conveyancer.</p>

            . I live in Mile-end-road, and am clerk to Mr. Temple. I remember the prisoner being his clerk also - (looking at the cheque) I know the prisoner's handwriting - I believe this cheque to be his handwriting, except the words "Smith, Payne, and Co." across, and "No account" in the corner - I am certain it is his handwriting - I believe the endorsement, "Temple," to be his handwriting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are Mr. Temple's brother-in-law? Is there any similarity between the endorsement and the body of the cheque? A. The T is formed like the T the prisoner wrote at the office - there is not any very great similarity except that.</p>

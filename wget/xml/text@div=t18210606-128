            , of Church-street, Spitalfields. On the 23d of May, he sent me to receive 7 l. 18 s. 6 d., from Mr. Wilcox - I received it, and was returning home, about eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner with my fellow apprentice, and two more boys - Smith, my fellow apprentice, called me over, and asked if I had got the money, I said, Yes; but I was paid all in gold - he asked what gold, I said, seven guineas and a half; he asked me to let him see a guinea, for he never saw one - I gave it to him, and he asked the prisoner to lend him a pin, to match with it, to see if it was gold - he gave him the pin, and asked him to let him see the guinea, he snatched it out of Smith's hands, with the pin, and ran away towards Whitechapel; he brought it back, after running about eighteen yards, and asked the other lads if they would go to regulars - he did not produce the guinea, they said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, Yes" and all three ran away - I was going after them, and Smith stopped me, and said, he was sure they would bring it back; I waited half an hour, and they did not, I have never seen it since - I knew him before.</p>

               <p>"I thought you was going to keep it, you are welcome;" I ran a little way, and dropped it in a puddle, and could not find it.</p>

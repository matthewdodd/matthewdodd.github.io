                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Walters, a gas inspectter, and live at 17, Bloomfield Street, Dalston—about 11.30 of 11.45 p.m. on 13th August, when I was close to my home, returning from a short walk, the prisoner was standing opposite the Fox public-house at the corner of the street—he followed me, and three doors from my own he said, "Is this Bloomfield Street or East?"—I said, "This is South Bloomfield Street, that is East," and pointing to it—he said, "Give me your Money"—I said "I have no money"—he said, "I'll murder yon, I'll murder you"—I said, "Oh, indeed"—he put his fingers in the neck of my jacket, stole my jet locket, and struck me a violent blow on the side of my head with his fist—the blow knocked me down—he ran away—I was sensible enough to get up—I ran after him—I next saw a policeman capture him—I did not see any other man—I am sure the prisoner is the man that knocked me down and that the policeman captured—I missed the locket directly he put his fingers to my throat—it was safe before I saw the prisoner—I have not seen it since—I suffered from the blow very severely—three bones were hurt, but not broken.</p>

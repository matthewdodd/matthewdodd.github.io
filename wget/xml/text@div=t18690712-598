The document itself represents the payment—if there is a commission paid to the under-taker, the person receiving the money for the company ought to get the undertaker to sign the counterfoil—all the particulars required ought to be filled up properly—there is what is called a fair order-book, which ought to be nearly a transcript of the counterfoils and the rough-order book, not entirely—it contains all the items of money paid—every transaction appearing in the rough order-book ought to appear also in the fair orders book, with the corresponding number taken from the rough order-book—the numbers ought to run on consecutively—there is also a book called a register of burials—that is in Court—it was the prisoner's duty to fill up all the columns in that register—the first number on the receipt refers ti the number in the register, not the number of the grave—then there is the date, name, sex, age, late abode, where buried, name of officiating minister, date of certificate of death, name and district of registrar, and name of the undertaker—that register would be kept by the prisoner—if the prisoner received money he ought to hand it over to Carter—it was Carter's duty to keep a cash-book, and to enter in that the money he received—Carter used to account to me every week—it was my practice to examine his cash-book with the rough order-book, and also with the fair order-book, and see that they corresponded—I did that regularly every week up to the time when he absconded—I found that all the money which was entered as received in the rough order-book and in the fair order-book was properly accounted for in the cash-book—sonic time early in April last, I, with my partner, Mr. Parker, examined the books—on the following day I went to the office—I found that Carter was not there—I have seen nothing of him since—I gave directions that same day to have him apprehended—in consequence of Carter not being at the office, I made a search in the office where Carter and the prisoner used to sit—that was either the same day or the subsequent</p>

               <p>day—I found this cover, which I have no doubt is the cover of one of the rough order-books—I also found this book at the bottom of a deep long drawer, covered with some old papers—some of the entries on these counterfoils are in the prisoner's handwriting, and some in Carter's—there are no consecutive numbers, or any numbers at all—none of the moneys entered there as received have been accounted for to me, nor are any of them entered in the fair order-book—but all the par<lb></lb>ticulars of them are entered in the register of burials in the prisoner's handwriting—I found a number of bundles of counterfoils, which I produce—there are about 750 or 800; some of them go up to the time of the prisoner's absconding—it is quite evident that they have been torn out of a book—about half of these are in the prisoner's handwriting, and about half of them in Carter's—this smaller bundle refers to last year, from April to April, our official year—there are about 150 of these—about half of them are in the prisoner's writing, and about half in Carter's—they are not entered in the fair order-book, but they are entered in the register of burials, in the prisoner's handwriting—none of the money referred to by these counterfoils has been accounted for to me—it would be necessary to preserve these counterfoils in case a grave should be required to be re-opened for a new interment—certain charges are regulated by the depth of the grave, and it would be necessary to refer to the last interment, with a view to ascertain that—that would not appear in the register of burials—unless these counterfoils had been kept neither Carter or the prisoner could have given the necessary information—when I found his book and papers I spoke to the prisoner on the subject—he was with me when I was making the search—he was standing by my side when I discovered all these bundles of counterfoils—I then took him into my private room, and asked him how he accounted for those—I pointed out to him that they were party in his handwriting and partly in Carter's, and that no such documents ought to be in existence at the office—he could give no account of them—I then said, "I will examine some of these and ascertain if they are in the register of burials"—I referred to several names which I had previously in<lb></lb>vestigated, and requested him to find out from the rough order-book where those names were entered—he referred to the book, and could find none—I then said, "How do you account for this?"—he hesitated a little at first, and then said, "I don't know; I don't know how it could be; they must have been torn out of the book"—I said that was impossible, because the book would show it immediately, the orders all being numbered consecu<lb></lb>tively, and in addition to that, any person who looked at the book could see nothing had been torn out of it—I asked where he obtained the materials to fill up the particulars—he said he obtained them from the certificate of the registrar of deaths of the district—I said, in reply, "That is impossible, because there are several particulars in them that you cannot find from the registrar's certificate"—he made no reply to that; he could give no expla<lb></lb>nation of it—it is a fact that the certificate of death does not contain the necessary materials to enter upon the register of burials—he could only get them from these counterfoils—this counterfoil of 9th October, relating to Mary Seller, for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., is in the prisoner's writing—Carter's initials are not to that; it is not in the fair order book, but it is in the register of burials—this counterfoil relating to Rebecca Geldart, for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., is in the prisoner's writing; that is not in the fair order-book, but is in the register of burials—this counterfoil relates to Percival K.

Barber, is also in the prisoner's writing, and is in the register, but not in the fair order-book—on 31st March I find a receipt for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for Elizabeth Croxton, on 1st April—that is in the prisoner's writing—that is not in the fair order-book, but is in the register of burials—I find a counterfoil of that in this book, which I found covered over with papers—it is not torn out of the book, the book contains recent dates—the counterfoil is in Carter's writing—here is a receipt of Fortunatus E. <hi rend="italic">Anderson</hi>, that is a mistake for "Andrews," dated 1st April, in the prisoner's writing—I find a counterfoil of that in this book, in Carter's writing—that is in the register but not in the fair order-book—this receipt for Hephribah Elmers, of 3rd April, is in the prisoner's writing, that is not in the fair order-book, but is in the register of burials—certificates of death have to be given before a burial can take place; they are sent up to any office; these are two of them relating to Croxton and Elmers—they do not contain all the materials for entering up the register of burials, only a portion—I was not at all aware of the existence of this book until I found it underneath the papers in the office—there was a rough order-book of the same date, which was being used at the same time, which had been laid before me week by week—this is a book of which I knew nothing, and in which no numbers are entered—after this conversation with the prisoner he remained in the office for a short time either that day or the next; he then went out, under pretence of getting his lunch, and did not return—I applied for a warrant, and he surrendered himself about a week afterwards.</p>

BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the date of that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 6th February—Carter sat at the same desk with the prisoner, side by side—from time to time he would be absent at his dinner, and the prisoner alone receive the money—it was then the practice to have Carter's initials on the counterfoil—when. together the prisoner would fill up both the counterfoil and receipt, and Carter would take the money, there would then be no necessity for the ini<lb></lb>tialing—Carter was twenty-one years in the service; I had very great con<lb></lb>fidence in him, and also in the prisoner—I and Carter both lived at Tottenham; we were on friendly terms, not intimate; I did not very often see him except during hours of business—I came to town by omnibus, he came by train; some years ago I travelled with him by train, not lately—I have been out with him once or twice on shooting excursions—I don't know that Carter used the waste paper on those excursions; I never saw it—I have latterly complained to Carter of his absence from business, and told</p>

               <p>him unless some alteration was made I should bring it before the directors; I complained of his being negligent of his duty—I did not complain of his playing billiards—I was not aware of it at the time, I have heard of it since—I complained of his inattention to business, and being so long at his dinner, and being absent so many hours—the prisoner was occasionally absent from illness; his health was not very good, and his brother occasionally came to assist in his absence—I kept a cash-book between myself and Carter—I have it here—I frequently took sums from Carter on account, from day to day during the week; it was entered simply as cash on account—when Carter was absent, and the prisoner has taken money, I have occasionally taken it, and he has entered it in Carter's cash-book, and I have initialed it—I examined the cash received with the rough order-book every week, except when I have been out of town, then it has run on for two or three weeks—I also examined the cash-book with the fair order-book, not with the register of burials—the register of burials is absolutely correct as far as I have been able to discover; that is a book which the prisoner kept—these loose papers were found in a little drawer in old-fashioned desk, which I was never in the habit of going to—the prisoner did not open that drawer, he was standing by; he did not take out the papers, I took them out; I opened them and saw that some of them were in his writing—he did not take out the book, I found that—these counterfoils ought to have been in some rough order-book—they go back some four years, I think—I see some are printed in 1863 and 1864—I should judge from that they went back six years, unless they kept back one of the old books which had not been used—the orders might not go back so far as that, the heading is printed 1863—I have not referred to the dates, I can only go by the date at the top—it must have been an old-book—half of these 150 counterfoils, I should say, are in the prisoner's writing—a good many of them have Carter's initials on them—these have been examined by our book-binder—he did not point out that the counterfoils had been stripped out from the rough order-book—he said that one or two had been pasted in one of the books—he pointed out that there should be precisely the same number of counterfoils in each fold—he did not say that any were missing or removed—he said the book had been tampered with in some way—I did not understand him to say that some of the folds contained less than the proper number—from 1863 there was never any examination with the register of burials—it was in that way it was discovered—it was not Mr. Bontems who suggested that an examination should be made—the way in which it was discovered was this: I heard from one or two gentlemen that Carter had been very extravagant in his expenditure—that aroused my suspicion—one of the gentlemen said Carter had informed him that he had private means—I believed that was not the case—Mr. Higgs' matter was notorious at that time, and that induced me to make the investigation—it was not made at the suggestion of a large shareholder—I am under surety for the fulfilment of the duties of the office to the extent of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think very few of the shareholders have said that I ought to pay Carter's defi<lb></lb>ciences—I have heard it said, but a large majority of them take a very different view—I never suspected Carter of living extravagantly until I received that information—the shooting did not attract my attention at all all—I was very rarely out with him, and I saw no extravagance on those occasions—we only went into the marshes at Tottenham—there was no expense at all, except the powder and shot; not even the expense of a rail-way-ticket,</p>

               <p>we were on the spot—I have seen Carter making entries in the books when persons have come with orders—I don't remember that I ever saw him commence a new book—he had the control of all the books—orders were constantly given at the cemetery, and sent on to the office, every week—I went through the superintendent's accounts every week, and brought them up with me—there is a rough order-book kept at the cemetery, but of a somewhat different form, having two counterfoils instead of one; one is sent to the office and the other remains there—either Carter or the prisoner entered from the loose papers that came from the cemetery into the rough order-book at the office; sometimes one and sometimes the other—Carter generally entered them at the time, but if he happened to be a little in arrear he would count the number of orders, and leave a space for them—that would not make it impossible for a person paying at the office to get a receipt with a consecutive number—there was always a con<lb></lb>secutive number—I have not got any receipts here with consecutive num<lb></lb>bers on them, because these are all orders that have not been accounted for—I don't know that there never was a consecutive number; it would be the duty of Carter and the prisoner to enter the consecutive number—I have never been present when a receipt has been given without a consecu<lb></lb>tive number—orders were always given to Carter or the prisoner—I did not take orders—I can only tell you what their duty was—I can't say what they actually did—I think the conversation with the prisoner was about the 16th April, but I am not sure—he did 'not tell me that he did his work under Carter's direction—he told Mr. Lewis, the solicitor, so—he was present at the time—he said he had, sometimes written in the register of burials from the direction of Carter, that Carter sometimes dictated to him what to write in it—that was said in the same conversation I have referred to.</p>

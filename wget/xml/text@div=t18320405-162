                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18320405-162-defend1455 t18320405-162-deflabel984"></join>,) to tell him I had a machine that was out of repair - he called at my house, and saw the machine; I asked what he would repair it for - he said 12s.; I said I would give him 12s. - he said, "I should like to take it away, to do it at my own place;" I said if that was the case I should not have it done at all, because it wanted so little doing to it - I had no particular reason for that, except that I thought the repairs were so trifling it was not necessary to take it off the premises - he said then he would call and do it at my house; on the 19th of February, 1831, when I came home, I found the machine was gone - the prisoner had not, to my knowledge, called at my house from November till February; finding the machine gone I sent my young man to the prisoner's house the day after; I afterwards went to Barbican and found he was gone from there entirely, and no person could give any account of him - I did not find my machine; I made inquiry about him for ten or eleven months - I was sometimes till ten and eleven o'clock at night searching for him in all the parishes in London - I afterwards saw the name of "Heard" up in Long-lane, and laid a plan with a baker named Wincott; I was sent for to Wincott's house in November last year, and saw the prisoner; I asked what he had done with that machine which he stole from my house; he said he had got it at his house, and I might fetchlit if I liked, but he would not send it home; I had him taken to Marylebone office - the witness, Carney, was not there; the Magistrate said, "Let the case stand over, and you bring the machine back to Mr. Scott's," as he said he had got it; he undertook to produce it - the case was discharged afterwards; I afterwards found Carney, who had been in the prisoner's service; he enabled me to trace the machine, which I found at Mr. Wheeler's, in Oxford-street - I knew it the moment I saw it; this was not more than a fortnight ago - I have it here.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Had he ever done work for you before November, 1830? A. Never - I considered he was the man who had first made it, which induced me to go there to have it repaired; I now know he did not make it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Although the Magistrate adjourned the case for the prisoner to produce the machine, when he came up without it he was discharged? A. The Magistrate let it stand over to give him an opportunity to produce it; this was on Saturday night- it was adjourned till Monday; I attended then, but the prisoner never came - I did not know him before; his father had made the machine; I did not call at the prisoner's house, and ask if the machine was to be sent for, nor did I send any body about it, nor did he call on me - I never called and said he was to send for it, nor say I had not made up my mind whether I would have that repaired or have a new one.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the proceedings before a Magistrate was an action brought against you? A. I suppose three or four months; I was served with a copy of a writ, in November or December - I believe he has given notice of trial; I have pleaded to the action - I did not know where Carney was to be found at the time I went before the Magistrate - my wife is not here, nor my son, he is only a child; I had left my business in care of my wife when I was out; she keeps my books, and attends to what is going on - when I went to the prisoner's house, in February, he was gone; I saw no board nor bill on the house, nor any reference to Mr. Price's over the way- nobody could tell me where he was gone; he had taken all his things; I inquired at almost every machine-makers in the neighbourhood; when I found he had come to live in Long-lane I called at his house, but could not find him; I left an address for him to call at Wincott's, in Princes-street, Cavendish-square, on business - they sent for me when he came, and I had him, taken; I knew Wincott had ordered a machine of him, and he had brought it there that day; I took the Policeman, and he took him into custody - I knew nothing of a Policeman being there before, and refusing to take him - Wincott did not, in my presence, attempt to give him in charge for not leaving the premises with the new machine - the Magistrates did not desire it to be given up.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Chambers, the apprentice, is here; did you say on that occasion "You knew me Mr. Heard?" A. No, nor did he say, "Yes, Mr. Scott, I do - I have an old weighing machine of yours," nor that he hoped I was not offended at his not having repaired it; I did not say, "Now, old boy you are regularly done," nor any such words - I had him taken up as soon as I came into the house; (looking at a paper) this was not written by me - I believe it is Wincott's writing: I do not recollect whether he gave it to the prisoner in my presence - I did not see him write it; I was busy - I did not see it put into the prisoner's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the contents? A. I cannot say I know every word; it is within the last fortnight that I first spoke to Carney - I have given him no money, nor promised him any; I have not given him drink, nor kept him from work, nor made him any promise - I swear positively that the machine found is the one that was on my premises; I have my own mark on it, and could swear to it among one hundred and fifty - I have mended it and re-mended it.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe your son is about thirteen years old? A. Yes, he was about eleven years old when this happened.</p>

            . I am a journeyman machine-maker,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050068"></xptr>and occasionally work for the prisoner - I still work for him at times; there is part of my work now in his shop, and some of my tools; I was present when Mr. Scott came and talked about repairing a machine; I heard him tell him it was to be repaired at his own place, and on Saturday night, the 19th of February following, I went with the prisoner, and took a truck there to take the machine off the premises - Mr. Scott was not at home; I saw Mrs. Scott behind the counter - the prisoner said,"We have come for the weighing-machine;" she said she knew nothing about the machine, and that Scott was not in; Mr. Heard came outside the door to me, and said,"This machine is not to go;" I said, "It is a very hard case we are to drag this truck home now without it;" then Heard called me back, and said, "We will have the machine;" "Yes," (said I) "we will have it;" so we went down stairs - Mrs. Scott never gave any consent that we should have it; she said she knew nothing about its going off the premises, and as Mr. Scott was not there, she would not have it off; we got down the stone steps down to the baker's-place, and the machine was there - we got it up, and put it into the truck.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you told Mrs. Scott? A. I never saw her any more - we took it home to the shop, and after a few days there was another machine we had sold which had come to be repaired, and the man came kicking up a row about it; it was Harper who lived in Fox-court, Charterhouse-lane; "Well" (said the prisoner) "we will put Scott's machine in the place of this; we will fit it up, so that it will appear like Harper's, and we will take it to Long-lane;" I knew he had sold Harper's machine, and saw him receive the money, and took it down to Brook-street; I afterwards went with him to Harper's and delivered the machine - Harper said, "This board to the machine is not mine;" Heard said, "Why, yes, in repairing the machine the bolt split, but you have got a better one" - it was better than Harper's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember afterwards seeing Mr. Scott's machine at Wheeler's in Oxford-street? A. Yes - I knew it at once; I have known it ten years - I had made some alterations in it, and knew my own work; the prisoner sent to me after that, about the 4th of April, 1832, and said, "Now we have got a machine, that will pass off for Scott's, and won't you swear to it?" I said, "If I am put on my oath I will tell the truth; anything you like to take down in writing you may, but I won't swear to it if I am brought to the oath; as soon as I am put to my oath I will never swear to it;" because I knew where the machine was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what you were to do to the machine when it was to pass for Scott's? A. Yes, he said, "We can put some iron hoops on the board to make it pass;" I said, "That is playing away with it, and when we are put to our oaths it won't do;" he said, "Well, don't you go at all, I will get another man to swear to it" - the prisoner lived in Charles-street, Bridgewater-gardens at the time we brought the machine from Scott's; he lived in Barbican when Scott called about it - he did not tell Mrs. Scott he had changed his residence; it was not a quarter of a mile off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had a Mr. Price lived in the house the father occupied? A. He lives there now - he is a milkman; there was not a bill up at master's house till we removed to Long-lane; there was then one with a reference to Price; he had his name up in Long-lane, but not in Charles-street; he was there three-quarters of a year before there was a name put up; he carried on business there, and I worked for him - it was there I changed Scott's machine; Chambers, the apprentice, did not go with us to Scott's - I will swear that nobody went but master and me; he has given his name as having been, but on my oath he never went - I saw no boy at Scott's and heard nobody say, "Mother, it is all right, Mr. Heard is to have the machine home to repair," but Heard told me the boy said so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did he say so? A. The day he was at Guildhall, some time before Christmas - he said,"If you are put to it, and questioned about this, you always say you heard Mr. Scott's son say that the machine was to go;" I said, "Will there be an oath required?" he said, "No, there won't;" I said, "Well then, it is all right, but never bring me where I am sworn;" he said, "Any thing I tell you you may say, there will be no oath required" - I said, "Well, that is all right."</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Have you ever been in trouble yourself? A. Never; I was never before a Magistrate in Ireland - a young woman robbed me of 15s. last Session, and no bill was found against her; I never knew Mr. Scott had a son - master said there was an action against Mr. Scott, and he took me before somebody; (looking at a paper) a paper was read to me - I do not know what is here; I was not sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the Jury to understand that all this time you were lending yourself to all these falsehoods? A. Falsehoods! No; what I have stated here about the machine is real truth - I did not go before a Magistrate; I went before the Grand Jury on Monday week - I have seen Chambers, the apprentice, since that; I have been at his master's ten times since - I did not say I should not come to work again for any b - y master; nor that Scott had given me money, and would give me 5l. more, or that I had been with Scott all the week, and had formed a plan against master; it is all false - I do not know Aggus a street-keeper of Aldersgate; I have told nobody that Scott had given me money, and would give me as much more as I wanted.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At what time of day did you go to Scott's for the machine? A. The lamps were lighted, and when we got there, I think it was between five and six o'clock; (looking at a machine) this is the very machine- it is Mr. Scott's; this part ought to be five inches higher - we cut it off to bring it down to the same height as the one we had sold, and here is a piece of wood which we coloured the same as a cast-iron pillar, which is here.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. How many machines have you made? A. A good many; I cannot tell how many - I do not swear to this by the pattern; we did not make this one, but repaired it - we took Scott's machine to Harper one Saturday night; it was in March, last year.</p>

            . I live in Orchard-street, Westminster. I have a brother, living in Church-lane; the prisoner had a machine of mine, but my nephew contracted with him to repair it in my absence - the prisoner brought a machine home in Charterhouse-lane; it was about thirtesen months ago - I said, "Mr. Heard, these are not the boards that were on my machine;" he said he had a machine at home, and in taking my machine to pieces, he split the boards, and put these on instead; Carney was present- I suppose he had had my machine in his possession about six weeks; I had been to his house to demand it once, twice, or thrice, but could not get it - I could never see him, till he brought the machine to me; I took the machine he brought me home, and afterwards disposed of it to Mr. Wheeler, of Oxford-street - this is the very machine (looking at it.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Is it not the machine you originally had? A. It is not; I have never found my own machine - this is Mr. Scott's; not one particle of it is mine - but the boards were what I first found out to be wrong.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was any name on the machine which he had of yours? A. I believe the name of Nichols was on it.</p>
               <p>MR. SCOTT. The prisoner's father made my machine, and his name is now on it.</p>
               <p>(Prisoner's Defence (written.) I am a weighing-machine maker, now carrying on business in Long-lane, Smithfield; have lived all my life in the neighbourhood - I was applied to by Mr. Scott, the prosecutor, in February, 1830, while I resided in Barbican, to go to his house to look at the machine, which wanted repairing; I agreed with him about it, and was to send for it, and repair it when it suited me; I went with my apprentice, John Chambers, and my journeyman, George Carney, on the 19th of February, with a truck for the machine; Mr. Scott was not at home, and Mrs. Scott said she knew nothing about it, but her son said he did, and it was right that I should have it, as he heard his father agree with me about it; he then, with a light, accompanied me, my man, and apprentice, into the cellar - helped us with it, and helped us also to start the truck - shortly afterwards, I removed to Charles-street, Bridgewater-square, being prosecuted for not having my freedom of the City, and I put a bill up at Barbican, referring persons to a neighbour for my residence; it being down two or three streets - I remained these carrying on my business without any public show, until the half quarter between Michaelmas and Christmas, when I obtained a shop which I had long; been trying for on the privileged side of Long-lane; I then put up a board at my late residence, in Barbican, referring person to Long-lane - I kept the machine in a stable, with other lumbering, things, which I rented close by of a Mr. Field, and no application was made for it until after I had been taken before a Magistrate, at Malborought-street, for stealing it, who discharged me, and for which I brought an action, which is still pending - the action was commenced in December last, and I have been working in my shop, which is an open one, next the street, until I was taken into custody on the present indictment, which was only on Thursday last; I have not sent the machine home since the action for false imprisonment was commenced, under the advice of my solicitor.</p>

I went with master and Carney to Mr. Scott's house; it might be the latter end of February; on the begining of March - we went to No. 1, King-street, Portman-square; we saw Mrs. Scott, a young man, and a lad - I suppose the young man was a journeyman; master told Mrs. Scott he had come for the weighing machine to repair; she said she knew nothing about it, as Mr. Scott was out - the young lad said, "It is all right mother," for that he had heard master and his father agree about it;" they showed us a light down into the cellar, and helped us up with it - the lad showed the light, and the man helped us up with it; the young lad started the truck off for us - we brought the machine home, and pulled it to pieces; it could not be repaired on the prosecutor's premises - a forge fire would be required to mend it; I have been four years in the business - the iron work must all go through the fire before it could be repaired; it was put into the stable, some part, and some pieces were left about.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was it not repaired immediately? A. Master said Mr. Scott was not particular and there was something about a new one, and he did not know what to do with it; it was put in the loft over the stable - my master lived in Charles-street then; he had left Barbican about three weeks; the night before he left I put up a bill referring persons to Mr. Price opposite, and cards were left there with the address - master left Barbican because the City prosecuted him for not being free; he remained in Charles street six or seven months, and carried on business there - it is about fifty yards from Barbican; he then moved to Long-lane, and attended to business regularly - in November last I remember a person coming to master's house for a machine; I saw Wincott, and I saw Mr. Scott; I know him now by sight - he called on the 4th of November, and asked if master was at home; I said No - he said"Give me a piece of chalk, I will write down my direction, for I want a new machine;" he wrote down,"Wincott, 7, Princes-street, Cavendish-square," and said;"Tell him to come there" - master made a new machine I and master went with it, on the 18th of November, to No. 7, Princes-street, Cavendish-square, to Wincott's; Wincott sent a little girl out of the parlour, to tell us to take it down into the cellar - master said, "I should like to see Mr. Wincott before I go into the cellar;" Wincott put his head out of the parlour, and Mr. Scott was with him-Scott said, "You know me, Mr. Heard;" "Yes, (said he) I have got an old weighing-machine of yours - I hope you are not offended at my keeping it so long;" Scott said, "Now old boy, you are regularly done" - master said, "Am I, how?" he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bill, gave it to Mr. Wincott, and said, "You are the man who ordered the machine, and I look to you for the money;" Wincott then said he would see master - (using some very bad expressions); master said he would take away the machine, if Wincott could not pay for it - Scott said, "Send your man for a Policeman, Wincott," and they used most dreadful expressions, and said they would lock him up; while Wincott's man was gone for the Policeman, Scott said; "I will go and fetch a Policeman myself," and used most dreadful expressions - while he was gone Wincott's man came with one; master was locked up in the shop - the Policeman was obliged to come in at the private door; Wincott told him to take charge of that man - the Policeman asked what for; Wincott said, "For committing felony;" master told him what it was about;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050070"></xptr>the Policeman said, "I will take the weighing-machine and Mr. Heard to the station, if you please;" Wincott would not allow that; while they were in conversation Mr. Scott came in with a Policeman, and took master in charge; the Policeman said, "Our inspector has sent for you, and you must go" and took master to the station-house I suppose; the machine was standing in the shop - master has never got it back; I went before the Magistrate, and after that went with master to Wincott's house, to fetch the machine or money; I saw Wincott, Scott, and many more - Wincott said, if he dare to put his foot over the threshold of the door, he would knock his *** out; master told me to fetch a Policeman - I got one; master told him he had his property - the Policeman said he could not interfere, and then master came away; master never concealed himself, nor kept out of the way - I worked for him constantly: he brought an action against Scott; Carney went before a attorney with me, to give an account of the transaction; he went into the room as I came out - I gave the same account there as I have now; (looking at a paper) I saw this at Wincott's house, after we came back from the Magistrate's; Wincott wrote it, in the presence of Scott and two or three more; Wincott offered it to master, to sign; master said he would take it and consider of it - Scott looked over Wincott while he was writing it, and when he had written it, he said that would do; I know it to be the same paper - I met Carney in Cow-cross last Friday, just;" as he came out of his lodging; he said, "Halloo, Jack;" I then stopped, and he said, "I will not come to work for my (using the most dreadful expressions) master any more"- I said, "Why not, there is work waiting for you;" (he had left seven or eight days) - he said he had got money at Mr. Scott's, and did not want to come to work; that he had 5s. on Monday, and had been getting drunk almost every day; he was half drunk that morning; he said, "If I tell you any thing, don't you tell master;" I said I would not  - he said that he and Mr. Scott had formed a plan to go where one of master's machines were, where he had sold or repaired one, and to swear that was Mr. Scott's machine, and Mr. Scott would give him money for it; he doubled his fist, and said, "Don't you tell master" - master never told me to tell a falsehood about a machine; some part of Scott's machine is at home now, and some part is over the way; it has never been out of master's possession.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then that is not Scott's machine which has been produced? A. No; there is no name on the one we have at home - I do not know what name is on the one in Court.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did I understand you to say your master was busy, and it was thrown on one side? A. Yes, as he did not know whether Scott would have a new one; I am certain the part of the machine at home, and what is over the way, are parts of that we brought from Scott's.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you take sufficient notice of the machine you took away from Scott's, as to know it again? A. Yes, I helped to pull it to pieces - I noticed all the boards of it; there was no name on it, either printed or engraved; I am quite certain the machine brought from Scott's had no name on it - the name of Heard was not on it unless it was put on in writing, and got rubbed off - it was never cast on; there was no name at all on it: I recollect a machine going to Harperls; I cannot say whether there was a name on that - I will swear Harper's own machine was sent back to him; it went through the forge fire, and the pins were put to rights - the steels all thoroughly repaired, and it was put together again; another set of top boards were put to it - I do not know why, but I saw master put another board to it; some part of the old board was burnt - they were so shockingly split they were not worth putting on again; Harper had sent for his machine two or three times - he was not obliged to threaten about it; he was very good friends with master.</p>

               <p>Q. Could the name of your master's father be printed or engraved on Harper's machine, without your noticing it? A. I cannot take on myself to swear whether it was or not; master told me Mr. Scott had authorized him to take the machine home to his house - I did not see Scott when he called about it; I saw no chisel marks on Harper's machine - Mrs. Scott did not desire the machine should not be taken off the premises; I think I should know the man I saw there - he was present when Mrs. Scott spoke, and heard the little boy tell his mother it was all right, I am sure of that; the boy was fifteen or sixteen years old, I cannot say exactly - he might be more; he was somewhere about my size - he might be shorter; I am eighteen years old; (looking at

            ) I do not think that is the man who was there; I will not swear he is not- he has not the same dress - the man had a baker's dress on; there was only one man present - Carney worked for master a good deal, and was very much in his confidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not strike you as something very odd that for eleven months Mr. Scott never came to get his machine, nor a new one? A. I heard master say he had called on Mr. Scott, to know what was to be done, but I was at work, and did not take notice of it - I sometimes hear master say, "I am going so and so," or that he has been so and so; Carney has not worked for master since this day week - he has been in and out of the shop - master wanted him to come to work, but he would not; he said in the shop that he could get 5l.; that was in the patrol's presence - he was rather drunk at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did not Carney say he would tell a false oath for no one, but if put to his oath he would speak the truth? A. No, he never said such a thing; he said he had prosecuted some girl, and he would go and swear any thing, right or wrong - it was on a Saturday, in 1831, that I went to Scott's for the machine; I am sure it was 1831, and the latter end of February, or the beginning of March- master generally goes himself, and it wants two persons to pull the truck.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the little boy shorter or taller than you? A. Rather shorter, and of a ruddy complexion; I think he wore a pinafore - I do not know his age.</p>

            . I am an extra patrol in the ward of Aldersgate. I was going down Long-lane, and was called by the last witness, who said his master wanted to see me- I went, and found the prisoner and Carney in an altercation about some law-suit; the prisoner said to me, "I wish you would listen to what this boy says;" he asked him to come to work for him - Carney said No, he would not work any more; he did not want work - the prisoner said he had had 5s. given him by Mr. Harper; Carney answered, "I have had 5s., and can have 5l. if I want it;"<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050071"></xptr>he had been drinking, but was capable of knowing what he was saying - Heard's is a workshop quite open to the street; persons passing could see him in the shop; I have seen him there every night almost, for the last seven months.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Give us Carney's words? A. He said he would see him d - d first, he said he did not want work, for he had got money enough - the prisoner said,"He told me just now the party gave him 5s. last Monday;" he answered, "Yes, and I can have 5l.;" Mr. Scott's name was mentioned afterwards, but not at the time the money was spoken of; but the prisoner told me that there was an action pending, and Mr. Scott had gained this party over, and would not let him come to work - he said this in Carney's presence, after he mentioned the money; I did not take notice what reply Carney made - he might say, if he was put to his oath he would tell the truth, without my hearing it - he made no reply when it was said Scott had gained him over; when the prisoner told me the transaction, I turned round to Carney, and said, "If you have been examined by an attorney or Magistrate, what you have said is down in writing, and they will find you for perjury if you are in Ireland;" he swore, and said not one thousand people would find him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know he had been with an attorney, and his words taken down? A. The prisoner told me so, in his presence - it was my duty to go there when called by an inhabitant, I never spoke to Mr. Heard before in my life - I do not belong to that parish; I have not seen him since - he was taken into custody not five minutes after; Carney was the worse for drink - he was not drunk.</p>

            . I am a solicitor at the Lord Mayor's court-office. On the 3rd of September last, in consequence of instructions from the prisoner, I brought an action for false imprisonment, against Scott and Wincott - I have the proceedings as far as they have gone; there was a plea to the action, that the machine had been obtained by false pretences - I advised the prisoner as to whether he should keep the machine or send it home; I saw Carney about the latter end of November, that I should know what he could prove - his master was not present; he gave me an account of what he could swear - I have the paper which I took work for word from his mouth; I read it over to him - he said, "That is the truth, and that I will swear to;" I had told him to mind, and state nothing but the truth.</p>

            . I was at Mr. Scott's house on a Saturday night in February, when Heard came for the machine; I was in the parlour with Mrs. Scott - Scott's son must be eleven or twelve years old then; he is now between twelve and thirteen, but I do not recollect seeing the child there at all - I did not see Chambers there at all; he never came into the shop, and never made his appearance; Mrs. Scott never saw him, I am confident -I positively swear he was never within the door of the shop; Mrs. Scott said she knew nothing about it being arranged for the machine to be taken away, and she should not permit it to go from the premises in the absence of her husband - Heard then left the shop, and shut the door after him; I remained with Mrs. Scott till nearly eleven o'clock that night (they came about the machine about six); nobody could have spoken to Mrs. Scott about the machine without my hearing them, and nobody did speak to her about it - I had been there at least an hour before Heard came.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a word of truth in the declaration that when Mrs. Scott was applied to, a child said, "I was present when my father and Heard arranged it, and he agreed to let it go?" A. There is not.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Where was the boy? A. I did not see him - Mrs. Scott was in the parlour with me after Heard closed the door; we were making out the weekly bills - I suppose the workmen were gone, but do not know; there are generally three young men, and sometimes four - I am merely employed there on Saturday, to make out the bills; I am a clerk at the Court-house, Marylebone, on parish the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not four or five men below, where the machine was? A. I believe not; it is their habit to go as soon as business is over on Saturday; I did not see the machine go; the shop-door was shut - I advised Mrs. Scott not to let it go, for Mr. Scott had heard something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050072"></xptr>derogatory about the prisoner, and that was the reason for not letting it go - we did not know it was gone till Mr. Scott returned, which was within half an hour; he went into the bakehouse, and missed it, and found fault that it had been allowed to go - the bakehouse door is not usually locked; the area gate is locked when all the men go, but it appears one man had not left.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you quite sure you recollect it so well that you advised Mrs. Scott to let it go? A. I did, and she positively refused to let it go.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. What did Mr. Scott say? A. He said, "You should not have allowed the man on any account to take the machine away, and why did you suffer it?" we said, "We did not suffer it; we insisted on his going away, or waiting till you returned, and did not know it was gone."</p>

            . On Wednesday the 18th of August, I was sent by Mr. Challenor to the East India Company's warehouse, in Crutched Friars; I got five chests of tea, I brought home four, I was going for a hogshead of sugar; I left my cart in <placeName id="t18150405-15-crimeloc81">Wentworth street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about this chest of tea - A. No, I saw the same chest that I lost in Coblers-court, Essex-street, I got the empty chest again, the tea was taken out of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050020"></xptr>Q. How came you to find it in Cobler's-court - A. I went with the officers, and they found it; I am sure it was the came chest, the number on the chest was 6947, the same number as was in the permit.</p>
               <p>SHIPLEY. Q. What do you know about it - A. I know nothing of the prisoner at all; I never saw him before to my knowledge; I can swear to no more than the two that I swore at first. I saw them empty a chest of tea out into a bag, one was a jew, and the other a butcher, the prisoner was not there I know nothing of him.</p>
               <p>LITTLE JOHN. On the 18th of August, 1813, I came down Wentworth-street I saw three men standing before the cart; two of the men have been transported.</p>

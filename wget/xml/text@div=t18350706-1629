                  </hi>. I live in Market-street, Fitzroy-square, and am a shoemaker. On Sunday-night, the 22nd of June, I was in Tottenhsm-court-road, at half-past twelve o'clock—the prisoner came up, and asked me to go with her—I said nothing to that, and then she put her hand round my waist, and picked my pocket instantly of two half-crowns, which I had seen safe five minutes before—I told her she had robbed me—she denied it—I said if she would not give it me, I would give her in charge.</p>

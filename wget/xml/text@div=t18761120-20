                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">interpreted</hi>). I am a Swede—I was a seaman on board the Reindeer—I joined her at Shields, she came from Dundee; she sailed under the English flag—the prisoner was a seaman on board, he is a German; we were altogether ten in crew—on 15th August we were on the High Seas, I can't say at what part—the prisoner, the deceased and I were taking tea in the forecastle; the prisoner was sitting in his bunk, and the deceased was sitting on his chest—they were friends then—a seaman, named Harry came into the forecastle and said to the deceased "You have taken too much tea "—the prisoner showed his pannikin to Harry and said "This is the tea I got"—the deceased said to prisoner "You have drank too much tea before"—the prisoner said "You tell a lie "—the deceased said "You are another liar"—they called, each other liars several times—Harry said to them "Sit down, and be quiet "—they were quiet for a moment—Harry went out from the forcastle, the deceased then got up and demanded the prisoner out on deck to fight—the prisoner said "I won't have no fight with you "—the deceased demanded him out a second time, and said "I will fight you"—he then went on deck, the prisoner stopped in the fore<lb></lb>castle and said "I don't want to fight"—previous to this the deceased had struck the prisoner several blows in the presence of Harry, they were not hard blows—the deceased remained on deck four or five minutes, he then came down into the forecastle again and sat down on his chest—he said to the prisoner "You called me a liar," and the prisoner repeated the same—they, called each other liars—the deceased got up from his chest and rushed across and struck the prisoner again with his clenched fist, across the chest and face, they were not very hard blows, there were a good many, but not very hard—the prisoner told him to be careful, various times—he said "Mind yourself"—the deceased said "I see you have got a knife in your hand, but I am not frightened of that"—I saw that he had a knife in his hand; the deceased had a knife on him, but it was in its sheath—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the prisoner's knife—the prisoner warned the deceased various times." Mind yourself, go away from me, I don't want to fight, I want nothing to do with you"—the prisoner had the knife in his right hand, the deceased was very close to him—I looked downwards for half a minute, and when I looked up I saw the deceased step back from the prisoner towards the forecastle door, and he said "Oh, oh "—the prisoner stood close to his own bunk, between 4 and 5 ft. from the deceased, with the knife in his hand—they were face to face—the deceased stopped at the forecastle door and undid his belt, and then unbuttoned his trousers and pulled up his shirt, and I saw blood come from his left side, there was very little blood, he attempted to get up the steps and fell down—the prisoner put his knife in his bunk and went on deck—I did not see the deceased after that; he went on deck, and I went and finished my tea—some of the men came and con<lb></lb>veyed the deceased into the cabin—this took place at 5.30 in the day—I saw the deceased dead next morning at 8 o'clock—there was some plaister on the side where the wound was inflicted—he was buried at sea the same morning—the prisoner went into the forecastle, took the knife and gave it to the captain—he told me afterwards that he got a needle and helped the captain sew the wound up—after this we went on our voyage to Tarrogona—I was there examined by the British Consul, and also the captain and Harry, and the boatswain—the prisoner was not present, he was kept on</p>

               <p>board—he was afterwards sent to Barcelona by the British Consul, and we came to England together in the same ship—on the way back we were talking about what had been done, the mate asked the prisoner who done this murder—the prisoner said "It was done through me, but it was not wilfully done; I could not help it"—the deceased was twenty-two years of age, he was a little bigger and stouter than the prisoner—the ship was going quietly at this time; it was rolling a little.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Before the deceased fell and cried "Oh," he went towards the prisoner as if to strike him again, he was very close—I can't remember whether the prisoner had the knife in his hand cutting his meat at his tea, that is the knife that he had to cut his meat with—the bunk is about a foot and half wide and between 5 and 6 ft. long—there was a chest and a bench standing there—the prisoner and deceased were good friends on the voyage; all the crew were like brothers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate.</hi>" I have to say that my conscience is entirely free and clear of what I am charged with; what has happened has been by a sad and unfortunate accident caused by the anger of the deceased. I was standing by my bunk, the deceased, jumped at me and I was quite frightened, I had neither time nor presence of mind to drop my knife or take another situation; the vessel gave a roll when the deceased rushed at me and the knife went into his side; for several moments I stood! as I stood before the deceased came on me."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). The weather was not very rough—I don't know how long the prisoner had been to sea, I think he is an old sailor, he is an A B—I can hardly believe there was a sufficient lurch of the ship to account for the knife getting into the man's stomach accidentally; it was rolling a little, not very much.—<hi rend="smallCaps">

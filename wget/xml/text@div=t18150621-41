I turned round and looked at him; and took particular notice of him. I had not gone two yards, before I put my hand into my left hand waistcoat pocket, and missed two three shilling pieces. We went in pursuit of him but could not find him. On our returning, Just round the corner of the Minories we met him; he said he never saw me, and never robbed me. I secured him, and gave him in charge to a constable, and told the constable to search him; and if he found any three shilling pieces on him, with the figure 3 on them, they were my property.</p>

            . The two three-shilling pieces I lost had each of them the figure three upon them. There was only one found upon the prisoner, I cannot swear to that. I took two three-shilling pieces in change at the Chapman's Arms, where the landlord always marks all three-shilling pieces that come into his house, with the figure three; and then if they are bad, he will take them back. I am sure the prisoner is the person who pushed me.</p>

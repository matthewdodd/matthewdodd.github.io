               <p>"Where is my Jack, I want to see my Jack;" the prisoner was not present, but I went down and told her, and asked if she could not tell where to find him - she said</p>
               <p>"I do not know where he is - I wonder he has not been here before now;" I first told her of it on the Thursday night - I told his cousin, and he went down to tell the prisoner; I went down to her myself, on the Tuesday or Wednesday, and every day I mentioned it, and said if she would tell me where he was to be found, my husband would go for him - she said she thought it strange he had not been there before, and would endeavour to try and send for him; she was always busy, and I cannot tell what answer she made when I offered to send my husband - I never heard Mr. Bond ask for him while she was in the room, I generally went down stairs, and left them; he died about three o'clock on the Saturday - the prisoner was there, after he had been dead some time - she took every thing out of his box; there was a large ledger, a silver tankard, and different things - she took them all up into her bed-room in her apron; there was some paper: on the Thursday I found two bills in his bed, and there were two 500l. notes under the bolster - I put them into the tankard, and they went up in her apron.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you look at the two 500l. notes? A. Yes; it was on the Thursday night before he died - he must have fetched them out of his box in the afternoon while I was down making some tea; I had left a boy with him - I had made his bed in the morning; they were not there then - I swear they were Bank of England notes, notes, not hair-dressers' flash notes; I never saw a flash note - they were exactly as Bank notes; it said 500l., and they were much worn, where they were doubled up; he was insensible when I took them from under the pillow - he had a fit almost every minute, and would not keep in bed ten minutes together, but was taking all his clothes out of the drawers, and routing about; I told nobody about these notes, not even my husband - in my opinion the deceased's mind was broken ever since the Wednesday when he had a convulsive fit, but at times he answered me correctly: I did not then tell him I had taken the notes from under his pillow - I thought his mind broken, and it was useless to disturb him: he had two strong fits on Wednesday, and then the doctor said he was dying; he would at times answer me, Yes, or No, but he had no knowledge whatever after the fits: the box was usually kept locked, but the key remained in it from the Tuesday till he died - I was never out of the room till he died, and am certain the notes were there; nobody could have gone to the box without my knowledge: I asked him where his son lived - he said in a street in Oxford-street, and at that time somebody came into the room; Mrs. Hall was not present: (looking at two flash notes) these are not the notes I saw under the pillow - they were blacker and dirtier than these, and more worn, but not worn as these are - they were more worn in the fold, but not torn at all.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you ever hear the prisoner ask the deceased where his son lived? A. No, I never heard her have any conversation with him.</p>

The prisoner asked me to present him with the codicil of a will - that produced appears to be the same; I think it was on Wednesday, the 9th of July - there was no signature to it then; the prisoner placed it in my hands, requested me to read it to him, and to ask if he would sign it - I took it up stairs, and finding him in a tranquil state, I told him his sister had presented me with a codicil of a will, to ask him to sign - he said he was already acquainted with the contents, I then said, "Do you approve of it?" he said he did; I said, "Will you sign the document?" - he said No, he would not; I then withdrew, took the codicil back to the prisoner, and told her he would not sign it -I did not read it to him, as he said he was already acquainted with the contents; I did not tell him the contents, concluding, from his answer, that he had seen it before - in fact, to the best of my recollection, he told me he had read it; he did not take it into his hand.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You would not have presented it to him, unless you thought him sufficiently tranquil to sign it? A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he give you any reason why he would not sign it? A. No - I do not recollect his ever telling me, it was because he thought if he recovered he should lose all controul over his property; I will not swear he did not say so, but, to the best of my recollection, he made no observation, except that he would not sign it; I saw him about three times a day - at times he was not in a state to judge for himself, at other times he was in a state of delusion, but, to the best of my judgment, he was at times in a state to judge for himself; on the Thursday and on the Friday there were intervals when he was perfectly sensible - I never introduced the subject to him again.</p>

Since I have been in Mr. Wright's office - it is not my business; I felt compassion for the prosecutor, and introduced him to Mr. Wright, whose employ I entered in September last - I had nothing to do with the will, but with the Chancery suit; I was clerk to Mr. Hughes, of Clifford's Inn, for five years - there is an indictment against the prisoner, Silcock, and two others, for a conspiracy; the deed which Bond executed is here - I think he makes a long A, but do not remember; the A to the codicil is a round one; he makes a round B, not like this one, which has the first stroke straight - whether he turned his d round at the end I do not know; the character of this hand-writing is different altogether - I used to go to his house for Mr. Hughes on business: I do not go there now, except on business - I might look in when I am passing; the Chancery suit is undetermined - the prisoner is in contempt for not putting in her answer; we obtained an injunction which would have shut up the house - she withdrew her caviat since this indictment has been found, which was in December; she has been out of the way ever since till five weeks ago.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you believe the name, "A. Bond," there to be his hand-writing? A. I am sure it is not; I am a surgeon, and practice where occasion requires, in London and in other places; I practised this morning - my shop hitherto has been in Clerkenwell prison, as I am indicted for a conspiracy.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know of any authority being given to any body to sign that name? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long ago were you taken up? A. On the 23d of November: if I thought right I dare say I could procure bail, but I remain in prison for my own personal safety - my shop was in Tottenham-court-road; the prosecutor does not bring me here - I have come of my own accord to vindicate myself; I have come by order of the Court. I suppose - I know the Marlborough Arms public-house, Blenheim-steps; I never told any body that if the prisoner gave me 100l. I would swear any thing, but if not I would turn round to John Bond's side, nor any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. You have said that signature is not Anthony Bond's writing; you may decline answering, but do you know whose writing it is? A. Mrs. Halls - she did it the day after his death, in the afternoon, at the Rising Sun; I disclosed that fact voluntarily.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you write to the attorney for this prosecution, that if he would let you off the indictment for conspiracy, you would come forward on this prosecution? A. Never, nor to that effect - I decline stating whether I made any affidavit in the case.</p>

I made an affidavit at Westminster-hall in November - I always thought the prisoner lived on very good terms with the deceased; she managed his business, and the greatest harmony prevailed between them - I never heard he had a son till this happened.</p>

He was first employed by the prisoner about October last - she was then in possession of the Rising Sun; she has delivered some property up to the prosecutor, by my advice - the house is leasehold; Mr. Harmer confided this case entirely to me - it was long since this indictment was preferred, but not in consequence of any fear of this indictment.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. If this will be a good one, she is entitled to all this property? A. In trust for her children, but she stated to me, what I believe to be true, that she is a large creditor under her brother's estate; the proceeds of the business she carried on at Reading were paid to her brother, who bought the lease of the Rising Sun with it, she furnished him with other money, which was confirmed by the attorney, and I advised her to give up the property, as she could establish her claim as a creditor and obtain it back in that way; I felt confident this indictment never would be prosecuted, except for costs - the valuation of the house and property is under 400l. - she was to administer under 450l.</p>

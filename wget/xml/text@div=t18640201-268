                  </hi>. I keep the Swan hotel, New-street, Covent-garden—I have known the prisoner four or five years as a respectable man, in a good position—in December last, he asked me to lend him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I did—on 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> January, a woman came and brought me this letter—I have seen the prisoner's handwriting several times—the letter contained this cheque; both the letter and cheque are in the prisoner's hand-writing—I know him by the name of England and Peyton—England is only a nickname—he is known as "Peyton"—I gave the woman two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, deduct<lb></lb>ing the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he owed me (<hi rend="italic">letter read:"</hi> 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> January.—Dear sir, I inclose you my draft on Glyn, Mills, and Co. for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which please cash and hand the bearer 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. gold.

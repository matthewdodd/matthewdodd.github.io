               <p>C. Give the best account you can of the watch.</p>
               <p>Groves. I had had a misfortune with it, having put it under my head one night, in taking my breeches up it sell out, and broke the spring, the chain, and one pillar; so I hung it by in my room, and did not wear it. I missed it, and had a suspicion of Anne Mountain, that lodged in my house. Some little time after, Mr. Gibson came and told me the prisoner brought my watch to pawn to him, in company with

               <p>Groves. I never saw him in my life till Mr. Gibson brought him to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Gibson tell you?</p>
               <p>Groves. He said he lent Skinner 15 s. upon the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the watch here?</p>
               <p>Groves. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you it?</p>
               <p>Groves. It was in Mr. Gibson's custody. We were before justice St. Lawrance, there the prisoner did not own he was guilty; but owned Anne Mountain came to his room, and delivered the watch to Skinner, to go and pawn it; and the prisoner owned he was concerned in going to the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was before the justice, did you complain you had lost your watch?</p>
               <p>Groves. Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Groves. She was gone off at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see her in your room?</p>
               <p>Groves. No; but there were none in my house but my wife and a little girl and she that could take it.</p>

             came to my house, and brought a watch to pawn, (produced by the prosecutor). I believe this is the same; it has been in the prosecutor's hands some time; they pawned it for fifteen shillings; the next day I saw an advertisement.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you advertise it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No; Anne Mountain's husband did at my request.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gibson, Are you sure the prisoner was one that brought it.</p>
               <p>Gibson. I am. Seeing the advertisement, I went to the prosecutor's house; upon asking him if he had lost a watch, he said he had. I told him I believed I had got it; and told him what sort of a man brought it, and asked him if he knew him? He said no. There was Anne Mountain's husband along with him: he said he knew him, and told me where I might find him. I went and found Skinner there; but the prisoner was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175502260035"></xptr> gone out of town with Anne Mountain. On the Monday following I had word come that the prisoner was returned, and that he was in a little court in Drury-lane, up three pair of stairs. I went and took him to the prosecutor, and then before justice St. Lawrance, and produced the watch. The prisoner said, he finding Anne Mountain had been advertised, went out of town with her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 24th of April, at three o'clock in the morning, the prosecutrix came to the station naked, all but a green baize thrown over her shoulders—there were marks of violence and blood about her face, also on the back part of her head, and her feet and legs were bruized, and had blood on them—one of her arms was bruised—she was in a fainting state, whether from the blows or from liquor I cannot tell—she complained of the bruises at the back of her head—I had seen her previous to that in the course of the night, she then appeared sober—she made a charge against the prisoner, her husband—I went to apprehend him—he was in the up<lb></lb>stair room—I said, "Pattman, come to the station, for your wife is there, and I think she is dying"—he said, "No, I shan't come"—I said, "You had better come and see her"—he said he should not—I then told him if he did not come, I should break the door open and take him—he said if I did he would serve me as he did that b—w—. I instantly broke the door open—he was very violent—another officer was with me—we overpowered him and took him into cus<lb></lb>tody—the prosecutrix wrote her name, "Ann Eliza Pattman," at the station, and I heard her give that name at the police-office, in the prisoner's presence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I saw the prosecutrix on the 26th of April, at a quarter-past four o'clock in the morning, at the station at Poplar—I found she had a contused wound on the hind part of her head, and a bruise on the forehead—she made no complaint at that time, but she showed me the hind part of her neck, where I saw a con<lb></lb>tusion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184105100090"></xptr>
               <p>—the wound on the back of her head was not bleeding then—it had been—it had been occasioned by some blunt instrument—it might have been occasioned by a fall against any hard substance—the bruises might be caused by blows from a fist—the wound was not severe, but the parts went a good deal contused—she went out next morning before nine o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Hale-street, Poplar. I have known the pri<lb></lb>soner twenty years; he is a man, I think, incapable of lifting his arm, even in self-defence—I have seen his wife thrash him—my bed-room looked into the prisoner's yard, and I have been frequently awoke in the morning by the violence of his wife—I have seen her throw the earth at him, and throw water in his face, and he has submitted to it like a child—she is a woman of violent temper, and at times under the influence of liquor.</p>

I am a joiner, of Warwick Place, Pimlico—on the night of 2nd October I went to bed between 10.30 and 11 o'clock—I got up next morning, and missed my watch and chain from the dressing table in my bedroom, also three coats, two pairs of trowsers, two vests, and in the pocket of the clothes was a purse containing 155., a knife, a pipe, some gloves, a handkerchief, and other things—about a month afterwards I was called to Arbour Square station, and saw my pocket-book and some of the other things there, which I identified.</p>

On 28th January I met the prisoner coming from Clerkenwell Prison—I took him in custody, and told him it was for committing several larcenies in the B division—he said nothing—he was taken to the Cottage Road station, where some of the property was identified—after he had been before the Magistrate, he called me to the cell, and wished me to see a young woman named Maria, and ask her to come and see him—he then told me that I should find Mr. Aldridge's watch pledged either in a pawnbroker's opposite Victoria Railway Station, or in Buckingham Palace Road—he also told me where I should find other property, but said that he was so bothered then, that he would write to me—I afterwards received this letter by post. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated "Newgate, February 5th," from the Prisoner to Sergeant White, giving the names and addresses of the pawnbrokers where the different articles were pawned.</hi>)</p>

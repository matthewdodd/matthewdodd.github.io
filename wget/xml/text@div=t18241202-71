On the morning of the 12th of November, about six o'clock, I found my shop door broken open, and my saw gone. I saw the prisoner lying under the bench; the saw had been hanging up in the shop the day before. I went for an officer, and when I came back he was gone; he had been in my employ ever since June - we went to look for him, and found him in Stanhope-street, Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish him to pay what he owes me - Witness. When I took him into my employ I promised to pay for his breakfasts. I have had several applications, and have kept 15 s. of his wages, to pay them, and I now have to pay debts for him to the amount of 1 l. 4 s.</p>

            . I am an officer. Oxley called on me on the 12th of November, and said his shop had been broken open, and the prisoner was lying on the shavings; we went there, but he was gone - we found him, with a duplicate upon him. I asked if he had sold the saw; he said No, he had pawned it not far off - he said if his master had paid him he should not have done it. The door of the workshop had been broken with a chissel, or a large knife.</p>

                  </hi> I am a lighterman, and live at St. Saviour's, Southwark—the prisoner lodged in my house four or five years—we were not good friends, we did not speak to one another at all—he paid his rent, and came into our room and took his meals with me and my wife, but found his own food—he came into our room on the night of 22nd Nov., between ten and eleven o'clock, he said he would sit there as long as he liked—I told him I wanted to get to bed—I asked him if he was going to stop in our house all night—he gave me no answer—I told him to go out, he would not go—he rushed past me, went to the cupboard, unlocked the door, got a knife, made a stab at my nose, and gave me a blow afterwards—he then <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> down the knife on the table, and ran up stairs to his own room—he struck my wife for taking my part.</p>

The prisoner has lodged with us nearly five years—he had his meals with me and my husband—on the night of 22nd Nov. he was in our room—I had been to the public-house to my husband for the key of the door—if the prisoner had come home he could not get in—when I went into the public-house the prisoner sat there—my husband and I went home, the prisoner followed us, he had an altercation with my husband—I endeavoured to push him out of the room, and I got hurt—he struck my husband with his fist in my presence—I remained in the room, but not all the time—I said he should not sleep in the house that night, and went up stairs to take the beds away—I did not see anything else.</p>

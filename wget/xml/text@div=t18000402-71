             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Woodsall. On the 28th of February, I sent a letter by the Post to Bury St. Edmund's, directed to Mrs. Holland, my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter? - A. This is the same letter: I put a guinea, and a seven-shilling-piece, into it, wrapped in a small piece of paper; they put three seals upon the letter, one seal stamped in the middle, and a bit of sealing-wax at each end; and there is another seal upon it, but that was put upon it at the Post-office; I gave the letter to the Postman on the 28th of February.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Was it so covered that it was possible that the guinea and seven-shilling-piece could have sell out? - A. No; the paper was closed all round, that it was impossible it could slip out.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Myers. I am a letter-carrier, in the Finsbury-square division: On the 28th of February, I delivered at the Post-office all the letters that were delivered to me in that division.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mrs. Holland) Q. Where did you live at the time you gave this letter to the postman? - A. At Mr. Brookes's, in Finsbury-square; Richards was the man I gave it to.</p>
               <p>JOHN-BAPTIST AUSTIN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I was presiding officer in the Post-office: On the night of the 28th of February, being on the opposite side of the table to the prisoner at the bar, I observed him with a letter in his hand; I thought he was adjusting the sold of it, I thought the sold of the letter might have slipped out; I did not suspect any thing then, till I observed him put the letter on one side upon the table; he was a facer; the letters are thrown promiscuously upon the table, and they face the letters all one way for the convenience of receiving the stamp; they lay them before the stamp, and another person stamps them; he should have faced that letter, and laid it down with the rest; instead of which, he went away with it, and took it to the further corner of the office.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you distant from where he was first employed? - A. About the length of this room; I then communicated what I had observed to Marshall, and desired that he would send the prisoner into the West-India room; I went into the West-India room, and the prisoner followed me; when he came into the room, he brought the letter in one hand and the money in the other; there was a guinea and a seven-shilling piece; I told him what I had observed; he delivered the letter and the money to me, and said he was looking for me to give it me; I told him he had certainly not been looking for me, because I was near enough to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the letter that he delivered to you? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the guinea and seven-shilling-piece wrapped up in a paper? - A. No; it was not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When he delivered the letter to you, did he deliver it to you sealed or unsealed? - A. These two packets of wax were burst, the principal seal was entire.</p>
               <p>Q.Then, how were the guinea and seven-shilling-piece got out? - A. I suppose, the sold being narrow, it was shook out at the end.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing it possible that it might be shook out at the end, is it possible that he might have taken it out for security? - A. He might.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Woodfall. I am a messenger in the Inland-office at the Post-office: On the 28th of February last, in the evening, I told the prisoner Mr. Austin wanted him in the West-India room; Mr. Austin was not far from the prisoner, he turned round and went into the West-India room, and the prisoner fol<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020068"></xptr>lowed him; and as soon as he went in, he presented Mr. Austin the letter, and the money separate from the letter; he said to Mr. Austin, he hoped he had no doubt of his having an inclination to secrete the letter; Mr. Austin said, he did not know what to think of the matter, for he had seen him with the letter some time before; Mr. Austin said, he was very sorry that he saw any thing of the kind happen; then Mr. Austin said, I must suspend you; and he would not suffer him to finish his duty, but sent him about his business, and desired him, in the morning to wait on Mr. Stowe, the superintending president; accordingly the prisoner at the bar attended the next morning, very early, to see Mr. Stowe; Mr. Austin was sent for, and I was sent for after; and then the prisoner at the bar related the circumstance to Mr. Stowe, and he ordered Mr. Austin and I to go to Mr. Parkins, the Solicitor for the Post-office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. He came voluntarily to Mr. Stowe's, as he was desired, the next morning? - A. He did, very early.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It wanted then but ten minutes of seven; I had a letter in my pocket which was to go into the country, and if I had not delivered it to the carrier before seven it could not go that night; it is very customary if a letter comes to the office, with any thing in it, to shake it; I shook this, and the money dropped out; there are above twenty of us stand all in a row, it is hardly possible to secrete a letter, and I went round with letters to the sixth division; I am remarkably short-sighted, I could not see Mr. Austin, or a friend, six yards from me.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mr. Austin.) Q. Is it not recommended by the office to persons not to send money, but to bring it to the office, and they would be answerable? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. I believe there is the word single written upon the letter, is there not? - A. Yes.</p>

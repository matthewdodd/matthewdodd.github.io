               <p>I live in Maiden-lane, my husband keeps a butcher's shop; on the 24th of January somebody knocked at our side door, and in came the child a baby without a frock; I stepped out of the fore door, and saw a woman go down the alley between a walk and run, I cannot swear to her face.</p>
               <p>Did you see the frock in her possession? No, I did not hear the child cry.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>I gave a silver shilling for the frock on the Friday, I was coming along the Strand, and a woman had some clothes in her apron, and this frock was hanging out; I wanted the money, but I thought it was worth eighteen-pence, and I asked eighteen-pence on it; I told the pawnbroker I bought it. I thought I was to be tried at Westminster, nobody knows where I am.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Horner. What time of the day was it that the child came into your shop? - Between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Court to Turner. What time did the prisoner come to your shop to pawn the frock? - I believe about half past eleven, she asked eighteen-pence for it, I believe it is worth half a crown.</p>

On Saturday night, the 6th of January, about eight o'clock, I was in the parlour behind the shop, which is part of the dwelling-house. I heard a pane of glass break and heard something being drawn through - I went out and found the window broken. In about a quarter of an hour I saw a man go and look in at the window; he then pulled out a piece of print seven yards long, which hung six or seven inches from the glass - he could not have got it out without putting his hand or something in - he ran away, I pursued him, he was brought back by the patrol. The properly was given me again in a few minutes. The glass was cracked before and puttied in - force must have been used to get it out.</p>

            . I live in Allerton-street, near Finch's. I saw the prisoner looking in at the prosecutor's window - I am certain of him. He saw me looking at him, and then came towards me and went across the road. In about ten minutes I heard the cry of Stop thief!

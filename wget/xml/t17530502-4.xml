            ; the prisoner lodged at my house about a quarter of a year; I had some friends came to see me on the 12th of March, we were talking about particular pieces of money, I was saying I had a two guinea piece, one of them said she never saw one; I went up and fetch'd down one, eleven crowns, three half crowns, a silver two-pence, and some other odd money; after they had look'd at them, I went up and laid them on a handkerchief upon a table, this was between eight and nine at night. I went up stairs again a little after ten, and missed the two guinea piece. and three crown pieces: my husband was out, when he came home I told him, we went up to the prisoner's door and knocked, she opened the door, and we desired she would go with us into our servant's room to search; she did, we found nothing, then we search'd her room, finding nothing we charged the watch with her, and took her to the watch house; I went the next day to her, and told her, if she would tell me the truth, I would forgive her; she then told me she had the money I charged her with, which was the two guinea piece, and three crown pieces; but she said she did not know the value of the piece of gold, and that she flung the money away at the last turning before she came to the watchouse.</p>

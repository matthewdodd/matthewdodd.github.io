            . I am a Policeman. On the 22nd of October, about eleven o'clock at night, I was called to Bentley's, and in the front room, on the second floor, found the prisoners laying on the floor, bleeding from the head; Hughes laid straight along on his back, and Worsley had her arms round his neck, crying out."Lord have mercy on me!" I asked them what was the matter, and who fired the pistol - Hughes said, "I fired one pistol at her, and the other at myself;" the woman only said, "Lord, have mercy on me;" I immediately ran for the doctor, and when I returned found two doctors there - my brother officer came in, and we picked up two pistols at the feet of Hughes; Worsley was put on the bed - they were afterwards carried in a boat over to St. Thomas-hospital.</p>

I went to Bentley's, and saw Hughes on the floor and Worsley on the bed; I heard Hughes say he had done it himself, and he wished he had done it to perfection - that he was in great pain, and if the doctors could not extract the ball to relieve him from pain, he wished they would give him a crooked wire he could do it himself; the doctors were not doing any thing to him then - Worsley groaned very much; Hughes said he expected that would be the last groan from her, and he wished he had done it to perfection, to put her out of misery.</p>

            . I practice as a surgeon. I was fetched to Bentley's about a quarter or twenty minutes past eleven o'clock; the male prisoner laid on the floor, and the female with her arms round his neck - I found her bleeding slowly from the ear; the bones of the ear were shattered - I cannot swear a ball had entered there, because I could not find one, and believe none has been found - I cannot swear what the wound was inflicted with; there must have been a discharge of something into the ear - I had her put on the bed, and examined the man; I found him bleeding from the ear, but very slowly; he said he thought he could feel a ball in his cheek - I examined, but could find no ball in either of them; in all probability I should have found a ball, if there had been any - I introduced my finger an inch and half into the wound - I should suppose the wound had been done either by a ball or the wadding of a pistol, but I do not recollect the particulars, as I did not expect any proceeding would take place.</p>
               <p>Q. If a pistol was fired close to the woman's ear, would the wadding produce such a wound without a ball? A. I think it would if it was rammed down tight; I considered the woman dangerous from the concussion, but after that was over, I considered danger over, and sent them to the hospital; Hughes was asked if he shot the woman, or whether they shot each other - he said he shot the woman first and then himself; the woman was requested by Mr. Bentley to indicate whether she wished Hughes to shoot her - if she did, she was to hold up her finger, and she held it up; I heard Hughes say "Elizabeth, are you still living? or is she dead?" he asked her if she did not wish him to shoot her; she said she did, or indicted so by signs - I do not recollect which: I remember Hughes saying he was an unhappy man, that he was an unfortunate man - I heard the woman speak, but do not know what she said; I saw them at the hospital next day, and heard Mr. Bowry ask the woman if she wished Hughes to shoot her - she said she moved her cap for the purpose.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If the pistol had been put close to the ear, and loaded with ball, would not it have gone through the head, or shattered it to pieces? A. Or rebounded - search was made for the ball, but none was found.</p>
               <p>There being no evidence to prove the pistol was loaded with a bullet, as charged in the indictment, the prisoners were.</p>

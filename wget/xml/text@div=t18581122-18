                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at High-street, Tunbridge, Kent. I came to town on 9th November—I was just at the end of Cannon-street, near London-bridge, at 12 o'clock that day—I came up Crooked-lane—I was waiting there to get past the crowd—I saw the prisoner some two or three yards below me; and once in particular, when I looked round, he had got his eye upon me—I did not take particular notice of that—after a time there came up a party of people, as though they came by a railway train, and they went by in pairs—just before the first pair reached me, the prisoner forced his way in between them, and round so as to work them round with a few of them behind me, and then his left hand came and took my watch, and he made his way very quietly among the crowd—I suppose I observed him about five minutes before he took my watch—as soon as he had done it, he got about one or two from me—I could not reach him, so I did not halloo, but I went round and caught him by the collar as soon as I could—I kept my eye on him the whole of the time—I said, "You stole my watch"—he said, "You don't mean that, do you?"—I said, "Yes, you villain, you did"—he began to make a whining noise, as if to attract the attention of other parties; and four or five of a similar stamp came and rushed in between us, and broke him from my grasp—however, I still kept my eye on him—he ran away immediately—he ran a few yards down the path, and then dodged under a horse's head, then under the tail-board of a waggon and round and about several other waggons, and I caught him in about the middle of the open space, the other side of King William's statue—I then shouted out "Police" twice, as loud as I could halloo—about a minute or two afterwards, up came a fellow who said, "Let that man go; I will show you who has got your watch"—I said, "Never mind the man that has got the watch; I have got the man that stole it: that will do for me at present, and I shall hold him"—the prisoner passed his hand back into the hand of the one that came up and wished me to release him, and something passed; I cannot say I saw what it was, but as soon as it was passed, he went over in an opposite direction, towards Fenchurch-street—I secured the prisoner and had him out on the path opposite the ham and beef shop there, and the police came and took him in custody—the prisoner was very resolute while I was holding him, trying to get away all he could, and it was with the greatest difficulty I held him—we had a tumble—a witness came up who was in attendance before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>behind me, and that brought me in the crowd a little way—he faced me—I did not lose sight of him at all after he had done it, till I took him—I am quite sure I did not go up to him, and see that he had nothing in his hand, and then let him go—I never lost sight of him at all; my object was to secure him—I came up from Tunbridge to see a sick daughter at Ham<lb></lb>mersmith; and I was waiting there for the crowd to allow me to pass up to the Mansion-house, to take a Hammersmith <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—I have lived at Tunbridge fifty-three years.</p>

               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, the prosecutor stood as I came down stairs; I asked him what o'clock it was, he said, six or half past six, and I wished him a good morning; I should think if any body had robbed him, they would not have stopped to have asked questions; why did not the woman follow me, I went gently from the door, and I went to the public house over the way.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Kemp. I saw nothing of him; I run immediately; I never saw him till I saw him at the Justice's.</p>

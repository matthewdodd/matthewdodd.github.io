I live at 10, Addison Square, and am a wicker-worker—on the morning of 17th February I remember going into a urinal—I was tipsy—the two prisoners followed me in—Crosby looked me very hard in the face, and Dowling was behind me, and all in a moment he put his arms round my head and against my breast, and the other hand he put on my fob, and forced me back on the ground—while I was on the ground he kept his hand over my mouth, and knelt across my chest—Crosby rifled all my pockets—I had nothing in them but papers and bills, and two or three post-cards—I heard Crosby say "He aint got nothing"—Dowling said "Are you sure he aint got nothing?"—Crosby said "Yes, nothing at all"—I don't remember crying out at all—I did not see a police<lb></lb>man come into the urinal—I lost my senses—I was very much hurt across my chest—I thought I was dying—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the papers and post-cards I had in my pocket.</p>

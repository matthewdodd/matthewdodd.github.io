On Sunday, the 19th of April, a little after eight o'clock in the evening, I was coming from St. Bride's church, and nearly opposite <placeName id="t18290611-322-crimeloc1699">St. Dunstan's church</placeName>

               <p>CHARLES READER. I am a law bookseller, and live in Bell-yard. I heard a cry of Stop thief! turned round, and secured the prisoner, who I had seen shortly before this happened - I had taken hold of him three minutes before for picking a gentleman's pocket, but the handkerchief was returned, and the gentleman declined prosecuting; I secured him, and a party kept soliciting me to let him go, as there was nobody to prosecute him; I let him go, and immediately found my own pocket had been picked - he did not get from me after Golland's robbery.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LIGHTFOOT. I am a beadle. The prisoner was given into my custody - I saw nothing of the transaction.</p>

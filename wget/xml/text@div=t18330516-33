I wished to get an under-tenant for it till Michaelmas next, when my term will expire; the prisoner came and entered into terms to take it, I think in February last; I did not sell him any thing, but lent him the use of the fixtures, but not to remove them, he was to leave them fixed; we made no agreement in writing - he was to enter about the half-quarter (about the 13th of February) and to pay the rent quarterly; the first half-quarter's rent he was to pay for taxes, but I believe he has not paid any - I went to the house about three weeks after Lady-day, and found it shut up and empty - the prisoner is a tripe-dresser - all the five stoves were gone, a counter, a stall-board, and a gas-pipe, which had all been fixed - I found the prisoner in East-street, Finsbury-market, about the 30th of March, and asked him what had become of these things, he said he took them out and sold them to a broker in Old-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not give me leave to remove the dresser? A. No, nor any of the articles, because I am bound to keep them, and to return them up again to the landlord on a repurchase.</p>

            . I live in Goswell-street, opposite the house in question. I know the prisoner by his coming to my shop; I was standing at my door at half-past nine o'clock in the morning, and saw him remove the stallboard and some other boards; I think it was on the Wednesday after quarter-day - he shut the street-door and went away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was there on the Friday afterwards, and the board was on its hinges. Witness. I saw you bring it out and lodge it on the stones, and then take it away; I am sure it was you, I was surprised you did not take it when the furniture was removed.</p>

            . I am a butcher. I went with the prosecutor to the house, and missed all the fixtures - we went to the station, and were told to look after the prisoner- we went to Finsbury-market, and the prosecutor saw him come out of a house and pointed him out; I followed and took him - he said he had sold the things a fortnight before to a broker in Old-street, but he did not say to whom.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took the premises, and found I had been taken in, as there was two years of poor-rates due, a year and a half of king's taxes, and other taxes due, and the gas-light rate; the prosecutor never paid one farthing, there was 2l. 14s. 6d. to pay for that, which I could not pay, and they cut it off - I was to give him 5s. for the stall-board, but I left it when I went away, and on the Friday after I saw it there - I went to a person and made an arrangement with him to take the house, and come in on the Monday - I took the house for the whole of the time, and I might have removed any thing if I had replaced it again - he has no proof that I sold any of them - I don't see what right he had to break into premises while I was in possession of them.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Is it true that there are poor-rates due? A. Not on my account; the landlord was to pay if there were any due before - I went to pay the gas rate, and they would not take it without some arrears, which I was not inclined to pay - I am still answerable for the rent, and was obliged to pay the last quarter - the prisoner did not state that he was about to leave the house.</p>

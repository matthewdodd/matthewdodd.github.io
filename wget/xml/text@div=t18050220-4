            , coming to your stables in February last? - A. Yes; I cannot justly say the day; I shewed Mr. Drake the horse. I took the horse in myself of the prisoner at the bar on the 1st of February; he brought the horse to our stables between the hours of twelve and four in the afternoon; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was the horse when he came in - did he come in with a saddle? - A. No, no saddle, only a bridle, a roller, and a cloth; he asked me if there was any chance of selling his horse there, or whether we wanted to buy a horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say his horse, or this horse? - A. I cannot justly say; we asked him if it was his horse; he said it was; we said he might leave it there a day or two, we would try it; this was on Friday; he came there again on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, to walk him about, and brush him over.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account how he came by the horse? - A. Yes, he did say where he bought it, but I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he fix any price on it? - A. Twenty-five guineas; the prisoner was apprehended on Monday, when he was riding the horse on the ride.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner brought the horse in, had he the appearance of being hard ridden? - A. No; he came to our stables from a livery-stable in Moorfields, I think he said Pope's stables; he did tell me, but I do not justly recollect; I think I understood him that he had stood there from the Monday before; the cloth and roller came from their stables, he said, and he took the cloth and roller from our stable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The horse stood at Hobson's stables, as I told him.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: I apprehended the prisoner on Monday, the 4th of February, as he was riding the horse; I had information that a stolen horse was there.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen Mr. Drake at that time? - A. No, it was about three days before I saw Mr. Drake; it was a friend of Mr. Drake's that took me there; I went with Mr. Drake to the Eclipse livery-stables; when I apprehended the prisoner, I had the bill in my hand; I looked at the horse, and it answered to the description in the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went with Mr. Drake to the livery-stables, was that the same horse you shewed him there, that you apprehended him on? - A. The same horse.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200006"></xptr>Q. When you apprehended the prisoner, what did you say to him? - A. I desired the prisoner to bring the horse into the stable, I asked him whose horse it was; he said, the horse was his own; I asked him where he got the horse; he said, he bought it of one Mr. Baker, in Gloucestershire, a farmer, I am sure that was what he said; I told him it was a stolen horse, and that he was a prisoner of mine, he must go to the Magistrate, and satisfy him about Mr. Baker; I took him into custody, and brought him before Mr. Conant; Mr. Conant asked him how he came by the horse; he told him he bought the horse on the road this side Hammersmith, but he did not know where to find the man; the prisoner is a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Drake.) Did you go first to the Eclipse livery-stables without the officer, or in his company? - A. I went first without the officer; I am confident that is the horse I had lost, I had the horse two years and a half.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was walking through Hammersmith, and coming back I met this man, he said his name was Baker, and he was a Gloucestershire man, he was on this horse; he says to me, groom, will you buy a horse? I said, if it is worth the money; he asked twenty-five pounds for it; I bid him sixteen pounds for him, afterwards I bought him at eighteen pounds, the horse, bridle, and saddle; I rode him to London, and put him up at Mr. Hobson's stables, I do not know the name of the street, it is in Moorfields; I put him up at livery there; I bought him as he was, he had got two splints and a very bad sand-crack, which I did not see till afterwards; I asked Mr. Hobson to sell him for me; they examined him, and said he was lame, they had no chance to sell it, they having many horses of their own to sell; my landlord knows that I had such a quantity of money, I took twenty-four pounds when I left my last service, and ten pounds I lent to a shoe-maker; I have been in the habit of buying beasts, I have had three hundred pounds stock; I produce a letter - (a witness produced another.)</p>

               <p>Court. (To Prisoner.) The letters give you a character, but we cannot read them here.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had he been in your house, after he returned from the country, before he was taken up? - A. About a fortnight; he was in place when I first knew him, about two months ago, with Mr. Peech, as a groom; that is the gentleman you have that letter from; he was looking out for a place when he was at our house, and when he left our house he had fourteen pounds.</p>

I am the wife of William Atkins, a hawker of Dorset-street, Spitalfields—the prisoner lives in the next house—on 21st August, I was coming down stairs about 1 o'clock, to shake a carpet—the prisoner was standing at the door with a cat and a dog—she came up to me and said, "What call'd you with my husband last night?"

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Grenville Park, Blackheath, and I am secretary to the Hop and Malt Company—about 5.30 on the afternoon of 4th December last, I saw a cab upset near the Company's premises, over a mound of earth at the side of the road—it was driven by a person named Bracey—I went and examined the horse—it was rather dusk, and I ordered him up to a gas lamp—I examined the horse, there was nothing the matter with it—its knees were not cut—no one else was there but myself and the cabman—the lamp irons of the cab were broken and the hood was cracked, that was all the damage done to the cab—the horse was dark brown, about 13 hands 2, with a rat tail—I ordered the man to call next day, but no one came—on 16th December, in consequence of an applica<lb></lb>tion which took place and a letter coming to me, I went to the yard of the prisoner with one of the directors, Mr. Grundy, and the architect, Mr. Moore—I saw the prisoner, he is a cab proprietor, at Henry Street, Gray's, Inn Road—I told him that I was the secretary to the Hop and Malt Exchange Company, I had come with the director, Mr. Grundy, and the architect, to see the horse and cab which was overturned on 4th December, in Southwark Street—he then said to a man, "Bring out that black mare which met with the accident"—a black mare was then brought out by the man Jones—it had a frightful sloughing wound on the off fore-knee—I said, "How comes it that the accident only happened a few days ago and that the knee is in that dreadful state?"—the prisoner said, "Well it is rather peculiar, but the mare's blood must have been in a bad state when she fell"—I said immediately I saw it, "That is not the horse,"—the prisoner</p>

I am a horse-keeper—on 4th December last, between 6.0 and 7.0, I was in Mr. Case's yard, and saw Bracey come into the yard with his horse and cab—I helped to take the horse out, and washed her legs; her off knee was cut; there was a little dirt in the wound—it was a black mare, singed—I saw her afterwards in the stable—Bracey drove a bay mare afterwards—I saw Bracey when he came home on the boat-race night; he said to me, "Amos, it is all wrong to-night; you can tell Charley Case I have got no b——money"—he did not pay any money that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The mare that Bracey was driving then was a brown mare, was she not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, a black mare, singed; she had a switch tail, not altogether a rat tail—I think Jones was the man who helped me to take the horse out—I saw a black mare with a sloughing knee a week or two afterwards—I don't know that she was borrowed by Mr. Case—she did not go out the day after the accident—Bracey drove a brown mare after that—it was not the one that came in on the night of the accident—I am in Mr. Richard Case's employment now, in the same yard—I do not know a great deal about horses.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a market porter—I was near the Hop Company's premises, and saw the accident—I assisted to get the cab up—I noticed that the horse's knee was covered with mud; I did not see that it was cut—the skin was knocked off his shoulder—the cab went over one side and the horse the other—the driver was thrown from his seat—when they got the horse up they went away—it was going ten or twelve miles an hour when it was upset.</p>

               <p>——<hi rend="smallCaps">WALTERERS</hi>. I am a horse-cloth manufacturer, at Tottenham—in the early part of December I was staying at Mr. Case's house—I remember a horse and cab coming into the yard, and the driver said he had had an accident by the side of the Hop Exchange, over the water—there was a dark-coloured horse in the cab then—I saw it taken out; its knees and mouth were bleeding—Mr. Case gave orders to wash the knees, and to put a horse in the cart, and we went to the place where the accident happened.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What day was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say exactly, I know it was the beginning of December—it was a Hansom cab—the horse was bleeding a good deal—there was a cut right across the knee, a little on one side; it was a deep cut—I never saw her afterwards—I received a letter from Mr. Case five or six weeks afterwards—it was dark when the cab was driven into the yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Mr. Case's yard when the horse and cab was brought home by Bracey—he said he had been upset in Southwark Street—I saw the horse; it was a brown mare, but black from her joints—she was brown from being singed—her legs were washed—the off-side knee was cut—the dirt was washed out with hot water—the other knee was rubbed with gravel—I saw her next day in the stable—she was not driven out by Bracey; he drove a bay mare—I went with Mr. Case to the Company's place next day, and they said the contractor was liable.</p>

Reading Bank notes, and from the drawer twenty silver spoons and a gold ring, which were worth about 13l. - I had four notes in the box a few days previous, and this paper, containing the numbers of them, was in the drawer, by the side of the plate; the numbers were (reads) 5831, 4103, 5464, and 5317 - they were Simmons' bank of Reading; I had paid away one of the notes a few days previous; I could not tell which: I did not see the prisoner again for a week or ten days, when he was in custody in London - he had given me not the slightest notice that he was about to quit.</p>

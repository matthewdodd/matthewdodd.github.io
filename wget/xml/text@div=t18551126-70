                  </hi>. I am groom to Mr. William Mason, of Chingford. He was absent on 21st Oct.—Ramsey was his gardener, and Wood was a labouring man under him—on that day I saw Ramsey leave Mr. Mason's premises with a basket full of something—Wood left the premises with him, and he had a bag with something in it—I gave information to a policeman, and he brought them both back in custody—Ramsey had the basket, and Wood the bag—there were cabbages and apples in the basket, and potatoes in the bag—there were apples and potatoes on my master's premises.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 346). I received information from the last witness, and apprehended the prisoners at 7 o'clock in the morning—I saw them come off Mr. Mason's premises—Ramsey was carrying a basket nearly full of apples, and Wood had a bag with about a peck of potatoes in it—I stopped them, and asked what they had—Ramsey said, "I have. got some vegetables that my mistress gave me"—Wood said Ramsey gave him the potatoes in the bag—I took them to Mr. Mason's house, and found they had no right to take them—there were two cabbages at the top of the basket.</p>

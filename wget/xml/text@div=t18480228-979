                  </hi> I live in Skinner-street, Snow-hill, and am a boot and shoemaker. On 22nd Feb. I went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the Coal-hole—the driver got off, and we went in and called for ginger-beer—the prisoner was standing at the bar—I put down a sovereign to pay for the ginger-beer and a glass of rum—the prisoner snatched it and ran away with it—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>immediately—the prisoner ran across the road—if course I could not run so fast as he did, I had my box coat on—there was a person in charge of the door—I said, "Shut the door, don't let him take my gentleman's money," and he shut it against me.</p>

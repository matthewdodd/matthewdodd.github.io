                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Stagg and Co.—it was the prisoner's business to pay the cashier all the money he received. On the 21st of October, between five and six o'clock, I saw a little girl come in and ask for some narrow velvet—the prisoner served her—I saw her pay him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which he took off the counter, and went towards the cashier's desk with it, but did not put it on the desk, as was his duty—I immediately went to the cashier and asked if he had paid it to him—he was called into a private room—Mr. Stagg told him he had been robbing the firm, which he denied—I asked if he recollected serving the girl with velvet—he said "Yes"—he keeps a book to enter his sales, and it was not entered—he said at first he had entered it in his check-book, and then said he had thrown the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the desk—it was his duty to check his book as well as put the money on the desk—he took the money from his pocket—there were three or four sixpences.</p>

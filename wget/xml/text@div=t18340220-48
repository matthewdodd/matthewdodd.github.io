               <p>Q. Was there anything you saw which could make it proper for the cab to go on that side of the waggon? A. Nothing at all; the two carts were a-head of the waggon - there was nothing between that waggon and me, but the other cab - it was highly improper for the cab to go on that side of the waggon - that is the side on which the driver always walks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it so light that you could distinguish the features of persons? A. I could not - I did not take notice enough of the cabs to see whether persons were inside them - I consider the cabs were not abreast - the cab with the grey horse was before, but I cannot say how much - I should think ten or twelve yards; quite as much as that - I cannot be mistaken - they were going at a galloping rate - the pace they went at was about ten or fourteen miles an hour; but I am no horse jockey.</p>

            . I am a house pupil at the London Hospital - I was called to the man about half-past eleven or twelve o'clock, and found him with a fracture of the ribs on both sides, he had difficulty of breathing, and complained very much of his chest; and he had an effusion of air under the skin, which indicated that one of the ribs had perforated the lungs to cause the effusion of air - he died on Saturday, the 9th of February - I examined the body after death, and found six ribs on each side fractured; and an immense collection of blood on the chest, and on the lungs as well; where air ought to have been there was blood; that injury was quite sufficient to account for his death; any thing going over him would produce such injury; the wheel of a cab going over him would account for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would you not rather conclude something very heavy must have gone over him? A. Yes; heavy, certainly; I will not say very heavy, it depends so much on the circumstances; some ribs break sooner than others - he told me he was sixty-nine years old - a waggonwheel might have done it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Might a cab-wheel have done it? A. Yes; I rather think a waggon-wheel would produce a much greater effect than I found - an injury of that kind depends very much on the position of the body at the time it is done.</p>

            . I am a waggoner - on the morning in question I was driving a waggon to London; there was one cart before me; I was going at my usual walking-pace; and on this side of Bow church I was passed by two cabs, one with a grey horse, and the other a dark one; the one with a grey horse came on the inner side of my waggon, between me and the pathway; it was going the same way as I was, and coming as hard as a horse could gallop; if I had not got behind my waggon, I should have been run over; if I had been walking close to my horse in the usual way, it must have knocked me down, and ran over me; I was close to the stones; there was just room enough for the horse; I never drive on the stones, but keep as close to them as I can - there was plenty of room on the other side for three or four cabs to have gone by - when they passed me, the cabs were as near each other as could be, one on one side, and one on the other - I could not tell what colour the other cab-horse was - it was driving at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200036"></xptr>same pace - after the cab passed me there was a lad before me, and he dropped behind his cart; and my horse shyed, and I cried, whoey; and by my crying, whoey, his horse and mine both stopped - and then I heard a man call out,"The Lord have mercy on me! what shall I do?" I went to him, and found him wallowing in the slough, by the side of the curb in the paved part, and in the track the cab had gone - he was hurt very much, and I called a policeman - I found a lanthorn by him which was beat all to pieces - it appeared to have been crushed by something going over it - I do not know who the man was - I assisted in picking him up - I called my master, who was in the waggon - the man was picked up, and I went on with my waggon, as soon as the policeman came - I saw no more of the cabs - they went on - the man was very close to the curb when I went to him - he had crawled a little way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there space for any person to be safe who was walking between your waggon and the curb? A. No: the cab must have run over me, if I had not got out of the way - it was not proper for any cab to go on that side - it was driving on the wrong side - when I found the man on the ground, my waggon had not reached him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. We are told it was rather dark; could you say that no carts had gone on? A. I do not know what there was before me - for what I know, some carts might have gone on - I cannot say the man was not on the ground before the cab passed - I asked him whether the cab had run over him, and he said, "Yes."</p>

            . I was accompanying a van that morning; I was immediately before Poulton's waggon, going in the same track; I was close to the stones, by the side of the road; I was coming towards London; I heard a cab rattling on the stones close to me, and I had to fly behind my van, or it would have gone over me; I ran behind my van, and caught hold of the hind ladder; I was almost down; the cab-horse was galloping very fast; if I had not got behind my van I should have been run over; the cab had a grey horse in it; after the cab had passed me, I saw something fall in the road, which I at first thought fell from the cab, but immediately I heard a man groan; I stopped my horse immediately; my van had not got within a rod of him; I found the deceased in the road, near the side, on the spot where I saw something fall, as near as could be; the man said he was hurt very much; he took on a good deal, and said a cab had run over him; I asked him if it was a cab with a grey horse in it; he said "Yes;" he was taken away, and I went on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was your van or Poulton's first? A. Mine was; I was just a-head of his horse, not a rod before him; there was one cart behind, and there might be one or two before; it was dull, but I could see by the light of the lamps; there were carts or something going before us; I had not seen the poor man before he was run over; it appeared to me that something fell from the cab; I cannot say who was the driver of the cab, nor whether persons were in the cab.</p>

            . I am a proprietor of a cabriolet - I drive it myself - on this morning I was at Laytonstone - there was a concert there, and a ball; and eight or nine carriages of different descriptions were coming to London - there was a cab with a grey horse there - I never saw the driver before - I could not swear to him - the prisoner is very much like the person - I was in the same public-house with the man who drove the grey horse for some time - I talked with him a little - there was a great impediment in his speech, like a defect in the roof of his mouth - my cab and his were the only two I saw there - I followed him with my cab - we were together at the gate, the first gate from Layton - after I passed Bow Church the grey horse was before me the whole way - I picked up a hat in some part of the road - I cannot say whether it was on this side Bow Church or the other - I did not see where it fell from - I was stopped by a policeman in the road - he told me a hat had fallen - I went back and picked it up - I then followed on the road - I got up to the other cab about Whitechapel Church - I called out to the driver, but do not know whether he heard me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you set out from Laytonstone, was the driver driving, or one of the gentlemen? - A. One of the gentlemen was on the driving-seat - there were four gentlemen came out of the house to get into the cabs - two got into my cab, and I suppose the other two into the other - mine was a very dark small mare.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Yours was the only other cab there? A. The only one I saw - I was driving at the rate of about eight or nine miles an hour, I should consider - I do not think it possible that my horse could go at the rate of ten or fourteen miles an hour - Stratford-gate is the first gate from Laytonstone - I overtook the cab at that gate, at least I was close behind it - I saw a gentleman on the driving seat there - I kept behind the cab with the grey horse all the way, after leaving the gate; when I first started, I was a considerable distance behind it, as it got on while we were stopping to pay - I never again got up to it, until I got to Whitechapel church - I could see fifty or sixty yards before me, I should think.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the cab with the grey horse stop during the passage from Stratford-gate to Whitechapel-church? A. Not that I saw - the gentleman continued on the driving-seat from Stratford-gate - I saw no more of it until near Whitechapel-church; and then the gentleman was not on the driver's seat - that is about four miles from Stratfordgate - I heard nothing of the accident until the day before the inquest - I was not racing with the grey horse cab - it is quite incorrect - I never saw the man before in my life- I remember meeting and passing several carts and waggons on the road - the gentlemen I drove were sober; I have not seen them here to-day; they were at the inquest;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200037"></xptr>but, whether examined, I do not know; I think one was named Betram, he lived at 29, Broad-street; I am sure one of them was at the inquest.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Were you trotting? A. No; my mare goes at a canter; she will not trot; I cannot call it galloping, a sort of canter; I passed several waggons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the grey horse go on one side of the waggon, when you went on the other? A. I never was near enough; I did not see it go inside a waggon that was going the same way as me.</p>

I am a merchant's clerk; I was at the ball, at Laytonstone, with my brother; we went in a cab which had a grey horse; we came home in the same cab; my brother took the reins; I believe the prisoner to be the driver; but he was so muffled up that I could not distinguish him; I hired him in Stamford-street, Blackfriars; when we came away, I got inside the cab, my brother got in the driver's seat, and the driver sat inside with me; my brother drove from Laytonstone; I had an impression at the time that the driver was rather tipsy; my brother drove to Bow-church, and, after that, the cab-driver drove; to the best of my belief, he took the reins of his own accord; he drove from within; he did not change his seat; my brother still kept the driver's place; the driver had a very peculiar voice indeed, as if he had lost the palate of his mouth; I saw the prisoner at the inquest, and believe him to be the man, but he was so covered with a cloak, and a handkerchief round his face; I heard him speak at the inquest, and should say distinctly he is the same man; it was not a cold morning; we had been dancing; I had a cloak round me; I do not remember passing a waggon coming in the same way as myself; I was labouring under a severe cold at the time, and had a cloak round me, and a handkerchief round my face; I was muffled up a good deal; as we came along, I felt a shock as if we went over something; I should say the horse went faster when the man took the reins, than it did when my brother had them; the horse took fright, I should think at the shock; after we had gone a distance of fifty or sixty yards, or perhaps more, the man stopped the horse; he did not go back to see what was the matter - I learnt from my brother that he had been nearly thrown off his seat, and he had lost his hat; we did not go back and pick it up; I then told my brother he had better get inside, and he did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose it was necessary to stop for him to get inside? A. That was at the time we stopped, forty or fifty yards after the jolt - the cab stopped probably a minute or a minute and a half - the other cab did not overtake us - I should say at the time of the jolt we were very near the right hand side of the road, going to town - that would be the off side - we were near the middle of the road - we had not passed a great many carts and waggons in the road, we passed some - I did not hear a soul call after us, after the jolt - at the time of the jolt the horse was not galloping - I observed the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear a horse capable of going at a very quick pace? A. Quite the contrary - we were two hours and a quarter going from our own house to the place, which was a proof how it could go - the driver did not appear to urge the horse to unbecoming speed on the road - we were quite sober - the horse did not appear to me to be perfectly sound in his paces - I should say he was lame of the off fore leg - I wished to stop and pick up my brother's hat - he replied, that our friends in the cab behind had picked it up - I knew the gentlemen in the cab behind - at the time the jolt took place in the road I saw no waggon near us - it is six miles from Laytonstone to Whitechapel Church, which we were about an hour and a quarter going.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not you see any waggon near you, when the jolt was - were you looking out? A. I was admiring the lamps - that would be on the side away from the waggon - the lamps were on the off side - the lamps are only on the off side - I believe they are not on both sides.</p>

            . I am a managing clerk in a solicitor's office - I was with my brother at the ball - I drove the first part of the way to London, and just at Bowchurch the reins were taken out of my hand by the <rs id="t18340220-48-deflabel300" type="occupation">driver of the cab</rs>

               <p>COURT. Q. Do you call that only a mile from Whitechapel? A. The post-office is considered six miles from Laytonstone, and it is a mile from my house to the post-office; I speak according to the Directory; I stopped the cab to get into my seat out of the driver's seat - there was no alarm given at any time to the cabman that an accident had happened - I had my hearing perfectly correct, and could hear the better from having lost my hat.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). After the evidence which has been given against me by the witnesses who have been examined, I must still feel, that although suspicion may<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200038"></xptr>attach to me for having been the cause of this accident, I am still certain that the horse and cab which I drove on the night in question, did not commit the offence; but you, my Lords and gentlemen of the jury, are most capable of judging of the degree of credit due to the statements of the witnesses, and will be best enabled to consider whether or not my plea of "Not Guilty" has not been justified even by the evidence for the prosecution.(

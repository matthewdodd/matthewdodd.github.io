               <p>I am a constable. On the 17th of April I went with a warrant to search a house in <placeName id="t17800510-43-crimeloc235">Three-pigeon-Court</placeName>

I went down the court first by myself, and knocked at the door and stood three or four minutes. I heard somebody come out of the cellar. Carter opened the door; I asked him if they did not know one Jones; and in the mean time Dixon came up. We went in and shut the door. I told Mr. and Mrs. Carter, who were in the lower room, that I had an information, and came to search the house on a suspicion of their carrying on the coining business.</p>
               <p>You looked upon her as the wife of Carter? - Yes, at that time. I desired Mr. Dixon to look about, and I took care of the prisoners. Dixon clapped his hands upon a piece of paper on the mantle-piece, which contained three shillings and sixpence in counterfeit money. He asked her how she came by that money? She made no direct answer to that. He searched a little farther, and in a corner cupboard beyond the chimney-piece he found about twenty-eight or twenty-nine shillings in base money. We asked Mrs. Carter how she came by them? She said she did not know, she supposed they belonged to a lodged she had had in the house. Mr. Dixon asked what was the lodger's name; she replied, she supposed the lodger would hardly give his right name. Mr. Dixon asked her over again? She said it was immaterial, she supposed the lodger did not give his right name. There is but one room on a floor. In the parlour we saw a little bit of a board which will take up occasionally to look down into the cellar. We took that board up and saw the coining tools below. Carter wanted to go up stairs to put some clothes on; I went up stairs with him; Dixon staid below, to take care of Mrs. Carter. I asked Carter if he rented the house? He said yes, I pay rent for the house. I asked him if he had any lodgers in the house? He said no, he had no lodgers at all in the house. He dressed himself. I told him he must go with me; when we came down stairs Mrs. Carter wanted to go backwards; I went backwards with her, and in the yard I observed a window blinded up with sacks and brick bats; that was the area window which looks into the yard. We came in again, and then we went into the two-pair-of-stairs room, there was a bed in the two-pair-of-stairs room, but it did not appear to have been lain in some time. We took the prisoner to New-Prison, and then we went and searched the house. Upon the stairs which go down into the cellar there hung a pair of gaers; Mr. Carter said they were his.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went with Grubb to search the prisoner's house; he was in before me; I followed him in and told them we had a warrant to search the house for coining tools. Mrs. Carter said we might search the house if we liked, there were no tools there. I put my hand on the mantle-piece, and found three shillings and a sixpence in bad money (producing them). I told her then if there were no tools in the house they had had bad money. I searched farther and found twenty shillings and fifty-two sixpences, in a corner on a shelf, they are all counterfeit. There are some black spots on the shillings. On the shelf, where the victuals were, I found this (producing a little pipkin) which appears to have had lambblack and bees-wax in it, the same stuff that is on the shillings. I asked him what that was for; he said he blacked his shees with it. We found the blacking for his shoes up stairs afterwards. I lifted up the board in the parlour and saw below the working tools, and a vyce, and a bag with pattern shillings and sixpences, which are good ones. The bad appear to have been made from them. There were also two botles of aqua fortis; one of them has been used the other has not. The colour is changed of that which has been used. If any base metal is put into it it will turn it instantly; one sixpence lay on the bench unfinished, that is smooted ready for colouring; it would colour it if it was put into aqua fortis and water. I found a pair of flasks and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100058"></xptr>screws complete, the metal is run into them for the purpose of making counterfeit money. There was no sand in them; they were not set. I found some sand, scowering-paper, some metal, and some crucibles for melting. Here is a piece of metal which has been melted, and some facing, and every thing which is used for the purpose of coining.</p>
               <p>What do you call facing? - It is sprinkled over the sand to make the impression come out clean; we found no one in the house but the prisoner. When they were before the magistrate, they were examined apart. Carter said they were married some where in Birmingham; she said they were married some where by the Borough. I found these three files (producing them) in the cellar. They have been been used in filing metal of this kind.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You met with no obstruction? - No; when they were before the justice the woman blamed him for not fighting instead of going quietly.</p>
               <p>Court. These shillings appear to be old ones? - They get old ones for patterns, because if they were new they would not pass so currently.</p>

               <p>Can you tell that they are new made when they appear to be old? - Yes; if they have been long made they will lose their colour.</p>
               <p>You know if they are convicted that you are entitled to a reward of forty pounds a piece? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing wanting to complete the business? - Nothing in the world that I know of.</p>
               <p>Was there any fire below in the cellar? - There was a fire place but no fire in it, the grate was cold.</p>
               <p>Mr. GREGORY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a monier of the mint (looks at the three shillings and sixpence) they look like good shillings.</p>
               <p>Dixon. They will appear to be bad if they are broke.</p>
               <p>Court. If the monier of the mint does not know they are bad, how do you discover them to be bad? - Any body may know them to be bad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gregory: (Breaks them) they do not appear white now they are broke.</p>
               <p>Were they made at the mint? - I cannot tell; there has none been made since I have been at the mint; these do not look to be bad; I do not see any thing coppery about them; I will not take upon me to swear that they are bad.</p>
               <p>Look at the twenty shillings and the sixpences? - By this light they do not seem to me to be bad; they look like old worn shillings (files one of each) they look bad now they are filed.</p>
               <p>Was that coined at the mint? - I do not know that it was.</p>
               <p>Do you coin bad silver at the mint? - Not that I know of.</p>

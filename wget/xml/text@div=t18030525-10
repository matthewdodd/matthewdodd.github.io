               <p>Q. Was the door shut? - A. I cannot say; I left a little boy in the shop, who was gone for some beer; I saw a man in the shop, and saw him go out; I flew out into the street instantly, and this young man of mine followed him, and never lost fight of him; I cried, stop thief, and he was taken; my young man and I followed him to Sheppard-street, and then I returned; I saw the prisoner after he was taken.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you keep your eyes upon him all the time? - A. Yes; I took hold of him by the collar of his coat, and held him till the watchman came and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q.What o'clock was this? - A.Half past nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say or do any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the candles fall from his hand? - A. Yes; I did not stop to pick them up, but pursued him.</p>
               <p>THOMAS COSS sworn. - I am a watchman of St. George's, Hanover-square: On the 26th of April, between nine and ten o'clock, there was a cry of stop thief, just by Union-street; I was close to the prisoner; he threw down the candles, and said, d - n your eyes, there take them; he was running, and they were pursuing him; he ran across Bond-street into Blenheim-street, we pursued him into Blenheim-street; the candles were picked up by the watchman; we took him, and brought him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about these things? - A. No. (The candles were produced.)</p>
               <p>Timberlake. These are my candles; the papers they are in are marked by my shopman with his mark.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Timberlake.) Do you know that they were in your house that night? - A. Yes; I missed them the moment I went into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you take no less, if a person took a large quantity? - A.Taking a great quantity, and paying ready money, might make a penny in the pound difference.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say, they were in the shop before the prisoner was in the shop? - A. I cannot say I saw them before, but I missed them immediately as I came into the shop; there were 6lb. in a paper, 1 lb. had been sold out of one of them just before.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Freeman.) How many pounds were there in the papers you took up? - A.Two 6 lb. and a 5 lb.</p>

On the evening of the 30th of December I was in my back parlour, at a quarter or twenty minutes before six o'clock, and heard the front parlour window sash moved up; I had not been into the front parlour that evening. I thought it was the servant shutting it, it had been dark for half an hour; I had candles lighted; I thought it was the servant, but I opened the back parlour door, and immediately a double knock came to the door, and the watchman sprang his rattle, and called out that there were thieves in the house. I unlocked the door leading from the passage to the front parlour; and went in with a lamp, and saw the prisoner close to the door; the bottom window sash was open, it had not been fastened. I know that it was shut before I heard it put up. I asked how he came there, he said,</p>
               <p>"I am here," and seemed quite frightened.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140026"></xptr>I collared him, and took him into the passage, my daughter opened the street door, let the watchman in, and he took him; the watchman brought a cloak, shawl, and several articles, which were tied up in a bundle, and had been bought at the linen drapers by my daughter on Saturday night - this was Tuesday. I had seen the parcel in the front parlour, it had not been opened at all, but my name and address was on it; it was opened before the Magistrate; it was going to my daughter at Chatham; she was at my house at that time; the watchman also brought a shawl belonging to my other daughter, and a cloak - they laid on the piano that morning, when I was in the parlour. I know the shawl to be my daughter's.</p>

            . I am serjeant of the watch of St. Mary-le-bone. On the evening of the 30th of December, I was on duty in Foley-place; my beat is on the opposite side to Elliott's house - I was opposite his house about twenty minutes to six o'clock, and observed a man standing on the iron rails before the house, and at the same time saw a large parcel handed out of the window; I could not see who by; the sash was up. I made towards the house immediately, and when I got within three yards of the man, he threw the bundle down, and ran off. I knocked at the door, sprung my rattle, and immediately picked up a cloak, a shawl, and a large paper parcel, directed to No. 40, Foley-place; it was dark. I had not passed the door before. I went to the window, saw Elliott go in with a light, and the prisoner was there. I went in, and took him to the watch-house with the things.</p>

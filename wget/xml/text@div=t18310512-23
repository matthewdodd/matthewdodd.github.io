On the 13th of April, about nine o'clock in the evening, when I came home, I missed two old coats and a waistcoat, which I had left safe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120029"></xptr>about a quarter to seven o'clock in the parlour, behind the shop - I found the prisoner in custody with them at Guildhall next day; they were old clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Is your master here? A. No; when I went out I left the parlour windows open - they are about four feet from the ground; it was my business to fasten up, but being out, my master forgot to do it - it was day-light when I went.</p>

I was in the butter-shop, about nine o'clock, alone - two strange men came in, and asked for a pen and ink to write a receipt - my mistress, who was in the parlour, told me to give it them; they wrote something at the counter, and staid a very short time - they staid outside a little while, and then one said to the other, "You have not written the date;" and they came in to do it - I stood at the corner of the counter, watching the butcher's shop, which is on the other side, but I saw nobody go into it - the property was stolen from there; the door of that shop is taken off during the day - the prisoner is not one of those who came into the butter-shop; I saw a man come out of the window of the butcher's-shop with a bundle - I ran out, calling Stop thief! he ran down Fleur-de-lis-court; two boys, at the top of the court, ran after him, and when I came up I saw he was stopped - I did not see his face when he came out, but he appeared the same in size and dress, rather thinish; nothing was found on him - the prisoner is the man who was stopped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.If the two men, who came to you, had any thing to do with it, they came away just in time for you to see the man come out? A. Yes; the window is in Feather Bed-lane - there were lights in the butcher's-shop; the shop doors were off, and the window open - I do not swear the prisoner is the man who came out of the window.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.When you pursued, did you see any thing in the man's possession? A. I saw him throw the things down, but lost sight of him as he ran down the court.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the bundle thrown down by the person who came out of the window? A. Yes, he dropped it as he ran, about a yard up the lane.</p>

            . I am fifteen years old, and live in Fetter-lane. I was in the service of Mr. Shaw, a copperplate engraver, but lost my place through attending at Guildhall on this business - I was at the top of Feather Bed-lane - I saw the prisoner running, and heard Adams crying Stop thief! the prisoner ran up the lane, and turned down Fleur-de-lis-court - nobody else was running from the cry; I laid hold of his coat in Fleur-de-lis-court, and assisted in stopping him; I afterwards saw the bundle produced - Lyford claimed it; it contained two coats, a waistcoat, a piece of canvas, and two stall-cloths.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not mean to say you were turned away for coming against the prisoner? A. Yes, it was the first week that I had been with my master - the prisoner was the only person running; the bundle was picked up by the Press coffee-house; the front of which is in Feather Bed-lane - Adams came up in about a moment after; I caught hold of the skirt of the prisoner's coat - there is a gas-light in the lane, and more in the court.</p>
               <p>THOMAS COUCH. I live at No. 141, Fetter-lane, with my father, who is a carpenter. I was at the top of Feather Bed-lane, and saw a person running up the lane with a bundle under his arm; he threw it down in Feather Red-lane - I heard somebody cry out Stop thief! he ran down Fleur-de-lis-court, and I after him - I did not lose sight of him till he was stopped; Adams was running behind him, calling Stop thief!</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How old are you? A. Thirteen- the person had a green handkerchief spotted with red, and I think he wore shoes.</p>
               <p>GEORGE FREDERICK P - I am superintendent of St. Bride's watch-house. The prisoner was delivered to me with the bundle, which I have had ever since.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had come from Grosvenormews to call on Mr. Crawford for a pair of shoes, which he was making for me - he lives three doors from the prosecutor's; I knocked at the door several times, nobody answered; I came away, and as I turned the corner, I heard a cry of Stop thief! I ran with several people - the two boys laid hold of me; and at Guildhall Mr. Crawford came and said he had a pair of shoes to make for me.</p>

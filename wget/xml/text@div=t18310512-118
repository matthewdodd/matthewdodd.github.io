            . I am waiter at the Hope public-house. The prosecutor came there - he gave me a sovereign, and I returned it; a lady wrapped it in a bit of paper, and he put it into his right-hand side-pocket - he then pulled out 14s. or 15s. in his hand, and gave me a sixpence; I saw the prisoner there, sitting next to Roberts - all the other persons went away, but the prisoner and the prosecutor, who had fallen asleep; the prisoner moved from his seat, and went and sat next to the prosecutor - I saw him put his hand into the prosecutor's right-hand side-pocket, which I had seen him put the sovereign into; the prisoner drew his hand out, and put it into his own pocket - he then went, and sat down where he had been before; my master then came in, and the prisoner jumped up, caught the prosecutor by the arm, and said, "He is a friend of mine, I have known him ten years, I will take him out;" I heard him say that, and for that reason, I did not mention to my master what I had seen - the prisoner came there the next night, and we gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was not room for me to sit near him at all. Witness. Yes, there is room for three persons - you did say I had better take the money out of the prosecutor's pocket, and leave it with my master, but my master was not at home; I did not ask you to help him out.</p>
               <p>JAMES SOUTHCOMBE. I am a Police-constable. I was applied to by Sibley, and took the prisoner - I told him what I wanted him for, and he denied the charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was with two or three friends; the prosecutor happened to come in - he went into a little box where there is just room to sit down; I staid sitting by Fisher and his wife - it was near ten o'clock, and they wanted to get the prosecutor out; I got up, and said, "I don't mind helping him out;" I knew he lodged at the Three Crowns - I got him out, and then had to go on duty as a watchman; he wanted me to go and have some more liquor, but I refused, and said I had had enough -I left him, and he went into another public-house or two: he got to fighting, got into a row, and got into the watch-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, in Gresham Street—I was appointed under the prisoner's bankruptcy to investigate his affairs, shortly after the adjudication, which was on 6th September—I received the books of the bankrupt into my possession—I have carefully gone through those books, with a view to ascertain the state of his affairs—I have received no invoices for the year 1869—up to July, 1868, the invoices were pasted in a book in the ordinary way—I have not been able to get the invoices from that time; that has very much impeded my research into the books—I applied to some of the creditors for copies, and received some; but was not able to get all, not sufficient to enable me to make complete inquiries—I got no original invoices—I am now referring to an account, which I examined with the books, and can speak to—the total amount of the prisoner's purchases in the first three months of 1868 was 1426<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; in the corresponding three months, in 1869, <hi rend="italic">it</hi> was 1867<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; in August, 1868, the purchases were 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; in April, 1869, they were 2088<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in May, 1868, 692<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in May, 1869, 1850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; June, 1868, 464<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; June, 1869, 2116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the total of those three months, in 1868, was 1517<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the total for those three months, in 1869, was 6055<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; making an excess of 4500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in those three months—the difference between the first three months, in 1869, 1867<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the second three months, 6055<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was nearly 4200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the sales for April, May, and June, 1868, were 3034<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the sales from April to June. 1869, were 3918<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., being an excess of 884<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that leaves an excess of</p>

               <p>purchases over sales of over 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I can't account for that; I can't account for about half of it—the stock that was actually realized was a little over 1700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is a surplus of stock unaccounted for to the extent of about 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is without taking into consideration any profit to the prisoner on these sales, treating the sales as at cost price—if there were any profits, that would considerably increase the deficit—the debts due to the bankrupt were nearly 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the total assets about 2900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the total debts about 6500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of which were customers' dishonoured bills; the deficiency, as between the assets and debts, is 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being treated as liabilities—the bills represented goods that had been sold to creditors—in August, 1868, he was indebted to trade creditors about 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't place any great reliance on those figures; but that is the best I can get from the books—I can't state the amount owing to him at that time—I was not satisfied, from the examination I made, that my figures were correct on that point—the bankrupt admits to 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of stock in hand at the beginning of January, 1869; but there are no figures in his books to give me any proper data—I have never received from the bankrupt, or from the books, or in any way, any solution of the 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deficiency.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As far as you were concerned, I believe it was simply as an accountant, without any previous knowledge of the bankrupt's trading? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite so—I have verified the accounts—I have been over all the principal items, the purchases and sales in each month—his indebtedness, at the time of his bankruptcy, was about 6500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of which arose from losses and bad debts—he also sustained losses, during the short remaining period of trading, of about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—that would account for about 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the deficiency; that is what I call trading losses—there would have been about 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. assets to be divided among the creditors—that would be about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—1853<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the amount unaccounted for—I have no knowledge of the cost price of the stock which the bankrupt surrendered to the assignees—it sold for about 1700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at public auction—I believe it was not a forced sale; the prices realized were very high; subject to that, it was a forced sale—the invoices that are missing are all the invoices for three or four months prior to his stoppage, from July, 1868—I do not know that those invoices were, at one time, given up to Mr. Lovering, or Mr. Wyatt—I know the bankrupt so alleged, and that Mr. Lovering denied it—I was employed by the assignees some time in September—I was first employed by some of the creditors; by Mr. Barren, he was the largest creditor—I know, of my own knowledge, that the prisoner has been in business since 1861; he failed then, or in 1860—I don't know that he was enlarging his premises in March, 1869—I don't know what stock he had at that time—I have no data upon which to arrive at that result—supposing his stock was very low at that time it would make a difference in my calcu<lb></lb>lation—I have estimated his stock at 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if he had not that stock it would go to hid credit, and if he had more, it would go to his debit—he kept a book, which contained the totals of the invoices; but the details were absent, because the invoices were not forthcoming; it contained the creditors' names—if I had had the invoices I could have seen what class and description of goods had been supplied; as regards the amount it did not mutter—the total purchases for the first three months, in 1869, was 1867<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the total sales for the same period 2630<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the difference being 760<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the purchases should also include the manufacturing wages, in order to get the difference between the two—the wages is part of the</p>

I am a boot and shoe manufacturer—I have had knowledge of the business, from my 14th year—I reside at 366, Hackney Road, which is next door to the house occupied by David Davis—from my house, I could command a view of his premises, I could see from my window right through into his back yard—I could see from my front window at one time, and at other times from my back window—from my front window I could see his front door, and from the back I could tee into his yard—he was a boot and shoe manufacturer, the same business as my own—the first day I noticed anything was on 21st June—I saw Feldman's van loaded with game kid and patent calf, and his carman, Ward, with it—the van was crammed full, right over the top—it was a four-wheeled van—it was driven up to Davis' front door—Mr. Feldman walked up to the door, knocked at it, and it was answered by the foreman, Davis came out and went in again and the things were unloaded in at the front door—Feldman's carman, and a boy of Davis's, and his manager, did the unloading—Feldman remained in<lb></lb>side Davis's house—I saw the goods as they were carried in—they were packed in parcels—each dozen in a separate parcel—I believe the value of the property taken in was about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the unloading took a good time—when it was all unloaded the van was driven away empty—I made a memo<lb></lb>randum about this—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced,</hi>) it is in my handwriting—it was made on the 28th June—if I said it was the 21st, it was a mistake, it was the 28th—that memorandum was made with reference to the transaction I have described—it was made on the same day—the following day, the 29th, I saw the same van and the same carman—the van was loaded with Austra-lian sides; that is leather—there were no other kind of goods—the van was so full that day, that boards were obliged to be placed on each side of the van, to keep the leather up, so that it should not slip down—the boards on the top were placed higher than the inside of the van—I saw Davis superin<lb></lb>tending the van—it was backed to the side entrance, and the goods taken into Davis's yard—I saw that myself—I believe the value of those goods to be from 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the van was driven away empty—the goods were weighed in Davis's yard, by Davis and his men, and then taken into his house—the day after that, the 30th, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening, the same van came up again—it had then got some Australian sides, and cropped bellies in it—it was almost as loaded as the first one was—I can't say the value of that load—the value differs, but I should say it would come to about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not at home on the morning of the 30th, my son was—in the evening the van was backed in and the goods taken into the side entrance—I don't know whether they were taken into the back premises, or into the house—goods frequently came in there between the 30th June and 4th August, in carts, I believe with an apprentice of Feldman's—it was a person I knew to be in his employment—I have often seen Feldman at Davis's place between the 28th June and 4th August—I can't say how often—I never saw him there at the time goods were being delivered either from the carts or the van, except at the time I have mentioned—on the 4th August I saw the van again—Ward came with it—it was tilled with rolls, not of leather, one roll of the paper was broken</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187001310008"></xptr>
               <p>and it showed like eyelet-holes—those are pieces for the fronts of boots—on the top of those some boards were planted, and three large hampers—I don't know what they contained—<hi rend="italic">they</hi> came into Davis's front door—the hampers were very full, because the man was compelled to stoop down to keep them on his back, and when he let them down in the passage the house was almost shaken into mine—I did not see Feldman there on that day—I believe I had seen him there the day previous—I went away on the afternoon of the 4th to Kamsgate, and returned on the Friday following—I saw Feldman there several times after that—he came to Davis's front door—it was shut, he knocked, and someone let him in—I saw Davis on several occasions after this, in the evening after 7 o'clock, when I was at a beer-house which I generally use, opposite Feldman's—I have seen Davis's trap standing at the door of Feldman's house for a long time before he came out—they have been acquaintances many years—I had seen them together repeatedly before the 28th June.</p>

               <p>of the goods in the van, because I don't know the weight of kid and patent calf—the van was there above an hour that day—my son was at home—he saw it—he did not make any memorandum at that time, only myself—I did not suggest to him to make a memorandum—it was between 11 and 2 o'clock—the van was standing, for an hour, in front of the door, next door to me—I mean to say that the whole of those goods went in at the front door—there was rather a large quantity—I am sure my son was at home—he came to me, and said, "Papa, look outside, there is a large van full of goods of Feldman's at Davis's door," and I said, "I have seen it already"—he is going on for fourteen years of age—he did not tell me to make a memorandum of it—I had done that already—I did it in His pre<lb></lb>sence—the goods had all been delivered then, they were just taking them down—this is my memorandum—this "June 28th, kid and patent calf," was written on 28th—the next entry is "June 29th, van of Australian sides," and then, "June 30th, patent calf and lining"—that is my son's—"Cropped bellies and Australian" is mine—that third entry was made by my son—I was not there when he made it—I swear that those entries were made at different times—I had left the envelope in ray desk, unlocked, and my son went to the desk and took it—I had not told him it was there—I dare say he saw me put it in the desk—I can't say whether he saw me write the memo<lb></lb>random on the 29th—I don't know whether he wrote anything else but what is on that envelope.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the last witness, and work at his place, next door to Davis—in June last I noticed some goods come to Davis's place—the first day was on the 28th—they came in Mr. Feldman's van—Ward was the driver—the van contained kid and patent calf—it was quite full—I first saw it at Davis's front door—there was no one else with the van when I first saw it—it had driven up, and was standing at the door, and the goods were being taken out of it into the front door by Davis and his man—they received the whole of the load, and that van was driven off—this was between 11 and 2 o'clock in the day—I judge by my dinner hour—on 29th June I saw some more goods come in the same van, with the same driver; they were Australian sides and patent calf—the van drove first to the front door, and was then taken to the side door—the goods were unloaded there, and taken into the yard, and the van afterwards driven away—that was between 11 and 2 o'clock—in the afternoon of the same day I saw the same van loaded with Australian sides—they were driven to the back yard and unloaded; it was the same driver—my father was at home, I believe—on the afternoon of the 30th I saw some lining and patent calf—my father was not at home then—they were unloaded at the front door—on the 28th I was at the door when I saw the things, and I went in to any father and told</p>

I am employed by Mr. Nicholson, the account-ant, and am also in business on my own account—I have had great experience in the leather trade for twenty-five years—I have been in the habit of valuing goods in that trade, such goods as the prisoner dealt in—I made an inven<lb></lb>tory of Feldman's stock on 14th September; this is it; the full value of the goods was 1616<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., some were manufactured, and some unmanufactured.</p>

I am an accountant—I was employed by some of the creditors under the first bankruptcy—the bankrupt's affairs were placed in my hands—I had all his books on 6th August, I think—he assisted me in making out a statement of his affairs, which was submitted to the creditors—invoices were produced by the bankrupt, extending over this transaction—those relating to the latter part of 1868 and the half of 1869 were also on files—I think we went back as far as January 1st—after I had worked out the statement, I handed these invoices to Messrs, Sole and Turner—there were five files of invoices, and here is their receipt for them—all the invoices were on the files—a large number of invoices passed through my hands—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a book kept by Feldman, with the dates, names, and amounts—when we went through the books, we endeavoured to check the goods off with this, and when we could not find any invoice, we put a cross against the item—that applied to the months of April, May, and June, and up to the bankruptcy—these invoices were left in our office—Mr. Wyatt, my clerk, can tell you what became of them—I did not hand them over to the defendant—I have been applied to for papers connected with the matter, on behalf of the assignees—I have not refused to deliver them—I have delivered every paper we have—we gave copies of the account we took—we have not given the originals—I certainly refused to give the originals—a different accountant was employed—we never give up original documents.</p>

I was clerk to Mr. Feldman prior to September last—it was my duty to book goods and check them before leaving the premises—I recollect the month of June last (<hi rend="italic">referring to the day-book</hi>)—nothing went out to Davis's on the 28th—there was a small parcel on the 29th, value 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; a parcel on the 30th, value 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., consisting of lining and patent calf, and that would be about three arm fulls in size, and about a 1/2 cwt. in weight—I always gave invoices and receipt notes for goods that had not been paid for—sometimes we might have a customer come in and pay for them over the counter, and then an apprentice generally took them home, or now and then the carman might take them in the van—when it was a credit transaction I always gave an invoice and a receipt note which was to be brought back by the carman to show that he had delivered—those that I have enumerated were all the parcels that I booked to go to Davis's on those three days—I see the entry on the 30th is in Mr. Feldman's writing, the other is mine—I recollect the 29th June—I was out with Ward, the carman, that day; not in the early part—we went to Messrs.</p>

               <p>S. C. Hoffmael &amp; Co., in New Broad Street, then to Westminster, to two parties named Chapman and Rowe, and then to Messrs. Spice, Hawley &amp; Co., in Jewin Street—I was with Ward that day from about 2 o'clock, directly after the workmen came back from dinner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long were you with Mr. Feldman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About sixteen months—before that I was a solicitor's clerk in two situations, with Mr. Hall, now of Fenchurch Street, then of Lincoln's Inn Fields, and with Mr. Soarth, of Welbeck Street—Mr. Hall had been Mr. Scarth's manager—I was with him seven or eight months, and with Mr. Scarth about twelve months—before that I was with Solomon &amp; Co., wholesale clothiers—I am travelling now—I generally went out with Ward when I wanted to go to certain customers—Mr. Davis was not one of those—I have been there, but I don't remember ever taking any goods there—Davis often came to our place; about as frequently as any other customer, I can't say: it might have been two or three times a week, sometimes less—Feldman did not go to his place as frequently—I remember Davis coming and looking over some goods on 30th June—that must have been before 2 o'clock—I can't say how long before—it would not have been about 11 o'clock—he saw some new brands of patent calf, and asked me the price of them; he said he had never seen them before—he did not come on the previous day, to my recollection, nor on the 28th—I can't say whether he was there on the 27th—I don't know where Mr. Feldman was on the 28th, whether he went to Davis's or not on that day—I can't tell—I was clerk and traveller—I have not described myself here as manager—I did on another occasion—I made a mistake, I mistook the word—at times I overlooked the taking in of the work and always paid the work people, so I thought that would consist of about the same thing—I generally managed the business when at home—I believe I did describe myself as manager; that was in the proof I made against the estate—I have not withdrawn my claim—I did not endorse any bills or cheques for Mr. Feldman—when customers' bills were dishonoured, cheques were sometimes made out, and I used to take them up, and Mr. Feldman would put in my name or any name that came into his head—he might have put his own, sometimes—if I had the invoices here I could tell you what goods came in in June; I can't tell without—there is a small book here I could tell you by—I know that goods did come in in June, and I could tell you the amount to a penny if you give me the book—I know the invoices were on the premises at the time Mr. Feldman was bankrupt, and they have been withheld—this book (<hi rend="italic">referring to it</hi>) is in my hand<lb></lb>writing—it was made up as an easy way of telling what was purchased in one month, without making any further casting—I began this book about the end of July, 1868, and continued it up to August, 1869—the invoices them<lb></lb>selves, of which this is an abstract, were all filed in the usual manner—I believe the delivery notes were also filed—I saw them brought here only half-an-hour ago in a large basket (<hi rend="italic">a number were here produced</hi>)—here are some in June, 1869, of goods to Davis (<hi rend="italic">the witness selected some and handed in, but they did not relate to Davis</hi>)—about 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods came in in June—they went into the general manufacture and general sales; some were made into boots and shoes, and some sold unmanufactured—we did a large trade that way—I don't think the trade was particularly increased during the three months before the stoppage—taking them altogether, the purchases and sales were on a par; perhaps one month we might have bought more and sold less, and another month bought less and sold</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187001310018"></xptr>
               <p>more—I will not swear that the purchases were or were not three times so large during the last three months to what they were before; I can't swear either way—I came up to the Court of Bankruptcy repeatedly while the examination was going on, and I believe I was twice at the Police Court; but was not called—I was never with David at the Bankruptcy Court—I don't believe I spoke to him there; I never saw him there; I don't believe I did—I may have seen him; but I never spoke to him—I do remember seeing him, now I come to recollect it—I think in September—I did not go across and have some refreshment with him; I have with Feldman, many times—I don't believe I went with Davis and Feldman—I did not go frequently to Feldman's place after the bankruptcy; now and then I may have called there—I was not there continually—perhaps I have not called for a month together—I can't say that I saw Davis there—he may have been there—I attended the sale—I bought some things there, to the amount of about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for myself—it was my own money—I paid with notes and gold—I can't say how many notes—I don't know whether they were tens or fifties—I believe I wanted change of a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Mr. Johnson could not give it me, now I come to recollect, and I got it elsewhere—the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was my own savings—I kept it at home—I had not had it long; I almost forget where I got it; let me see! I believe it was from Mr. Wolff, I fancy he gave it to me—he is the prisoner's father-in-law—he gave it me about two or three days before—I said I wanted some, and he lent me some, too—it was my own money—I believe it was about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he lent me—I wanted a large note, a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, because I had some smaller ones, and he did not have it, only this 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I did not care about carrying many notes about with me—this was not to go to the sale with—it was after the sale—I will swear I had it from Wolff—I did not have it from Nicholl—I believe I got it the day after the sale—I paid a deposit of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the sale, and the remainder a day or two after—I can't say why small notes would not have done as well—it may have been a fancy to get a large one, nothing further—I will swear I did not receive it from the prisoner—Mr. Nicholl was a customer of his—I don't know about his being a friend—I have seen them together constantly, since the bankruptcy—he is one of his bail—he did not send a cheque to the bank and get that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and give to the prisoner, nor did the prisoner give it to me; I swear that—I can't answer for Mr. Nicholl's act—I did not see him send a cheque to the bank—I swear that Wolff gave me the note—I can't swear that it was in the prisoner's presence; he may have been there—it was not at the prisoner's place; it was at 12, Camomile Street, Wolff's place—the prisoner did not go with me to Wolff's—I bought the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods because I knew what they cost, and if they went under cost I knew where to sell them—I sold part of them—I took some away and left some at the pre<lb></lb>mises, 99, Hackney Road, where the sale took place—there is a small portion there now that I cannot sell.</p>

                  </hi>. I was foreman to Mr. Davis, of Hackney Road—I was four years in his employment—I saw all the goods that came in; it was my duty to check them with the invoices—after checking them, I put the invoices on the file—it is not true that, at the latter end of June, large quantities of goods were delivered from Feldman's, at Davis's—they could not have been delivered without my knowing it—his warehouse would not hold one-third of goods to the value of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., apart from his general stock—there</p>

Davis, but I did not go through the amount to see what it was; they went to Mr. Levy's sale rooms—there were three loads, two of goods and one of cutting machinery—the sales had been stopped somewhere about Christmas—I believe the sale was by private contract; they sold the goods for so much to one person, I believe—they were taken to a sale room, and Mr. Levy sold them.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a clicker in Davis's service for seven years, up to a fortnight after Christmas—I worked in the back room—I could see a portion of the back yard from there—I could see all goods delivered—I remember June last—I saw goods delivered in that month; various quantities; not considerable quantities—we never had vast quanti<lb></lb>ties in at a time; 5 cwt or 6 cwt., sometimes more—Australian sides, kid and calf in some quantities, cropped bellies, and things of that kind.</p>

Q.</hi> Were you in the same room with Yervil and Vaughan? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I could see the things delivered, through the door, but I could not see the van—I could see the things delivered from the van, and see them weighed in the scales.</p>

Fraser with a sack - I let him go some distance, and then asked him what he had got in the sack - he said he was going to take it to the docks - my brother officer came up, and spoke to me at the time, and the prisoner threw this sack of flour down, and ran away - I have since found he threw it down just by his own house - I pursued him, but lost him - this is the sack, it contains above 100lbs of flour; we took it to the station-house - I returned to my beat - Mowatt came back there, and I took him - I afterwards found about half a hundredweight of flour in his lodgings, similar to the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. You are not a great judge of flour? A. No - I did not see Mowatt's face, when he had the flour, but I am certain he is the man, by his person and dress, and size - I had a full view of him when he dropped the flour - he returned in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, his coat was covered with flour - he had a cap on when I saw him, and the same when I saw him again.</p>

             (police-constable K 263). I was on duty, and met the prisoner in Lower Gun-alley, with the flour on his back - I followed him a few paces, and, while speaking to my brother officer, he dropped the flour and ran away - I sprang my rattle, but lost sight of him when he turned - I saw Lemore come from the prosecutors' premises about half past three o'clock, and went to him and said, "Young man, I want you" - he became very much agitated, and said,"For God's sake do not take me, I shall lose my situation, I only came to see the machine, and have been drinking with a friend" - I was taking him to the station-house, and on looking round, I saw my brother officer with Mowatt - I found on Lemore about one pound of biscuits, which he said was given him by Owen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he tell you where he lived? A. Yes; and I went, but found nothing there.</p>


               <p>THOMAS OWEN. I am foreman to Messrs. Fraser - the premises were in my care on the 21st of January - Mowatt used to work on the premises - I ordered him to come at ten o'clock the night before he was taken, to turn over a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200046"></xptr>docker - he came and brought Lemore with him, who is his brother-in law; but the millwright had not got the docker done, and I sat down and went to sleep - there were some sacks of flour in the passage - when I awoke, the two prisoners were gone - we had biscuits like this up stairs - I did not give Lemore any, but he could get at them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There are hundreds of such biscuits come from your place, I dare say? A. Yes; I cannot tell where he got these - I had asked Mowatt to come, and he brought Lemore with him - I said he might as well stay, if he was not engaged - I did not give either of them any biscuits - I know Edwards - he was employed to work the docker - I did not tell him to give them any - I did not give him a key to get any - I did not direct him to give the prisoners anything - we had some beer with the millwright - he is not here - he might have given two or three of these to the prisoners, but I do not think he would have done it - the men who work for us have 14lbs. of flour at Christmas.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. I know nothing about him, only that I was employed by the prisoner to carry them skins. On the 24th of October I was in Smithfield selling oysters, the prisoner came to me and told me to meet him at half past five in the afternoon, at the Jack of Newbury, Long lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet him there. - A. Yes, I went with him into White Cross-street to a house.</p>

               <p>Q. What goods were they. - A. Skins, he told me to go forward to Bishopsgate-street with them.</p>
               <p>Q. To no house. - A. No, he was to meet me there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he follow you. - A. I do not know whether he followed me or no, I was stopped in Fore-street with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you where you was to carry them, Bishopsgate-street is a long street, near a mile long. - A. I was to carry them to Bishopsgate church yard.</p>
               <p>Q. He was to meet you there. - A. Yes, I am sure he is the man that gave them to me, some of the Worship-street officers stopped me first, and they stopped him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was with you. - A. He was in the street with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. At first you said that you were to carry them generally into Bishopsgate-street, and now you mend it, and say that you were to carry them to the church yard, were you not to carry them to any given place. - A. No given place.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a pitching block there, that was where you intended to carry them. - A. Yes, of course.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was not the man's direction, but you intended to pitch them there. My lord asked you whether you was sure that the prisoner at the bar was the man that gave them to you to carry. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was stopped by Mason, and the prisoner was brought over to you in custody, did not he ask you whether the prisoner was the man that gave you the parcel to carry, did not you say that you had never seen him before. - A. No, indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Mason so. - A. I do not know, being frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were doing what was honest you had no occasion to be frightened. Did not you give that answer to Mason. - A. Well, I did give him that answer.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken in custody yourself, you was found with stolen property in your possession. - A. Yes, I have been in custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in prison before this time for any other offence. - A. Not before this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself, take time; have you ever, and how often been in prison before. - A. If I ever had been in a prison, I should recollect it in a moment.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Did you ever stand at that bar. - A. Yes, I have once.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, did you not know that at the time these officers apprehended you that you yourself must have stood there at the bar if you had not charged some person with giving you the property to carry. - A. I had a right to put it on the person that employed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not further say that you did not take the things from the prisoner, but from some person at Fleet market. - A. I was not sworn then.</p>

Harcourt came up; the porter was on the opposite side.</p>
               <p>Q. Harcourt met you. - A. Yes, Harcourt was stopped by Armstrong and the other officers, and I went across to the porter; I asked the porter what he had got carrying, his answer was he did not know. I then saw a little hole in the basket, and something hanging out a little way, I found it was hare skins or fur; I said to him where have you brought it from, he said he brought it from Fleet market, and he was going to take it to Bishopsgate church yard.

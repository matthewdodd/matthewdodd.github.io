                  </hi>. I am the tenant of 7, Beulah Terrace, St. Mary's, Lambeth—on the 20th of December I went to bed about eleven o'clock—I saw the house secure, especially a parlour window which opens into the back garden—I fastened the latch in the inner door of the room on the passage side—I was roused between three and four next morning, came down, and found the staple of the lock unscrewed, and the window forced open—the screw had been forced out of the kitchen window,</p>

I was on duty near the prosecutor's house about live minutes to three o'clock, and heard the scraping of a window fastening—I then heard a window slide up—I was in the rear of the unfinished house in a garden, and could see the window—I saw a match struck outside it, and about ten minutes afterwards saw two men get out of the window, and come in the direction where I was standing, within ten or fifteen yards of me—they must have seen me—they retreated to the rear of the gardens, over the fences—we traced Pitt over several gardens, and Rayment got over a high wall—we searched the garden, and found Pitt under a large laurel tree—we told him lie had been in that gentleman's house over another garden—he said, "I will go quiet, police<lb></lb>man"—we had kept them in sight from the window to where we took Pitt—I am sure the person I took was one of those who came out of the window.</p>

On the 21st December, when Pitt was in custody at Wandsworth Station, two females visited him, about two o'clock—I was in an empty cell, and in consequence of what I heard I followed the females to No. 2, Ballard Street, South Lambeth—we went up stairs, and found Raymond sitting at the fire in the front room—he had a black coat on, and there was a slight tear in his trousers at the back of the right leg—he had a boot on his left foot, and on his right a small boot, like a female's boot, cut in front—I said I should charge him with being concerned with Pitt in burglariously breaking into the house of Mr. Hoskins—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I told him two females had been there, one of whom was in the house, and that I heard Pitt ask her what time Jack came home—I did not know at the time that Jack was his name—she said, "He came home very late, and he sprained his foot in leaping over a high wall"—she also said that his trousers were torn—he said, "It is all very good, I know nothing about it"—I said that Pitt said they got through an empty house—Rayment said, "I know nothing about it"—I found this boot, the fellow to the one he had on, under the bed—I did not look at his ankle—he said that ho had rheumatism—I took this to the garden at the rear of Mr. Hoskins's house, compared it with several footprints there, and the breadth of the heel and this part of the boot corresponded—I could not get a distinct print.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Pitt's Defence.</hi> I had been drinking, and went into an unfinished house to sleep. I heard the policeman's rattle and thought there was a fire. I got over the wall and saw two constables with their staves out: I stooped down and they caught me.</p>

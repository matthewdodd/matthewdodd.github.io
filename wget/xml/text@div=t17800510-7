               <p>I keep a water cart at Hampstead, I was at the Cock and Crown at Hampstead. The prisoner asked me to carry a parcel which was in the Cock and Crown; that was on Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Do you know what that parcel was? - It appeared to be pewter wrapped up in a coarse cloth; it weighed about three quarters of an hundred weight. I carried it about twenty or thirty yards and put it into the boot of the Hampstead coach to come to London; this was between eight and nine in the morning; she desired me to take it from the Cock and Crown, and put it in the boot of the coach as fly as I could that the master of the coach might not see me put it in left the man should get turned away from his place.</p>
               <p>Was there any direction on it? - No.</p>
               <p>Did she go into the coach? - No. She went back with me to the Cock and Crown to give me half a quartern of gin for carrying it and putting it into the coach.</p>
               <p>Could you distinguish it to be pewter? - I just saw it and felt it and shook the plates together. The bottom parcel was large, the top smaller.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - No, I never saw her before in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw this man before.</p>
               <p>Gale. She came to town in my coach; I put her bundles in the coach myself. This parcel was put in another coach.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came to the Cock and Crown about ten minutes after seven as nigh as I can recollect on the Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I drive a Hampstead stage for Mr. Davis. She asked me what time I should go to town; I said about nine o'clock. She asked me to carry a parcel for her to London. I asked her where it was; she said she would go and fetch it, and when my coach was driven out she was walking backwards and forwards before my master's door. I asked her, where is your parcel? she said I have put it in the boot. I asked her if she went down in the coach; or if there was a direction on it? She said no, I might leave it at Mr. Chandler's, the corner of Great Russel-street, Tottenham-court-road. She said she had not done her business, and could not go then. I staid a while and going to town catched Mr. Gale's coach, and she was on the box of his coach. I thought it was very odd. We stopped at the corner of Russel-street, and Gale's coach drove up behind me; and she came to my coach and demanded the parcel; I took it out, it was very heavy; I rested it on the wheel when I let it down on the pavement, the plates chinked, the wrapper was open. I had the curiosity to see what it was. I saw it was pewter. She took the parcel from me, and paid me three pence for the carriage, and I lodged it in the shop. Chandler keeps a great grocer's shop, the corner of Russel-street.</p>

I am a surgeon—I examined the prosecutor on board—I found he had seven founds, and the ear was divided—one wound in the neck was, I suppose, four inches deep—they were inflicted with this knife—there is blood on it now—I continued to attend the prosecutor—the ship arrived on 16th March—the prosecutor is not recovered yet, and will not for many months—I knew the prisoner as a seaman on board—for a week or ten days before this he had been to the captain and to myself, saying that the crew were about to murder him, and to beat him; and we made particular inquiries into it, and had the men called to inquire as to the truth of the statement, and they all told me there was not the slightest foundation for it—I believe that he was certainly mistaken—we did not think it necessary to confine him—he came to the captain to be engaged, and I believed that he was not correct, and would be of very little use to us—I recommended the captain to bring him home as a passenger—I saw him afterwards—he still perseveres in that delusion—there is nothing else about the man—in every respect he seems perfectly healthy—for the first fourteen or twenty days he was very good.</p>

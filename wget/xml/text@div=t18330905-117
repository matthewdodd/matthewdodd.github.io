               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How do you know you had it then? A. By having examined the stock-book on that day - this parasol and the other things might have been sold, but that the bills would have shown - the prisoner said she bought some of these things at our shop before she came to my service - but the Irish linen cloth, we know, was in our possession on the 29th of April - there have been one or two mistakes made since I have been in business - but I forgot to mention the prisoner had a piece of ribbon in her hand, and was endeavouring to keep it from me - I told the magistrate she had it, but I do not think I said she was concealing it - these stockings might have been sold - I have two apprentices.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say the stockings and other things might have been sold? A. Yes; but if this Irish linen cloth had been sold, the stock-book would have shown it.</p>

            . I know the prisoner. She brought me a piece of linen once, and asked me if I would make her a few shillings on it, as she wanted to pay for two pair of shoes - I pawned it for 17s. at Mr. Barker's, in Houndsditch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined-by MR. DOANE. Q. Did she not say she bought that at Mr. Sharland's? A. Yes; out of her quarter's wages.</p>
               <p>MR. BARKER. I have two pieces of linen; one pawned on the 10th of May, and one on the 20th of July, for 17s. one was brought by the last witness - I cannot tell which it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know that one of them is the piece this witness pawned? A. I have had them both, but I have taken the duplicate off.</p>
               <p>ROBERT SHARLAND. This is the piece pawned on the 20th of July, it is mine, and here is my private mark on it - this other is also mine, and here is my mark on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If you sold cloth would it not have your mark on it? A. Yes; but if been booked; my book is here, and these had been sold they would have my brother, who keeps it.</p>

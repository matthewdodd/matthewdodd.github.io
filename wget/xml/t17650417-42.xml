Mr. Williams looked upon a shelf, and said he had lost a great many: he and I went to look for the thieves, and by Alderman Parson's gate we saw the prisoner and another sitting: I took hold of the prisoner, the other ran away: we took the prisoner to the watch-house, with a pair of shoes on his feet, and there were two pair lying by him; they had more shoes: the other man was buckling a pair of shoes on.</p>

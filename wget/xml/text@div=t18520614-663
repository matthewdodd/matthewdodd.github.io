               <p>78, St. Paul's Church-yard. Last Monday afternoon, 3rd June, the prisoners came about 3 o'clock together—one of them asked to look at some shawls, the others must have heard it—they were shown into the shawl-room, and some shawls were exhibited to them—I should say they looked at nearly a dozen, and ultimately one was sold to Mary Lynch for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the other two prisoners were by and saw what was going on—she gave me a sovereign and a half-sovereign—after selling the shawl, I folded it, and took it down stairs—I gave it to a young man to make out a bill—while this was going on I received some information; the prisoners had all come down and were waiting for the change—in consequence of what had been said, I went outside the counter to where the prisoners were standing, and saw a portion of a shawl, which I suspected was our property, hanging down about four inches below Seymour's shawl—I made the remark, "This will never do"—I told ber it was our shawl, and she immediately gave it up to me, this is it—I am quite certain it is one that I had shown them, here is our private mark on it made by myself—it is worth 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had not seen the prisoners before, to my knowledge.</p>

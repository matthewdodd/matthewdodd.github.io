                  </hi>. I am married, and live at No. 32, Milton Street. On 25th Aug., I was standing between Milton Street and Fore Street, about five minutes to 6 o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner take a ham from Mr. Fletcher's, go a little way up Milton Street, and give it to Watkins—they went up Flying Horse Yard, and when they came out they did not have the ham with them—I had known the prisoner before, and am quite sure I saw him take the ham.</p>

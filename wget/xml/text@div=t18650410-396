About eleven o'clock on that night I was on duty in Covent—garden, and saw the prisoner in New-street—I watched him into a public—house there—I looked in, he looked round and came out and walked towards Covent—garden market—I followed him to the Britania and saw him put 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the counter, Mrs. Skeate served him, she gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some coppers in change and made a communication to Mr. Skeate who went to the till—about twenty minutes afterwards the prisoner called for another pint of beer and put down another shilling, he got the change and Mr. Skeate gave him in custody—I searched him, he put his hand in his waistcoat pocket and took out a handful of shillings and put them in his mouth—I saw three—I threw him on his back but was unable to get it out for the blood gushed out of his mouth, but I could feel the shillings going down his throat—if I had not let go I should have choked him—I took him to the station, two sixpences and ten pence were found on him.</p>

On 18th October the prisoner came to my house about half past 7 in the evening—she asked for twopenny worth of gin and cloves—she gave me in payment a shilling—I tried it with my teeth and it bent double—I told her it was a bad one, and asked her if she had got any more like it—she pulled from her bosom a purse, in which were five good shillings and a half-crown—she paid me with a good shilling—I put the shilling which I had bent, on the fire, and it melted in a moment—the prisoner left my house—I was afterwards sent for to the rail way-station and found her in custody.</p>

I went into Mr. Hagger's house that evening; I saw the prisoner there—after she had gone out, Mr. Hagger made some communication to me—I went over to the railway-station—the prisoner was in the booking-office—I went to the paying place and found a shilling lying by itself there; I took it up; it was a bad one—the last witness went with me on the platform; he pointed out the prisoner to me and I gave her in custody—I asked her if she had any more money of that sort by her; she said "No"—I said, "You offered to pass one at the public-house close by, and now you come to do the same thing to us; I shall give you in charge"—she did not say anything—I went with her to the station, and when there the constable placed the shilling on the desk and the prisoner caught it up, put it in her mouth, and swallowed it—it was the same shilling that I had given to the constable.</p>

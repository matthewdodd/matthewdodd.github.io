                  </hi>. I live in Kentish-town. On 10th January I was going along Whitechapel about quarter before 6 o'clock, I met three men who surrounded me—I put my arms up to make my way through and one of them took my watch—when I found myself liberated my guard fell and the three were running across Whitechapel, I pursued them—the prisoner was one of them—two of them went down Whitechapel and one went the other way—I spoke to a policeman and he went up a court and brought the prisoner down to me—I gave him in charge, but he made his escape from the policeman and left his coat behind him. <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I did not take the watch. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It was one of the three took it; I don't know which.</p>

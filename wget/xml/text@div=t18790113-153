                  </hi>. I am assistant secretary to the London Society of Compositors—its object, amongst others, is that of a benevolent society for the relief of unemployed compositors—the rule referred to in this case is in Appendix B—it governs the mode in which application is to be made by an unemployed member—I produce the call-book and the unemployed claim-book—the prisoner's name is signed here on 5th October—I saw him sign it—a member places his initials, which the heading at the top explains shall stand for his signature, each morning, if the member is out of work—the prisoner signed this as being totally unemployed for five days, which entitled him to the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I placed "Nil "against the column "Earned or received," he having told me he had earned nothing—if I had known he had earned 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that week I should not have paid him anything.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The society encourages the members to get work—there is no difference between night and day work, except that night work is paid 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour more for—a man out of day work getting into night work would be disentitled to relief under the rules, with this qualification, that there are certain technicalities in our trade, and there are what are called grass hands and <hi rend="italic">casual</hi> hands—a grass hand is a man who has work in an office week after week on weekly newspapers, and a casual hand is a man daily at work—the rules never contain resolutions—this is a book of rules only—I produce a book containing a resolution affecting night work of August 31, 1875: "Resolved, that such earnings be not considered as affecting provident claims n—that does not refer to casual hands—then there is a resolution of November, 1877—I copied them out as there was no occasion to bring the book here—each member has one of the books of rules given him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner told us he had not earned anything that week—the resolution relating to casual hands does not apply to him, as he was a grass hand—I never received notice to produce the book—there is no distinction between day and night work as regards the right of members to relief.</p>

                  </hi>. I am overseer to Messrs.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I can give a fair idea as to how much was for day and how much for night work—they commenced work on Monday after<lb></lb>noon, and one job particularly we should not have done at night—it is called "Historical Credibility"—his share on that would be 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. day work—the paper he was on would be done, a great part, in the day—that week he must have had nearly full work.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Gate Street, Poplar, and am master of the <hi rend="italic">Lady Gertrude</hi>, lying in the West India Docks—Seymour was my second mate—on 3rd March he was on board and a communication was made to me by the first officer—I examined the lazarette under the cabin and found ten pairs of boots and 67lbs. of old Muntz's metal, which is the sheathing of a ship—there is a good deal of copper in it—Seymour was taken in custody, and I accompanied a detective to Murphy's shop on 4th March—we met Murphy outside the door and asked him if he had bought any metal lately from the <hi rend="italic">Lady Gertrude</hi>—he said, "No; I have bought no metal for some time—the officer said "did your wife buy any?"—he said, "I don't know; my wife is at Hammersmith, but she will be back if you call at 6 o'clock—it was then 4 o'clock—the officer said, "Do you keep a book?"—he said "Yes;" and on the way in he said, "By-the-by, I have; last Saturday I bought 80lbs. of a man who said he was mate of a ship"—this was Tuesday or Wednesday he went and spoke to somebody inside</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187404070027"></xptr>
               <p>and his wife made her appearance with the book—he asked me how much there was—I said "About 80lbs. or better; but I have not weighed it"—he said "There was more than that"—we could find no entry in the book, and the detective said "This is your wife; why did you tell me she was at Hammersmith?"—he said "That she had gone;" and then he said "I did not know she had returned"—he took the bag of metal out from behind some old <hi rend="italic">junk</hi>, just inside door—I could not see it before the <hi rend="italic">junk</hi> was taken away—there was about 67lbs. of metal, which I identified, and a few small bars which did not belong to me I returned to him—we get 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per 1b. for it—I have not sold any <hi rend="italic">lately</hi>; but that is the market price—I examined his book, but found no entry—he refused to go with the detective at first—there is a back entrance to the house from the wood-yard, and an entrance to the wood-yard from the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't think he said whether his wife had or had not bought any metal—he did not say "By-the-bye, my wife did buy 80lbs. on Saturday;" he said he did—this metal has been round a ship's top-gallantrail.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective K</hi>). I went with McDonald to Murphy's shop, and found him at the door—I asked him if he had bought any metal from on board the <hi rend="italic">Lady Gertrude</hi>, on the Friday or Saturday previous—he said "No; I have not bought any for some time"—I asked if his wife had bought any—he said "I don't know; my wife is at Hammersmith, and will be back at 6 o'clock"—I said "Have you a book?"—he said "Yes; look in the book and see whether there is any entry"—as he went across the shop he said "I recollect, I bought 80lbs. of a man who said he was mate of a ship, on Saturday—he then produced the metal, which McDonald identified—he then got the book and looked at it, and a female came from the parlour and stood by his side—I said "Is not that your wife?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Why did you say she was at Hammersmith?"—he said "She has been, and I did not know she had returned"—this is the book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is no such entry in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The shop is seven or eight yards across each way—he seems to have carried on a large trade—there was plenty of rope there—he deals in wood for ships—I know he is allowed in the Commercial Docks and it is a privilege to be permitted there—he said nothing about his wife having been in charge of the premises on the Saturday—there is a gate-keeper always on duty at the Docks.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner</hi>). I have pleaded guilty to stealing this metal and boots—I was the second mate of the <hi rend="italic">Lady Gertrude</hi>—I took them at 5 o'clock in the afternoon—I had three men to assist me often—I sold the metal to Murphy—two men assisted me on two occasions and three on the last—I have seen Murphy on board the vessel—he was not at the shop on the first occasion, his wife was there—that was soon after 5 o'clock—I saw him on the second occasion when it was getting dark, that was before 6 o'clock, he asked me whether we had any more, it was weighed and we got 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb. for it—there was about half a cwt. altogether—he paid for it and we left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I took some boots also from the ship and got some one to take them away—they were not sold, I gave them away—we delivered, I think, 19 lbs. of metal to the wife on the first occasion and she laid the money on the scale—I did not sec her on the second occasion, I saw Murphy, the metal was weighed, and we were paid at the same rate, and the same on the third occasion—very little conversation passed.</p>

On 8th July last when I came up from the cellar, I received a 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note from the last—I examined it—I noticed the name of James Johns oil the back of it—it appeared to have been just written—after looking at it for some minutes, and comparing it with another one, I took it to my next door neighbour, Mr. Pontifex—I brought it back again, and went to the prisoner he was in the parlour alone—I asked him where he got it from—after hesitating for a while, he said that he took it in the Edgware-road—I asked him where—he said, "At the Green Man public house"—I said, "From whom?"—he said, "From ft horee dealer there," but he did not know his in I told him that I was pretty Satisfied thai it was a forged one, and unless he gave some very satisfactory aocount of himself, I should give him in charge—I went out and lent for a policeman—I stood Outside the parlour door waiting for the policeman, and in the meantime the prisoner came out, of his own accord—I still told him that I was satisfied it was a good one, and he said I had changed it, that I had kept hid good one, and given him this bad one—the prisoner was standing in front of the bar when the policeman came, and I gave him in charge—he still said that I had changed it—I went with him and the policeman to the station to give the charge—as we were going up Long-acre the prisoner said, "The old man Was in front of the bar when you removed me, that I took the note from"—I said it was very strange he could not tell us that when the policeman wste going to remove him—at the station home he told the inspector that he met three or four horse dealers in Tottenham Court-road, and he gave one of them, meaning Smith, five sovereigns for it—he did not mention Smith's name, he called him, "The old man," and he said "This is the man's pockets book that I gave the five sovereigns to."</p>

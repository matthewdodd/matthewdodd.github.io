On Saturday the 8th of April, in the evening, I had been at my pay-table; two of my mates and I came together as far as Shadwell; by this means I got intoxicated. I fell in with the prisoner; she stopped me in the street; I told her to be gone; I would have nothing to do with her. A woman unknown to me asked her what she stopped me for. I was very much in liquor. The prisoner shoved the woman off the pavement, and told her to go about her business. The prisoner followed me through Shadwell-market; I turned round, and told her to go about her business again. I had not walked far before I fell sick. I walked to <placeName id="t18130602-25-crimeloc142">Pope's-hill</placeName>

I was sick, and laid my head against the wall, and sat down upon the stones, and I fell asleep. I looked up in about ten minutes, when I saw the prisoner standing over me. I told her if she was not gone I would give her in charge of the watchman as soon as he came past. She said, I was very bad, and she wanted to take care of me. I threatened her with the watchman again. She went away. I never saw her after that. I fell in a sound sleep. I had my property when I fell asleep I am confident.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fall asleep on the ground - A. Yes, on Pope's-hill. I continued asleep from between ten and eleven o'clock until between three and four in the morning. When I awoke I found my property was gone, another man's and my own.</p>
               <p>Q. What property - A. A five pound note and two one's. They were in a pocket-book in my side pocket. From that I went home. I got home about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from where you fell asleep to your home - A. About two minutes and a halfs walk from Shadwell-market to Ratcliffe-cross. As soon as I missed the property I went about to look who had got it. They took me to the officer, and Brown found the prisoner and the property.</p>

            . I am an officer of Shadwell office. Mr. Scott, the last witness, came to my house on Sunday morning; he told me he had lost his pocket-book and seven pounds I told him to be quiet, and I would find out the woman if he knew her. In coming from my house I saw him and a young woman with him, and two or three more shipwrights. The young woman said, she saw Mrs. Hicks with him, and by information I apprehended Mrs. Hicks in Ratcliffe-highway. I told her she must go with me; she was very unwilling to come. I told her if she was not the person I wanted she should come back, there was a person waiting to see her. When we reached the house where the prosecutor was waiting, the prisoner put her hand into her pocket, and pulled out these notes, and was making away to the fire with these papers. I made up to her, and caught these papers out of her hand. I said, you shall not destroy him. Then I took her into another room along with another woman. I called the prosecutor, and asked him whether he knew the woman. He pointed out the prisoner. I then searched her, and found a five pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Should you know the note that you lost if you were to see it again - A. No. I had two following numbers, five pound notes, from the bank. My master told me No. 5613 and 5614; the five-pound note and the other papers were altogether. I have never found the pocket-book. I believe that note to be mine; I will not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Saturday three weeks last I was going along Ratcliffe-highway; I saw the prosecutor and two women that he had with him; they walked into a house in Spring-street. I was going that way to Shakspeare's-walk. I was returning in about an hour afterwards; I saw the prosecutor and the same women again. When they saw me come up they bid him a good night, and went away. He took hold of me, and said he was very much intoxicated. I said he was a foolish man he did not go home; he said he had no home; he belonged to a ship called the Four Brothers, in Shadwell dock; the gate was locked; he could not get in to go on board of her, and while I was talking to him he dropped these papers. I picked them up, and gave them to him. He told me to take care of them for him till the morrow. He told me to come to him on board the ship the Four Brothers, and give them him; to ask for the carpenter. He had got some dirty linen I was to take home and wash for him. I never knew there was anything in these papers until the Sunday morning. I only saw the five pound note; I intended to take it to him on Sunday afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Newington. On Saturday night, 15th April, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was going along Waterloo-road, near Granby-street, and saw the prisoner—she came up to me alone, but in three or four minutes, three men came up and knocked me down; they were all three upon me, and when I was down they kicked me on the jaw—while they were on me, I had the prisoner's hand in mine, with my watch in it, which had been in my waistcoat pocket, fastened by a metal chain, which I found broken—the men kept <hi rend="italic">firing away</hi> at me as hard as they could—I had to fight very hard—I hallooed, "Police"—a policeman came, and the men ran away—I kept hold of the prisoner's hand, and gave her in charge, with the watch in her hand—I took it from her hand, and gave it to the constable—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it; the chain remained with me.</p>

I am a partner in the firm of Walker and Howell, of 40, Broad-street Buildings—I am accountant to the Liquidators of the Unity Bank—I produce the charter of that bank, dated 9th January, 1856—I have here the minutes of the appointment of the two defendants respectively—Mr. Terry was appointed manager on 18th August, 1857—there is no resolution on the minutes appointing him; there is only a reference to it, on 18th August—Mr. Burch had formerly been a clerk in the bank, and so had Mr. Terry; I think Mr. Terry was the accountant—Mr. Burch was appointed secretary on 23d January, 1861—he had acted in the capacity of secretary previous to that appointment—I produce the original transcript of the balance-sheet of 30th June, 1862, the balance-sheet, and the detailed balance-sheet; it is in Mr. Burch's writing—it shows a nett balance of profit on the half year of 3, 215<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have carefully gone through the books for the six months previously, and there had been no profit made—there had been a loss then from the commencement of the bank of 130,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is an item in the balance-sheet (No. 3) of 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of assets made up of bills discounted, loans to customers, &amp;c.—the bank had a customer of the name of Ollivier—he owed 419<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 30th of June, 1862—there were four dishonoured bills of Ollivier's for that amount—they were dishonoured in 1861—in the past-due bill-book these four bills are entered as past-due bills, and that is entered by Terry—op<lb></lb>posite there is the word "forgery, "but there is nothing to show when that word was written—on the back of one of the dishonoured bills there is a receipt for a dividend of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—that sum of 419<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was carried to the item of 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in the committee minute-book of the 19th of February, 1861, there is an entry in Burch's handwriting to the effect that Ollivier should be prosecuted for forgery—Mr. Alderman Mechi and several other of the directors were present when that resolution was passed—in the Board minute-book of the following March, there is an entry also in Burch's handwriting to the effect that the board had resolved to offer a reward of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the apprehension of Ollivier—there are twenty-four dishonoured bills of T. Harrison and Co. in 1860 and 1861, amounting to 3, 760<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and these are entered in the past-due bill account from the general ledger as past-due bills—five of these bills amounting to up wards of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. are accepted by a person named Brock—there was a bankruptcy dividend upon them in November, 1861, of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound—that was the last dividend—the total dividend was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there are live other bills dishonoured by a Mr. Wright 1860, for upwards of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were four dividends paid</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On what theory is that deducted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The general ledger only gives the balance of current accounts after the overdrawn accounts have been deducted, or father all the sums which are drawn out are deducted from the account, and when customers draw money out of the Bank and have no funds they reduce their amount, so that the reduced amount only appears—all the overdrawn accounts are due to them also; but in consequence of the books not being balanced, or from some oversight, the amount of the balance has been copied instead of the debt, being an increase of 13, 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the overdrawn account is placed on the other side as an asset.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Terry ordered it to be subtracted, but there is an irregularity, the books not balancing—I do not know how much is due to the customers and how much is not—I am only speaking of the custom of books generally.</p>

               <p>it is brought forward on the credit side—it showed the true position of the bank, that it had made a loss—a dividend of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per share is recommended—I don't see that the report recommends the 38,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be written off, but it was written off and the reduced amount of capital is subsequently placed—I have looked at all the balance-sheets, and no such item appears in any of them down to 1862—on 25th January, 1861 there is a resolution stating that the loss as shown in previous balance-sheets was now written off the capital account—on the same day I see there is a resolution appointing Mr. Burch secretary—I found this paper among the papers of the bank; it appears to be a rough balance-sheet of December, 1860—it is in Mr. Burch's writing—it contains "losses on bills in suspense, chief office—old, 10, 585<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., ditto new, 3, 504<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the words "old" and "new" are erased—both those items are carried into item No. 3 in the balance-sheet of June, 1862—there were dividends received on them in the meantime, but there is a difficulty in tracing them because the credits were not passed in the proper way—in round numbers, about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of dividend has been received altogether—Mr. Sykes was the manager of the west-end branch of the bank; Mr. Humphreys owed that branch a certain amount—the past-due bills at that branch amounted to 7, 790<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the overdrawn accounts came to 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—both these sums are included in the item of 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the balance-sheet of June, 1862, as issued by the head-office—there was a check for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid to Morgan in error, which is also included in the 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a lost 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note is included in the same item—in April, 1861, a remittance of 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was lost in its transmission from the head-office to the west-end branch, and that is also included in the 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the cash actually in band at the bank on the 30th of June, 1862, was 29, 680<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and uncleared checks 6, 245<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was a deficiency of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>". in the cash on the 30th of June which turned out to be a bill received of Perls, of which an entry is made, "less error, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." to make the day-book balance.</p>

               <p>trust-deed for the benefit of his creditors which was signed by Terry, for 5, 209<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am aware that Mr. Sterne has since made an arrangement with his creditors to pay twenty shillings in the pound; but the bank would not have any advantage from this arrangement, because they had already given him a full release—there has been a final loss of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have acted as accountant for Mr. Sterne—I believe the arrangement is a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> one, and will be carried out—when Mr. Terry was under examination before the liquidators, he explained that the reason why Mr. Sterne wished to have his account transferred to that of Mr. Terry was that he was in some dispute with his partner, and he was afraid the money would be attached if the account were kept in his own name-various payments have been made, since this balance-sheet was published, that would reduce the balance by 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. The item, No. 1, in the balance-sheets always appeared in the same way, so for as I can ascertain, but improperly so—the bank always debited themselves with a reserve-fund for losses—on the 14th of May there was a board-meeting, at which the list of overdrawn accounts was taken into consideration, and it was resolved that they should be scrutinized, and that such accounts as were considered irrecoverable should be written off, and proceedings taken to reduce the amount of the remainder—that was done, as appears by the minute of a subsequent board-meeting—in the balance-sheet of 30th April, 1857, here is, "Bills discounted, loans to customers, and other securities, 185, 253<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>"—I can only guess as to whether the post-due bills are included in that, there is no such item, but I believe 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for post-due bills is included in that—at that time Mr. Chambers was manager, and both the defendants were clerks under him—I believe that Mr. Chambers introduced Mr. Terry to the bank—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at the general ledger</hi>)—on 2d May, 1857, there were 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of past-due bills at the chief-office, and 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the branches—the bank paid 23, 648<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for preliminary expenses, the first year they commenced business—besides this, they made bad debts to the amount of 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in the first two years their losses were over 38,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at the time that Mr. Chambers resigned there was a large amount of bad bills in existence, but they had not then arrived at maturity—this 38,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was written off as bad debts on December 31st, 1860—33,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. appeared to have been lost while Mr. Chambers was manager—Alderman Mechi was the governor of the bank—in the first year the bank begin business, he borrowed 23, 863<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—he always paid the Bank of England rate of interest—a gentleman named Baylis was paid 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for promotion-money—that was included in the preliminary expenses—he was also to have had 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year as manager for life, but the matter was compromised for 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Alderman Mechi originally had a salary of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year as governor; but when the bank got into difficulties, he gave up the remuneration—MR. Eyre was an original director, Mr. Bower was not—at the first meeting I find the names of Tayloe, Stone, Eyre, Baylis, and Mechi—the names are incorporated in the charter—Mr. Hay ward was one—besides the 32, 528<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the loan to Mr. Mechi of 23,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Mr. Galand borrowed money—the bank never made a profit in any half-year, but most of the balance-sheets show a profit—by the first year's balance-sheet a profit was shown, of 2, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that included the past-due bills—nearly the whole of the subsequent half-year's balance-sheets showed profits, and those balance-sheets were published by the chairman and directors to the public—the directors received in fees altogether 2, 987<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and other sums intrusted to them by way of gratuities by the shareholders—there was one vote of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in addition to that—they were votes expressing confidence they drew</p>

Bazin's—between September, 1859, and 5th August, 1862, the total amount borrowed by Mechi and Bazin was 7, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over and above the 23,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he owed that enormous sum when he took the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. fees—Mr. Deputy Bower, another of the directors, also kept an account—he became a director in 1857—he borrowed money from the bank to the amount altogether of 44, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. between that period and 6th May, 1862—he did not have it all at one time, and he generally kept a large sum lying idle at the bank—Mr. Hay ward, another director, borrowed 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in February, 1860—Mr. Eyre was one of the directors from the beginning, and a bill of his for 1, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. seemed to have not been paid, and to have been passed through the accounts—I could not say whether it was a dishonoured bill—it was in November, 1859, included among the past-due bills, but it was ultimately paid—Mr. Eyre also had loans from the bank between June 19th, 1857, and July 1862, to the amount of 16,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but never more than 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at one time—Major Mulkern was one of the directors—he had loans to the amount of 4, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his son also borrowed from the bank about 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at the time of the balance-sheet of June 1862, the directors owed the bank about 26,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but 23, 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of this amount was owing by Alderman Mechi, and the firm of Mechi &amp; Bazin owed 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides—200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing by MR.

Mechi, Howard, Bower, and Mulkern were, present, and a letter was read from Mr. Turner, calling attention to the account of Levi, Heath, &amp; Co.—by the committee-book of 27th April, 1858, the solicitor was to furnish a quarterly report of all matters of business in his hands—Mr. Tayloe was the solicitor to the bank—he was not examined before the Lord Mayor—by the board minute-book of 21st May, 1858, I find, "Present, Messrs.

Attention having been directed to the list of overdrawn accounts at the chief office, it was resolved that the list be sanctionized, and such as are irrecoverable be written off, and that appli<lb></lb>cation be made for payment of such as are above a month's standing and are recoverable"—on the 14th of July, 1858, there is a minute, "The report and balance-sheet to be presented to the shareholders at the second annual meeting, on the 16th mat, was discussed and decided on"—at this board meeting Alderman Mechi, Mr. Bower, Mr. Eyre, Mr. Mulkern, and Mr. Hayward were present—on the 7th January, 1859, the directors expressed a wish to have "a report from Mr. Tayloe of the matters in his hands concern<lb></lb>ing the old past due bills"—on 18th January, 1859, "The report and balance<lb></lb>sheet to be presented to the shareholders was discussed and decided on"—at the board meeting of 25th January, 1859, "The report was presented by MR.

(<hi rend="italic">No</hi>. 3) contained the past-due bills, &amp;c.—the defendants were arrested upon a warrant applied for by me on 2d September, 1864; I acted simply upon the instructions I received from the solicitors—the bank has paid all its creditors and depositors every farthing; I should say, altogether, about 250,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—about 200,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been paid to the depositors and creditors—13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been returned on each share, and I should say about another 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will be returned, or a little less—that will make about 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a share, in round numbers—the investments in the chief offices and branches are developed in this balance-sheet at 24,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they realized about 8, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from the Railway Company for the Cannon-street premises—that shows a loss of about 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have heard Alderman Mechi state that he expected Perl's estate would realise 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound.</p>

Mr. Giffard. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As to this sum of 38,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was written off, there is an entry of that in the books, as I understand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is—after it had been written off, it could not very well appear in any other way unless it appeared every time—the bank represented themselves as better off by 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because they had to account on the opposite side for a less sum through reducing their capital; they had lost 38,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if they had placed the capital at the correct amount, they would have had to account on the opposite side for the 38,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which had been lost; it would still have re-mained, but it would have remained as a loss, and would have shown the position of the bank—I only know the way in which Burch kept the books by different inquiries that I have made, not from himself; I have never asked him a question—I have seen all the rough day-books, and noticed the different handwritings—the defendants both went to the London and Middlesex Bank as soon as the Unity shut up—Terry did not remain there down to the time of this charge—the London and Middlesex Bank is being wound up now; I am winding it up—Burch remained there till the end of August, 1864; he was assisting the directors in winding it up—I first saw Mr. Eyre's memorandum at the Mansion-house, while he was being examined as a wit-ness in this prosecution—there are a great number of these weekly summaries or reports, all exactly in the same form—my attention has been called to this one of 24th June, 1862—the past-due bills there are put down at 12, 682<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is put down to the left side; the balances at the right are the credit balances—there is a blank left opposite the investments—past-due bills would be an investment—interest on deposit-receipts would also be an investment—"bills discounted "appears in the debtor column; should understand that—if you did not see the heading" balance debtor and creditor, "very likely you might imagine there were no past-due bills; the first page represents the past-due bills as a blank, because during the week there happened to be no past-due bills, and this was a weekly statement—the other is the actual balance—I have not looked to as certain if the account is kept in the same way throughout in these weekly accounts—it is in blank here (<hi rend="italic">looking at another</hi>)—if there had been any additional past-due bills, they would have appeared there—in order to know what the debtor-balance referred to I should refer to the general ledger—there is a detailed statement</p>

"bills discounted, loans to customers, "&amp;c—I have all the detailed entries before me—the general ledger gives the past-due bills—from the date of the balance-sheet of 1857, down to the writing off of the item of 38,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that item always appeared either in the form of past-due bills or losses; and from the year 1860 no such item has appeared—there was a regular set of banker's books kept—if I was endeavouring to find out what bills were good and what were bad by the books, I should first ascertain when the bills were dishonoured, and trace them all out; the discount-ledger would show the original entries; and having found out when they were dishonoured, I should examine the past-due bills account, and see whether any final dividend had been received, and should then consider the balance that ought, to be written off as irrecoverable—if you wanted to ascertain the amount of cash in hand, you would refer to the general ledger and see what the balance was, according to the cash account, and then the cash in the cashiers' tills ought to agree with that amount, and if it did not, the cash-article</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then that would give greater facilities for seeing what bills were past-due? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would—any one looking at the ledger would see what the state of things was—a detailed account is given in the general ledger of all these bills—in the balance-sheet they have copied the totals, and added them to the bills discounted—that is a mode of keeping them alive in the books without writing them off—they could not very well be written off without the sanction of the directors.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The general ledger, I suppose, consists of a good many volumes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are two volumes; one goes up to 1859, and the other, to the close of the bank—I believe the general ledger is written up every week, and sometimes twice a-week; it is in Mr. Burch's writing, posted up from the day-book—the amount of Bunyard's account, 41,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., includes renewals in many instances, over and over again—the discount ought to be larger on renewals—I think with respect to the two loans of 965<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 755<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., no in-tercet was charged—the note of discount in Bunyard's case was always the same—the rate of discount varied very much according to the class of customers—I see here is an instance; S. Bridgland is charged 3 percent, and the very next customer is charged 10, and the next 5, I should say the rate of discount to the directors was rather more favourable than to the other customers, but their bills were looked upon as better than the others; they were charged the bank rate, and others were charged higher—Harrison and Co. was charged an average rate of 7 1/2—the discount varies with the length a bill has to run; it ought to do so, at all events—I don't say that rule is always followed—a bad bill ought not to be discounted at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At all events it refers to this one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the auditors would find the over-due bills included in the "bills discounted loans to cus<lb></lb>tomers, &amp;c, 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that item, unless an explanation was given to them as to how the figures were arrived at, would not have agreed with the books—they could not have compared them—it would not have agreed with the books unless it had included the over-due bills; so with the cash in hand, it must have included the documents I have referred to, to make up the 38,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And with regard to the amount due on current and other accounts must they have known that that was not the true account, but the account less the amount of over-drawn accounts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because when they compared that with the general ledger those items would have agreed—they could not take all the customers' ledgers, and run all the balances out; that would be a very difficult thing, and take some considerable time—they would not understand that the amount ought to have been increased by the over-drawn bills; they would consider it was a balance, and the proper way of expressing it—I have no doubt that a good many accountants would have passed it, simply because they were not brought up in a bank—the manuscript balance-sheet and the detailed balance-sheet of 30th June are in Burch's writing, figures and all;</p>

I was governor and chairman of the Unity Bank from 1856—I remember the two defendants entering the bank at its commencement—Mr. Terry entered the bank as chief accountant, and Mr. Burch was cashier—at that time Mr. George Chambers was the manager—I did not recommend the defendants for employment in the bank; neither of them—they were unknown to me previous to that time—they were selected as having the best testimonials out of about 150 from different banks—I remember Mr. Chambers retiring from the management in August, 57—I had a conversation at that time with Mr. Terry about his becoming the manager—I recommended him for the appointment, believing him to be then the best man for that position—the bank had at that time sustained a variety of losses in '57—I took steps to communicate to the shareholders the losses that the bank had sustained—at that time the bank was fully able to pay its depositors—it could not repay its capital to the proprietors, because a sum of money had been lost by Mr. Chamber's management equal to be<lb></lb>tween 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was, in fact, the cause of his dismissal or retirement—he was unsuccessful in discounting—upon Mr. Terry being appointed certain rules were made by the directors, and entered in the minute-book for the guidance of the manager—(<hi rend="italic">The minute of 19th January 1858, was here read, containing a recommendation from Mr. Eyre at to the duties of the manager, which recommendation was decided to be acted upon</hi>)—I believe that entry was written by Mr. Burch himself for the purpose of showing to Mr. Terry—from that time Mr. Burch fulfilled the duties of secretary, though the formal appointment was not made for some time after<lb></lb>wards—the secretary was always present at the board meetings—I have given directions to both the defendants with reference to the preparation of the balance-sheets—I requested them to make a true and faithful and uncoloured report of the state of affairs of the bank—it was the duty of the manager and the secretary to prepare the balance-sheets from the books, which the directors never interfered with—when they were made out they were pre<lb></lb>sented to the board, and the directors did not make any alteration in them or interfere with them in any manner, but merely ordered them to be printed—the directors examined them before they ordered them to be printed, by reading them, and seeing the details therein expressed—we took no steps to verify the items, but relied entirely on the manager and the secretary and the auditors—the whole of the accounts were submitted to the auditors prior to the balance-sheets coming to the directors—as a fact, we never tested the balance-sheets in any way by the books; we relied upon</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). I recollect the balance-sheet of June, 1862, being placed before me, and that it showed a profit—I did not then know the bank was in difficulties—I believed the profit to have been truly realized, that the balance-sheet showed a true statement of the affairs of the bank, and that the three items in question, namely, 207, 668<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in respect of loans to customers, bills discounted, &amp;c.; 159, 392<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the amount due on current and other accounts; and 38, 715<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as cash in hand, were truly stated—I knew that overdue bills were comprised in the item 207, 668<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I also assumed they were placed at their proper value as the instruc<lb></lb>tions were given—there are overdue bills in every bank, but I certainly did not know that overdue bills that were forged were included in that item—The instructions given by the directors were that all the past-due bills were to be placed at their true value, making such allowance as was believed to be correct, as to the dividends that might be returnable on; them—I held 537 shares in the Unity Bank—the total number of the shares was 3,000, and I held more than a sixth of the whole capital of the bank—I recollect the failure of the Royal British Bank, and purchasing about that time a large number of the shares of the Unity Bank—it was then that I borrowed a considerable portion of the 23,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the bank to buy the shares; giving the bank at the same time ample security, independently of the shares themselves—that was done at the carnest request of the then manager, Mr. Chambers—there was a great panic at that time, and our bank was only four months old—I made all the circumstances of the loan known to the shareholders at the time—the secretary always attended the board and entered the minutes—loans and renewals of loans were brought under the attention of the directors, as were also discharges by the bank of debts due to the bank—the release to Bunyard of 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was totally unknown to us—I had no knowledge that Terry had given a release for that debt—it was never brought to the attention of the board while I was present—no entry of the 996<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. transaction with Bunyard was entered on the minutes or brought to my attention—I had told Terry I did not like the appearance of Bunyard, and that he must be very careful with respect to him—he said proper inquiries had been made, and that the securities were good. I think Perl's case was brought before us, and that Terry was authorized to take a composition, Perl having failed—it was hoped Perl would pay 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound, but those hopes were never realized—he paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—the debt was 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I did not know that Terry had signed the deed of composition for 2, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HOWELL</hi> signed for those bills he expected to be dishonoured, the others he expected to be taken up by the acceptors)—There was no concealment in Perl's case of which I am aware—I frequently spoke to Terry as to Lowenthal's account—it was constantly a subject of discussion and anxiety at the board—Mr. Burch was always present on these occasions—we often referred to the mauager</p>

               <p>as to whether he was satisfied with the securities and the <hi rend="italic">bond fides</hi> of the transactions—his replies were satisfactory—I did not know Ironsides or that he was a customer of the bank—I did not know that some of Lowenthal's bills were substitutions for the acceptances of Ironsides, or given up for those acceptances—I remember F. W. Hall being a debtor to the bank—his debt was discussed at the bank in the presence of Burch, and sometimes of Terry—Terry was called in and warned to be careful with respect to Hall—he said he had confidence in him and was satisfied, or words to that effect—we knew nothing of him ourselves—the manager was not generally present at the meetings; we sent for him when we wanted him—we sat twice a week, and in the interim we called frequently at the bank—he had access to the minutes when he chose—my instructions as to discounting bills were to prefer security before profit—there was a book called the "Cash Article Book"—it was generally read over week by week at the board meetings, but I am not quite sure it was read latterly—the secretary read it—I have no recollection of an item in the book of 1, 095<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in respect to a cheque of Sterne, drawn on Martin, being read over—I could not say how many entries were read—they ought to have been all read, if at all—the book was left on the table, four or five directors sitting round—we never looked at the book—I am quite sure Sterne's name was not called out, or it would have attracted our attention—directions were given after the 30th of June, 1862, by me or Mr. Eyre, to prepare a book containing a list of debts due to the bank—the one produced is it—it is partly in Burch's and partly in Terry's handwriting—the book begins in January, 1863, and pur<lb></lb>ports to show the debts, good, bad, and. indifferent, due to the bank—it was certainly not with my knowledge, or that of the directors, that the debts of Sterne, Bunyard, Lowenthal, Harris, or Jabez Wood, were omitted from that book—the object of the book was to show what was owing to the bank and what was paid—I recollect that book being produced to the directors, it was the subject of discussion, sometimes with the manager, and sometimes with the secretary—in February, 1864, I recollect going to a meeting of shareholders, and having a conversation with Burch before, going—that was on the 9th of February—I asked him what had become of our assets, our money in the Unity, adding that I could not understand why we owed the London and Middlesex money, and that there ought to be money of our own, or words to that effect—he produced a small book in which were several names of persons represented as owing us money, including Lowenthal and others—I had believed that those debts had been paid long before—I expressed my surprise, and asked why he had not mentioned that before—he replied that he did not like to do so—shortly afterwards, on the same day, I communicated the facts to the directors—Terry was spoken to on the subject during the day—he was called to account about it, but I could not state what took place so well as the other directors—I lost quite 18,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the bank—that was by the depreciation of the shares; in fact every year I was losing about 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by these conceal ments.</p>

               <p>and originally 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I knew that Terry had been sixteen years in the bank of Jones Loyd and Co., and we had perfect confidence in him—I knew the item 207, 668<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. contained past-due bills and cheques in suspense, but I did not know the exact amount of those bills and cheques—I have no doubt the amount was stated to us—it was 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, but I cannot recollect—I did not know that it amounted to nearer 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but the amount, whether 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was known to me and the other directors—I am one of the liquidators by virtue of my office as a director under the charter—we, as directors, do not oppose the prosecu<lb></lb>tion, nor do we sanction it; we do neither—there are three other directors besides myself, namely, Mr. Deputy Bower, Mr. Eyre, and Mr. Hayward, of the Minories, all four well-known gentlemen in the City of London—we have taken no part in the prosecution; we did not oppose it—the prosecution has been instituted by the direction of the Master of the Rolls—we, as directors, knew of the gross amount of past-due bills and cheques in suspense.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This, you know, is a celebrated item, and will always be so in the banking world—I mean "bills discounted, loans to customers, &amp;c. 207, 668<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—why did not the directors divide that item into three parts, so as to show what was cash, what were past-due bills, and what were cheques in suspense? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We placed the item in that way as all other banks do, or did up to that time, latterly there has been an alteration in some—there always must be past-due bills in a bank, and a great many whose realization must always be uncertain, depending as they must do on a great many circumstances and contingencies which I think I need not illustrate—some bankrupts' estates are occasionally twenty years in being wound up—I was not aware that the forged bills were carried into the balance-sheet as good"—we knew that Ollivier's and Frasi's bills were forged—they ought to have been written off—I do not know that they were—the general instructions of the directors were to write off what was bad—I mean to say, that a manager of his own accord would be at liberty to write off debts that he thought were bad, with<lb></lb>out the sanction of the directors; I would call it deducting from the profits of the half-year—the instructions were to make a true and faithful account of the affairs of the bank; I frequently; have those instructions—I did not suspect that the manager was doing otherwise—every half-year I charged the defendants to make out a true and faithful balance-sheet—the expression "preferring security to profit" which I have used may be found in <hi rend="italic">Gilbert's Book on Banking</hi>—that, at all events, was my rule—I did it to give confi<lb></lb>dence to our manager; he looked to me very much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose the name of an acceptor was forged, but the drawer and endorser were good, you would not write it off would you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If there was a prospect of getting the money from it, certainly not—if a bank was unfortunate enough to have 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of forged bills, the manager could write that off; he must write it off to make up the balance-sheet—I think it would be very necessary to give some account to the shareholders if there was so large an amount as that—if there was a prospect of getting the money, you would put it at its estimated value.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any written authority anywhere for writing off any amount except for the 38,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I think not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say on that occasion, "I think it is necessary that I should distinctly and unmistakably state that the conduct of the directors in the management of this bank has been honest and consistent, and of the utmost regularity?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe I did—there were very-likely cries of "No, no, "to that—I also said, "Gentlemen, with respect to the staff, the directors have no knowledge of, nor do they believe in any irregularity on the part of the staff of the Unify Bank"—I believed so at the time—it afterwards took Mr. Howell, the accountant, four months to go over the books to ascertain the true state of affairs—I thought it very strange that the defendants should have carried over those accounts without letting us know—it was not at the wish of the bank that I became Sheriff—I don't think I borrowed 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to pay my shrievalty expenses; I may have done so—my shrievalty cost me 4, 6002.—if the directors had borrowed all the capital, it would have been for the benefit of the shareholders, and nothing would have been lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say this at a meeting of shareholders on 16th July, 1858:—"Allow me to say the directors do not trust entirely either to the clerks or the manager; once a month they count all the cash themselves, each director taking his turn; every Tuesday we examine every bill that is dis<lb></lb>counted, and the particulars of every loan that is proposed; the expenditure also constantly undergoes a most rigid investigation"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is so—the cash was not always counted once a month—that was our duty—it was very often counted—it might in some instances have been omitted—we counted the notes and gold—we verified the cash in the tills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember Deputy Bower, one of the directors, saying at the same meeting, "Twice a week, gentlemen, every Tuesday and Friday: I am the more entitled to say this because some question has arisen with regard to a monthly audit of the accounts—twice a week, I say, we might always have been found at our posts: not that our efforts have been confined to those days, but on those days there has been a regular examination made of what has been done in the intervening day. Now, when we have made that ex<lb></lb>amination, and made it, as I know it has been made, correctly; when, and in addition, we have every week made a practical audit by counting the cash, I must say I do not see how any other gentleman coming there monthly could have done the work better than it has been done by ourselves. "<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he was wrong in saying every week, it was every month—I have no doubt he said so—they are <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> reports, and copies were seat to all the shareholders—I think it very likely that the shareholders proposed an audit once a month, and very likely the directors opposed it—on 21st January, 1859, I addressed a meeting—I no doubt said, "I think I may very safely congratulate you on the improved state of your affairs through the excellent management of Mr. Terry, combined with the careful supervision of the directors, the bad debts of the past year, instead of being 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., are under 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. It must be borne in mind that we are not in a position to pick our paper; we are not in the position of the old-established banks, who can take in the largest and the best fish, and reject all the small ones. It is, however, the desire and aim, both of the manager and the directors, not so much to extend our business, as to take care that all the business done shall be <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi>, respectable, and legitimate. Let me add to what I have already said, that the directors still abstain from charging any fees for their services to the bank. They are working very hard, attending very closely to their duties, for the present without any remuneration; but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186504100165"></xptr>
               <p>if the bank should succeed, as I believe it will, I am quite sure they will receive a fair remuneration from the shareholders at the proper time. The directors are determined to devote close and untiring attention to your affairs. We have always done so up to the present time; We read every letter, we look at every bill, we devote a good deal of time to your interests, and we shall continue our efforts in the hope that are long they will be crowned with happy results."—That is perfectly true—I have mo doubt I said so, and that I meant so—I heard Deputy Bower say at thai meeting—"You all know that we have stack to the bank; yes, almost like leeches have we stuck to it. We have attended twice a week without any remune ration; we examine everything; we take an interest in everything; there can be no retrogression without our knowledge, and 10 advance without our helping to promote it We come before you with a can did statement of our affairs to the last penny. If there had been any lost we should have informed you of it."—At the half-yearly meeting, on the 27th January, 1860, I said, "Past experience has made us wise. We have learnt mot to place too much confidence in any man. We have got an excellent manager (we take care that all who are employed are not merely testimonial men, but persons who have been tried before), but we shall watch even our manager closely; and I contend that, in a concern of this kind, no man should be entrusted with an unlimited amount of responsibility."That is quite true, and acting on that we appointed Mr. Burch as the eye of the Board—I asked for 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for remuneration for my services and my losses—there was no doubt consider able discussion about it—I could not say on what day it was—I said without that I would not consent to the transfer to the London and Middlesex, and I was at liberty to do that as a shareholder—none of the directors asked for remuneration—we were to get 10, 00<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., by the transfer on a certain contingency, and I asked for 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of that sum I worked for it, too, and I should have had plenty of sympathy from the shareholdaers, if that had been put into my pockets—the June balance-sheet was no doubt considered at our meetings—we always looked at the balance-sheets and talked them over, but we never altered or interfered with them—I have mo recollection on one occasion, when we wished to have a dividend, Mr. Terry entertaining a strong objection to it—if I stated so in July, 1860, it was so certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINB</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say you appointed Burch as Secretary to superintend the manager? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As the eye of the board—the former manager resigned in 1857—Burch came first as a clerk, and he was afterwards appointed secretary—he had first 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a year, and the manager had 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I consider my duty, as a director, was to direct and supervise, to receive the reports of our confiden<lb></lb>tial officers, and to form opinions on those reports.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And not to inquire any further into the matter. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not say that—on the contrary, I inquired whenever there was in my mind a necessity for inquiry—we certainly did not consider it our duty to look at the books of the bank—they were very numerous and voluminous, but at the Board meet<lb></lb>ings we had all the correspondence read, and we had a weekly statement furnished by our confidential servants—we must have believed what they said, or we must have discharged them—we took their word for the repre<lb></lb>sentation of certain facts—the books were read to us—we looked at the letter-books occasionally—the correspondence was a most important part of the business of the bank—we could not become clerks or managers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose you looked at the weekly returns? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Closely, in all their details—they were our guides, for we did not know what we were about without them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you take away, or have you got a copy of the weekly return of August, 1862? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I have taken no document away belonging to the bank—I am quite sure I did not take away a return of August, 1862—I have not a single one in my possession.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say at the half-yearly meeting on the 20th July, 1860: "The directors had adopted the prudent policy of endeavouring to do a safe business rather than a very extended one of a less certain character, and he was happy to state as the result, that the losses from bad debts did not ex<lb></lb>ceed the average small amount which had hitherto occurred under the excel<lb></lb>lent management of Mr. Terry. On this, the termination of the third year under the new management, he had looked into the books with the view of ascertaining whether and to what extent they had improved their condition under the new <hi rend="italic">regime</hi>, and the result of his inquiry was so favour-able that he ventured to lay a few figures on the subject before the meeting. "Is that true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never said anything but what I believed to be true—I call that looking into the books—it was made by our confidential manager; if you cannot trust him, who can you trust—perhaps I ought to have said I looked into the accounts—I consider that the looking at the weekly state<lb></lb>ments produced to us by the proper authorities was looking into the books—we did not employ a detective over our manager—we had all the bills before us weekly, and every loan that was granted, as far as we knew—there was also produced before us every week what was called the customers' account, showing what persons' accounts were overdrawn, and how much the discount for the week was—we should not have fulfilled our duties if we had not had such an account—I had an account in my own name at the head office—I did not draw on that account, it was merely in connexion with the shares—Mechi and Bazin had an account at the chief office, and also at the West-end branch—Mr. Bazin, my partner, had also a separate account—I did not operate on his account—I think it is very likely that I sometimes used his private account for my own purposes—I knew that at times we overdrew our account at the chief office, and at times at the west branch, but my partner managed the financial department altogether; I had nothing to do with the finances of the business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you bring out the money from that West-end branch and pay it into the chief office to give your account there the appearance of a balance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think at the close of a half-year every one likes to make their balance look pretty well, and on one occasion that was done; but the bank suffered nothing by it—whenever our account was overdrawn I insisted on being charged for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you do the same thing sometimes to show a balance at the western branch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That may have been done; I do not know; my partner managed the financial department.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you in that way always appear to have a respectable balance at both? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very likely; the cheques passed—my partner managed the financial transactions entirely—I did not interfere; he had the entire management—it was without my authority—I should not have objected to it; it was a very innocent affair—I did know it; but I did not authorise him to do it—I knew it at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So that there would appear a balance at both offices when the balance was against you at both? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The cheques were passing and would be paid—the appearance of the audit would be that we had a balance in our favour, not very considerable—we were not overdrawing; the cheques were passing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing those cheques had not been drawn, would you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186504100167"></xptr>
               <p>appear to have overdrawn at both places? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say; I am not sure—the cheques were passing to put both accounts in credit, when in fact they were not in credit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>.<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not done to falsely represent that you had a balance, when in point of fact you were overdrawing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I be<lb></lb>lieve it was a very innocent affair—it had that effect—it was done with that intention, no doubt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have mentioned the examination of the books by the directors; will you state exactly what was done when you met on the Tuesday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the Tuesday the loans were considered—they were brought before us for our sanction—there was a loan book, in which was placed the amount granted, subject to approval—those were new loans—Mr. Burch mentioned the name of the person applying for the loan and the amount and sometimes Mr. Terry, and the subject was discussed amongst the directors—the manager was called in when it was necessary to get information on the sub<lb></lb>ject, to enable them to decide—I think the discussion was conducted in the first instance without the manager, but generally with him, and after discus<lb></lb>sion we came to a decision—all loans or renewals were considered on that same day, the Tuesday—the matter was brought before us by Mr. Burch, verbally or in his list; I can't say which; sometimes the name was put down I think, I cannot quite charge my memory; we discussed the question whether it was a proper loan to grant, Mr. Burch being present, and after<lb></lb>wards if any further explanation was wanted we called in Mr. Terry to give us the reasons and grounds for granting the loan—here is an entry on 25th June, 1861: "The following loans were approved"—then follows a list of names—they would not be written until after our decision was arrived at—they were discussed one by one—Mr. Burch would regulate the order in which they were brought before us, then we should discuss them, and on being approved they would be put down—no loans were ever brought before us until the manager bad first approved of them—I think that was our principal business on Tuesday—the correspondence was read on Friday—I know that our meetings were very short on Tuesday compared with Friday—the weekly reports were read on the Friday, I think—on the Friday we had the correspondence read, with the list of discounts—Mr. Burch read the correspondence; that occupied a substantial part of our meeting—we then read the weekly reports of the state of the bank—they were first read and then we examined them ourselves—we examined whether the amount of current accounts, deposit accounts, had increased or diminished; we examined all through it—we perfectly understood it, it was our guide to know in what position we were; we could not have got on at all without that—the cash was counted once a month, I think—I mean the cash in the tills, that is the cash referred to in this item—the bank balance we had before us every week—we banked at the Bank of England—some of us frequently went to the Bank to ascertain that the balance was there correctly—the Bank of England notes were counted by us with our own hands, and the money in the tills—I think the silver was weighed—the gold was counted—we did not attempt to verify the item of sundries—they were cheques and bills <hi rend="italic">in transitu</hi> or in suspense, passing into the country for realization and so on—we did not check those, more than the list being read to us—another paper was handed in—that was a paper of discounts; the discounts effected for the week—there is an abundance of these, it is a very important list to us—it was a list of persons requiring discount, how much already had been discounted, what was the average balance, and what the rate of interest—that was part of the business that we managed as directors—we examined each bill that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186504100170"></xptr>
               <p>was discounted—the bills were passed from one director to another to see whether the names were good or not; to see if we knew them, and if not, questions were asked—from two to four hours were occupied in that way at these meetings—it depended upon the length of the correspondence and so on—we did not consider it our duty to look at the books themselves, because we had no doubt of the honesty and straightforwardness of our officials—by our officials I mean the manager, secretary, and accountants—the balance-sheet was brought before us after it had been verified by the auditors—it was then sent to the printers by Mr. Burch or Mr. Terry—we never saw it till then I think—I don't think we saw it before the auditors—it was brought to us immediately before sending it to the printers—it would be submitted to the auditors soon after the accounts were made up at the half-years—I think it occupied the auditors about a fortnight—we never inter<lb></lb>fered at all with the auditors or held any communication with them with respect to their audit—if we happened to go in and found them there, we immediately said, "Good morning, "and went out—after being audited the balance-sheet was submitted as a matter of course to the shareholders, with the auditrs' signatures attached.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that you did not see the balance-sheet at all before it was submitted to the auditors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It came to us after the auditors—I don't know that I ever saw it before—my brother directors will be able perhaps to speak upon that, but I don't recollect that we ever saw it before; in tact, I don't think it was made up until then—if I bad seen anything wrong in the balance-sheet, it would have been my duty to call attention to it—the re-port was matter of discussion amongst the directors; that was entirely a matter for the directors—that is not the balance-sheet; it is attached to it on the other side of the fly-leaf—the report assumes the balance-sheet to be correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIPFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A variety of speeches or portions of them have been suggested to you—I believe you have made a good many of those speeches to the shareholders? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We considered it our duty that the absent share<lb></lb>holders should know everything, as if they were present, and therefore we had a special reporter, who gave a verbatim report of everything that was said and done, and a copy was transmitted to each shareholder—the speeches were rather long at times—I invariably told the shareholders that I would answer any questions put to me, and those questions and answers are all embodied in the reports—at the time I made those statements that have been referred to, I believed them to be true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you at any time aware that in that item, No. 3, 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the full amount of bankrupts' bills and forgeries were iucluded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; I had no idea of such a thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then I should like to know what directions were given? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The directions given were to make a true and faithful account of the value, of the estimated value, as far as it could be reached, of each security, without colour and without exaggeration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever look to see what estimate had been made? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The estimates were discussed frequently in the board-room—in certain cases, in many cases, I inquired of Mr. Terry upon what principle he esti<lb></lb>mated the bills, such as Perl's, for instance—with reference to this account of 30th June, I don't think I did inquire of him upon what principle he had estimated the bills, or the amount at which he had estimated them—I did not understand the over-due bills' account to be estimated in these weekly returns—he was to carry into the balance-sheet the true value.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Would it not appear from that that the item of 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was not an estimate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I always considered that it was an estimate—I did not know what amount was carried in, as past-due bills; I could not tell without the books—I con<lb></lb>sidered that the bankrupts' bills and forgeries were estimated in the balance<lb></lb>sheet, but in the weekly returns they were put at their true value, as far as it could be reached—I don't think there was any direction to Mr. Terry in writing on this matter—there is a list of the bills somewhere—Mr. Howell has been through the accounts, and can give the details.</p>

                  </hi>. I am A partner in the firm of Byre and Lawson, solicitors, of 1, John-street, Bedford-row—I have been in the pro<lb></lb>fession since the year 1840—at the formation of the Unity Bank I was applied to by Mr. Bayliss to become a director—I was a director from the first—Mr. Terry was appointed first accountant to the bank at the time I was a director—on Mr. Chamber's retirement he became manager—I did not take an active part in his appointment—I remember an instance of a sum of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., borrowed by a person named Gregory, being entered in the cash article book; that transaction took place before the investigation to the management of the bank by Mr. Chambers—Mr. Gregory had l,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., lent him by Mr. Chambers, without security—an inquiry was made of Mr. Chambers whether that was not in the cash article book, and there was a ques<lb></lb>tion whether it appeared there or not; Mr. Terry was called into the board-room, and heat once, when asked the question, admitted that it was, and ire<lb></lb>gularly so, inasmuch as Mr. Gregory had left the country, and the money must be considered as lost—that was an irregularity by Mr. Chambens which Mr. Terry pointed out On 24th December, 1657, I wrote this letter to the directors; it is addressed to Mr. Alderman Mechi—(<hi rend="italic">read;</hi> "My dear Sir—Sinee our last court-day I have taken into consideration the position of the Unity Bank, and my own responsibilities and duties in connexion therewith. After what has passed, and the small shave of support I received from the chair, I do not feel personally inclined, nor do I see the advantage that would arise from my again attending the court until my duty may impera<lb></lb>lively require ma I desire, however, to put on formal record my view as to our present position, and as to the course which ought to be pursued. You are aware that I hare for some time past regarded the position of the</p>

               <p>bank with apprehension. That apprehension has been seriously increased by the recent revelations. The committee appointed at my instance has brought to light larger losses and a far more imperfect system of manage<lb></lb>ment than we were, any of us, previously aware of. The examination has also elicited facts connected with our losses which are of a very serious character. I have ventured to submit to yourself and my colleagues what appears to me to be our only remedy. But while I find my colleagues generally concurring with me as to the serious character of past transactions, I do not find them prepared to take the only step by which, as it seems to me, the property is likely to be saved from ruin. Under such circumstances the grave question which I have to consider is by what course of proceeding I can divest myself of any portion of the serious responsibility which de<lb></lb>volves upon me, and how far I can best perform my duty, not only to those who at my instance have invested their money in the bank, but to all pro<lb></lb>prietors at large who have honoured me with their confidence as a director. There is no ordinary meeting of proprietors until the month of January. The circumstances, however, are so serious that I think it ought to be deliberately considered whether we are to await that period or give the proprietary an opportunity of considering the position of the bank. In the balance-sheet of the 30th of April, 1857, our losses were stated to have been 1, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., According to your statement at the court in July, they are now upwards of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., showing a loss of nearly 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in three months. The customers' deposits in the bank do not increase; at the present time they would be less than they were six months since had not several thousand pounds been paid in respect of the call of the Unity Fire Company. Our paid-up capital (150,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,) has been so dealt with that we have no more than 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—one-tenth of the whole—available at the present time for banking purposes. Our shares, of the value of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., each, are at the present time not saleable in the share-market. Without reference to the many other grave and startling facts which are known to us, it appears to me that the fore<lb></lb>going considerations alone are sufficient to indicate the propriety of calling our proprietors together. I accordingly request that you will have the kindness to submit this communication to the court, and take its deliberate opinion as to the propriety of calling a special meeting of the proprietors to consider the position of the bank. In the event of any such meeting I shall be prepared to state unreservedly my views of the present position of the property, and at the same time to resign my seat as a director. In the contrary event, I shall, at any rate, feel that I have done my duty by putting on record my protest against the present system of management, and my opinion as to the course which ought to be taken in justice to the pro<lb></lb>prietors.")—At that time I had from thirty-five to forty shares in the bank—at the time I wrote that letter I had ceased to attend the board—I after<lb></lb>wards resumed my seat, and continued to attend ever since down to 1862—I afterwards increased my shares to sixty-nine—I certainly understood the item of 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in the balance-sheet of June, 1862, to include the past-due bills, taking the latter at the proper estimate of their value—I never ex<lb></lb>amined the item of cash in hand, 38, 781<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor did I examine some of the other items—I was present at the weekly meetings when the cash-article book was read, and I believed judging now from the large number of names it con<lb></lb>tained, that the items in that book could never have been read over fully—on the 27th of June, 1862, those items were written upon thirteen pages of the book, and the reading of these over would have occupied a much longer time than ten minutes—on 17th December, 1862, a list of the defaulters</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant in the Minories—I was one of the directors of the Unity Bank—I became so in 1855—I subse-quently became a director of the London and Middlesex Bank—I was not aware that forged bills were included in this item of 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I con-sidered that bankrupts' bills were so reckoned by our manager—I considered that all past-due bills were valued by our manager at a percentage, according to their value—I took my last shares in December, 1861, paying 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per share—I did not confer with Mr. Terry entirely upon my purchase of those shares, but I took their value from the assets of the bank—I</p>

               <p>thought they would be worth 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a share, consequently I gave that money for them I thought in safety—I recollect hearing a conversation between Burch and Mr. Eyre, at least Burch was called into the committee-room when I was a director of the Lon<lb></lb>don and Middlesex bank—I recollect a paper or a list of debts that Mr. Eyre observed Alderman Mechi had before him; and Mr. Eyre observing the names of Lowenthal and Sterne there, expressed a good deal of surprise, and so did we all—I was present when the minute of this was taken, on 9th February, 1864, it was read over to Terry—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi> "At a meeting of the directors of the London and Middlesex bank, limited; present T.

"The directors present at that meeting were, Mr. Harris, in the chair, Mr. Benjamin Bower, Mr. Alderman Mechi, Mr. Eyre, MR. Hay ward, and Mr. L.

On Friday night, the 20th of Nov., I took Whaite into custody, on another charge—Clare delivered me this tea-caddy in Whaite's presence—I had seen the caddy before, in the lodging of another porter of the Eastern Counties Railway—Whaite said, "It is mine, and in it you will find a gold watch, which my grandmother gave me eight years ago"—he said she was a lady and was dead—I opened the caddy in his pre<lb></lb>sence, and found this watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, and live in Bury-street, St. Mary Axe. Morgan lived with me about three months, and has left about three months—before she left I missed a gold watch, on a Sunday—she came on the Mon<lb></lb>day or Tuesday—she did not live in my house, she only came to nurse a child—I said to her, "Have you seen a watch? I had a watch here, and it is gone"—she said she had seen none—it is a watch I took in exchange, and I wore it, but I should have sold it if I could—I said no more about it—Mor<lb></lb>gan left on the Thursday afterwards—she did not tell me she was going—she never returned—this is the watch—I described it to the officer before he found it—there is not another watch in London like it—I know it quite well—it was safe on the Sunday and gone on the Monday—I had no suspi<lb></lb>cion of Morgan.</p>

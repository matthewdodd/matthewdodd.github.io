                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, New Montague-street, Spitalfields; the prisoner was my servant of all work for about three months. On the 6th of Jan. I marked a shilling, which I put on the floor in the dining-room—I missed it the next morning—it was found on the prisoner by an officer whom I called in—he made a further search, and found in her box, in my presence, this small shaw I and these other articles—they had been deposited, before they</p>

               <p>were missed, in my wife's bed-room—I had seen them there—the prisoner's box was locked—she gave the key to the officer—she said she did not put these things in her box, but some one else did it without her knowledge.</p>

Q.</hi> Why did not you take things out from mine when they were taken out and laid on the bed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She put them out on the bed, but I gave her in charge for the shilling—there were two gold rings and other property found—she was taken before the Magistrate, and we then made fur<lb></lb>ther search, and found these things.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant H</hi> 8.) I was called to the prosecutor's on the 7th of Jan., and the prisoner was given into my charge—I asked if she was willing I should examine her box—she said, "Yes," and ran up stairs—I went after her—she unlocked the box, put herself in a great rage, and threw the things on the bed, all the contents of the box were on the bed—I ad<lb></lb>vised her to be more still, and not put herself in a rage, and to turn out her pockets—she put her hand into her pockets, and pulled it out clenched—I took her hand, opened it by force, and found in it eleven half-crowns—I in<lb></lb>sisted on having her pocket, and in it I found this marked shilling, which the prosecutor identified—the prisoner said, "You have not got me now; I did not steal it, I picked it up"—I then took her to the station, and in con<lb></lb>sequence of something I heard, I was induced to return and examine the contents of the box more minutely—I then found these other articles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Why did you not take them when I first threw them on the bed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not aware at that time that any wearing-apparel was missing—I did not put the things into the box before I lost sight of them—I went to the Police-court first, and the prosecutor went with me—I most particu<lb></lb>lary requested the prisoner to be peaceable, and put all the things into the box, but she would not—I was obliged to send for further assistance—I found the things on the bed when I returned from the Police-court—my at<lb></lb>tention was not drawn to these things at first—whether they were amongst the things the first time I do not know.</p>

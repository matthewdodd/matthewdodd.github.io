                  </hi>. I live in the parish of Harrow; I keep the house. On the night of the 14th of July, about ten o'clock, I went to bed, leaving the house secure—I was aroused in the morning, at one o'clock, by a policeman calling for assistance—I came down and found my house</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman.

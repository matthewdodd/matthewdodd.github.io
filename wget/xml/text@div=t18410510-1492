                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 815.) I was on duty at the bridge at Great Ilford on the 14th of April, at half-put five o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner at the back of a cart, with three horses to it, loaded with straw—he looked at me very hard, and 1 looked at the top of the cart—the tilt did not appear to lie flat on the top—I went up to the prisoner, and asked what he had got on the top of his cart—he scratched his head, and said, in a muttering tone, that he had got food for his horses—I told him I suspected he had got more than he ought to have, and or<lb></lb>dered him to stop his horses—he made no observation—I got on the load, removed the tilt, and saw two sacks, one of chaff, and one of mixed com, a truss of hay, and a bundle of green rye—he had five nose-bags hanging on the side of the cart—four of them were full of corn, and the other three-parts full of turnip-tops—I saw a bundle of hay in the hind ladder of the cart—the sacks had "George Biggs, Longbridge, Barking," on them—I then told the prisoner to turn his horses' heads round to the station-house gates, which he did—I took the property off the cart, and put it into the yard, went to the prosecutor, and he came to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer at Barking. The prisoner was my horsekeeper—on the day in question he was allowed three nose-bags of corn, and about a bushel of mixed corn, to supply them when empty, but no more—it is not long since I had a case here before, and I gave very particular instructions that they should take no more than one tack, and a small bundle of hay, to feed the horses, and I took off part of the allow<lb></lb>ance of hay, because they had green meat cutting at that time—he had no right to have the truss of hay which was found on the top of the cart, nor to have so much at the back—he had no right, to have more than three nose-bags, nor to have two sacks of mixed corn—he was going to Clapton that day, I believe, which is about nine miles from Barking—he would have been back that same day—he would not want any thing like that quantity—the horses could not have eaten it in three or four days—I repeat<lb></lb>edly forbad him taking more than I have stated—I saw the property at the station, and knew it to be mine.</p>

             sworn. - I am a Prussian: On the 10th of August, I was in company with the prisoners at the sign of the Amsterdam Arms; there were about thirty-five of us sailors; we were waiting for a gentleman to put our names down for a ship. We went into that public-house a little after four o'clock in the afternoon; the prisoners asked me if I would take a walk with them, which I did, at about half after four in the afternoon; we went from the Amsterdam Arms to the half-way house; I went in, and asked for a pot of beer, and these two men and I drank together there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go out of that house? - A. Between eight and nine o'clock, and then both the prisoners came out of the house with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know these men before? - A. No, I never did; they both of them went with me into <placeName id="t18050918-9-crimeloc44">Stepney fields</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18050918-9-crimeloc44" type="placeName" value="Stepney fields"></interp>

               <p>Q. Where was Ferguson at the time, while Read was easing himself? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that man was that gave you a knock on the head, and knocked you down? - A. I cannot know.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Ferguson at that time? - A. He was in the fields easing himself; the man that knocked me down said, you b - r what do you do in these green fields; he said, strip; I said, for what shall I strip; Read and Ferguson left me for about two or three minutes before I was knocked down; the man that knocked me down took every thing from me, and left me the same as I was born of my mother; he told me to take my clothes off; I told him I would not; a man took hold of me, and took my clothes off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a second man that came up? - A. I cannot know that, I think it was the man with the black hair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the man that knocked you down? - A. No, I did not; I had not so much time.</p>
               <p>Q. If you did not see him, and had not time to look at him, what reason have you to think it was the man in the black hair? - A. That is the man that was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of him at the time you were knocked down, so as to recollect he was with the man? - A. No, I was senseless.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you senseless? - A. I cannot say, I was knocked down as a butcher knocks down an ox.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect their taking your jacket off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know whether there was more than one man - did you observe or see any thing at the time? - A. I saw nothing more than two men that were with him at the time; they took all my clothes off, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. After your clothes were taken off, and you were stripped, did you see any body go away? - A. I was almost out of my senses; they left me in the water in the ditch; I did not see who ran away, I got up, and went to the half-way house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180007"></xptr>Q. What things were taken from you? - A. A jacket, a waistcoat, a shirt, a pair of trowsers, shoes, stockings, and hat, my protection box, with my protection in it, three guineas and a half in gold, and a silver watch; I have seen my shirt, jacket, and trowsers, since, at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober? - A. I was as sober as I am now; I had only a pot of beer the whole day, and in the half-way house they forced me to have some gin, but I threw it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether it was dark or light? - A. After I was stripped in the fields it was moon-light, it was then about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were at two public-houses - remember what you said this moment, you were as sober as you are now; you were in the public-house all day? - A. Yes, I was; I was waiting for a gentleman to put my name down.</p>
               <p>Q. You drank no more than a pot of beer; I ask you whether you were not the person that paid for the gin? - A. Yes; I did not drink any of the gin, I threw it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you buy gin for the purpose of throwing it away; why, if you had not liked to have drank it, your messmates would have liked it? - A. They are no messmates of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a sailor, and they are sailors; were not you three and a great many more hired to go to Southampton to bring up a ship into the river? - A. There were some people there that I knew, but not these two men.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that they were to be messmates with you when you got to Southampton? - A. Yes, that I was told; they put their names down as well as me.</p>
               <p>Q. On the next day these two men were found at the public-house? - A. No, it was on the third day; they were found at the sign of the Amsterdam Arms.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the house to which you regularly put up, all of you, to go to Southampton? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore these men going there were sure to be found by you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Since you have been robbed, you have been in company with Mr. Rogers; had you any conversation with him about the two prisoners? - A No, he called me out of my house, and took me to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Rogers say to you he would shew you the two men that robbed you? - A. No; he asked me if I should know them when I saw their faces.</p>
               <p>Q.Nothing was found belonging to you upon either of the prisoners? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you say at the office that the man that knocked you down had a white jacket on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never got your watch again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the prisoners were searched? - A. Yes, and Read took a knife out of his pocket, and said, d - n my soul, I will cut that b - r's throat.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard any thing about a reward - did not Mr. Rogers tell you there would be a reward of forty pounds, in case you convicted these men? - A. Mr. Rogers told me nothing; I do not know there is a forty pounds reward.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say the man that knocked you down had a white jacket on - did you see that man that knocked you down? - A. Yes, that is the man with the black hair, Ferguson.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured jacket had he on? - A. A white looking jacket.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you had been drinking with the prisoners at the public-house, had you observed what coloured jacket Ferguson had on? - A. He had a blue jacket on then, and when he returned after he had left me, he had a white one.</p>
               <p>Q. That is your conjecture? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Shadwell: From information, on Sunday, the 11th of August, I went, in company with Brown and Oliver, in pursuit of the persons that were supposed to have committed this robbery, and by the description that the prosecutor gave me of the two men (Ferguson, he said, had very large whiskers at the time he committed the robbery,) I went to the Amsterdam Arms on the Monday, as we were informed that there were to be about twenty-six men to sail to Guernsey, and then the two prisoners were in company with from twenty-five to thirty men in the room; Ferguson was sitting at the upper end of the room; I desired him to be very cautious to pick none but correct men; he instantly pointed out to Ferguson; we secured him, and on his looking about the room he pointed out the other man; I searched them, but found nothing on them; Ferguson had large whiskers on then; I went to the pawnbroker's on Monday, and found his clothes.</p>

Yes, and he was very much in liquor, and would not pay me, and I went to Ferguson's house to enquire for him; Ferguson was at home at the time sitting with the woman that he lives with; he told me he dare say he should see him in the morning, and if he did not pay me then, he would pass his word for it.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Murray, a pawnbroker, in East Smithfield; I produce a jacket, a waistcoat, a pair of trowsers, and one cotton shirt, pledged for one pound, in the name of A. Wilkinson; I do not know whether it was pledged by a man or a woman. (The property identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Ferguson's defence. I never was in his company at all after I left the Amsterdam-house; I was intoxicated and went home to bed.</p>
               <p>Read's defence. According to agreement I went along with this man to the Half-way-house: the prosecutor came into the room and picked upon this gentleman, and I went to him to give him some money, I having a few shillings: seeing some blood on my waistcoat, he said, that is the man; at the same time he had been along the room and never offered to take me up: Mr. Rogers said he took me for striking Kit Duff.</p>

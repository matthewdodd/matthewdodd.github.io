                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop in Crosier-square, Chelsea. I employed the prisoner to dig and plant some potatoes for me—on the 3rd of January I gave my wife two sovereigns—the prisoner was present, close to me—my wife went down stairs—the prisoner went directly outside, where he might have seen through the window to where my wife was—I saw him stand where he could look in—this was on Wednesday—he was to come and finish his job the next morning, but I never saw him again till he was apprehended—I knew that he was in destitute circumstances, as he had half a crown on the Monday, and on Tuesday he had a shilling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the prosecutor. My husband gave me two sovereigns in the presence of the prisoner—I put it into a small box, and placed it in a large one in my bed-room—I missed it the following afternoon—I did not see the prisoner look in at the window—he was working in the garden—he never came to finish the job—I had ad<lb></lb>vanced him money the day he came.</p>

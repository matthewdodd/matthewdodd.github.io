               <p>- MASON sworn. - I am an officer, I apprehended the prisoner at the bar on the second of May, in the evening; there are four handkerchiefs, an old shift, a shirt, an apron, and two towels; I was sent for, and Kennedy gave me charge of the prisoner. (The property produced, and identified by Mrs. Drewett.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I came up from Deptford from the regiment to see a mother that is in St. Luke's workhouse, to give her some small relief; in coming near the end of Finsbury-square I saw two towels, I picked them up, and there was a man and three boys with him; I asked him if they were his, he said they were; I said if they are your's take them.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prisoner.) Do you mean to say you never was in Drewett's house? - A. No, I had not been two hours in London; I never had nothing but the two towels.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Kennedy.) You saw him pick up the two towels? - A. I saw him and the boys pick up all the things.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him drop several things? - A. Yes, they dropped from him as he was running; first one, two, and three.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure that it was the same man that you followed out of Mr. Drewett's house? - A. I am as confident as of my own life.</p>

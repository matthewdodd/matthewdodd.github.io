               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. How do you know the prosecutor's name? A. I saw him write Page Ward - I am not aware that it is our duty to report to our inspector every thing that passes, but merely the apprehension of such a party; I should not have considered it my duty to have reported that she offered 20l., and I did not do it - I stated it to the Magistrate, and I believe I gave the same account I have now.</p>

               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

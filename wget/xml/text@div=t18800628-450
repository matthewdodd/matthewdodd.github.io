                  </hi>. My husband, James Blackman, was a Salesman in Covent Garden Market, and lived at 32, Derwent Road, Glengal Grove, Old Kent Road; the prisoner lived next door, at No. 34; he is a carman—on Saturday afternoon, 8th May, about 5 o'clock, he knocked at the door, and asked if my husband was at home—I said he was not—he said he would wait for him if it was till 12 o'clock—he then walked to the front garden gate—while I was standing at the door I saw my husband coming towards my house in company with Watson—as he came up to the gate the prisoner ran at him, and thumped him in the nose, then he thumped him in the mouth, and made his nose and mouth bleed, and knocked off his hat—my husband stooped as if he was going to pick his hat up to go indoors, and the prisoner said n Come on, you b—, you have long wanted to fight me, and now you shall fight me; take off your coat," and he gave him another blow, I did not see where, and my husband fell in the road—I went up to the publican opposite, and asked him to stop it, but he did not interfere—my husband took off his coat, and then they fought again—my husband fell down about five or six times; the last time he was insensible—each time the prisoner struck him he knocked him down—he was picked up by two men and carried indoors; he was partly insensible; we partly brought him to—he was bleeding from the mouth and nose—he spoke to me once or twice afterwards, and then he went into a stupor, and remained 00 for three days—he had a fit about 12 o'clock that same night, and another fit at 6 o'clock in the morning, and he never came out of it for three days—he died on the Sunday morning in the following week—he was 35 years of age—he was very intoxicated when this happened—he was walking steady; he never staggered when he was tipsy—he had never had fits before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was a hard drinker—he was nearly always drunk, nearly every day—he was only violent to me—he was a very powerful man, about 13 stone—he had a bit of a scuffle with a bricklayer the week before—I don't know anything of the prisoner; I heard that he once had a fight with another man and nearly killed him; his daughter told me so—I have spoken to him, my husband has never spoken to him—he has always con<lb></lb>ducted himself to me in a quiet, proper manner—I have asked him not to fight with my husband, because he was very stout, and I knew if any one fought with him it would kill him, and he said "If your husband speaks to me I will walk away"—there was a dispute about some of the prisoner's rabbits eating the cabbages in our garden—my husband was very angry; I mentioned it to the prisoner, and he said he would rather have given my husband a couple of rabbits than have had any dispute about it—I once took a table-top to the prisoner to take care of, to keep from my husband's violence—on this very Saturday the child took a lamp in to the prisoner's wife to take care of, and my husband asked her for it, and she abused him—when the prisoner called he said my husband had insulted his wife; lie did not say how—he was in an excited state—I did not hear what patted between him and my</p>

               <p>husband—he was struck three times before he took his coat off; when I asked the publican to separate them he said "No, it serves him right"—the people called him a b cur; that was when he was walking away—he said "I am no cur," and he turned round and Morris struck him again—I did not say "It is my husband, and it serves him right"—it was the blow in the neck that knocked him insensible—the prisoner did not help to pick him up and carry him in—he did not ask if he wanted any help; my husband said after he got indoors "I have a good Samaritan here," that was when one of the men who carried him in said "I will come and see you again presently"—it was after I had given him some water and he was laid on the bed—he was never properly sensible after that; he just answered what was said to him, that was all—he said he felt all right when I asked him—I went out for about half an hour to get my shopping in—I went to the prisoner's door, and he asked me how my husband was—I did not say he was better, I said he seemed very bad—I did not say I was glad he had given him a good hiding—when I went back I did not find that my husband had fallen out of bed and struck his head against a zinc pail by the side of the bed—he was on the bed when I came back; he afterwards went into a fit; he was in a fit when I came back; he spoke to me and asked me for some water—he was not black in the face—I went to get some water, and when I came back he had slipped partly off the bed and his head was in the pail—he was not quite off the bed; he was not on the floor—I put him on the floor afterwards, because he was making such a noise in his throat—his body was partly on a box by the side of the bed, that prevented him from falling off the bed altogether—he had two fits that night; he had 100 fits afterwards—he did not die in a fit—the last fit left him about 6 o'clock—he lost his voice then, and then his breathing gradually got lower—I sent for a doctor about six o'clock on the Sunday morning, when he had the second fit.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was just after 12 o'clock when he slipped off the bad, when he had the first fit—it is a very low bedstead—the pail was by the side of the bed.</p>

I live at 1, Victoria Place, Cornwall Road, Peckham—I am a porter in Covent Garden Market—I had known the deceased about two years—on Saturday, 8th May, about 5 o'clock, I saw him at the Glen gal public-house, sitting on the horse-trough, about three or four minutes' walk from his own house—I had some beer and invited him to drink some; he did not—he was intoxicated—he followed me into the house—we afterwards went over the canal bridge together—he walked alongside of me; he walked middling—just before we got to the lamp this side of his house, the prisoner came up to him and said "What hare you been insulting my wife for?"—he had no time to answer, for the prisoner knocked him down with his fist—I helped him up—he then pulled hit coat off, and the prisoner knocked him down again five or six times in the foot<lb></lb>path or roadway—the last time he was knocked down he never spoke any more—I assisted to carry him into his house—he was not sober enough to fight—I said to the prisoner several times "Don't strike the man, don't knock him about; wait till to-morrow morning and see him when he is sober"—he made no reply; this was at the first start—he struck him about the face and body, and the last time under the throat, and he fell down on his back—after assisting him into the house, I stopped with him about a quarter of an hour and then left—this was going on for about 10</p>

I am a surgeon, of 100, Trafalgar Road, Old Kent Road—on Sunday morning, 9th May, about 6.30, I was sent for to. 32, Derwent Road, where Blackman lived—I found him in bed; he looked like a man recovering from a state of concussion, dazey—also from the effects of drink—I spoke to him, but he never spoke—I noticed his eyes, he would not let me look at them; I tried to, he objected—his right eye was black and ecchy<lb></lb>mosed, and a contusion over the eyebrow, such as might be given by a man's fist; there was no blood, the skin was not broken—I attended him afterwards once or twice a day—the back of his head was in a bruised state, a little bit blue and yellow, from extravasation of blood under the scalp; it was a simple-looking bruise, it was a bad one, exactly such as might be occasioned if he was knocked down and fell on his head—he never spoke sensibly while I attended him—I was not present when he died—I saw him late the night before, he was then in epileptic fits, I might say he was dying—the injury to the head brought on the fits—concussion comes on at once upon the injury, but the effect gets worse after a little interval—by direction of the Coroner I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and made these notes at the time—he was a well developed man, big and powerful, and stout—the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances were well marked—the brain was ia a highly con<lb></lb>gested state; there was no fracture of the skull—there were several small clots about the brain, from rupture of the cerebral vessels—there was a larger clot in the right hemisphere; there was a great deal of effused serum on the brain, and this clot was under the dura mater—the other organs were healthy, with the exception of the liver, which showed that the man had been drinking—the state of the brain would be accounted for by a vary violent concussion at the back of the head—if he had been knocked down on the Saturday and fallen violently on the back of the head, that would account for the concussion, and for compression afterwards coming on;. it would account for the whole of the injuries to the brain from beginning to end—in my judgment he died from concussion of the brain—there must have been a very violent blow to produce the concussion—he could not have sustained an injury of that kind by merely falling out of bed on to a pail, impossible; I never heard of that—these were very serious injuries—there was large bruise on the right side.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The bruise on the back of the head was as big as a couple of inches—it was outside the scalp—if he had fallen out of bed on the edge of a zinc pail, it would have made a cut—I should say that could not have caused such a bruise; such a heavy man would have been sure to cut his head; it might cause a shock, it might be serious—he had a great many epileptic fits towards the end—heavy drinking may bring on epileptic fits—I don't think that would produce these fits, it would produce apoplexy—if he received a shock it might produce fits—epileptic fits very often result in death; 100 fits would of course be fatal; we must allow a little for exaggeration—if a man was not subject to fits I do not think the falling out of bed would bring them on; if he <hi rend="italic">was predisposed to them it might</hi>—they are hereditary—I should certainly say that the fall out of bed did not kill him—I don't think it had anything to do with the fatal result—I don't think he had concussion <hi rend="italic">from the fall on the</hi> pail, and I don't think that would produce the clot; that was produced by rupture of the vessels of the brain, brought on from excitement, drink, fighting, and concussion—excitement would help it on—no doubt when he was knocked down a little vessel <hi rend="italic">of the</hi> brain gave way and burst, and that brought on concussion, which gradually produced compression, and the excitement would help it on—I don't think the fall from the bed broke the little vessel—a vessel sometimes breaks from small causes; that would be apoplexy, the man might drop down dead suddenly—coughing might sometimes break a vessel; that would be from previous disease—this man was not emaciated, he was very stout and fat—long drinking might weaken the tissues and make the vessels liable to break.</p>

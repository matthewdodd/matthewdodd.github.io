She said she had got but one halfpenny in the world if I would give her two-pence she would have a quartern of gin. I gave her the two-pence; after that we agreed to go to bed; while I was in bed with her she robbed me of eleven guineas and sixpence halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Did you see your money before you went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130051"></xptr> to bed? - Before I went to sleep, after I was in the room.</p>
               <p>Did any body else come into the room besides her? - A person brought the gin; they drank it between them; after that woman was gone I locked the door.</p>
               <p>Was it after that that you saw your money? - No, before; I waked, I believe, between four and five o'clock, my money was gone out of my breeches pocket; I had put my breeches under my head. I went out and found a constable; I desired the constable to examine the person who brought the gin to see if I could learn who the prisoner was; there was a woman in company with the prisoner found that morning in a publick-house, near St. Giles's church; there were two guineas of the money found upon her, which she owned before the justice were mine.</p>
               <p>Had you advised her to own it? - I had not said a word to her, nor nobody else, that I know of. She said, of the money which her and

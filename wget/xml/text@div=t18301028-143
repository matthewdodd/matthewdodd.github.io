I was fetched to the watch-house, and asked if I had lost a pair of lamps from Mr. Kendrick's yard, No. 25, Foley-place - I went and looked, and missed a pair; the yard is open, but there are folding gates; I do not know whose the lamps were - they had been on a shelf for two years; it is my master's yard, and is opened at five o'clock in the morning, and shut at seven in the evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is your master's name? A.

On the 28th of September I was on duty in Oxford-street, at half-past seven o'clock in the evening, and this gentleman pointed out two men - I followed the prisoner, who had the lamps under his arm, to Park-lane; I there took him, and asked where he had the lamps from; he made no answer, but when I took him back he begged of me to let him go.</p>

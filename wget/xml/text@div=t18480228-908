                  </hi> I am cook to Mr. Fincham, of Spring-gardens. On Saturday morning, 7th Feb., I received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from my mistress—there was one sovereign, one half-sovereign, several half-crowns, and the remainder was small silver—I put it on the dresser, in different books or bills, to pay bills with, and left it there—If went to bed a little after nine on Saturday night—the prisoner was my master's footman, and slept in the pantry, which leads out of the kitchen into the scullery—I closed the windows and fastened them before I went to bed, and they were so on the Sunday morning—I did not notice the money or books on Sunday—on Monday morning my fellow-servant went down before me, came back again, and said something to my master; and at a few minutes after seven we all three went down stairs together—the dresser drawers were all open, but nothing was gone—some of the things were partly out, and some were on the floor—I did not see the money which had been in the books—the window was open, and the shutters partly open—they were safe on the Saturday and Sunday night—there is a gate to the area, but no steps—the prisoner came out of his room, and said there had been thieves in the house, that there had been two men at his door, threatening him if he made a noise; that he tried to open the door, but could not—he said he heard the bar of the shutters rattle while they were there—the area door, which fastens with a shutter, was as usual; there were no marks on the shutters—there was a foot-mark on a wooden meat-screen under the window inside, which had the appearance of having been made with the heel of a shoe—I missed a spoos from the caddy which was on the table on Saturday afternoon—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is mine.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 5, spring-gardens. The prisoner has been in my service as footman since September—on Monday morning, 7th Feb., in consequence of something that was told me, I went into the kitchen, found the drawers open, and caps and handkerchiefs strewed about the ground—the window was open, and the shutters about half open—I</p>

               <p>looked on the window-cill and could see no marks at all—there was some black mark on the screen inside the window—the shutter had been fastened with a single bar inside—there were no footmarks in the house—I asked the prisoner whether he had heard anything—he said he had heard men come into the house, and they threatened him if the did not open the door they would do him some harm; that they tried to get in with a key; that they went up stairs, came down again, and went away—I sent for a policeman, and showed him all about in the prisoner's presence—the policeman said it was clear no one had broken into the house, and suggested that there had been some one concealed inside—he searched but could not find any one, and then said he wished to search the prisoner and his room—he did so, in my presence—the prisoner said he had only 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the policeman found, either under or about the bed-clothes, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. wrapped up in a bill, and a penny somewhere about the bed.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of Castle Bavnard Ward, I produce three pounds of coffee, I got it on the 27th of August, of Mr. Campbell, who stood by the prisoner, at Mr. Gossett's warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take it from the warehouse? - No, I did not, I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. To Gossett. Do you know whether you had coffee under your custody, in these warehouses, 15 and 16? - A vast quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any other person any custody of coffee in these warehouses besides yourself? - None. I should inform you that the prisoner was not a servant of ours, but a cooper employed by the merchants to cooper the casks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was working for Mr. Pugh, there were seven of us in the whole, it was very warm weather, and I pulled off my hat, and in pulling my hat off my wig stuck to my hat, and I worked on till one o'clock, till dinner time; with that I clapped my hat and wig on, so as it may be now; I know I never put any coffee in, nor knew none to be there; the officer that locked us out of the warehouse, he searched me all down, at last he lifted up my hat, and there was some coffee in it, some few grains, and he said, you have some coffee there. I never put it in myself, nor know how it came there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any witnesses? - No, I had none but my shopmates, and they happened to go down first, I was the last person that came down. I has worked twenty years before this for Mr. Pugh.</p>

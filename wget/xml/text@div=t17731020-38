            . On the 27th of August last my master and the family were in Yorkshire; I was left alone in the house; I went to bed about ten at night; all the doors and windows were fast; I arose about half after six o'clock in the morning; the first thing I observed was the dining room was open; the windows were fast; the door of the dining room I fastened last as I went to bed; I found a chest belonging to Mrs. Barton, who is now in France, and has been there nine months, in the room broke open; it was in a closet kept within the dining room; it was put in there, locked, a fortnight before, when the family went into the country; I had not seen it out of this closet till the morning when I found it broke open, and the closet door was open. I went down stairs and saw the office door and all the drawers except one open, and the back door to the garden was broke open, which door I am sure was fast when I went to bed; the bottom of the door was broke away; two pieces were taken out, one over the other, by which means the person could get into the house. As to any of the plate, and things mentioned in the indictment that have been lost, I can give no account of them, excepting two silver tea spoons marked E. P. they were

            . I am a watchmaker at Newcastle-upon-Tyne. On the 6th of September, about half after seven in the morning, the prisoner came to my shop, and enquired if I had good second hand watches to sell; I shewed him one; he liked it and asked the price; I said 55 s he said he was not a good judge of watches himself, but he had an acquaintance that lived in the town, and would bring him in half an hour; he asked me if I took plate in exchange; I said yes, if it was sterling and good. The prisoner returned in about half an hour with another man, whom I did not know then; his name is Simpson; he looked at the watch and liked it, and desired I would mention the lowest price; I said fifty shillings; then I desired the prisoner to shew me his plate; upon which he produced a silver waiter, two silver salts, a silver gilt cann and a silver flat-bottom candlestick; I looked at them several times; I suspected him and sent my apprentice for

I went home, and in an hour after was sent for to the Town-hall. The plate was delivered to one Finley, a serjeant at mace. (The silver waiter, gilt cann, salts and candlestick produced). they are the same the prisoner produced to me; I saw them put in the trunk to the other things at the Town-hall; the trunk was locked, and the key was delivered to the serjeant at mace.</p>

            . I am a constable: I was sent for by Mr. Harrison, about eight in the morning of the 6th of September; I saw in his shop the prisoner and Simpson; Mr. Harrison told me he suspected some plate produced was not honestly come by; the prisoner said he had some friends, and particularly one Hill, who he had served his apprenticeship with, but that having broke his indentures, he was obliged to go from him; he said his aunt had left him, his brother, and father an equal share of the plate, and that was his share; Mr. Harrison asked him why he did not dispose of it in London; he said he had not a mind, he was not among his friends; he muttered something further that I could not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177310200027"></xptr> distinguish; then he and Simpson went away, and said they would come back again, and shew that the prisoner came honestly by the plate; I went away to my shop. Between twelve and one I went, in company with Mr. Harrison, to one of the Aldermen, and carried the plate; returning to Mr. Harrison's, we met with Simpson. Between two and three we found the prisoner by the Key-side, at a shoemaker's house; I called him to the door and told him I was come for him that he might let the magistrate know how he came by the plate; he said he was very willing to do so, because he could give a clear account how he came by it, and accordingly went quietly into the Town-hall; I went for Mr. Harrison, and he came with me to the Court; the prisoner in the Town-hall delivered me these spoons out of his pocket; two that have been now produced I am sure are two of them.</p>

(The spoons shown him); they are the same. By Mr. Moseley's orders I went to one Mitchel's house, in High Bridge; there I found a trunk; it was locked; I brought it to the Court while the prisoner was there; Mr. Moseley asked him if he had the key of the trunk; he took the key out of his pocket, and Mr. Harrison opened the trunk or chest with the key; I saw a great quantity of plate, and all the things were locked up again in my presence, and the key delivered to me; I have kept the key ever since; the chest has been opened two or three times, but always in my presence; there was nothing taken out. When I went to Mrs. Mitchel's she gave me three small silver spoons, and another that was gilt; I brought them to the Town Court, and shewed them to the prisoner; he acknowledged them to be his, and said he had given them to the woman of the house; there was also a gold girdle (producing it); the prisoner acknowledged that girdle to be his.</p>

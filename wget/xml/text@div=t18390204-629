               <p>no scissors of her own—she had borrowed my daughter's—but when I spoke to the prisoner she said she had a pair of her own, which were in her box, in the chaise-house—my husband gave her warning, and she was to leave me on Thursday the 24th of January—I had two rings which I wore at a party on the Friday evening, before the 24th—they were then enclosed in this box, and locked up in a drawer in the wardrobe, in my bed-room—I saw them safe on the Saturday morning—in consequence of information from my daughter, I went to a drawer in the prisoner's room on the Tuesday morning, and found a pair of stockings—I shook them, and the scissors and the two rings fell out of the feet of the stockings—the rings were then loose, and the case in which they had been kept was left in my box, in the drawer of the wardrobe—I went up stairs, and found the prisoner in Mr. Wright's dressing-room—I said to her, "Oh, Harriett, what have you been doing?"—she said, "Nothing."—I could hardly believe she had done it—I went to the wardrobe, and missed my rings—I then said to her, "Harriett, I have found my scissors, and you have taken them"—she said, "Then you have been to my drawer"—I can swear to these rings—they belonged to my mother, and were given to me by my father after her death—I was present when the prisoner's room was searched, and two flannel waistcoats which belonged to my eldest son were found under the mattrass, and between the laths of the bedstead, where they ought not to have been—my family consists of Mr. Wright, a daughter, and two sons, the prisoner, and a man-servant—these rings are worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On Sunday, the 20th of January, my father and mother went out in a phaeton, and my two brothers went with them—I, the prisoner, and the footman were left at home—while I was at home I heard a drawer open up stairs—I was at that time in the kitchen, and, saw the footman was in the chaise-house, and I knew the prisoner was up stairs—when I heard the noise, I went up and looked in my mamma's bed-room first, and then I went to mine and my brother's—I called the prisoner three times, as loud as I could—she could not have been in any part of the house without hearing me—I know these two rings perfectly well—I saw them on the Friday night and on the Saturday—I put them away in a drawer in the wardrobe—they were in this little box, and this was in another box, and then in the drawer—I locked the drawer myself.</p>

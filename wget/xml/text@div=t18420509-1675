On Good Friday night, the 25th of March, I went to bed at half-past eleven o'clock—the house was perfectly fastened before I went to bed—I was very particular in seeing every thing fast, because it was a very stormy night—I got up about a quarter after six in the morning, and found the window of the back-room on the basement story broken open—we use that room as a counting-house—the window does not open—it is a fixture—part of the sash was cut out, and two squares of glass taken out—I found about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of copper money missing, con<lb></lb>sisting of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. packages, and about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of halfpence in a bag—the whole amounted to better than 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my house is in the parish of St. Nicho<lb></lb>las, Deptford.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 26th of March, I saw the prisoner at a quarter after six o'clock with another young man named Barry, in New King-street—I heard the other say, "Go back, you b—, for the b—policeman is coming"—they were coming in a direction from Fletcher's at the time—they then turned towards London—the young man with the prisoner went a little way up to see if a constable was coming, and then they both joined and went towards London—I saw no more of them—the young man had beckoned to the prisoner, and then he joined him;</p>

On the 18th of May I was present while the prisoner was bargaining for some leather bags—I took them, and received direction from my master to bring either the money or the goods back—I drove to Barbican—a man came out, looked at them, and said he would not have them—the prisoner then said he knew where he could sell them—we went to two other places, first to Hackney-road and then to Mr. Layland's—the prisoner went in there—he came out, and said it was all right, he had sold them—I threw the goods on the ground, and gave the prisoner the invoice to get the money—he came out, and said he could not get the money for half-an-hour—I said, that shuffling would not do for me—he then ran away as hard as he could—I could not get the money—I found that Layland had bought them for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lether-seller, and live at 108, High-street, Shoreditch. The prisoner brought me some leather bags, and asked me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt. for them—I said it was too much, the value was 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt.—he agreed at last to take 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they were old bags—he said he had just cleared them from the Post-office—I ordered them to be thrown down in my shop, and paid the prisoner two guineas, which was at the rate of 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt.—he brought me an invoice, and told me if anybody should call and ask what I brought them at, I was to say I had bought them at this price, which was 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he then went out of the shop—he would not give me time to remonstrate—he appeared to be in a hurry when he brought the invoice—I thought him a highly respectable young man—he did not seem to know the value of the bags—I told him they were worth 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt.—I re-considered, and thought they might be worth 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not think the prosecutor knows the value of them—these produced are them, they are old bags, we sell them for old leather—they would not be used again for the purpose that they had been, which was to convey letters from the Colonies—they are all torn.</p>

               <p>Did you lose any part of your property at any time? - Yes, two pieces of stuff quilting intended for petticoats, the outside green and the inside white quilted with wool; the outside is called durant to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What was it worth? - About twenty shillings, I believe I lost it on the 5th of January last.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason for charging the prisoner with taking the stuff? - Yes, from my little girl telling me she took it.</p>
               <p>Do not you know any thing of it of your own knowledge? - Yes; when I found her she told me she took it.</p>
               <p>When she made that confession did you make any promise of favour to her? - When she told me she took them, she said they were pawned; I desired to have the duplicates; I told her if I could have my property I would not hurt her.</p>
               <p>What age is the child? - She will be thirteen the 23d of next May.</p>

               <p>I am servant to a pawnbroker, No. 13, Holywell-street, Shoreditch. I have a petticoat here which I received from two women, but I cannot recollect either of their faces; I have looked at the prisoner, but cannot recollect her to be the person I took it in of.</p>

               <p>Emmerson. I once looked at the petticoat by day-light and swore to it, but now it is candle-light what can I do?</p>
               <p>Can you upon your oath say that the petticoat now produced was the stuff you lost? - I believe this to be my property; the coat I saw by day-light at Justice Wilmot's I could swear to.</p>
               <p>To Harvey. Is that the petticoat which was produced at Justice Wilmot's? - It is the petticoat she swore to at the justice's.</p>

               <p>I hired the prisoner to look after my family; she was setting forth her distresses; she said she had a family, and had been out of place two months, and that she had supported herself by pawning her things. She said she had a petticoat in pawn which she would sell for two shillings more than it was pawned for, rather than the pawnbroker should run away with it. I redeemed it out of pawn, they had lent seven shillings upon it; I paid the interest and gave the prisoner a shilling more. She told me it was her own, and by her producing the duplicate I thought it was her own.</p>

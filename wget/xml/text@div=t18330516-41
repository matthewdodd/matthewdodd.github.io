               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far from the orchard did you see the prisoners? A. I suppose half a quarter of a mile - the shirts were not in this bag then, they were under May's arm; I cannot tell whether he might have picked them up before he saw Goddard - I never saw Mr. Cripps write his name, he cannot write - his name William Cripps is on his cart; I have heard persons call him William; I can't call to mind who has done so, but I have heard it.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live at Willesden. On the afternoon of the 8th of May, I was near Mr. Cripps', and saw the prisoners come out of Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160031"></xptr>Cripps' orchard - May was carrying this linen under his flannel waistcoat, under his left arm; they ran across one small piece of field, and then down the side of a long field; I followed them, and May dropped the linen and I took it up; I lost sight of the prisoners for about a minute, on Mr. Halls premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there not a considerable quantity of linen in the orchard? A. Yes; Goddard might have taken some of it as well as May - I was not near enough to hear what Goddard said to May, or May to him.</p>

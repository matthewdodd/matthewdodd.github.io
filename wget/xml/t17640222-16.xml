            . I keep a public-house; the prisoner brought a coach-glass to my house to sell to an old cloaths-man this day fortnight: I had a frame that would near sit it; and as he said it was given him, I thought he did not steal it, so I agreed with him for it for half-a-crown. When he was gone I took up the news-paper, and there read an advertisement of such a glass being stolen. He had told me his master lived at the Swan at the bottom of Hay-hill,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220009"></xptr> by Brudenell's muse: After dinner I went there to enquire: I found the prisoner was discharged there, and they gave him a very bad character, and that they had forbid him coming there. In the evening there came the other witness and asked to see the glass; he measured it, and said he believed it belonged to the prosecutor. The prisoner came the next evening and called for a pint of beer; I stopped him; he would go with me to his master at the Swan, but he attempted to slip from us as we came near the house. (The glass produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Bright Hemmings. This is just the size, but I cannot undertake to swear this is the property of the prosecutor.</p>

On the 31st of August, the prisoner came into my brother's shop about one o'clock in the day, he asked for a cake of soap, which came to sixpence. I gave him the cake of soap; he offered me a three-shilling piece; I told him it was a bad one; then he offered me a dollar. I took it to Mr. Wilson in the back room. I marked it with a file upon the head. That was a bad dollar. Mr. Wilson said it was a bad dollar. He told the prisoner he had offered me a bad three-shilling token before. Then Mr. Wilson made towards the door to keep the prisoner in; he tried to make his escape. This is the three-shilling token that the prisoner offered me, and this is the dollar.</p>

            . I lodge at Mr. Griffen's. On the 31st of August, the lad brought a dollar to me. I went with the lad, and I said to the prisoner, this is a bad dollar, where did you get it? you have before offered the lad a bad three-shilling token, will you let me look at it; he instantly gave it me. I took it in my hand, and said to the prisoner, it will be necessary for me to detain you. These are both bad, the three-shilling piece and the dollar. The prisoner attempted to escape; he got out of the door. I brought him into the shop again, and sent for a constable. I marked the three-shilling piece. That is the three-shilling piece. The constable searched him, and found ten three-shilling pieces on him.</p>
               <p>MR. BARNARD. I am a constable. I searched the prisoner, and found upon him ten three-shilling pieces, all bad. These are them. I marked them. I asked him how he came by them; he said he picked them up near the Mansion house.</p>

               <p>Q. Look first at the dollar, and tell us whether that is a genuine bank dollar - A. It is a counterfeit; it has the resemblance of a bank dollar. The three-shilling token is a counterfeit, and the ten three-shilling tokens are all counterfeits. They are all of the same manufactory. They are all made from the same die.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the money near the Royal Exchange. I do not know good money from bad; if I had I should not have offered one after the other. I told the same when I was taken as I do now.</p>

I bought fourteen quarters and a half of oats the latter part of the year, they were put over a cart-house; Rush looked after my horse, and did odd jobs - he lived four months with me, and I had a good character with him. The prisoner Townsend was taken up and tried upon some other charge - and, in consequence of some suspicion, I directed that Rush should be taken up, but he got away the same night, the 21st of January; I had some sacks, with the name of Gold, of Brentford, on them - I cannot say exactly when they were on my premises; I had seen them about a month before the 18th of January.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Is Rush in your service still? A. No - he went away; he did not give any account of this till the others were in custody.</p>

            . I was in the service of Mr. Jones about six months; I became acquainted with Townsend, who is a harness-maker, about Christmas last; he asked me, more than once, to get things from my master for him - at last I agreed; he came and called me up in the morning, and I let him into the yard, to get some of Mr. Jones' oats - it was in January, but I do not know on what day; I got up, and was down in the stable between six and seven o'clock - he went up to the loft, and got three sacks of oats; he brought one sack with him - the other two sacks were in the loft, empty, and they were filled that morning; two of them had the name of William Gold, Brentford, on them; he threw them out of the loft, and carried them upon his back; I went with him with the last sack, to Seabrook's premises, and put them into a cart in the shed; they remained there till the evening, covered with hay; I met Townsend that evening, and went to Wighton's house; I did not go on Seabrook's premises - I stood in the road; this was before I went to Wighton's; Butler was with us - Wighton then came, and took two sacks away from Seabrook's premises, in a wheelbarrow - Seabrook was on the premises, I saw him take the third sack out of the cart, and shoot it into the stable; I went down to Wighton's - the two sacks were then taken out of the wheelbarrow by Wighton and Butler, and taken to the back premises; I staid in the road - one sack was brought back by Townsend, which he gave to me, and I carried it back; it had the mark of William Gold, Brentford; I went with Townsend on the Saturday following, to Wighton's house - he was not at home; we then returned to Seabrook's, and he was not at home; we then went to Wighton's, and he was at home - Cooper was in his shop; Townsend went in, and Butler said, "What are you come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220072"></xptr>after?" he said, "Money for the corn;" Butler went to the back premises, and Wighton came out; they had some conversation, but I could not exactly hear what it was; Wighton said, "What do you want for the oats?" he said, "I do not know exactly;" Wighton said, "I will give you 8s. a sack - I have had some from the bargemen for that;" he paid down 16s. on the blocks, for the two sacks; Townsend took it up, and said it would do very well, and he threw back a shilling for Cooper and Butler to drink; Townsend and I then came up the street together - he paid me 4s., and said he would give me 4s. more. I ran away on Sunday night, the 22d of January, and was apprehended by the patrol on the 22d of May. I was going to tell him of it I had been taken up two hours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. Upon your oath, when you were before the Magistrate did you not say that you saw one of the sacks shot into the bin in Wighton's stable? A. Yes; and I persist in saying so now.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you know that there is no bin in it? A. I did not say into the bin - I said I saw it shot; I do not know exactly whether there is a bin in it - there must be something to shoot it into. I cannot read.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Then how do you know the name of Gold was on it? A. Because there were some sacks came from him.</p>
               <p>JOHN EMERSON. I am an officer. I apprehended Wighton on the 24th of May - he said, "I know what you want - it is about the corn job."</p>

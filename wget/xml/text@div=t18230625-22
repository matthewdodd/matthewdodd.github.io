On the 26th of May, I lost 40 l. and upwards; there were twenty-four sovereigns, and a great number of crowns, shillings, and sixpences; it was kept in a small drawer in my bed-room on the first floor, part in a tin box with the letter T on it, part in a bag, and part in an old stocking, and twelve shillings were loose - it was all in one drawer. I went up stairs at a quarter to one o'clock in the day; the room door was then locked, the drawer shut, and the keys in them. I sent my little girl, who is five years and a half old, up stairs to see if the infant who laid in that room was awake; she called, but being busy I did not hear her, and the prisoner answered, "I will take him down;" she was upon the first floor, and brought me the child down, my little girl came first, and gave me the key of the bed-room; they both came together, and supposing the door to be locked, I put it in my pocket; she could not then have been in the room, but a short time; she left the child with me, and went out of the house, and returned in about five minutes; my little girl offered to go up stairs with her, but she said, "I am only going for my bonnet" - she went up alone, and in about two minutes I had occasion to go up to the room for a paper of copper, and when I came to the door, and took out the key, supposing it to be locked - I found it shut, but not locked; I went in, and found the two top small drawers open; the one nearest the door had my caps and frills thrown out upon the floor, but nothing taken; my husband's shirts and handkerchiefs were thrown from the other, and the box, bag, stocking, and money, taken; 9 s. were taken from the loose 12 s., and a shilling from a shilling and two sixpences, which were in the corner of the drawer. I instantly came down stairs, and ran to the next house, No. 18, to fetch the prisoner as my friend; (I had not seen her go out) I did not see her there, but I called out, "Mrs. Hazlewood, I am robbed of all my money;" I heard her make some answer. I ran back directly, and went up to the bed-room - she followed, and one of the lodgers fetched Adams, the officer, who searched the second floor lodger, whom I suspected; he then searched the prisoner, and found 18 s. 6 d. on her - she said she was going to the Court-house to pay 8 s. for her son or daughter, and that the 10 s. 6 d. was her own. She left my house immediately after the search, offering to fetch my husband from Marylebone, where he worked; she came back, and sat down; I scarcely saw her before her mother fetched her, and she was out all night. She had slept at home every night but one, for the last nine months.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's son-in-law, and lived at No. 18, Wheeler-street, next door to the prosecutor's. On Monday, the 26th of May, I went home to dinner, about one o'clock, and found the prisoner in my room; she said, "Ben, you must not go to work, but take this money to my mother" - she gave me some sovereigns out of a tin box, I cannot say how many, but suppose about twenty; and some silver out of a stocking - there were crowns, half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences; she gave me the box, bag, and stocking, and told me to throw them away; she did not say why. I threw them over the pailings, into a stone-yard, opposite the Vinegar-yard, in Old-street, as I went to my grandmother's, who lived in Newington-buildings, City-road; my grandmother was not at home - I found her at Mr. Moore's, Stoke Newington, and gave her the money, which I received from the prisoner. She did not tell me where she got it. My grandmother went and fetched her while I waited in Shoreditch; we then all went on together, and as we went up Shoreditch, she asked what I had done with the money - I said grandmother had got it. I do not know whether my grandmother heard this. We went into a coffee-shop in the City-road; the prisoner had then got the money; I had not seen it returned to her - she counted it, but how much there was I cannot say. There were sovereigns, crowns, half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences; the same kind of money as she had given me, and after counting it, she said she had got all Mrs. Winsbury's money. We came out. She said she had promised to buy me something a long while, and gave me three sovereigns and some silver to buy a watch with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did neither of you make any observation when she said she had all Winsbury's money - A. My grandmother<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250011"></xptr>was out of the room. She told me that when she went up for her bonnet and shawl, the door was not locked, and she went in and took the money. I do not recollect saying anything to her. I bought a watch at Latter's, in the City-road, I have seen the box and stocking since. Mance and Vann apprehended me in the afternoon of the 29th of May, and next morning I gave information about it when I was examined, but not before.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. The prosecutor's house is in the parish of Christchurch, Spitalfields. On the 29th of May, I and Vann went to Matthew's apartments, and found a watch, which I have produced. Next day I went to Smith's stone-yard, nearly opposite the Vinegar-yard, and found part of a stocking, three or four yards from the pailing. On the Monday following I went with Matthews to his master's workshop, near London-wall, and he took from between the bricks and floor a bill of sundry articles, bought at Pearson's, upon which 9 l. had been left in part payment.</p>

            . I am Mr. Leckie's servant, I lost seven handkerchiefs. I went with Ray to the prisoner's lodgings, she said she knew nothing about them - I questioned her about it - She at last produced a quantity of duplicates, among which I found one for the handkerchief, she acknowledged it was for Mr. Leckie,s handkerchief - She said she had done wrong; I told her she must know more about them-after some time I told her I would send for an officer. I went to Lightfoot's by her directions, and found two more.</p>

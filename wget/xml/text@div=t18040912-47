On the 27th, I went to her at the watch-house, and asked her if she had taken away the pin that she was turned away for, and to tell me where it was, I should be glad, that I might obtain it; she then fell on her knees.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to her to speak about this, did you tell her it would be better for her if she confessed; did you hold out any hopes to her? - A. I certainly did.</p>

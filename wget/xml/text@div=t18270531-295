On Friday, the 18th of May, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw five sacks of oats, and one of beans in the loft - I locked the loft and took away the key, and next morning, at a quarter-past five, I went there, and they were all gone; I knew the prisoners by sight - I believe they are labouring men - the lock was not forced - they had got over the chaise-house door, and could then enter the loft - I had not seen them about the premises.</p>

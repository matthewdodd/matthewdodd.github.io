On the 1st of February, about one o'clock in the day, I was in the parlour adjoining the shop; there is a glass door between the shop and parlour; I saw Freeman at the window, with his hand through a square of glass, and two packs of cards in his hand - they had lain near the window - he was in the street - I ran out; he took his hand out of the window, and was going away - I caught him - Lefevere was with him; I told him I had seen him take the things out of my window - he said he had not got them, and pointing to Lefevere, said he had got them; I took hold of Freeman, and brought him back to the shop; Lefevere dropped the cards when Freeman pointed to him, and said he had got them; I saw him drop them down at his side - I had seen Freeman give some of them to him before I got up; Lintoul brought Lefevere back to the shop - there was nobody near them that I saw; they took two packs of cards; a young man, who is not here, picked the cards up, and brought them in; I saw Freeman's hand in the window, and he appeared to have the cards - the glass had been cut two or three months before, and the window robbed, but my husband had puttied it up quite firm before this happened; it was quite firm and strong before they came to the window - they must have forced it through - he forced one piece of glass out inside from the other piece; I sent for an officer who took them - the cards are worth 1s. - when Freeman's hand was in the window, Lefevere was a very little way off, and could see him take them.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Clements, in the Hackney Road, nearly opposite the prosecutor's. I was standing at my master's door on the 1st of February, and saw Freeman's hand through the window taking the cards out, I did not see him give them to Lefevere - they were both together at the window - I had not seen the window before; Lefevere then walked away - another young man who stood at the door with me, ran over and picked up the cards - I did not see how they came on the ground - I secured Lefevere, and took him back to the shop.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green; the prosecutor's house is in that parish - I was fetched from my own house to take the prisoners, who were in the shop; I received two packs of cards from Mrs. Bennett, I believe - I have had them ever since, and never saw the prisoners before - their parents state that they are very industrious boys.</p>
               <p>MRS. BENNETT. These cards are our's - we only had these two packs in the window - I know them by the manner they are tied up; I saw them safe that morning, and saw Freeman take them out - I am quite certain the window was fast before; I have often seen the prisoners about the window.</p>

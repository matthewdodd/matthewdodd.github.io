On the 5th of September the two prisoners came into the shop, Barrymer asked for a jacket, and while Barrymer was trying it on I turned my back to take one off the shelf, and when I turned round I perceived Johnson had stolen a jacket; I saw the sleeves hanging down under his jacket; I said he had a jacket from off the counter; he ran away and threw the jacket away. Barrymer was in the shop while I pursued Johnson.</p>
               <p>Q. That is all you have to say against Barrymer - A. Yes. Barrymer was in the shop when I came back, he had put on his jacket then, and was going away; I told him to stop, that he was a confederate with the other man; he said he did not know the man.</p>
               <p>MR. SYKES. I am a shoe-maker. I was coming along the street at the time, I heard the cry of stop thief. I saw him throw the jacket away, I pursued him and stopped him.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Spotswood. That is the jacket that Johnson took, I had seen it not five minutes before it was stolen. It was stolen from off the counter; it cost seven shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Johnson said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Barrymer was not put on his defence.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of the other three? - I never saw nothing of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he file them? - At a place in Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him six, and he brought back three, did you ask him for the other three? - He was to bring the other three the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it he brought the three? - It was the 19th of November, I don't know the day of the week.</p>
               <p>Q. What are these locks worth apiece? - They are worth half a guinea apiece, in the state in which he had them from me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by them afterwards? - I never had them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know where he lived? - I did not, because he was secreted by another man. I asked him where he lived, but he said it was nothing to me, so as I had my work done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether ever I received the locks back again? - Yes, he says you brought him them, and he gave them you back again to repair.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I can prove to the contrary, I never received them, the man that he has brought against me, did receive them, and sell them; it is a spiteful piece of business, because I would not work for him; I am a hard working man, though he has punished me very much for six months.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a gun-lock filer, I know the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160006"></xptr>soner at the bar, at that time I was at work in the prisoner's shop, a shop which his master had furnished for him, one Mr. Shew, in East Smithfield; the prisoner's shop was in Long-alley, Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you his servant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was in partnership with me.</p>
               <p>Collings. He paid me my wages; I never took any work out or brought any In. One day when I was at work there, his house-keeper, the woman that he cohabits with, brings up six locks into the shop, they were marked I. K. and she told him that he must take them and repair them, and take them to the Tower and get them inspected, and then Mr. Knubley would give the remainder of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you understood that somebody or other had brought these locks to the house-keeper? - Where she brought them from I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand it so at the time? - I understood that he had sent her to Knubley's with them, and they were returned to be repaired.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me just this moment that the house-keeper brought up the locks and gave them to the prisoner, and told him that he must repair them, and take them to the Tower; from that, the first he had seen of these locks was from the house-keeper? - He had made the locks, filed them, and sent them to Mr. Knubley, and Mr. Knubley gave a guinea towards the money, and sent them back again to be repaired.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month or week was that, that you saw these come up into the shop? - I never took any notice of the time; it was some time before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Were six cannon locks brought up there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say about them? - The prisoner said he should not repair them, he should take the names out, and take them to Mr. Shews.</p>

               <p>Q. Who began the conversation? - The house-keeper brought the locks up into the shop, and told him he must repair them; then she went out of the shop and left them; and then he said he should not repair them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the first you ever saw of the locks? - No, the first time that ever I saw the locks was when they were made; the prisoner made the locks.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you understood that Knubley sent back these locks to be repaired? - Yes. It is the rule of the trade for the workmen to take them to the Tower inspector, and if they are returned the workmen repairs them till the inspector puts his mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the reason that he said he would sell them to his master? - No, only he did not like to repair them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether he was in partnership with me or not? - I was not; he always paid me my wages.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He received the money and gave me what he liked.</p>
               <p>Court to Knubley. To whom did you return the locks to repair them? - To Tranter himself.</p>

            . I am an officer. I stopped the prisoner on the 17th of January, in Eagle-street, about half past six o'clock in the evening, with this lead in a sack; I asked what he had got - he said some lead, which he had brought from Penton-place, where he had been working for himself - that it was lead which he had left, and he was going to take it back to Mr. Ransom, in Bedfordbury, of whom he had bought it; I detained him, and went there; they said they knew him, but had not sold him any lead.</p>

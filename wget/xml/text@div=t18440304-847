I was sent for there on Sun<lb></lb>day, the 25th of Feb.—I found Caple and a policeman there—I went into the rolling up shop—I found a square of glass taken off the window of the door—I found some moist sugar thrown about that room, some wine, and a lemon—the lock was forced off the door of that room, and the cupboard broken open—I found an empty port wine bottle, and one of sherry—I went into the warehouse, and found two desks broken open and in disorder—I have since missed a rule and corkscrew—I found a pane of glass taken out of the front area window on the basement story—the space was large enough to ad<lb></lb>mit a man into the front kitchen—the area door was unbolted and unlocked—I had left the premises safe at nine o'clock the evening before—they are large premises—three hours after the first search I and Caple went into the print-room—I there found Hall concealed—I secured him—he had been in our employ five years—I missed a rule, a corkscrew, part of a bottle of sherry, part of one of port, a glazier's diamond, and several trifling articles—part of a bottle of wine had been taken from the cellar, and was left in the warehouse—I missed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the desk.</p>

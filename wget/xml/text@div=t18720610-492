                  </hi>. I am a student, and live at 180, Kenniagton Park Road—I was riding on an omnibus in the Blackfriars Road, about 6.30, and when near the obelisk I saw the prisoner, who had got up on the <hi rend="italic">knife-board</hi>—I was beside the driver—after we passed the Surrey Theatre, the prisoner got on the near side of the <hi rend="italic">knife-borad</hi> and tried to get down by the side of the driver—I should say he was drunk—the driver prevented his getting over, and the conductor came up and told the man to keep quiet, or he would call a policeman—he sat down behind the driver, and some time after, when the driver was hailing some one, I looked round and saw the prisoner with one foot over the seat behind the driver—the driver called the conductor, who collared the prisoner, and he was brought down on his back—the driver gave me the reins and whip, got out of his seat, and turned round to help the conductor manage the prisoner, who was on his back on the roof, and the prisoner gave him a kick, and he went over and fell to the ground—the prisoner was helped down and given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am conductor of this omnibus—I saw the prisoner get up in the Blackfriars Road—he knocked his foot on the step—did not stop for him—his hat fell off—I could see that he had been drinking—some boys picked up his hat, which I returned to him, and said "You are drunk"—he said "No, I am not"—I said "Where are you going?"—he said "King's Cross"—I said "If you ride quiet you will go to King's Cross, if not, you will come off"—I saw him stumble, and said "What are you going to do?"—he said "I want to get over in front"—I said "You will not get over in front, you will stay where you are"—I said "Jack, don't let him go over, the first policeman I find I will have him off," and when we got to Stamford Street I said "Jack, stop the buss, I will have him off," and I called to a boy to fetch a policeman—the prisoner was endeavouring to get over, and the driver stood up and gave Taylor the reins and whip to hold—I said "You shan't go over," and in the struggle he kicked the driver—I cannot say whether he did it intentionally—the driver fell to the ground, and I said to the prisoner "Do you see what you have</p>

                  </hi>. I was the driver of this omnibus—the prisoner got up, and tried to get in front two or three times—he was the worse for liquor, and the conductor and I tried to prevent his doing so—the apron-strap around me, which keeps me in my seat, was undone, and I found him attempting to get in front—I put my hand like this to stop him, and at Stamford Street the conductor said "Hold hard, <hi rend="italic">Jack,</hi> here is a policeman, we will have him off"—I asked Taylor to hold the reins and whip, to help the conductor—the prisoner was lying on his back on the roof of the omnibus, and kicked me in the bottom part of my stomach—I do not sup<lb></lb>pose he meant to do me any injury, but I was knocked off the omnibus and my leg was broken; the kick broke my thigh-bone, and one leg is now shorter than the other—I was lying on the ground, and the conductor said to the prisoner "See how you have served my mate"—he said "Yes, you b—, and I will serve you the same"—I was eleven weeks in the hospital, and feel the consequences now; I shall not be able to work for some time yet.</p>

            . I am a parish officer, I keep a sheep's head shop. On Saturday morning the 21st of March, about half after six, I saw the prisoner Markwell with a dozen of shovels, he had six in each hand; I saw him go into Brittain's old iron shop, <placeName id="t18070408-51-crimeloc305">No. 6, Peter's-lane, St. John-street, Clerkenwell</placeName>

I waited a quarter of an hour, I saw him come out without the shovels; I followed him to High Holborn, into a tool shop; when he came out I went in and made enquiry. I found he lodged at a shovel maker's in the Old-Bailey, and coming down Holborn I met Brittain with some shovels on his shoulder; they appeared to me to be the same shovels that I saw Markwell take to his house. I told him he must not sell these shovels, I had every reason to suspect they were stolen; he said, Tissiker if they are stolen, it is unknown to me, I have given a fair price for them, and there is no harm can come to me; he carried the shovels home. Going along, I asked him if he knew the man that he bought the shovels of; he told me he knew nothing of the man, but he had had dealings with him before. I went home with him, and three of the shovels that were marked with chalk I took to Mr. Haskins in the Old-Bailey; Mr. Haskins said they were his property. I then went and took Brittain in custody.</p>

               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Markwell left his defence to his counsel.</p>
               <p>Brittain's Defence. I bought these shovels of this man; he said he was out of work, and he was employed to sell them any where he could get a customer; I thought I had a right to buy as well as any other person.</p>
               <p>Brittain called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

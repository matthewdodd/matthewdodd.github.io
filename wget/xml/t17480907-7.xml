             . Two fellows came into my shop, and stole 2 guineas.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174809070005"></xptr>Q. What made you suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Taylor . Because he and another man, who is now in prison for the murder of a man, came into my shop, and bought several things, and pretended they could speak no English; and I was forced to shew them in Portugal money what the things were worth.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they buy?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Sometimes silver buckles, and sometimes other things. They asked for something, and I shewed them 12 guineas, as the price of the goods, and they put their hands among them, and mixed them . They came again the next day, and my man charged them with it, and they said they belonged to the Tripoli ambassador; but when I went to the ambassador's house, they knew nothing of them: and I charged the man at the bar with stealing the 2 guineas, and he took me aside, and said he would give me the 2 guineas. I said I did what I did for the sake of Justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . You say you produced 12 guineas, and that the prisoner and the other man mixed their hands among the money; but you cannot say the prisoner took it.</p>
               <p>Taylor. This man was the nearest to me, and I believe he had the money; for the prisoner finger'd the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other touch it?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brugar. I am servant to Mr. Taylor. The prisoner was in the shop at the time Mr. Taylor said he pulled out 12 guineas, and another man was along with him. I don't know how many guineas there were.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire he may be asked whether I had not money upon the counter.</p>
               <p>Brugar. He had money of his own upon the counter, but I did not think of that before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure whether it was Mr. Taylor's money, or not, that he finger'd?</p>
               <p>Brugar. Upon my word I cannot be sure.</p>

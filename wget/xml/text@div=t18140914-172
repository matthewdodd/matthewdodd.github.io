I went out to make water; the prisoner was then breakfasting with the landlady. As soon as I came in again, I saw the prisoner going out; I then found my money was gone, and when I awoke I found my neck handkerchief had been taken off, and the pad of the handkerchief laid down by me where I was asleep, and my bundle was taken from me; it contained two frocks, and a pair of trowsers; the bundle was tied up in an handkerchief I pulled off the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss the bundle before you went out - A. No. A frock and a pair of trowsers were taken out of the bundle; the handkerchief was tied up again. I was leaning on this bundle. He took out of the bundle two frocks, a shirt, and a pair of trowsers; he tied the handkerchief up again.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned and found these things taken out of your bundle, did you look for your money - A. Yes; I did not perceive it was taken away untill I went out, and saw him crossing the yard; I then missed a one-pound note and ten shillings from my right hand jacket pocket. When I fell asleep, there was no other person in the taproom but the prisoner. Seeing the prisoner crossing the yard, I asked the landlady where he was gone to; she said, she believed to the privy. I went out of the house, and went down Wych-street; I went to the King of Pruissia in Wych-street; the landlord asked me if I was looking for any body; I told him I was looking for a man that had robbed me; I said he was a tall man with a green coat on; he told me to come with him; I went into the house with the landlord, and I saw the prisoner. The prisoner would not let me see the bundle; he had my handkerchief in his pocket. I was present when part of my property was taken from him; the magistrate ordered it to be given to me. I found my two frocks, a shirt, handkerchief, and a pair of trowsers. These are them, they are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had no intention of keeping them; he left them in my care; he followed me to the King of Prussia.</p>

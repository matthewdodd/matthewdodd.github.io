On the morning of 17th April, the prisoner was brought to the Smithfield station, about 2 o'clock in the morning—I observed he was without shoes or boots and his trousers were torn, and his hands were Hack as though he had been clambering over the roofs of same houses—I went to the house No. 44, which was empty—I went in and searched it, and on the first floor was an open window—I found these three bags and some Lucifer matches, some of which had been</p>

In consequence of information I went on the morning of 17th April to Farringdon-street, to the back of No. 44, which is an empty house—I got over the wall to No. 43, which is Mr. Emery's—I found the window open on the first floor of the empty house—I went in at that window; I found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, this dark lantern, and this spikelet or large gimlet, three bags, and several Lucifers—I got out of the window again, and found the skylight leading to Mr. Emery's shop at the back had been broken open—from this rope suspended from the skylight into the shop, a person would be able to get from the leads of the skylight into Mr. Emery's shop—I found this pair of boots in the room of the empty house where the window was open, and this piece of cloth—it is called Coburg cloth—I took the boots to the station, and the prisoner put them on; they seemed to fit very well, he had no difficulty in getting one on, the other went on rather hard—there was a ladder in Mr. Emery's shop, by which any one could get up—it was a shop ladder with a board across it, to get up to the shelves—it was a long ladder, it readied nearly up to the skylight.</p>

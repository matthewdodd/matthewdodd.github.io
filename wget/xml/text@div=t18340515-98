            . I am a shoemaker. I have known the prisoner three or four months - there was great animosity between her and the waiter - I have written down on this paper some expressions he made use of (reads): - "My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I, Richard Hall, have come forward in behalf of the prisoner at the bar, Sarah Barker, to state to your Lordship the following words I have heard spoken by the young man-servant to Mr. Worrall, that he thought he was going to leave his situation. I asked him what for? - he said, 'Through that b-y b-h Sall, but he would do for her.' About a fortnight afterwards I went to Mr. Worrall's, and the waiter told me he had good news, yet very bad. I asked him what it was - he told me, that b-y b-h had been robbing her master, and he was very sorry it had happened."</p>

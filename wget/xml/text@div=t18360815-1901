                  </hi>. I am a tool-maker, and live in Goswell-street. On Sun<lb></lb>day morning, the 31st of July, about half-past three o'clock, I was at the corner of Old-street, in Goswell-street, in company with a male friend—the prisoner came and caught hold of my hand, and I felt my ring go off my finger—she held my finger tight—I said, "Be off woman," and felt my ring go—I accused her of it directly—she laughed, and said she had not got it—I said I would give her half a crown to give it to me, for I did not want a piece of work—the policeman came up, and I gave her in charge—she was taken to the station-house, and I heard her telling the policeman</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183608150115"></xptr>
               <p>she had thrown it into the road—I and the policeman went back and found it.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 60.) I received charge of the prisoner—as I went to the station-house, she said voluntarily that she had taken the ring off his finger, and thrown it across the road—I went and found it two or three yards from where they were standing—she seemed sober—the prosecutor had evidently been drinking, but was quite capable of transacting business.</p>

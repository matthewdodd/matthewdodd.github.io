               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did your master have hand-bills printed describing them? A. Yes; I cannot read. I can swear to one rabbit by a slit in the ear; they had black spots on their faces and all over them.</p>

            . I am gardener to Mr. Barkly. On the 24th of February (Sunday) these rabbits were stolen; I went to the pales about seven o'clock in the morning, and saw some footsteps; I noticed one particularly - there was one particular nail in the fore part of the heel-piece, and I traced the marks from the premises, over one field, to Hornsey-lane, about a mile towards Holloway; I do not know the prisoner - I have seen two rabbits here, which I am sure are master's.</p>

            . I am headborough of Islington. In consequence of information, I went to Selley's house, on the 27th of February, and received from him two live rabbits, one duck and one drake dead - I gave the rabbits<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100103"></xptr>to Cox; I went on the same day to No. 12, Brand-street, Holloway, where the two prisoners live - I saw West, and asked him where Singfield was - he said he was not at home; I searched the house, and under the bed found a lot of white feathers in a flat, and then found a lot of feathers in a bag - there were about as many feathers as would cover four ducks; I left, and went there again, and saw West without his shoes; there was a pair of shoes by the side of where he sat; Price, who was with me, took them up, and I looked at them; Price said he thought they corresponded with the foot marks; we made him put them on, and took him away with them; I went next morning to Mr. Barkly's premises with the shoes, and examined the foot-marks in two or three places in the shrobbery, and fitted the shoes; they corresponded exactly with the marks. In consequence of information I went to Woburn, in Bedfordshire, and found Singfield; he saw me and ran away; I followed, and found him at Bow-brickhill, in Buckinghamshire; he was then at dinner - he said, "All you have against me is selling them; not stealing them" - and when on the coach, he said he should not have been drawn into if it had not been for Tom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have known Singfield some time? A. Yes; I never knew anything against him, but I have heard something - the ducks found were plucked. all but the heads; the drake was very large - we found some cock and hen feathers - it was on Thursday that I fitted the shoes; I think it had rained one night since the Sunday, but am not certain.</p>

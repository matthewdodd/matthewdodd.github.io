I am a carman employed at 4 1/2, Duke Street, Aldgate—the prisoner Stone is my uncle—in consequence of what he told me at 11 o'clock on the morning of 1st October, I took thirty sacks to the Parcels Delivery Office—this direction was on them "H. Riley, 1, Water Street, White friars"—that is my uncle's writing—they were sent from the prose<lb></lb>cutor's warehouse in Black Horse Yard, Aldgate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. Henry and Co., sack manufacturers, at 47, Mark Lane, and they have a warehouse in Black Horse Yard—the sacks produced are my employers' property—Stone has been our foreman about seventeen or eighteen years—about 11.30 a.m., on 1st October I received some information about the sacks and went with Detective Child to 1, Water Street, White friars—the door was opened by a woman—a Par<lb></lb>cels Delivery van came up about that time and delivered a bundle of thirty sacks—the woman paid the carriage—I went into the passage with Child—he had a communication with the woman and then he went upstairs—I remained in the passage with the goods—Riley was brought down and Child said "Where did you get the sacks from?"—he said "I bought them of Stone for 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each"—I said "That is only half their value, you know, they are worth 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—he made some reply, but I did not understand what he said, he mumbled something—I had known him before—he had been to our ware-house as a customer four or five years ago—there was a balance due from him.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 5th of July, a few minutes after ten, I was coming home in the evening, I found the street door open. I went up stairs, and when I had been sitting there a few minutes I heard a noise in the shop. I ran down stairs, and saw one man run out and shut the door after him, and shut the prisoner at the bar in. I immediately ran up stairs and gave the alarm; and the watchman came and secured the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, he might have got away. Did you leave the door open. When you came in you found the door open, walked coolly up stairs and sat down. You never looked to see if any body was there - A. No, I did not. I saw the prisoner examined at the watch-house, and a remnant of print was found in his hat. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether the prisoner was in doors when you went in first - A. I don't think he was.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they get in - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the key-hole on the outside - A. No, not the outer door. They picked the lock of the shop door to get into the shop. The street door is about two yards from the shop door.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the shop part of the house - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mr. Douton any partners - A. No, he has not; he keeps the house. It is in the parish of St. Andrew.</p>

            . I am a watchman. As I was coming on my duty, I met a boy running; he said come quick watchman, there are thieves in the house.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160022"></xptr> It was a few minutes after ten. I made all the haste I could. I went up the private passage. I saw two ladies at the garret window. They cried murder, watchman break in if you can, there's thieves in the house. I forced myself in a window opposite to the area, and so got in, and found the prisoner on the stairs. I took him to the watch-house. He was there searched. There was some muslin found in his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine which way he got in - A. No, I did not.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I assisted the watchman in taking the prisoner. I stood at the door and took him down to the watch-house. The watchman got in at the window; he took the prisoner, and I assisted in taking him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FLETCHER. I was constable of the night. A few minutes after ten the two last witnesses brought the prisoner into the watch-house. On examining the prisoner, in his hat was this remnant of cotton and this silk handkerchief. I went afterwards to Mr. Douton's house. I went into the shop, and on the counter there were these two bags. The bags had been filled with property, they were filled with muslins.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards of muslin - A. I do not know myself. After that I sent the prisoner to the compter.</p>
               <p>Q.to Patison. Look at that piece of cotton found in his hat, and the muslin - A. That is my master's property, three yards of printed cotton. The three yards of printed cotton found in his hat is worth six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, as to the other articles found in the bags, does the bags belong to you - A. No, they did not. This muslin is a sample of what was found in the bags; it is nine yards and three quarters. Both the bags were filled with muslins. One of the bags was drawn to the shop door, the other bag was in the middle of the shop, on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen these muslins - A. The day before; they were on the shelves when we left the shop on the Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of these muslins found in the bag - A. Between three and four hundred pounds. I am sure they are Mr. Douton's property.</p>
               <p>Q. When you said you had brought a sample, you meant a part of that muslin - A. Yes. These two are whole pieces, about five yards in length. The value of this part that I have brought is about five pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from my lodgings in Sun-street, Bishopsgate. I heard the cry of thieves from out of the window. A man came out of the house, and shut me in. I was called up for trial last night, my witnesses were then here, they cannot attend to night.</p>

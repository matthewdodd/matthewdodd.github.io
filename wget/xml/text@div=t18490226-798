                  </hi> My father's name is Emanuel; I am fifteen years old. On Thursday, 11th Jan., I came home with my barrow, and went into my father's house, leaving it at the door—I came out in less than ten minutes—it was gone—I gave information to the police—this is the handle of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) it has my initials on it—I branded them on myself—my mother has the iron here.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 82). I took the prisoner to the station on the night of 25th Jan., went back to his house, searched, and in the loft at the top of the house found this small part of a barrow marked "J. H."—I then went to Mr. Jenners', the second house from the prisoner's, the yard of which adjoins his, and had these two handles delivered to me—the small part found in the loft I have compared with the other parts, and they correspond.</p>

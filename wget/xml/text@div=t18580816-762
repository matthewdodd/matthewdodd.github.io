                  </hi>. I am a hosier, living at 221, High Holborn—on Monday, 26th July, the prisoner came to my shop somewhere about 3 o'clock—he asked to look at some shirts—I showed him some—he asked for a better quality, which were 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the half dozen, and said he would have four of them—he then asked to look at some kid gloves, and selected two pairs, at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pair, and then selected a black silk handkerchief which was to be hemmed—the things amounted to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he pulled out his purse to pay me, but I saw that there was little or nothing in it—he then said, "I will send for them, if you will get the handkerchief ready"—he gave the name of Williams—between 4 and 5 o'clock, the witness Lynch came with a letter; this is it—it contained this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—(<hi rend="italic">letter read:</hi> "Monday, 26th July, 1858. Sir,—I enclose 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and shall feel obliged by your giving the bearer the shirts, handkerchief and gloves, I purchased this noon, and please enclose the change in parcel. R. Williams. To Mr. Blackburn, corner of Little Queen-street, Holborn—wait an answer.") I had the goods made up ready, I did not send them; I made up a bundle of cuttings, and sent by him—I next saw the prisoner at the station in custody.</p>

I am a ticket-porter at Lincoln's-inn—on the afternoon of 26th July, about half-past 4, the prisoner came to me in New-square, took a letter out of his pocket, and asked me to take it; I cannot write, or read writing, but this looks like it—he told me to take it to Mr. Blackburn's, at the corner of Little Queen-street, Holborn, and wait for an answer, and bring it to 2, Adelphi-terrace—I asked what name I should ask for, he said Williams.</p>

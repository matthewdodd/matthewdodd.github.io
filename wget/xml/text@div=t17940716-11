I have not seen them since at all; they have never been found.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner with taking these spoons? - My servant came up to me and brought a note that a gentleman had wrote below stairs, and waited for an answer; I immediately got up and looked at the note, and read it; it purported that Mr. Orchard, of Hatton Garden, wanted to see me about some particular business, and wanted me to call about ten o'clock. I immediately sent word down, by my servant, with my compliments to Mr. Orchard, and I would wait on him. In two minutes, or one it might be, my servant comes up again, and says, sir, the person seems to have turned out to be a thief. About a sortnight after that I was sent for up to Bow-street, I don't recollect the day exactly; my servant swore to the prisoner's person; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner came to Bow-street was he in the same dress he is in now? - O no, by no means; he had on a green coat then.</p>

               <p>I am in the service of Mr. Cooper; I am very positive that is the man that came the 1st of June; I knew him the first time I saw him at Bow-street. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160023"></xptr>came about eight o'clock in the morning, as high as I can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear a sailor then? - No, he had a green coat on; he asked if he could speak to Mr. Cooper? I answered him no. He asked how long it might be first? I answered him perhaps in the course of half an hour. He said, he could not wait, but he must have an immediate answer, that he would leave a note, if I would let him have some pen, ink, and paper; which I granted him; I was in the parlour with him while he wrote the note; I never left the parlour till I took the note to my master; when I left the parlour the spoons were in the case, on the side board, open; I only left him while my master gave me an answer.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner when you came down? - No. Immediately I found the knife case that I had left open was shut, and when I opened it a pair of table spoons were gone, marked H. T.C. the name of my master and mistress, and I had left the front door fast, and I went and looked at the door, and found it pulled too, but not fast.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I cannot pretend to plead innocence while the charge is made so plain before me, I only recommend myself to mercy, to you and the jury.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner live servant with you?</p>
               <p>Stroud. Five months, wanting two or three days: she behaved very well till lately: I trusted her to take money while I and my wife were at market, and I believe she gave a just account, and was a very honest girl for three months; but lately she would not do any thing at all, and behaved very bad; I miss'd money at divers times; the first time I miss'd five guineas, the next four, the next three, and the next two; all in a little time: she used to buy herself things, and used to say she had a rich aunt, that sent her things and money; but I since find they were bought with my money; she has confess'd it all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you mistrust her, upon your missing money so at times?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I did not in the least: I thought my wife had taken it. On the 23d of August, I went to put up a guinea and a half into my bag, and I miss'd two quarter guineas, and either two half guineas, or a guinea, I know not which, and some silver. When I took the prisoner before Justice Cowley, she told us where the key was hid that she opened the lock with; the officer went and found it accordingly: I took her down in the ground, and told her, if she would let me know where my money was, I would let her go about her business; but after that I was frighted by the thief-takers; they threatened me very hard, that they would prosecute me if I did not her.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said to her when she confessed?</p>
               <p>Stroud. There was no threatning, as I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing said of shewing her favour?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I cannot say any thing as to that; she own'd every thing, and told me what goods she had bought with my money, and that she had laid out 10 l. 13. 6 d. of my money, and for what. (He mentioned shoes, gowns, stockings, hats, cardinal, necklaces, gold bobs, mittens, buckles, stays, petticoat, bonnet, caps, and shifts, which she owned she had bought and paid for with his money.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I should be glad if she could have favour shewed her; she is very young.</p>

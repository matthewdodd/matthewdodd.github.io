                  </hi>. I live in Crosby-row, Walworth-road; the prisoner has been in my service about six weeks. In consequence of some suspicion, I sent for a policeman—her box was examined in her presence—she un<lb></lb>locked locked it—I found a shawl of mine in it—in consequence of that I dis<lb></lb>charged her—she went away, leaving her box behind—on the following day I made a further search of her box—(I did not search further at first,</p>

               <p>as my wife was in a delicate state of health)—the key of it was lying in the house—I then found another shawl, a silk dress, and two pieces of gauze ribbon—I know the ribbons to be mine by a private mark on them—the shawl I know to be my wife's from her wearing it—the prisoner's mother came with her next day to beg I would look over it, but having found these additional things, I gave her in charge—these are the things—the letter "S" is on one piece of ribbon, and the letter "L" with 'two strokes on the other—I am a dealer in these articles—the prisoner was not present when the ribbon was found; I had sent her away the day before—it was not in the power of any one to put anything into her box after she was gone—I had missed the ribbon long before—I had put the key on the mantel—shelf in the sitting-room—my wife and a little servant-girl had ac-cess to that room—they are not here—the prisoner offered no defence to the shawl being in her box—she said she took the shawl out of the closet in one of the upper rooms, and she said she was very sorry.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable P</hi> 241.) I took the prisoner into cus-tody on the prosecutor's charge—I went up with him, and saw the two pieces of ribbon—he took them out of the box, and handed them to me—the box was unlocked—the prisoner was not present—she was not in the house—I received the shawl from the prosecutor also.</p>

The shawl was taken from the upper room—it was not thrown by, as not to be used again—the value of the ribbon is about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as near as I can form an idea, and the shawl 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have inquired as to her former character, and believe her to be led away by the vanity of dress—there was much more valuable property within her reach.</p>

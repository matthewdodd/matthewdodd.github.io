               <p>Where is the Castle and Falcon? - In Aldersgate-street. The next day Mr. Mott appeared, and the prisoner was taken before Mr. Alderman Alsop; the box was opened and contained parcels of this kind (producing the parcels of pocket-books)</p>

               <p>I am porter to Mr. Mott. On the 22 d of September I took this box from the Castle and Falcon, in a cart, to Mr. Johnson's in Bishopsgate-street, opposite the church; while I was delivering some things there the box was taken out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Can you tell whether it was in the cart when you got to Mr. Johnson's? - I had it in my hand, and missed it about ten minutes after; it lay on some bags of nails, which being heavy, were laid in the bottom of the cart; I moved it to deliver the nails; I missed it as the cart was going on; when I laid it out of my hand I put it farther in the cart; I was never out of the cart; I delivered the bags out to the porter; I imagine it must have been taken while I was moving the nails.</p>

               <p>(The prisoner called eleven witnesses, who all gave him a good character.)</p>

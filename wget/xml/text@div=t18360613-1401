                  </hi>. I am one of the Committee of management of that Sunday-school in Bishopsgate—it is attached to a Wesleyan chapel—it is not of the chapel, on the 18th of May, about six o'clock in the evening—as soon as I went in, I saw the hooks of the hat-holders unscrewed, the knobs of the pulpit door gone, and a book and several other things missing—the gas-pipe burners, two glass-holders, which were fastened—when I went up-stairs, I found the money-box (which is put for persons to put money in for the school) broken open, and the money gone—in the Secretary's room the desk was broken open—I missed eight or nine Bibles, which have not been found—nothing was found except what was fixed, and the hand-bell which was missed from the Secretary's room—it belongs to the Treasurer, Mr. Thomas Tagg, and and the Committee of the school, which consists of twelve—I found the window had been broken.</p>

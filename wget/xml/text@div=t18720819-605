               <p>that before, in former transactions with the father—the prisoner told me to send the goods to 61, Watling Street—I noticed the variation in the address, and spoke to him about it—he said a man who had been employed there as stock-keeper and warehouseman had robbed him of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it was through him the place was given up—he said as soon as his father had received the statement, and it was checked, he would send me the money, less 3 per cent discount—he said "These small matters are always paid for prompt"—if he had come and not represented himself as being there on his father's account, I should not have supplied him with any goods—I supplied him believing he was his father's agent, and that his father would pay for them, and that he had authority from his father to order them—I would not let the prisoner have the goods on his own credit—the 23rd May was the first order—that came to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was the day he made the representations to me—I sent the goods the same day, I believe—I received this order from the prisoner on 28th May—it was brought by a messenger, I believe—I know the prisoner's handwriting—I believe this order to be his—I sent goods amounting to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 1st June I received this memorandum from the prisoner, ordering goods to the amount of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 11th June he earns and ordered more goods—I supplied him with six felt squares, amounting to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—and at various times he ordered goods—on 18th June, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 19th, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 22nd, 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; amounting altogether to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—all those goods were supplied upon that representation—we sent in the statement of account to the prisoner in due course, but I received no reply from him—in conse<lb></lb>quence of something I heard I wrote to the prisoner's father—received a reply, in consequence of which I went to see the prisoner respecting these orders, and I took his father's letter with me, and had a conversation with him—he read the letter—he said it was his sister's handwriting—this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>; "Gentlemen—Answering your letter with statement to hand, I beg to say I have no London house whatever, nor have I any connection with the house referred to in your note—Isaac Leach Stott, signed E. Stott")—I asked the prisoner for some explanation—he said his father and he were at variance, and if I would go to Lincoln's Inn the next day I should have the explanation I wanted—he did not make any particular appointment, he merely said "I suppose you want your money"—I showed him the card, and said "Let me clearly understand, these goods are for the Rochdale house, for your father"—he said "Yes"—I wanted to know if Isaac Leach Stott &amp; Co. was the same as Isaac Leach Stott of Rochdale, and he said distinctly, "Yes, of course"—I did not go to Lincoln's Inn, because he did not give me the address—he said I should see his father there—I corresponded again with his father, and the result was that I instituted these proceedings.</p>

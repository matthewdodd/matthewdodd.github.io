                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 25, Orchard-row, Stepney. I know the prisoner—I lived with him between four and five years—I never lived with any one else; one Friday or Saturday morning, five or six weeks ago, the prisoner made me get up and dress myself about five o'clock—he beat he and kicked me, and made me go to the Minories with him—it was very wet—he told me to stand against a baker's shop-door, three or four doors before you come to a court—he then went down the court—I went to the corner of the court, and saw him climb over a wall, and disappear—I then went and stood against the baker's door for about three-quarters of an hour—the prisoner then came to me—he had five coats tied up in a bundle, and had a pair of black trowsers on over his own, and a small shooting-coat on—he held out his hand, which bad gold and silver in it, and said, "I have got something less than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he told me to go home, and he went away—I reached home first, and he came home about eight—we lodged at Mr. Turner's, 9, Princes-street, Church-street, Shoreditch; when be came over the wall, and brought the coats, he had not his own coat on, and when he came home at eight I asked him where his own coat was—be said he had left it behind—he brought home with him a pair of black cloth trowsers, and made me cut a piece out of the side of the leg and stitch them up, so that they should not be known—after they had been so altered, he wore them—I afterwards went to a policeman on duty to complain of the prisoner—the policeman did not come to our lodging—he went to the prisoner's sister's house and opened a box, and took out the trowsers; I was there—I went and pawned the trowsers, after the policeman had seen them, at Mr. Fawcett's in the Commercial-road, for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that box belonged to Esther Phillips—I had borrowed it of her—I pawned them, because the prisoner's sisters were following me to take them away from me—since that, a knife has been shown me by a policeman—I had seen the prisoner with it, and seen him use it several times—a coat was shown me by the policeman—it is the prisoner's—I had darned it in several places.</p>

               <p>I was shocked at it, that was the reason I would not carry them—I did not remonstrate with him and tell him what an infamous fellow he was—I saw a policeman that morning, when the prisoner was gone down the court away from me—I did not say anything to him, he spoke to me—I saw several policemen as I walked home that morning; I did not speak to any of them—I know a man named Flowers, a companion of the prisoner's; be was not a companion of mine—I was in hit company once when the prisoner brought him to our lodging—the prisoner new charged me with being in bed with Flowers—he did not find me one morning in bed with Flowers and turn me out of doors for it—be turned me out of doors because he said be had some<lb></lb>body else that be would be married to and he did not want me any more—he said he would cut my throat, and he would not give me my clothes—I went to bed, and the next morning, at seven o'clock, I went to the police office—I was never tried in the same court with Flowers—I have been tried, and the prisoner has brought me to it—I was tried for robbing a man in the Commer<lb></lb>cial-road, and he (the prisoner) received the money; it was at the street-door of a house—a sailor followed me there, Mrs. Gray's, I believe—I lived there when the prisoner first had me there—Mrs. Gray is not a respectable woman; she keeps rooms with beds in them—the prisoner lived with me there at the time the man followed me there—I do not know what money he was robbed of—I was convicted, and had six months imprisonment—I live now with my father—I lived at that time with Mrs. Gray—I went backwards and forwards there, and ate and drank there—that was the only time I was tried and con<lb></lb>victed—the Magistrate gave me three months for going into a linen-draper's shop, and thieving—I wanted victuals—the prisoner was at that time in gaol—he left me without a farthing, and without a home—I had nowhere to go, and before prostitution, I preferred thieving—I had the three months after I had the six months—I knew a man of the-name of Flynn; he was one of the prisoner's companions—he was transported when the prisoner had six months—it was while the prisoner was living with me that I knew Flynn—when the prisoner turned me out I went back to my own lodging, in Princes-street—the prisoner never came home all night, and I went back to the same place—I cannot tell when I pawned the trowsers—it was the next morning after I left the prisoner—I did not have them till the morning after I left him—the money is at home now, on my father's shelf; I never touched it—I never was in prison beside the six months and the three months—I was taken up and fined 10a. at the Stepney Police-court—one or two of us got out, and had a drop to drink—I did not break a woman's heed, or strike her—Mrs. Jelly and Esther Phillips was there—she is a young person who used to come to my place—she is a shirt-maker—I believe she lives in White Horse-lane—Mrs. Jelly keeps a sweetmeat shop—she has apartments—she has one bed<lb></lb>room—I have been all over the house—no one was with me.</p>

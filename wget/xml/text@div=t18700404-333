               <p>on the 6th February, as I was going through Bromley Hall Fields, I saw a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in St. Leonard's Road—I, and a friend who was with me, went up to see what was the matter—I got up just time enough to see Templeton strike the deceased—he did not fall—he was struck just about the mouth.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Royal Standard public-house, St. Leonard's Road—I was in a butcher's shop next door to Mr. Haynes', and hearing a noise I went out and saw Abchurch standing with his face to the fish-board, and I saw a blow struck, but by whom I could not say—it was a deliberate blow from behind; it struck him in the jaw—I never saw such a blow in my life—I went and tried to find a policeman—I believe Abchurch was perfectly sober—I don't think he gave the slightest provocation, from what I saw—the position of the man would show there was no provocation, and his back was turned to the man who struck him.</p>

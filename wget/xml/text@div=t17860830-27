D. when it comes in I make the factory debtor for a piece of cloth; when any part is cut off, credit is given for that part; this is the remaining part that agrees with the goods that were left; it makes up the full length; I should suppose, and really imagine it must be my piece, though the place was not broke open or any thing of that kind, how it was taken I do not particularly know.</p>

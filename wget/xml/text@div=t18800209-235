I am a carpenter, of Barking—this basket of tools is my property—I left them on Saturday night, 24th January, in a new villa which is being built at Barking, and on Sunday evening between 7 and 8 o'clock somebody said something to me, I looked for my tools and missed them—I found them at the police-station.</p>

I keep a beerhouse in Barking, and am building a house opposite—Dixon is in my employ—I went to the house on Sunday, 25th January, about 10 a.m., and saw this basket safe in the front room—I went there again about 7 p.m to shut the shutters, and when I got into the scullery I heard a scuffle, the kitchen window was thrown up, and the prisoner jumped out; I rushed after him; he jumped over the palings, I went out to the gate and called "Stop thief!"—he was stopped by a con<lb></lb>stable and brought back—I went into the parlour and found a bag</p>

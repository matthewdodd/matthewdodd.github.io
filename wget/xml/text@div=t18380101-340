                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live in High-street, Hamp<lb></lb>stead. The prisoner was in my service as cook for eight months—it was part of her duty to go out to get porter for the family in the evening—it was constantly her business to do it—she was to get it from Robert Ware—the was taken up on the 18th of December in consequence of a bill being sent into me, the day previous, by Mr. Ware—the amount was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told the prisoner the circumstance, and discharged her—I was in the habit of giving her money for the beer, but not every night—on the 12th of December I gave her a shilling—I am certain of that—it was on a Wednesday, I think—I made a note of the day of the month, previous to my coming here, but I cannot be certain of the day of the week—I made the memorandum from my recollection—there is no particular circumstance which enables me to recollect giving her a shilling on the 12th of December, but I have a general recollection of it—when I discharged her I told her she had been committing various felonies in my house, and was discharged—she said it was all true, she had appropriated it to her own use—I asked how she spent it—she said, "In gin and pastry"—this was the day after the bill was sent in—I discharged her, and another case induced me to have her apprehended—it was only occasionally that I gave her money—Mrs. Reed gave it to her if I was out—there are more instances in which I did not give her the money, than which I did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a publican, and live at Hampstead. I supplied Mr. Reed with porter—I know the prisoner as his servant—I used to send the porter at dinner time, and she fetched it in the evening—on the 12th of December she came for porter—I can be certain of that, because I was not out of the way all the evening, and saw her about half-past nine o'clock—she came for a pint and a half of beer.</p>

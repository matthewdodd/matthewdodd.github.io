               <p>Q. Did he take any thing from you? - Nothing but my cloak, he tore the cloak off from my neck, he broke the string of it; it is an old bit of a white cloth cloak, and my brother ran and catched him.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did your brother bring him back? - He did not bring him back, he held him till I came up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he still in Lawrence-lane, or was he got out of Lawrence-lane? - I got up to him in the same street, he went rather more than the length of this court, about two or three hundred yards from where he took my cloak, when I went up he had got my cloak tucked underneath his left arm, underneath his own coat; my brother called the watchman by his name, and he came and assisted him, and took him to the watch house; I don't know the watchman's name.</p>

               <p>Q. To Mr. Parrott. Was you with Mrs. Hopkins at any time that she was robbed? - A very little while. On the 8th of January, Wednesday night, I was just returning from her, after I had got her a lodging, I had not got above ten yards, I stopped to make water, before I had done I heard this woman cry out for assistance, she was robbed, I went up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150038"></xptr>to her, and she laid down in the dirt, in the kennel of the street; says I, which way is he gone? I did not stop to pick her up, I ran along the street after the man, and I saw the watchman, and I asked him, if he saw any man run past there with a cloak? he said, there was a man just gone before; I went after him, and caught hold of him by the collar; says I, stop my friend, you have got something there that does not belong to you; he makes answer immediately, and says, I have got nothing here belonging to you; I told him, if he had not got any thing belonging to me, he had got something belonging to somebody else, that did not belong to him; and the watchman came out to assist, and we found the cloak underneath his coat; it was a white cloak; the watchman and I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You never lost fight of him, after you took him with the cloak? - No; the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say at the justice's, you was in the house when your sister called you? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Jury. How far was he when you took him from where your sister was robbed? - About three hundred yards; he was ten yards from where he lodged himself, when I took him; the people told me that, where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Hopkins. What is the value of this cloak? - The cloak it is not worth any thing, I don't care what value you put on it; it is worth eighteen pence.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I produce the cloak; I am a watchman. I was at the corner of Bucklet-street, St. Giles's; I was standing in my box fixing my candle in the lanthorn; I heard a woman calling out, Adam! Adam! It is a noisy troublesome place with women there, I took very little notice of that; a man came up to me, I thought he had something under his coat; he walked very unconcerned by the box, in a minute afterwards, this young fellow ran by the box; he said, watchman, did you see a man go by here? I told him, yes; says I, he is just before you; and I bounces out of the box, he went along, and in a very little time, he stopped that man there, and I came up to him, and it was that man there, I knew the man; I found the cloak under his coat, on the left-hand side, hid; I took it from him, and I took him to the watch-house. This is the cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. Who got up to the man first, you or Parrott? - Parrott was the man that caught him first, I had to come out of the box, so he was more at liberty, than I was; I am sure that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any woman? - I saw no woman there, but this woman that came up, and went with us, and gave charge of the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she in the presence of the prisoner say any thing about the cloak? - She said, that was the man that robbed her of her cloak, and used her ill; she was all over mud and dirt, at the same time, very dirty. I have kept the cloak in my possission ever since.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hopkins. This is my cloak.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That same night a man ran past me, as I was making water, and said, balloo! and he immediately dropped the cloak, and I picked it up; I walked past the watchman with it, and I said to the watchman, why did not you stop him, when you saw him? I was not two yards from his box, when he stopped me. I have sent two letters to a man, that I served my time to; he is not here. I served my time to a butcher.</p>

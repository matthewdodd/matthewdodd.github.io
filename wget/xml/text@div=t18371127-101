                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Brewer-street, Somers'-town. On the morning of the 8th of November, James Hartwell came to my shop with this paper in his hand, signed James Carpenter, which is the name of my landlord—in consequence of which I delivered to Hartwell a shoulder of mutton, believing it came from my landlord—he came three times with similar orders, and I supplied the articles he applied for, believing I was supplying my landlord.</p>

I received this paper from the prisoner—he told me to take it to the butcher's in Brewer-street—I took it, and received the meat—I can read—I knew it was not sent for by the person whose name was to it, but I thought it was right—I was not aware that it was wrong—the prisoner was well enough to have gone with it himself—he merely told me to take it to the butcher's in Brewer-street, and I should have the meat—he did not say why he did not go himself—he told me to say that Mr. Carpenter was not well—the prisoner was well enough, but I thought it was right, as the butcher gave me the meat.</p>

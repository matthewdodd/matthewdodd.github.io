                  </hi>. I am a farmer and grazier at Somersham, in Huntingdonshire. I have known the prisoner several years—he in a drover, and I had employed him once or twice—on Monday, the 27th of August, I had eight beasts at St. Ives market—they were not sold there, and I put them into the hands of the prisoner, to drive to London—my directions to him were, if he could sell them on the road he might, and those he did not sell on the road he was to take to Mr. Pollett, my salesman in Smithfield, for him to sell for me there—I have never seen any of those beasts from that day to this, nor have I received payment for any of them—they were Galloway Scots—the colours of two or three were varied, the others were black—I saw the prisoner again on the 30th or 31st of Oc<lb></lb>tober, at Huntingdon, in custody—I had been in the habit of seeing him frequently before August—I saw him on most Mondays at St. Ives market—I was there, I think, every Monday between August and October, and never saw him—I came up to London on the 6th of September, and saw Mr. Pollett on the 7th—I made inquiry about the beasts, and offered a reward.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tyer-up of cattle in Smithfield market. On Friday, the 31st of August, I tied up six Scotch Galloway beasts in Smithfield market, facing the King's Head public-house—I believe three or four were black, and the others partly covered—the prisoner was not there when I tied them—he came about an hour or two after—I saw him standing behind the beasts once or twice during the day—that is the position a man would occupy who was going to sell them—it was in the morning when I tied them up—the last time I saw him about the beasts was, I think, about ten or eleven o'clock—in the afternoon I saw that the beasts were gone—I went to Jones the banker's, to be paid for tying them up, as Mr. Goodbody banked there—I received 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a head—I be<lb></lb>lieve I tied up six or seven besides these—I think I received 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—the six beasts were tied together, and the others adjoining them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waiter at the Shades Stam Packet Hotel, Lower Thames-street—on 10th September the prisoner walked into the coffee-rooml there was no one there—he said, "I expect to meet a gentle<lb></lb>man, I think I am a little before my time"—I asked him to sit down, and left the room for about two minutes to attend to a party outside, and when I returned the prisoner had gone and I missed my coat from behind the prisoner running in the middle of the road with my coat on his arm—I followed him as quickly as I could into Monument-yard and saw him picking up some halfpence which had falled out of the coat pocket—an officer came up on the other side and secured him—I had in my coat a purse with two half-sovereigns and a postage stamp—I have never seen them since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer—I saw Campbell running after the prisoner who had the coat on his arm—some halfpence were falling out of it and I have no doubt that the purse fell out—I took him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I occasionally went to the house to have refresh<lb></lb>man and had been in the habit of leaving my coat there by the door, close by the peg where the plaintiff's coat hung. I was waiting for a friend; I waited as long as I could, and finding he did not come I went out, and being in the habit of hanging my coat there and not thinking what I was doing, I took the coat and did not know it was not mine till some money dropped form it.</p>

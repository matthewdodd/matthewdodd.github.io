               <p>Q. Do you know where he was the evening before he was taken up? - A. Yes; he came into my house first about five o'clock, he went away directly, he only left a leg of mutton, and then, I believe, he went to his tea; about seven o'clock I saw him again, and, I believe, he did not go out after that till between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to leave the leg of mutton there? - A. I do not know; he brought in a leg of mutton, and desired it to be dressed by a little after eight o'clock.</p>

The prisoner came to wash for my wife two or three times; on the 10th of September, my little boy told me that she came into the shop and took a gallon of oil out of a cistern; I went to an officer - we went to her lodgings, some fish oil was found, which corresponds with what I sell - I cannot swear to it, but I have no doubt it is mine.</p>

            . I am nearly nine years old. I saw this woman at my father's shop one day, I do not know when - she took a half-pint measure, dipped it in, and took out the oil from the can, a great many times till she could not get any more, and then she lifted up the can and put it into the bottle; she put the measure down with the others, and took out the oil in a large stone bottle - I told my father of it; I called my sister down before she took the oil - she told me to call her.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Mr. Box to the prisoner's lodgings, she was there - and while I was looking into a cupboard, she took up a pail and ran down stairs - I ran after her, but could not get hold of it before she had emptied it down a gully-hole; I then took hold of the pail and found it was linseed oil; I have been in the oil business twenty years; I said this was just what I wanted - she said it was no such thing: I found two bottles of fish oil in the cupboard in the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I passed by the prosecutor's door, and the little girl said, "My mother wants you:" I left my basket and went up to her; she said, "To-morrow I shall want you to come and do a little washing, but I don't want my husband to know of it - call at ten o'clock, and if he is there, don't say any thing about it;" I went to the house about eleven o'clock, and did her washing - I went again the next day, and asked the girl if her mother said any thing about my money; she said No; I said,"Then give me three quarts of lamp-oil," and she drew it out and served me; the woman owes me a spite, because one day she beat this little boy very much; she is his mother-in-law - and she said to me, "I suppose you don't approve of it;" and I told the neighbours of it.</p>
               <p>COURT to ANN BOX. Q. Did you sell her any oil on this day; A. No; I have sold her half-pints; my mother-in-law was ill, and I went for the prisoner, and she could not come.</p>
               <p>JOHN BARRS re-examined. Q. Did you see any stone-bottle? A. No; there was a white jug by the side of the pail, which had had some linseed-oil in it, and some was spilt.</p>

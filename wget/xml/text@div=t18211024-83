I rent the whole house - there are two doors to it; my brother who is a shoemaker, lives with me. On Saturday the 27th of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was in his shop talking to him, and heard a pane of glass break, ran out, and saw the prisoner at the window, with the clarionet in his hand - it laid in the window just before; he had got it by breaking the window, which was whole just before - it was dark, I saw two others on the opposite side of the way, whom I suspected - when I came up to the prisoner he was not a yard from the window (it is a circular sash, and he broke the pane completely out) - he ran from me - I overtook him about thirty yards off, without losing sight of him - a person laid hold of the lapel of his coat. I believe the prisoner lived in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you take me with it in my hand - A. No; he dropped half of it, and threw the other half away. I am sure I saw it in his hand at the window, his hand was cut, and bleeding fresh, with breaking the glass.</p>

I heard the window break, and saw my brother run out - I called his wife down to mind the shop, then ran out, and saw the prisoner cross the road, and throw something down - the largest piece of the clarionet, was picked up on that spot, the other piece was found close to the window.

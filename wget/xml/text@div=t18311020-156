On the 10th of September, at ten o'clock in the morning, I left my watch on a nail in a turn-up bedstead in the kitchen - the prisoner came to the house as helper to a gentleman who lodged on my first floor; about eleven o'clock at night, when I went to bed, I missed my watch; I had seen the prisoner there about seven o'clock in the evening.</p>

            . I live in Adam's-mews, Grosvenor-square, and am a servant out of place; the prisoner lodged in the same room with me - I lost a great coat, and accused him of it; he showed me three duplicates - one was for a watch; I copied it, as I had heard of Curtis' loss, and gave it to him - I took the copy to Curtis' shop, and left it, on the 26th of September - the prisoner was taken the same day.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DEVELIN. I am a Policeman. I received the prisoner on another charge; I found a duplicate on him, went to the pawnbroker's, and found the watch; Curtis described it before it was produced.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

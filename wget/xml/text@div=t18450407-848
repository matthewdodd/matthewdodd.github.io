About three years ago the prisoner lived with my mother—the window which was entered is in a wing of the house, and belongs to a room which is generally called the nursery—it is very easy to get from that room to my mother's bed-room—the nursery window has no pulleys—there is a fastening to it to keep it down, but nothing to keep it up, on being opened it would immediately slip down again—I have seen the window since—the breaking was Just in a place from which the fastening could be reached—it bad not been broken before that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Shoreditch. On Satur<lb></lb>day, the 1st of March, the prisoners came to my shop—I said, "Do you want to purchase a coat"—they said, "What is the price of it?"—I am not positive which spoke, they were together—I called my foreman to wait on them, and stood by and saw the coat sold—White said to my foreman, "Can you give change for a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I looked in my till, and said I could—Payne gave me a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—it had not been produced when</p>

               <p>White asked if I could give change for it—I gave a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. check and twelve sovereigns for it—I laid it on the counter—I believe White counted it, and gave it all back to Payne—White gave me the name and address of Smith, Ann's-place, which I wrote on the note.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Francis Shaw, a cabinet-manufacturer in Shoreditcb.

                  <hi rend="italic">Payne's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written.</hi>) "However suspicious appearances may be against me, I solemnly declare that I am entirely innocent of any partici<lb></lb>pation in the robbery with which I am charged; nor did I know the pro<lb></lb>perty found at my lodgings belonged to Mrs. Brown. The desk I only received on Sunday morning the 2nd of March; I had never opened it while it was in my possession; I received it from a person named Har<lb></lb>rington, with whom I have been acquainted about six years; she told me it belonged to her brother, who was at Yarmouth, and asked me if I would take charge of it for a few days till her brother's return, which I contented to do, not knowing it was stolen; the articles produced by the pawn<lb></lb>broker, Alton, were pledged by me for the same person; had I known they were stolen property, I should not have taken them to a place where I have been in the habit of going for at least twelve months past, and given my own name and address at the time I pledged them; the two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes sworn to by Mrs. Brown were brought to me by Louisa Harrington; she told me they were her own property, and that she lived at Lambeth; she asked me to change them for her on the 6th of Feb. which not being convenient for me at the time, I told her I could give her eight pounds in money, which I had by me at that time of my own; she accepted that, and I gave her the other two pounds after I changed the notes; the twenty pound notes were my own property, most part of which was left me by a relation some time since; the remainder was my own savings; I took it out of a savings' bank at Chelmsford in Essex, about nine months ago; the five pound notes, also the money which I gave up at the station-house, I received in change of one of my own notes; the head of the diamond ring was given to me by the person Louisa Harrington; I had no knowledge of the value of it, or that it had been stolen, or I should not have had it in my possession upwards of a month after the stated time of the robbery taking place. I wish to state that I only lived in Mrs. Brown's service six weeks, and that is nearly four years since; and during that time I never saw any of the things I pledged for Louisa Harrington. I hope you will take in consideration the extreme improbability of my keeping stolen pro<lb></lb>perty in my possession upwards of a month, and continuing in the same lodgings, and going about the neighbourhood at all times of the day, bad I been aware the same was the proceeds of a robbery committed at a house where I had formerly lived, and was so well known. I never told roy fellow-prisoner, or any other person, that I found 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or any such sum."</p>

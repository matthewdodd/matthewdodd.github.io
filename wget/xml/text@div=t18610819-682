                  </hi>. I am single, and reside at 124, Marylebone-road—on Saturday afternoon, 6th July, about half-past 2 o'clock, I got into one of the General Omnibus Company's omnibuses at the Circus—there were other persons then in the omnibus, but I do not recollect the number—I was sitting second from the door—there was one person next the door, but I was more than half-way up, next to the brass rod—there was a distance between me and the person sitting next the door—when we arrived at Tottenham Court-road, the two prisoners got in—Jones got in first and sat between me and the woman, next to the door—there were three in the compartment and she was the centre one, and was on my right hand—when I got in I had in my right hand pocket my purse, handkerchief, and a small button-hook—inside the purse was a smaller red purse—inside that, were two sovereigns, and in the larger one ten shillings' worth of silver—I had last seen it about 12 o'clock—I had been nowhere to spend any money—Smart sat next the door on the opposite side—she had the child with her that she has to-day, and her purse and parasol in her hand—she did not sit exactly opposite me—I was near the centre, and she was on the opposite side next the door—she was nearer to Jones than to me—as we went to Holborn-hill, I saw her put the parasol on Jones' knee—it remained there some time—as we were going down Holborn-hill I felt Jones draw her hand out of my pocket—I put my hand in to see what I had lost and found my purse was gone—I then said to the conductor in her presence, "Stop, conductor, this woman has put her hand in my pocket and taken my purse"—she made some sort of denial; I cannot recollect the exact words—the omnibus stopped before we got to the bottom of the hill—I do not recollect whether the windows were open or shut—I did not see any one get out—the conductor then called a policeman, and he asked me if I gave the woman in charge—I did so, for robbing me of my purse—I then saw Smart two or three yards from the omnibus, going away—I said to the policeman, "That woman is her friend, I think you ought to take her too"—then the conductor turned and said she had not paid her fare—I did not see what policeman came up to take her, but she was taken—she was not more than three yards from the omnibus when she was taken—there were persons round her, both men and women—there was very quickly a crowd—Jones was taken in custody in the omnibus—she did not get out till I did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the General Omnibus Company's con<lb></lb>ductors—I was conducting this omnibus on July 6th, when the prosecutrix got in—the two prisoners got in at the corner of Tottenham Court-road—I think there were eight or nine other people then in the omnibus—when we got to Holborn-hill, I got down and put the skid on as usual to go down the hill, when I got up again the prosecutrix said, "I have had my pocket picked during the time I have been in your omnibus, I felt this lady's hand leave my pocket," pointing to Jones, who was sitting next to her on her right hand side—I called a police-officer and gave her into custody—I hung my skid up and took money from a gentleman that got down outside—during that time the door was opened and Smart got out—she had not paid me—there were people round her when the policeman was there—she was then about three or four yards off the omnibus—I did not hear Smart say any<lb></lb>thing about Jones—she said at the station-house, that she did not know her, and when given in custody she said she knew nothing of Jones.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shorthand-writer. I took a note of the trial of Henry Robinson in this Court, before Mr. Common Serjeant, on the 2nd of Feb.—Mr. Timmins then stated, that he and his wife had been attending the wedding of their niece at Limehouse church, on Sunday 14th Jan.; and between and half past o'clock at night, that they went to Limehouse stairs to return to their house, at Rotherhithe; that Robin<lb></lb>son accosted them when they got to the stairs, and said that he knew Timmins; that he went with them across the water and nearly to Timmins' house, when he robbed him of his watch and guard chain—they stated that this prisoner, Campion, was the waterman who rowed them across the water—Mr. Metcalfe for Robinson, called this prisoner, Campion, who was sworn, and gave his evidence—(<hi rend="italic">The evidence was here read as at page</hi>, 442 <hi rend="italic">Fourth Session.</hi>)</p>

On Sunday, 14th Jan., I was present at the marriage of my niece—after that was over, I went in the evening to the river side with my husband, about o'clock—we were going home; we went to Limehouse-stairs, Daniel Hurley, and Mrs. Wenham, and Ann Hurley—when we got to the stairs, we got a boat—Henry Robinson spoke to my husband, and made friends with him—he said he worked with him twelve months ago, and knew him very well—we went down to the boat, my husband went in, and he said to Robinson, "If you know me so well, hand my mistress into the boat"—Robinson caught hold of my hand to put me into the boat, and instead of that he threw me into the water—I was smothered up, as far as I could be smothered: all my body went in—after that my husband helped me into the boat—Robinson got in, and my husband, and me—we were rowed across the water; I expect this prisoner is the man who rowed us across—I took such notice of the prisoner that threw me into the Water—I did not take notice of this one—my husband, myself, and Henry Robinson were rowed across the water—we sat on one seat—we went to the Horns, on the other side of the river—after we got out of the boat, Henry Robinson was with us, making friends with my husband—he walked to within a few yards of my husband's house.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner</hi>). I was convicted here last Session—on 14th Jan. I went away from my home, at No. 8, St. James's-place, Wapping, about 4 o'clock, or a few minutes after—about half past 9 o'clock that night I was at Mr. Braggart's, the India Arms, in Trinity-street, Rotherhithe—I left that public house a few minutes before 10 o'clock, when it was time for the man to close his door—I never was on the Middlesex side of the water after ten minutes past 4 o'clock that day—I went through the Thames-tunnel at ten minutes past 4—I never crossed the water at all that day—I never saw this prisoner in my life till he came to the police court at Green<lb></lb>wich—he appeared as a witness against me—they called the man that took the persons over the water, and he came in—I had never seen him before—I did not go over in his boat that night—I never went over from those stairs in my life, nor yet <hi rend="italic">no</hi> other, only against the Tunnel and in the Tunnel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman. On Sunday, 14th Jan., I was the waterman ferrying from Limehouse-stairs across to the Surrey side, till a few minutes after 10 o'clock, when I came to the other shore and gave up my place to Campion—I waited there, I suppose, half an hour—these persons, that were supposed to go over the water, were on the stair head when I gave it up—they were all together—I saw a man and a woman go over—I could not swear to that man and woman—they were two of that party—when the boat was pushed off I was standing on the top of the stairs, leaning against the iron bar—I could distinctly see who went over—it was only a few steps—there were two and the waterman in the boat—I do not know Robinson—the persons appeared by their talk to be in liquor—nothing was said to me by any of them, because I was not against the boat—I did not see any one tumble into the water—I saw a man that had been overboard walk up the stairs—I persuaded him to take his clothes off, and to get home—I thought he had had enough to drink—I saw Ashdown—he took the gentleman over that came up the stairs, the gentleman that had been in the water—he went down to go in my boat, but he would not go with them—he stepped over Campion's boat into another.</p>

               <p>not think it did—when any one steps on the edge of the boat, they would not fall, without they are tipsy—I think it is not possible that they might get overboard; they might get a lurch a little—a lady might not fall into the water—it is not impossible for a person to get in the water, but out boats carry 30 cwt—they are like a little punt to what they used to be.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman at Limehouse-stairs. I remember being there on Sunday, the 14th Jan.—I was there about 10 o'clock—I saw Mr. Timmins, and his wife, and a lot of his friends—as far as I could see they were all drunk—I saw the boat into which they got—this prisoner, Campion, was there—when the boat got under weigh, there were only the boatman and Mr. and Mrs. Timmins in it—I took over Mr. White, the superintendent of the London Dock—he got into my boat from the stairs—my boat was right up to the stairs, and Campion's boat was up to the stairs—when Mr. White came down the stairs he came first to Campion's boat—he stepped into Campion's boat first, and then across into mine, and I took Mr. White over—I landed him before Campion's boat came over—I was coming back with some other passengers, and in coming back I met Campion's boat—we very nearly touched one another—Mr. and Mrs. Timmins, and Campion, were in his boat, and no one else—I am quite certain of it—I was quite near—I had to unship the right hand scull, to pass him—I was the first person who was subpœnaed to attend the police court—when they found I was not the man, Campion came forward—I do not know this man (Robinson)—I did not see him at Limehouse stairs to my knowledge—whether he was there or not I am certain he did not go in Campion's boat.</p>

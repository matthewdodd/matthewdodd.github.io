The prosecutrix called me, and said she had been grossly insulted - she was crying, and said a handkerchief was taken out of her hand, with 3s. in it; I went with her - she pointed the prisoners out, and I took them; there was a young woman walking with one of them - I saw no other woman near Langley; the property has not been found.</p>
               <p>Gibbs. Q. Did you take us together? A. No, they were one hundred yards apart - one was running, and the other walking - they appeared going away from the prosecutrix; one was in the City-road, the other about twenty yards down the Eastern road.</p>

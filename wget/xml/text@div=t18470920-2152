                  </hi> I am in the employ of Messrs. Jennings, Bettridge, and Sons, papier machee manufacturers. The prisoner was in their employ—he had a cash-book, in which it was duty to make entries of the monies he received, and get it signed by whoever received the money from him—we have often sent goods out by him—on the 15th of Jan. I sent him with an inkstand to Lieutenant-Colonel Mitchell—he came back and said the colonel was at dinner, and he would take an opportunity to call an pay for it—the amount was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is the bill which I gave the prisoner of it, in my own handwriting—this receipt to it is the prisoner's writing.</p>

               <p>of by the last witnesses—the prisoner has made no entry of them in his book—this book was given him for the purpose of making entries of the money he received—he ought to have entered these amounts in it—I gave him this book as a check on our accounts, and the first entry in it is my own hand-writing—it began in Nuv., 1845—the entries in it are not all that he has received since then—that is his own fault—he did not enter them—he laid the book aside from gross negligence—the rule was, that whoever sent him out, received the cash he brought back, but if that person was gone out it was to be paid to the person who was there—with regard to the inkstand, I alone was there—I sent the goods to Miss Mortimer—Mr. John Betteridge sent them to Mr. Moxon—I was there when Miss Mortimer bought the goods—she only gave the addresses, 72, Eccleston-square—when the prisoner took the goods, I said to him, "If she does not pay, bring back the name:—when he came back I said, "Have you got the money?"—he said, "No, but the name is Miss Mortimer"—I took the book, and inserted, "Miss Moritmer, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."</p>

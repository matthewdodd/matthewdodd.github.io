On the morning of 27th February, at 10 minutes to 12, I was on duty in Catherine Street—the prisoner came up to me and said "I want to gave myself up, I have killed my child"—I asked him where—he said "5, New Inn Passage; I gave it some poison, belladonna, in an egg cup"—I took him to the station—I then went to 5, New Inn Passage, to the front room, third floor—I found a little girl and boy in bed—this bottle was standing on the table and this egg cup beside it—I spoke to the girl, and from what she told me I took the little boy out of bed and handed him to a woman who came up—its breath smelt strongly of camphor—the woman at my request gave me some mustard-and-water, which I administered to the boy, and he vomited—I had sent for the divisional surgeon, Dr. Mills, and he arrived soon afterwards, and by his direction I took the boy to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the E Division of Police—on the morning of 27th February I was called by the last witness to New Inn Passage—I went immediately and found the child in the act of vomiting from the mustard and water which the sergeant had given it; the vomited matter smelt of nothing but mustard and water—there were no very defi<lb></lb>nite symptoms of any special poison—I was told it had had belladonna liniment given to it, and upon that I sent it to the hospital—the pupils were a little dilated, but nothing more than you ordinarily see in children—dilatation of the pupils is a symptom of belladonna—1 did not see the child at the hospital, I have seen it once or twice since—this bottle was shown to me by Marriott, it contained about 20 or 30 drops of belladonna liniment; I did not analyse it—belladonna is calculated to endanger life, it would depend upon the quantity—I have no doubt the child had very little, not sufficient to poison it; if it had swallowed a poisonous dose there would have been more decided symptoms—the child is only 3 years old—I can't say that it would not have developed symptoms of poison had not the emetic been given immediately, but from the subsequent history I cannot think that it had sufficient to poison it—I afterwards went to the station to see the prisoner—he was in a state of great misery, crying, and very tremulous, and nearly on the verge of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>; he had been drinking a good deal—he said "I gave the child this liniment"—I asked him if he knew it was poison—he said "Yes, it was belladonna," and he assigned as a reason for giving it that the child's mother was very ill in the hospital, and that he was out of work and not able to look after the children—he said he was particularly fond of this child, more so than the other; that he thought the best thing was to put it out of this world's misery, and as he had not the heart to strike it he thought it was most</p>

               <p>merciful to give it this poison, and after he had done it he intended drowning himself in the Thames—I asked him what was to become of the other child—he said that was older and could look after itself—he seemed quite to understand what he was saying—he said he had been drinking for some days and had nothing to eat.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector E</hi>). I was on duty at Bow Street when the prisoner was brought in, he was very excited—Marriott told me what he had given himself up for—I said it was a very serious thing—he said "Yes, 1 know it is, but I have done it"—he said he was in a poor state, his wife had been taken to the hospital on the previous Thursday, and on the Tuesday following he had taken his clothes home (he is a tailor by trade); that he went home about 11.30 the previous night; he had been drinking, the child was very restless all night, and there was no one to attend to it; it coughed very much; he got out of bed several times and carried it round the room; then he thought of dashing its brains out, and he got out of bed for that purpose, but something came over him that he could not do so; that he got into bed again and lay there for some time, and then he thought of the belladonna mixture, and he got up and poured it out in an egg cup and gave it to the child as he lay in bed; and the child after drinking it put his hand up to his mouth and said "Oh, dadda," and he then left the house and gave himself up—he said the belladonna was supplied by a dispensary to rub on his wife's side when she was ill before she went to the hospital—he afterwards asked whether the boy was dead—I said "No"—he said "Good God, I wish he was."</p>

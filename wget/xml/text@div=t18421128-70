                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, and live in Wood-street. In August last, I had a slight knowledge of one Bennett, in business—about the 23rd of August he came to my warehouse in company with the prisoner—Bennett had been to me a day or two before—Bennett introduced him as Mr. Barnard, a very respectable man, who I should be very glad to do business with—he mentioned his name as Barnard, a draper, of Waltham-abbey—Bennett had told me I need not apply to the reference which he gave me, that he had a very good business at Waltham-abbey, and had been there some time—the prisoner then proceeded to look out goods to the amount of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked his name—he wrote down "Samuel Barnard"—he gave me a Teference to Mr. Sculthorpe—the goods were to be sent to the Easter Counties Railway—he said he would take them down with him—he had them the same day—I had not had any communication with Mr. Sculthorpe—I after<lb></lb>wards directed Pratt, who is in my service, to let him have goods—I let him have these goods, believing his name was Samuel Barnard—I would not have let him have them if I had thought it was a false name or address—in October Pratt made a communication about his wanting more goods, and I sent him down to Waltham-abbey—I have never had any money for the goods.</p>

I went down to Waltham-abbey—I found nobody named Samuel Barnard carrying on the business of a draper there—he had given me no number of a house—I inquired for Samuel Barnard, a draper, next door to where he lived, but they did not know him by that name—I saw a shop without any name up—there appeared to have been a name, but it was erased.</p>

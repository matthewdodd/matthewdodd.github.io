I lodge at Mrs. Sullivan's, 7, Wellington Buildings, St. George's-in-the-East—on the night of 16th January, I went to bed about 11.15—there was no fastening on my window or shutter, but they were closed—early in the morning I was disturbed by hearing a chair move close to me—I asked who was there, and got no answer—I saw the prisoner with her foot on the chair, getting out through the window—I caught her hand,</p>

               <p>but she got away from me, and then I caught her dress and held her—she said "For God's sake, let me go"—she had a shirt in her hand, I <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> a pocket from underneath her arm, and I found it was the pocket that contained the papers and tickets—I called Mrs. Sullivan down, and the prisoner was given into custody—I have known her from a child—she was brought up in the neighbourhood—she does not live in the house—the things had been taken from the room, and they were Mrs. Sullivan's property—I pulled them from under her arms—she had been drinking, but she knew what she was about—I don't know that she had ever been in the room before—I go out at 8 o'clock in the morning, and know nothing of what happens till 8 o'clock at night.</p>

I am the wife of Michael Sullivan, and live at 7, Wellington Buildings—on 16th January I went to bed at 10.30; next morning I was disturbed by Mrs. Hannen calling me, "Mrs. Sullivan, Julia Ragan has come to rob you"—I came down stairs, the window and the shutters were open—I put on my clothes, and gave her into the custody of the first policeman for coming into my window at 2.45 in the morning—the shirt and towel and pocket were removed from where they were the night before—there were fourteen duplicates in my pocket—I have known the prisoner from a child—her name is Julia Ragan.</p>

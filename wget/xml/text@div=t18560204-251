                  </hi>. I live at Hillingdon, and am in the employ of Daniel Rutter and another. I had to take care of some empty cottages, in a brick field, belonging to them—I saw them all safe on Wednesday, 9th Jan., about half past 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I had the key of one of the cottages—the tenant had taken away the key of the other—I locked the one that I had the key of, and I tried the front door of the other, and it was safe—the stoves were in that cottage that I had the key of—I went on Thursday morning, about a quarter before 11 o'clock—I went to the cottage I had the key of, and found the shutter broken—there was a pane of glass broken, and the window was open—I went in, and found the left hand room stove gone, and the two brass knobs of the door—from the right hand room there was another stove gone, and part of an oven door frame—an iron window frame, and two brass knobs off the door, and a piece of zinc</p>

               <p>was gone—I went into the adjoining cottage by the back door—I missed the tap from the boiler and the stove from the back room—I have seen some of the articles since and identified them—I was present when the prisoner was examined before the Magistrate—he was called on for his defence—he said that he stole the things, but did not break into the cottages.</p>

                  </hi>, Jan. I am a journeyman bricklayer. I was at work on that Thursday morning about half past 7 o'clock—I saw the prisoner come by the back of these cottages with a sack on his back—about five minutes before, I had heard a knocking in the houses—I am sure the prisoner is the man that came by the back, I knew him well before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 115). I am stationed at Hilling<lb></lb>don. On that Thursday morning I went with Harris to those cottages—I heard him describe the things that were missing—I found the shutter broken of the cottage which he had the key of—the window was open, the back door had been nailed up, and that was open, and the back door of the other cottage was open, and there was a square of glass out of the window, which would enable a person to open the window, and the back door could then have been opened—I suspected the prisoner, and from information I went the next morning to a man named Langley—I saw him and spoke to him—I went to his house in the afternoon—I found three pieces of zinc and part of a window frame—my brother officer had been there previously—Langley was taken and convicted of unlawful possession of the things—I took the zinc and window frame to the cottage, and they fitted exactly.</p>

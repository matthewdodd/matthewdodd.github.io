             thus deposed, The fourth of the last Month a little past 8 at Night, hearing a Noise, I went to see what was the Matter, which when I had been informed of, I went in Search of the Prisoner. - I went to her Father's, and looked round the Kitchin, but she was not there. I went and searched the Cellar, but she was not there. I went up one Pair of Stairs, but she was not there. I went into the Garret, and she was not there. At last I looked up the Chimney, and about 7 Foot high in the Chimney there stood the Prisoner stark naked as ever she was born, and just as I looked up down she dropt into the Room: - But had she fell before I had seen her, I should have been sadly frighted. I asked her how she got into the House, and she told me, she could open any Door whatsoever; and then went into her Father's Cellar, where we found the Goods<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172612070007"></xptr> here in Court. The Prisoner made little Defence; but a Gentlewoman that she had lived with gave her a good Character: And another Gentlewoman, whom she had served since the Former, deposed, That for six Weeks before the Prisoner left her Service, she was distracted, and that she herself got an eminent Physician to prescribe for the Prisoner. And some that were Evidence against the Prisoner, acknowledged that sometimes she used to do wild Actions; and when asked, why she did so? would answer, Punch bid her do it. <rs id="t17261207-59-verdict238" type="verdictDescription">

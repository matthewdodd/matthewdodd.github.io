             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What is your partner's name? - A. Daniel Jones; we are <rs id="t18040516-24-viclabel140" type="occupation">manufacturers of chimney-ornaments</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18040516-24-victim262 t18040516-24-viclabel140"></join>

               <p>Q. In consequence of any information did you go to his house, and when? - A. On Monday the 16th of April I went to his house opposite the Red-lion, Hampstead, I told him I was coming that way, as he had offered me a chimney-piece for sale I thought it was a good opportunity; he very readily shewed it me; when I saw it I knew it to be mine; I then asked him if he could let me have a wider shelf; he said if I liked the chimney-piece as it was I might make a wider shelf for it; I told him I wished to have it without any alteration, therefore if he could make me a shelf to suit my purpose I would call and treat with him; he said he had a shelf at Ship's that would do for me, and after a pause he said it would not, it was not so wide as that; on that same morning I called again, I saw a little slip of marble in Ship's presence that I knew to be mine; I caused the prisoner to be apprehended immediately; the slip was brought from Ship's the next day by the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Whether that stone you swear to, and this chimney-shelf which he readily shewed you, was not at one time or other to be made up in a chimney-piece for you? - A. At no time; the shelf is mason's work; he had no mason's work from us in Portland-road; he had then a small pedestal to make for us.</p>
               <p>Q. He was employed by other masters as well as you? - A. Certainly; the prisoner is a carver, he never was employed by us in doing any thing like a mason.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Ship? - A. He is a polisher of stones.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You went to this man's house under the idea of buying a chimney-piece? - A. Yes, I thought it was an opportunity of seeing whether it was mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he get chimney-pieces from, he only being a carver? - A. I understood then from him he made chimney-pieces.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What are you? - A. I am a polisher of marble, I live in Holbrook-court, Swan-market: On the 11th of April I received a slip of marble at Hampstead from the prisoner to polish.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the flip of marble Mr. Cook saw at your house? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Is there any particular thing in this piece of marble that you should know it from any other person's? - A. I brought it from him, I had five or six pieces of marble to work for Mr. Waterman.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Suppose that piece of marble had been out of your possession eight or ten days, should you know it again? - A. Yes, we only polish it on one side.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer; I produce the slip of marble from the house of Ship.</p>

               <p>- SHAFFIELD sworn. - I am an officer, I took the prisoner in custody; I produce a shelf brought from the prisoner's lodgings, I made the prisoner carry it himself, for fear he should run away; I have had it in my possession ever since; I produce another slab, brought from Mr. Cook's yard.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I told Waterman, that, if I had this stone brought from my yard to compare with that stone found upon him, he would see that nothing but a saw parted it; there is a shake in each; he said, he could not help it, he bought it of a man in the Curtain-road; he took the child from his wife, and in a moment threw it into her lap, and then run away across the fields; we went after him, and took him; I have since compared it, I am positive it was sawed off the piece of marble in my yard, because of the shake, and the black veins answer one with the other, and these corners taken off there; its rough part is taken from the rock. (The prosecutor identified the pieces of marble, by comparing them both with other pieces of marble they had been sawed from, which corresponded.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I purchased the marble of Nevill Edmonds, he lived in the Curtain-road, since that he let his yard to go to Norfolk, I paid him twelve shillings a foot for it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

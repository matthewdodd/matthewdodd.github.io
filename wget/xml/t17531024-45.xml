I was very much startled, the moon shone very bright; I gave myself a little consideration what I had best to do, and now I might best attack him; I thought there might be some danger in coming out to breast him, for fear he should have arms, so I thought if he went to go away I would take hold on him: when the prisoner found I was awake he moved off, and got up two steps of the ladder, and was one foot upon the third, I then walk'd my man that lay in the next cabin, and told him there was a thief; and as the prisoner was just got within one step of being out of the cabbin, my man catch'd hold on him by one leg, and I by the other, and we pull'd him down directly into my man's bed, which is near the ladder. My man then said, master see that he has not got your watch, I was afraid it was gone, but I had no occasion to search his pockets, for when the prisoner sell the watch fell with him ; I then said, Jack, we have no need to search his pockets, for here it lies close by him. We then took him ashore to the watch-house, and he was committed to the Compter for that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a manufacturer of paper for hanging rooms, and carry on business in Lowther-arcade, and at Kensington—the prisoner was in my service, in different capacities, for thirteen or fourteen years—he had been originally a journeyman paperhanger—in 1838 he made a proposal to sell paper for me, which I agreed to—I told him I wished to see what he could do before I fixed his wages—he agreed to that—in the mean time I allowed him at the rate of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he was to find customers, to tell paper<lb></lb>hanging to, to deliver the goods to the customers, which he was to get from my warehouse, to deliver the accounts, receive the money and deliver it to me—he was to get the accounts from my ware-house—it was the duty of Angero, my book-keeper, to make out the bills of parcels to be delivered to the prisoner, to be delivered to the customers—the prisoner had no business to make out bills in his own name—in 1839 I came to an arrangement to pay him ten per cent.—upon my oath I never arranged with him for a partnership—I was not aware that he claimed any thing like a partnership with me till after I gave him into custody—I had a customer of the name of Loat—I have got my books here—here is an entry from May 1838 to May 1839—part of it is in Angero's handwriting, the other by a clerk I had previous to Angero—if the prisoner had an order from Loat in May, 1838, it was his duty to give the particulars to whoever might be the shopman at the time, to get the goods, and on re<lb></lb>ceiving them, to write down in a book the date he received them, the name of the party they were for, and to sign his name—he copied this from the order book, which I keep myself—the book kept by the prisoner is the check order book—it agrees with my book—on the 21st of May the pri<lb></lb>soner appears from his own book to have received thirteen pieces of paper, No, 8887; seven pieces, No. 8771; five pieces, No. 8605; one and a half, No. 8914; twenty-seven, No. 8796; seven, No. 8898; and eight. No. 8893—these are all the entries in my book, and stated by him to be left at Loat's on the 21st—there appear in his own order-book in June, July, August, on to December, and in April and May, 1839, different items received by him down to May 31, 1839—Mr. Loat's account was 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it ap<lb></lb>pears on the 25th of September, 1838, he paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 11th of May, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., leaving a balance of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which has not been paid—if the prisoner had received more than that 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was his duty to have at I once accounted to me for it—I never allowed him to sell goods on his own account—after the 24th of June, 1839, he accounted to me for moneys received from other persons.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might he not even with your goods, provided he entered them, have done business on his own account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—the agreement was that they were all to be sold in my name—the longest time that we were without settling any account was seven weeks—I advanced him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a week, which amounted to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., when his commission did not amount to 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., so I stopped it—I knew he had worked for a great variety of builders and persons as journeyman paper-hanger, but he was my servant all the time to sell goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live at Balham-hill. Before the 24th of June, 1839, I received a considerable quantity of paper from the prisoner—up to the time he delivered the last, I did not know I was being supplied with it by Mr. Teu—he supplied it to me in 1839, in his own name—I knew no other person in the transaction—I received some bills of parcels of the prisoner—I have some of them here in September, 1838—on the 25th of September, I paid him on account of this bill 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had before that paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the 30th of October, I paid him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on the 27th of November, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on the 24th of June, 1889—he received the balance of all I owed him—he did not deliver a bill for a balance of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due from me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am book-keeper to Mr. Tea. I have been in the habit of delivering bills from time to time to the prisoner to deliver to the customers—another person also occasionally delivered bills to the prisoner—Mr. Teu's name was at the head of the bills—it was the prisoner's duty to deliver the bills to the customers who had the goods—in January last, I delivered to the prisoner a statement of the balance due from Mr. Loat to Mr. Teu—it was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he stated that it was his own fault that it was not paid, but he should be going that way shortly and he would call and get it in.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming to your father's shop on any day? - A. Yes, on Saturday the 7th of December between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the shop besides yourself? - A. My sister; the prisoner when he came in the shop said he came from a lady for two yards of lace to trim a spencer; we asked him what sort he wanted, he said he did not know: if we would give him some patterns he would pay us for it. My sister said that she never cut patterns, but he talked to her a long time, so wishing to get rid of him she looked for some; all this time he stood by the shop window, close by the door, and while he stood there, he kept rubbing the right side of his face: so that his hand was even with the lace which hung in the window; while my sister was looking for the patterns he snatched a piece of lace from the window; I heard a little noise, which was occasioned by the ticket falling that had been pinned to the lace, and looking at his hands I saw it in his left hand. I said you have got a piece of lace, my sister came round the counter and took it from him; he said he did not mean to steal it; he immediately made up to the door and ran away. A gentleman passing by, saw him run, came to us, and asked what he had done; we told him he had stole a piece of lace; he was pursued and brought back, he was delivered to Hawthorn the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the lace here? - A. Yes, this is it (producing it).</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A. A guinea. Prisoner's Defence. The piece of lace was laying down on the ground, and I picked it up.</p>

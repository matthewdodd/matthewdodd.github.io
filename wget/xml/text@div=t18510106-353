                  </hi>. I keep the Talbot, public-house, Chester-street, Belgrave-square—the prisoner was my potman, and carried out beer—he had been in my service two years—in consequence of information, the night before the prisoner was taken I marked three shillings and two sixpences, which I placed in the bowl in the till in the bar; the till was not locked—the prisoner had access to the bar—he slept on the premises—the bar was locked up during the night—he had not a key of it—next morning a policeman came to me—I examined the till about a quarter before seven o'clock—the prisoner had been up probably half an hour—the bar was open then—my daughter usually got up about half-past six o'clock—the prisoner was given in custody, and a shilling that I had marked with a penknife just under the ear, was found on him, and some halfpence—this is it—the prisoner had no right to go to the till to take money—he had never been allowed to go to it at all—if he received money he was to give it to me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-serjeant, B</hi> 46). I was employed by Mr. Goodyer to watch the prisoner—I went to the house, and cut a bole through the floor of the club-room and through the ceiling, over the till, and by lying down I could see every one that went to it—on Thursday morning, 2nd Jan., I went at about a quarter before five o'clock—I had a key and let myself in the house—I heard the bar opened about half-past six o'clock—I did not see who opened it—I then saw the prisoner go to the till, open it, put his hand in the bowl, and take out either a shilling or a sixpence—I acquainted Mr. Goodyer of it—I then looked through the <hi rend="italic">hole,</hi> and saw the prisoner go again to the till and take some halfpence—</p>

               <p>I then came down-stairs with Mr. Goodyer, who went to the bar, and the prisoner came along the passage towards the back yard—he had his band in his waistcoat pocket—I seized him and searched him—I found on him this shilling and some coppers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the Thursday before, my mistress gave me a shilling, and on the Wednesday one and sixpence more; she said that was half-a-crown for my Christmas-box; I said I was going out for a holiday next day, and asked her if she could lend me any money; she said she did not know, but if she could get any money unknown to my master, she would give me some; what money I had on me beside what she had given me was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; for what I know, this might be one of the shillings she gave me.</p>

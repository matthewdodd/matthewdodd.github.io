            . I am a Bow-street officer. On Thursday, the 25th of May, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, I stopped Guy with this iron and brass socket under his arm, in a bag; Haines was with him - I asked what they had got; Haines said, some old iron, which the foreman where he worked, at Mr. Stracey's, had given them for a perquisite; I went to their masters there, and found what they said was false; I said I would go, and they said they would go with me; I left them in Hall's custody, and said I would go by myself.</p>

On the 25th of May, about half-past eleven o'clock, Haines asked me to lend him a bag - I went into the skeining-room, and he took up a bag, which I gave him leave to do; I saw the same bag afterwards at the public-house, with the property; he had told me he wanted it to take home some logwood grounds, which were given as perquisites. I had never given either of them this property.</p>
               <p>HAINES' Defence. I put the grounds into it to burn; this piece of iron was in it, but I did not know it; Guy came and said, "You have got a piece of iron."</p>

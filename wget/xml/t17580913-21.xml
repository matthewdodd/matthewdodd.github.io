            . I was present when this money was put into the desk; I told it out, and put it there. There was the same quantity that my father speaks of. On the Thursday morning I found the desk open, and missed the money; I observed the desk to be cut with a knife, I borrowed the prisoner's knife, and found it to fit the place; then I sent my brother and another person to search his lodging; they went, and soon returned with the money; after that, we sent for an officer and charged him. He said, he found the gates open that go into our work-house, and came in, and so to the counting-house, between 11 and 12 at night: he tried to cut a hole, but, in trying, found it loose; so he thought it was easier to break the lock, than cut a hole; so he broke it open, and took the money, and carried it to his lodgings, and went to bed, and the next morning he came to work.</p>

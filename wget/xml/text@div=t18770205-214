I live at 69, Horseferry Road, Westminster, and am a contractor—I have a number of horses; Belchambers was in my employ as foreman of the yard, and Carter as chaff-cutter—I had about thirty horses in the yard-in consequence of something I noticed I communicated with the police-Rayner was employed by a person named Haylock, who stands his van in my yard-previous to 11th January, I know that sacks and corn were being stolen; I saw that from an examination of my stock—on the "morning of 12th January, I saw three sacks of corn in Rayner's van, after the police had stopped it, the name of T. and G. Wright, corn merchants, who supplied me, was plainly marked on those sacks, and the corn was the Same description as that supplied to me, the value of it was 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—no one had any right to remove it.</p>

About 6 o'clock, on the morning of 12th January, I was in company with detectives Preston and Clinch, and saw Rayner coming out of Mr. Wynne's yard, driving a van and pair of horses—I stopped him about 5 yards outside the gates—I told him we were police-officers, and I wanted to know what he had got in the van—he said "Nothing"—I pulled the tarpaulin on one side and saw three sacks—I asked what he had got there—he said he did not know—I asked where he got them from—he said, at first, he did not know—at last he said two men down the yard had put them in; I asked where he was going to take them—to—he said he did not know—we took him to the station and found that the sacks contained oats.</p>

At 9 o'clock on the morning of 12th January, I went to Gibson's yard in Edward Street, Vauxhall Bridge Road, about half a mile from Mr. Wynne's yard—I followed him through the yard into a public-house, with Clinch and Barrell; I asked him if he knew who we were—he said "No"—I said we were police-officers, that we had got Mr. Wynne's foreman and another in custody for stealing some corn, and we should like to look in his stable—we asked him if he had any—he said "Unfortunately I have had some, you can look in the stable," and we did so—he said the last two sacks came last Thursday morning, and that Haylock's man, Rayner, always brought them—on the way to the station he said that all the corn found in the stable had come from Mr. Wynne's, and there were 21 sacks in another sack, which had been brought there by Harrison—he said he had paid Belchambers and Carter, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the two sacks of oats and one of maize, brought the week previous—I afterwards went back with Barrell, and measured the quantity of corn in the stable—there was 9 1/2 sacks altogether—I saw one horse in the van, and a pony he brought into the stable—the corn and sacks were afterwards shown to Mr. Wynne—Gibson said he should toot have done it, only they were always bothering him to have it, and he had been dragged into it by the others.</p>

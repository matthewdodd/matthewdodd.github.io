                  </hi>. I am an oilman, and live in Strutton-gronud, Westminster. The prisoner was employed by me for ten or twelve months to go round to my customers and receive money—he ought to account to me the same evening as he received it—if he received 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Malkern, he has not accounted to me for it—I did not see him again for four days after,</p>

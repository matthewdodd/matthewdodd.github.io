               <p>Q. What did he do? A. Nothing that I know of - he did nothing with a stick; I was examined before the Coroner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the Coroner that he struck at you with a stick? A. No; I was in the dark - I told the Coroner I could not see: I cannot read - I have not said he struck at me with a stick when I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say he struck at you with a stick - you did not know whether he struck the child, but you screamed out that he had killed the child? A. No, I have not said it - I did not hear the child scream.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any harm done to your child that night? A. I cannot say whether it was during the morning, or whether it was him or the children - I took the child to the hospital in the morning as its arm was broken; I did not give it any blow - I did not know whether it was him or the children, as I took her out of bed, and put her into bed with my landlady's children; the child did not scream out, but I said, "John, you have hurt my baby;" he was drawing the stick in his hand, and it fell by the bed-side out of his hand; I then said, "John, you have hurt my baby," but I moved it to my side, and it went to sleep again; it died five days after - I went to the Middlesex-hospital: it was taken care of by the doctors there - its arm was broken that night by somebody; I cannot say whether it was by myself, the children, or him - I never had the stick in my hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The child went to sleep after you heard the stick fall? A. Yes, quietly; it never cried after that - the room was quite dark; the landlady's eldest child is about twelve years old - I was not sober enough to remember what I did; I had some gin about half-past five o'clock, before I came home, and had beer at home; the prisoner is a well disposed man when sober.</p>

            . I keep the room in which the witness lodged; I knew the prisoner by the name of Gower- he came to my room on this day, and we all slept in one room; I sat up drinking with them, and went to bed about half-past one o'clock: they went to bed at the same time: I was not tipsy - there are two beds in the room, and my four children slept there; they did not beat the child - the prisoner and Mahoney had been jawing - that awoke me; the prisoner wanted to go out to his employ about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, and she would not let him; I had locked the door, and told him the key was on the box - he asked to have the door opened, and asked for his neck-handkerchief; I heard a violent blow on the bed, and the baby screamed out immediately; Mahoney said,"John, you have killed the child;" he returned, and struck a light, to look at the child - I had said to her, "Why do not you get up, and get the man his neck-handkerchief to go to work?" he said, "I have left my wife and family, you ****, and neglected them for your sake - you have given me something to drink, which compels me to follow you;" he said if he did not get his neck-handkerchief, he did not care if he hung at Newgate; I cannot say what he meant; when he found the baby's arm was broken, he ordered her to go to the hospital, to be taken care of; he said something about a ****; I got up, and lighted a fire - he laid hold of the stick in his hand, and wanted to strike her again with it, but I laid hold of him, and prevented him, and the father of my children also, who slept in the room; they went out together, leaving this child in bed with my children.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When he found the baby's arm hurt, was he not very sorry? A. He was, indeed, more so than the mother; I did not see the blow given myself - the mother aggravated him very much indeed, and put him in a passion; he begged her to let him go to work, but she would not - I was sober: the prisoner appeared found of children.</p>

            . I am surgeon at Mount-street infirmary. I was present at the examination of the child's body, which was conducted by Mr. Howship, before the Coroner sat - the only mark of external violence was a fracture of the left arm; we found bile effused in the cavity of the abdomen, and a small rupture in one of the ducts which convey the bile from the gall-bladder to the intestines - the vessels were all healthy; on one side of the brain there was a slight fullness - the fracture of the arm was recent; the child appeared to have had proper nourishment - I cannot form a distinct opinion of the cause of death, as such slight causes will produce death in children; the appearances found were sufficient to cause death, and they certainly proceeded from violence; if it was hit with a stick, though under the clothes, those appearances would he produced, the bile and other appearances, as well as the fracture.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you examine the lungs? A. I did - I could not tell whether it had had a cough; children of that age are liable to a hundred ailments, that after death the appearances would be equivocal; the fracture continued, but I could not say whether the arm had been set - there was no bandage on it, and it was too recent to expect union to take place; there was no external appearance on the arm - it is exccedingly possible that the fracture could be produced without, but I should expect some mark.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Would not the probability be more in favour of non-appearance of marks, the child being under bed-clothes? A. Certainly, but it might have had marks- the mere fracture would not produce the appear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050090"></xptr>ances I have described, but if the stick hit other parts it might.</p>

            . I examined the child - a blow given on the Led-clothes certainly might have caused the appearances; a stick like the one produced, used by a powerful man like the prisoner, would be likely to produce external marks; but under the bed-clothes it would be much less probable - I cannot give a positive opinion of the cause of death, but the appearances cannot be doubted to be sufficient to explain it - such appearances could searcely be produced without external violence - I apprehend if blows were given in the front of the infant, it would be more likely to have produced the appearances.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Death might have originated in a great many things? A. It might, certainly, in so young an infant; it is probable a drunken woman in bed with the child might account for the violence - I should not expect to find external marks on the arm - I had a man under my care, whose leg was carried away with a cannon shot and the other broken, and there were no external marks; I am disposed to think an infant's body is not more likely to betray marks - I consider the fullness of the vessels of the brain unimportant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I paid every attention to the child from the time the mother was put to bed, till I went to her lodging by appointment, and know nothing of what is laid to my charge; the man of the house went out with me and his wife to a public-house, and the child was put into their bed with their children for four hours.</p>

S. I. in a heart, and which was marked Henley, it appeared to contain about two bushels of malt, or rather more, when he came out I observed him go towards the house of Parker, it is about a hundred yards from this place.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Parker? - He collects sacks for the West country barges, he keeps an iron shop, and buys things of that description, iron and rags.</p>
               <p>Q. How did West take this sack? - He took it on his back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be weighty, or how? Not very weighty, I see him take it, and go in great haste to Parker's house.</p>

            Did you see him go into the house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What next happened? - I had occasion to go to Parker's house, for thirty quarters of sack of this very mark that I saw on the prisoner's back. Parker goes to different brewers about the town, collect the sacks for the west country barges; I saw that come out of Parker's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring any thing out with him? - He did not.</p>

               <p>Q. When he came into the house did you observe any thing? - I went into the room on the left hand side, and there I saw the very identical sack that West had taken there; the tier was loose, and I put my hand in, and it appeared to be malt that was stoned, not sweepings, it appeared brisk, and if it had been sweepings, it would have been slack and damp, it appeared as it was taken from the heap; Parker was not at home; when I saw Mr. Day, I communicated it to him, and I and master went afterwards, about seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the time you went before? - One o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Parker at home when you came there? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what past when you went there with Mr. Day, was the sack there in the same state? - It was, and Mr. Day challenged Parker with buying malt of his man (West, the prisoner) he said he knew nothing about it, and then Parker asked the wife; and she said that a man had brought a sack there, and threw it down and went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they taken into custody? - Not till the next day, I was at the apprehending of West, at his master's warehouse, the next morning; he said he was innocent, he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You see the sack the second time in the same place where you had seen it before, though there had been six hours to remove it? - Yes.</p>

            Now with regard to West, Owens is the foreman of Mr. Day, I believe he is over him? Did not West tell you that he took it by the directions of Owens, and that he is bound to obey him? - He did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not Owens absconded immediately after? - He did, when West was apprehended, he put on his coat and went off.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the situation of the oil warehouse, with respect to the malt warehouse? - The oil warehouse is directly under the malt warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any communication between one warehouse and the other? - There was not; I had been at a great expence this spring, to have all the floor stopped with brick and mortar, because there had been a great deficiency before.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any body being in the oil warehouse, have access to the malt room? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you went with Mr. Lyon, the last witness, to Parker's? - I did; I examined the warehouse the next morning, on taking up West, and found it all perfect underneath, I was not at a loss to know from whence it came in; I examined up the stair case, and on the first flight up the stairs, there was a hole broke in one of the boards, about eight inches long, and six broad; the piece was made to slip in and out, seeing that had been broke, I took it down, and Mr. Whitbread's man examined it the next morning.</p>

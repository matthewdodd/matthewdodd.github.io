I had the money in my hand when I went to her room. I wrapped the sovereign in the notes while we sat there, and put them into my pocket; the prisoner took them out, and ran away directly. I met her in the street three or four days after - I was not above five minutes with her, but am certain of her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What information did you give the officer respecting the street you was robbed in? A. I do not know the street; I never mentioned the name of it, or the number of the house - I never said it was No. 20, White Lion-street, or that it was at Mrs. Clark's. I met her again on the Wednesday following, in the same place - I did not give charge of her; and, on the Friday after, she was brought to me by a shipmate - and was secured.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why not take her on Wednesday? A. I was afraid she would run from me.</p>

            . On Saturday, the 4th of August, the prosecutor came to me between five and six o'clock, and said he had been robbed; I went with him - he could not point out any house. On the Friday he sent for me, and said he had seen the woman, and his shipmates were going to bring her down; she was taken, and he swore positively to her - she was remanded twice, but he had given us information of quite another person altogether.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has not the other person absconded? A. We have seen her since, but he swore positively to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Sunbury, sixteen miles from London. I was at the Angel inn, Brentford-bridge, last Monday, and had a cart standing there with some linen and one loaf of bread in it—my attention was called to the cart—I followed, and saw the two prisoners, and took the loaf from under Perkins's arm—Sloame was in his company, and they were both eating the bread—I had had a loaf of that description in the cart, and when I came up it was gone—it cost me 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Isleworth. Last Monday I was passing the Angel inn, about nine o'clock, and saw a cart standing there loaded with linen—I saw two soldiers pass—one of the two made a stop at the cart—I walked on, looked back, and saw one of them take something out of the cart—I cannot say what it was—I met a boy, and told him, "These young men seem to be tipsy, and they have taken something out of the cart, I wish I could see the person belonging to it"—I went over, and told the prosecutor—he came out, looked under the basket in the cart, and said, "A loaf"—I went on when I heard it was only a loaf—they appeared tipsy, and were laughing and <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engraver, and lodge at 255, Strand, at the house of Mr. Nicholas, a tobacconist. On Saturday, 7th Sept., a short time before four o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by Mrs. Nicholas (Mr. Nicholas was absent in the country)—I went down and spoke to a policeman—I then went to the back of the premises, and waited with Thur<lb></lb>tell, eighty or ninety paces from the front entrance—I then went to the front entrance, opened the window of a back-room, got out on to the leads of Mr. Nicholas's house, and saw the prisoners on Mr. Wilson's house, the second house to the right towards Temple-bar—I shouted, "Look out, there are two of them!"—I was then about four yards from them—in half a minute after, they walked along the wall of the next house to ours, and dropped four feet down from Mr. Tomlinson's wall—one of them, I should say by his voice it was Charles, said to those below, "Well, we will come down"—I saw nobody below—they immediately dropped into a passage at the back of the house to the ground—it leads to some houses, but is no thoroughfare—I ran to the back, and found George in custody of a policeman, and Charles in Thurtell's charge, who was holding him by the left-hand, with a loaded pistol in his right—I tried to seize him twice—he put himself in a very menacing attitude, and said he would not move from that spot without a policeman, and threatened to knock the teeth down the throat of anybody who attempted him—I ran and found another policeman—we all went to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Nicholas, a tobacconist of 255, Strand, next door to Mr. Tomlinson. I was asleep at the top of the house about four o'clock in the morning, and was awoke by the landlady—I went down with Ryder, and remained outside with a policeman—Ryder left us and shortly after he called out, "Look out below, there's two of them!"—saw the prisoners come from Mr. Tomlinson's wall—they got down about four feet, then got down on to our roof, and dropped down into the street near us—I had a pistol; I put it to Charles's head, and threatened to shoot him if he made the least resistance—Ryder came up—Charles put himself in a fighting attitude, and said he would not go off the spot unless we had the assistance of a policeman, and he would knock the teeth down any man's throat who attempted to take him—another policeman came and took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Dobree and Tomlinson, pawnbrokers and silversmiths, of 254, Strand; it is Mr. William Benham Tomlinson's dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Clement Danes; I sleep in a room at the back. On 7th Sept., I was awoke by Mrs. Tomlinson about four o'clock—I looked out at the back window, and saw two men crossing the back premises to the wall of Mr. Nicholas's house, where they dropped—I afterwards saw the prisoners in custody—I examined Mr. Tomlinson's premises about a quarter-past six—the bar of the back-parlour window had been wrested out of its place and bent—there are two bars which cross each other; they go through, and a pin is put inside—the other bar was in its original state—I had fastened the window at seven the evening before—the bar was not bent then, or the pin could not have been put in—I found the bracket of the spout removed, and a piece chipped off, as if somebody had come over there—the slides were displaced three or four feet from there—the back-parlour shutters were newly painted, and I saw the print of a dirty hand just in the middle where it clasps—that mark was not there the night before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What sort of a bar was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A quarter of an inch thick; there was a mark of the palm of a hand upon the bar, and of the fingers on the shutters—that is about six or eight yards from the front of the houses in Newcastle-court—from Mr. Tomlinson's you can look up New<lb></lb>castle-court, or down into Pickett-place—it was a very nice light morning—you could distinguish a person at the length of this Court—the parlour-win<lb></lb>dow looks into a yard which is enclosed by a wall about nineteen feet high.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Charles Woods, of Lichfield Street, Soho—on 31st August, I went to bed, leaving the kitchen door locked' and the window bolted—the kitchen was nearly half full of wet clothes, which I had hung up to dry—I slept upstairs over the kitchen next morning, about 7 o'clock, I sent my daughter down, and she came back, and told me something, and I went down and missed a blanket and shirt—I do not know what else was missing—I was going out to give information at Bow Street, and met the prisoner Monzona in the street, with a bundle under her arm—I said "I want to see what is in that bundle"—she made me an answer which I did not understand—I said "I should like to know what it is, as I feel confident that is what I am in search of"—I saw a blanket, and I said "I feel confident that is mine; I shall wait till a constable comes, and have it examined"—she said "Don't make a bother in the street, wait till my friend comes back," and she pointed to Manley who was on the other side of the street, and who went on without looking across the road—Monzona had a towel on her arm containing some bread—I noticed that the towel was marked, and joined in the middle—I could see that it was mine—I pulled the things away and said I would lock her up—she said "I have not done it myself, the other person was with me, and I do not know why I should suffer alone"—I told her to follow Manley, and pushed her by the arm—Manley had the other things—I examined them—</p>

               <p>she went to an empty house, and could not get out—I waited fur a consta<lb></lb>ble, still holding Mouzona—the policeman brought Manley out of the house—a lot of boys pulled the clothes from her, and brought them to me—this blanket is mine—I found ray window unbolted, and open about half an inch—one pane of glass was broken when I hung up the clothes, not large enough for anybody to get in, but there was a high place for them to stand on, and they could put their arm through and unbolt the window.</p>

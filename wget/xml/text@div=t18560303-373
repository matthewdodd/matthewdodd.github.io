                  </hi>. I am housekeeper to Mr. Johnson, who keeps a beer shop at Barking. On the evening of 13th Feb., between 7 or 8 o'clock, I was in the tap room, and the prisoner, who was a servant at the house, was sit<lb></lb>ting on the tap room table—I told her to get off, as it was not a place for her to sit on—she said that she would sit there, and I said that she should not—she was not drunk—I took hold of her arm, and said, "You will not sit there"—I took her off the table, and she turned round and scratched my face—whether I hit or pushed her I cannot say, but she caught hold of my dress, tore me down on the ground, and the watch fell from my bosom—it was a silver patent lever watch, with a gold seal—it is valued at 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a diamond in the middle of it, it was Mr. Johnson's—a person in the room said, "Mistress, get up"—the prisoner got up, took up the watch, and ran out immediately—I went after her, but could not find her, and before I came back I went to the police station and gave information—I then went back, put on my bonnet and shawl, and saw her with two women in the street, rather below the Bull—I said, "Mary, I want you, give me the watch, there is a good girl, and come home"—she turned round, and tore the string off my bonnet, and it fell down—I would not let go of the tail of her dress, and got her back—she began to abuse Mr. Johnson—he said that she was going, so I called a policeman in, gave her in charge, and she was taken away—there were people in the tap room—I saw a man named Bennett there—whether he was there the first time she went away, I cannot say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Barking. I was in Mr. John<lb></lb>son's tap room about 9 o'clock on 13th Feb., and saw the prisoner with the watch in her hand—she went out of the tap room, and I do not know what she did with it—she offered it to Mr. Scotcher, but he would not take it—I saw a policeman run after her, and he brought her back almost directly—she had gone out the back way—that was the only time I saw her—I was not there between 7 and 8 o'clock.</p>

               <p>them say so—I dare say she was brought back in a minute or two—there were several people in the bar—she held it to Scotcher, but I did not hear her say anything—he is alive and well, at Barking—I beard him say that he would not have anything to do with it.</p>

On 13th Feb., about 9 o'clock, I was called into Mr. Johnson's beer shop by Rebecca Toulson, who pointed to the prisoner, and said, "That party has stolen Mr. Johnson's watch from me"—while I was speaking to her, the prisoner ran out at the back, and I ran after her, caught her in a thoroughfare at the back of the houses, and told her that the charge was stealing a watch—she said, "I have not got it now"—she had then ran 100 yards, I should say, from Mr. Johnson's, and was in a path leading into another main street—I had not lost sight of her—I have searched for the watch in the gardens on each side, and in some water butts, out of which I let the water, but could see nothing of it.</p>

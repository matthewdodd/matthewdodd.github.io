                  </hi>. I am lodging at Mr. Harris', in Point-street, Ports<lb></lb>mouth—on the 12th of May I was on Wimbledon Common, on my way to Portsmouth—I was near some trees—the prisoner came up to me with ano<lb></lb>ther man, who asked me if I was on the road—I said "No," I was standing there because it was raining—the prisoner then asked me if I wanted to buy a razor—I said no, I did not know that I did, what sort was it—he took it out of his pocket and showed it to me—I was going to buy it—I took a small bag out of my pocket which contained a half<lb></lb>sovereign, a sixpence, and three pence in copper—I was going to get the threepence out of the bag, and the prisoner caught the bag out of my hand—I was going to catch him, and the other man said if I touched him he would give me some cold steel—they went off for thirty or forty yards, then ran as hard as they could—I stood under the trees till they were out of sight, and then pulled off my smock-frock and followed them—I got sight of them a long way a-head, and followed them for five or six miles—when the prisoner got to Kingston he went into a baker's shop—I followed behind a cart and passed the shop—I then saw him come out of the shop and come up towards London again—I gave information to an officer, who took him—I can swear he is the man that took my bag.</p>

On the 12th of May Payne gave me information—I proceeded in pursuit of the prisoner, and saw him at the corner of Coomb's-lane—I asked him whether he had not offered a razor for sale, and while I was speaking to him the prosecutor came up and said, "That is the man that robbed me"—the prisoner said, "I have not got the money, the other man has got it"—I took the prisoner to the station—I found nothing on him—this is the razor Payne gave me, which he said he had of the prisoner.</p>

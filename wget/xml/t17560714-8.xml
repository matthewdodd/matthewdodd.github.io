I saw her in bed; then I went out, and shut the door after me, and when I came back I found her and the things mentioned were gone. I apprehended her; then she said she let a woman in that was her acquaintance, and she got up and took the things, and went away with them. She told me where they were, and I found one gown at the pawnbroker's by her direction. Produced in court and deposed to.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does she live?</p>
               <p>T. Hands. Her name is Pain: In Bow Street, Bloomsbury. The prisoner said she had fetch'd out some of the things and sold them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Blake. I am constable. I was sent for to the prosecutrix's. I went with her to the pawnbroker; and found this gown there that is here produced.</p>

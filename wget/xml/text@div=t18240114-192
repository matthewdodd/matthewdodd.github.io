On the 6th of January, at seven o'clock in the evening, my sister called me; I ran into the street, and saw the prisoner at the top of the alley adjoining the house - it is no thoroughfare; I accused him of stealing some soap - he made no answer, but ran down the alley. It was dark, I returned to the shop, and missed three bars of soap and two parcels of starch. Nicholls produced the soap in a few minutes.</p>

I told my sister, who followed him out; I followed her, and saw him standing in the alley adjoining the shop. She charged him with taking it; he said nothing, but ran down the alley.</p>

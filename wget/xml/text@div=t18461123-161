                  </hi>. I am fifteen years old, and live with my father, Edward Henry Firmin, who keeps the Rising Sun beer-shop, Larkhall-lane, Clapham. On the 10th of Nov., in the afternoon, I was in the shop—the prisoner came and asked for a glass of ale on trust, as she had no money—she sent me to ask my father a question—he was in the tap-room—I opened the door, looked through a little hole in the tap-room, and saw her go to the till—I saw her with the till open, and her hand in it—as I came back she returned her hand to the till, and I heard the till shut—she sat down, and seemed confused—I did not take any notice of it to her—I went into the parlour, and when I came hack to the bar I saw her at the till again, and a penny in her hand—she shut the till, and sat down again—I went to my father, to tell him, and on looking through the hole again, I saw her go to the till a third time—I then flung the door open—my father got up and came out—she had a handful of halfpence in her hand, over the till, which was wide open—she dropped some into the till, and some out—my father took a penny and two halfpence off her lap, and as she went away I picked up four penny-pieces and halfpence, which fell from her apron—she was given in charge—there had been about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the till before she came in—I had been to it just before she came in, and put (6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into it, and there was about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. before that, and afterwards 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep this beer-shop. On going into the bar from the tap-room my daughter pulled the door open, and said, "Here is a woman at the till"—I ran out—the prisoner was inside the bar, with her hand full of halfpence, in the till—she dropped some into the till, and I found 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in her lap, when she went and sat down by the fire—she was the worse for liquor.</p>

I lost thirty fowls from my yard. The poultry were all safe on the evening of the 24th. I heard that there was a man detained at Edgware with Poultry. I went there and saw the twenty-six fowls; I knew three of them to be mine by the plumage. I swore to three of them before the magistrate, and Mason was in custody charged with stealing them. The property was found upon him.</p>
               <p>- WOTTON. I am a farmer; I live at Edgware. On the 25th of January I was at work by the road side about the middle of the day; the prisoner Mason came down the Edgware-road; his wife and daughter were with him, and a sack across his donkey. I asked him if he had anything to sell; he said, no I then asked him what was in the sack; he said nothing but a bit of hay for the jack ass. I told him I thought he had got fowls; he said it was no odds to me if he had. I took him, his wife, and daughter before the magistrate. There were twenty-six fowls in the sack; they were dead. The magistrate asked him where he bought them. He at first said he should not tell him; afterwards, he said he bought them of a higher below St. Alban's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know anything of the other prisoner - A. No. The magistrate said if he would swear that he bought them of him he would give him his liberty; he swore then.</p>

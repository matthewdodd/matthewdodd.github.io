                  </hi>. In 1873 I was in business with my brother Joseph, at 22, Well Street, as James Procter and Co., warehousemen—prisoner was a wholesale clothier at 6, Anthony Street, Commercial Road—he bad bought woollen goods of us for six years—we gave him two months' credit and discount, and then we gave him longer credit and discount by drawing bills, and he met them till 1872, when he got behind—in conse<lb></lb>quence of something that happened my brother went to see him in March; he then owed us only 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had been to the premises in March, and con<lb></lb>versed with him, and seen stock there, and business going on as usual—we sent Upton, a porter, there on 4th April to present a bill for payment—he came back, and, from what he said, I went there and found the place shut up—we afterwards got inside and found it empty—we saw the other credi<lb></lb>tors,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187911240075"></xptr>
               <p>and then filed a petition, and the defendant was adjudicated a bankrupt—he did not attend any of the meetings—I have seen furniture in his house—I only proved for one bill for 56<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because the other bills had not matured—he has been since examined at the Bankruptcy Court, and his son-in-law Rosenberg—in consequence of information I went several times to a house in Virginia Place, Commercial Road, and saw the defendant's wife, sons, and daughters, and recognised some furniture as Sternheim's, which I had seen at Anthony Place—he now owes us 330<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the debt and the expenses of the bankruptcy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I liquidated my affairs in 1873 for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; some of my creditors got 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and others 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; there is only 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. wanted to make them all up to 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I paid it to every creditor—I have been up and down stairs at Anthony Street—I have not heard him describe any woman as his wife; that woman was introduced to me as his wife by his sons and daughters, and I believe she was his Wife, because she became chargeable on the parish when he deserted her—there were two grown-up sons and a daughter; I did not see a daughter-in-law—I will swear to seeing a chair and a table, but cannot remember other things, it is so long ago—I did not sell them; the landlord claimed six months' rent, or else I should have, but he did not put in, an execution—I had not seen the defendant since the latter end of March—I have never had a paper off the file, but I received three proofs as trustee; they were left in Court—I did not swear to two exhibits, one of 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and an invoice for goods supplied, 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., covered by a bill—here is the proof which you say was re<lb></lb>moved from the file; it was not sworn by me—the goods were supplied on 7th February, 1873—he was indebted to McCarthy 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a member of the committee of inspection—M'Carthy did not, to my knowledge, go to the premises and remove the goods which he had supplied—he is not here, he is laid up with gout—these circumstances took place 18 months previous to the bankruptcy—he had 200 coats, and gave Sternheim credit for them—two sons and one daughter worked in the business—if I had known that this old man had pawned the goods to raise the means of paying my bill I should have given him in custody—he did not tell me the last time I saw him that he should return the goods and go back to Rotterdam.</p>

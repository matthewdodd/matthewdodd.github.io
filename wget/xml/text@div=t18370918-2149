                  </hi>. I am bailiff to Mr. Thomas Fagg and others, coach proprietors and farmers, at Bedfont. They keep their horses there to sup ply the coaches—the prisoner was a carter, and drove one of their teams of horses in the farming line—at twenty minutes before two o'clock, on the 14th of September, I was called up to assist a friend of mine, who died in his chair, and I got up to go there—I was not watching the prisoner—I had no suspicion of him—one of my master's wagons was there with two loads and a half of straw in it—(no corn)—which the prisoner was to take to the Bell and Crown, Holborn, for their own use—I saw the prisoner there—he ought to have set out about one o'clock, and this was near two—I looked over the granary gate, and saw him draw a ladder away from a part of it—I went and asked him if he was not going—he said he was a little</p>

               <p>too late, and he went into the stable, where the straw stood which had been loaded two days before—I sat on the barn loft, and he came in with three horse cloths—he took the ladder, and went up the load of straw, he was some time up there, covering it over, and that gave me some suspicion; when he went to get his horses from the stable I got up the ladder, and on the top of the straw I saw four sacks of corn—he got his horses in, and went seventy-eight yards, then I called him, and told him to stop, as I had got a little parcel to send; I kept him till the policeman came up, and then I got the ladder and got them down—they are my master's oats, and the sacks are marked with his name in full.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police horse-patrol. I was called on to take the prisoner—I saw the sacks and corn—I asked the prisoner, "What about this corn?"—he said, "If there is any corn there, that is more than I know; it must be done to spite me"—he said, in going along," I am innocent; there is more guilty in the yard titan I am"—this was about four o'clock in the morning—about eight o'clock he said Lovell had been to the cage to ask him to say nothing about the oats.</p>

                  </hi>I am a watchman in the employ of Mr. Peto and another, on the Blackwall-railway—the prisoner Cox was a mason's la<lb></lb>bourer there. On the night of the 14th of June, between nine and ten o'clock, I was watching near Three Colt-street—Howard lives in Three Colt-street, adjoining the railway—there is an archway adjoining his pre<lb></lb>mises—I saw Cox throw several pieces of timber called battens over into Howard's premises—he took them from the archway adjoining—he threw them over a fence, from eight to ten feet high—Howard was at that time in his own yard, and took one of them up—I said, " Halloo, what game do you call this? this game won't do for me"—Howard made no reply, but brought the piece of timber a little way back towards the archway—be went into his own house—I came off the railway down into Three Colt-street—I met Cox and Howard both together—they said they were very sorry for what had been done—I said I should apply to my master and leave him to do as he thought proper—Howard said he was very sorry it had happened, he hoped I would not do any thing in it, or say any thing about it, would I go and take any thing to drink? Cox said he wanted several pieces of sticks to put up the dahlias in his garden—Cox went back into Howard's yard and threw the pieces of battens back again—he came to me and said he hoped I would not say any thing about it any further, as he had put them back again—I told my employer, and then picked up the pieces of wood—these are them.</p>

               <p>hand, I called out, and he carried it two or three yards towards the railway—when he took it up first he was going towards his own house with it, and then he brought it back and left it—I had been standing at the front door talking to Howard, and then Cox went in at Howard's front door—I then went into the archway and saw Cox throw the timber back—Howard was then talking to my employer—Howard is a shipwright.</p>

What this man has stated is three parts false—I was going to the necessary, and fell over these pieces and hurt myself—I had bad a little to drink—I got up, and flung the pieces, as hard as I could, in all directions—this man was as much in liquor as I was, or rather more—he was talking to two women—he said he should not have seen me if I had not made a noise—I was talking to two masons, and Howard came and asked me if I was aware what I had been doing. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. These pieces were along the archway—I did not see him fall—he was not in liquor—I saw no more boards thrown about—he did not make a noise—I was talking to two women.</p>

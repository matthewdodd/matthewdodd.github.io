                  </hi>. I keep a second-hand clothes-shop at Greenwich. On Wednesday, the 12th of May, the prisoner came to sell a waistcoat for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I declined it—he then said, "Will you give me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>?"—I said, "No, you are an indifferent character, and I want no dealings with you"—he threw the waistcoat on the floor over a pair of cotton stockings—he took it up immediately, and the stockings with it—he left my house immediately, and went over to the Ship and Last public-house—I followed him, and saw him place himself in the settle of the public-house—I said, "You have taken a pair of stockings along with that waistcoat"—he said, "I have not got them"—I said, "If you have not, you know where they are"—I sent my wife for a policeman—she had gone over to the house will me—the policeman came, and the stockings were found by the pot-boy—the prisoner threw them under the table, after the policeman came—I saw them in the policeman's hands—I did not myself see where they came from.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pot-boy at the Ship and Last public-house. Last Wednesday I saw the prisoner going over to Mr. Fleming's—he afterwards came back, and sat down in our tap-room—Mr. Fleming came over, and sent for a constable—I saw the prisoner take the stockings out of his coat-pocket, and <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> them under the settle—I got under the table, got then, and gave them to my mistress, who held them till the policeman came, and then gave them to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you see Mrs. Fleming come in and accuse me of having them in my pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—you went out into the yard two or three times—you pulled off your coat and waistcoat—I did not see you empty your pockets—you went into the yard two or three minutes before Fleming came in—then you came back, and sat down on the settle—you only went out once—you were sitting on the settle when Fleming came in—Fleming said, "You have got my stockings"—you said, "I have not"—Fleming then said, "I will go and fetch a policeman," and went out, and after that I saw you pull the stockings out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Mrs. Fleming was present when I turned my pockets out, and said, "Now do you see whether I have got it?" <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not see that—he put his coat and waistcoat on again while the policeman was sent for, and took the stockings, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> them under the table—he had the coat down under the table while he did it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner in charge, and received these stockings from the landlady of the public-house—he denied having taken them—he was considerably in liquor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was drinking at the Ship and Last public-house, with three or four more—I had no money to pay my share, and one of them said, "Go and get something on your waistcoat at Fleming's," who lends money on articles, but for the last month I have dealt at another house occasionally, and that has given offence to Fleming—he would not lend me any thing on my waistcoat—I went over to the public-house again—he came, in about five minutes, and said I had got his property—I took off my coat and waistcoat, and emptied my pockets, to show I had not, and they saw they were not there—I am certainly of opinion it is a con-spiracy, for the stockings to be conveyed to the house, to get me into trouble—I never took them—Mr. and Mrs. Fleming frequently came over to drink with me at the house.</p>

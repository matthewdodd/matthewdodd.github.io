                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 112.) On Sunday evening, the 1st of June, I was on duty in Went worth-street, Whitechapel, about seven o'clock in the evening. In consequence of information, I went to the White Swan, Upper Keate-street, Spitalfields—I saw the prisoner standing within the door of the house creating a disturbance with some persons there, and challenging them to fight—he was a little the worse for liquor, not a great deal—I requested him to leave the house, and not create a disturbance, or he would be locked up—after a short time he left the house, and went to where he lodged, which is in the same street, went up stairs, and presented himself at the window, and began abusing me, calling me all the villains and the thieves he could think of—I went away after that, and in consequence of what I heard, returned to the same street, and found the prisoner in the midst of forty or fifty persons—he was then challenging the same party to fight, a man named Crawley—I heard him say he would not go to bed till he had his revenge on the party that night—I requested him to go in doors, or I must take him to these station-house—he went to the door, and put himself in a fighting attitude towards me—he afterwards went in, but before that he said, if I dared to touch him he would jump my b—g—ts out—I went into the house with him, remained there about ten minutes, and requested him to stop in doors, and not go out again, or he would be sure to be locked up—I left him, and went away—shortly after, in consequence of what I heard from Burcham, I returned to the same street, and saw the prisoner there with Lloyd, a constable—he was kicking in a most violent manner—when I came up to him, Burcham took hold of him on the right side, and I on the left—we proceeded with him towards the station-house into Red Lion-street, and at the corner of Lamb-street he commenced furiously kicking me—I threw him on his back, keeping hold of him, and while he was on the ground he kicked me twice in the privates—I was stooping over him—he aimed at that part, and kicked me very violently—he did not use any particular expression—after kicking me the second time, I explained to Burcham</p>

               <p>that something was broken—I felt a dreadful pain, and was scarcely able to stand; but owing to the crowd, I continued to hold him—after gettine up and proceeding along Lamb-street, he tried to get my hand into his mouth, but another constable came up and prevented him—he then gave me a violent blow on the right ear—I was afterwards examined by Mr. Mears, the surgeon, and had a rupture, and am still under his care.</p>

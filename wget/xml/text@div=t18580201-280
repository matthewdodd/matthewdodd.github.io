                  </hi>. I am master of the workhouse at Camberwell. I know the prisoner and knew her daughter, Mary Bennett, she was about 17 years old—she was admitted into the workhouse on Monday, 28th Dec.—she re<lb></lb>mained there under medical treatment till 20th Jan., and then died—on 13th Jan. she made a statement to me—I said to her, "You are very ill; be careful what you say; you are not likely to recover; I think you are dying"—she said, "I think so too"—I am certain that she believed she was dying—she had been told on the 13th by the medical man, in my presence, that he did not think she could possibly recover—that was this same day, just previous to her making the statement—I have not the least doubt that she believed she was dying—she told me that, a fortnight before her mother threw her down stairs, she had hit her over the head with the leg of a table, and she had not been well since; not since the two; the blow and the throwing down stairs—onthe 19th she repeated precisely the same statement to me, and I cautioned her as I had previously done—she continued gradually to get worse, till the night of the 20th, when she died—Mr. King was not present on either of these occasions—his assistant was—the statement was not taken down.</p>

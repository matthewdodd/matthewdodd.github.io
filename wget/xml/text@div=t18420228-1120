                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at Cookfield, in Sussex. On the evening of the 28th of February, I was in Tooley-street—I bid eighteen sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, three half-crowns, sixteen shil<lb></lb>lings, and five sixpences—I met the prisoner, and went with her to a house in Vine-yard—I gave her two half-crowns—we had some gin—I went to bed—I was sober then and my money was in my trowser's-pocket, which I put under my pillow—I awoke about one o'clock (the prisoner did not come into bed)—I saw my trowsers at the foot of the bed—the prisoner was then sitting on the side of the bed—she went down stairs—I examined my trowsers and missed my money—I gave an alarm, and she was taken by the policeman and searched—he told her if she had got it, she had better give it up instead of being searched—she said she had not got it at all—eight sovereigns were taken from her bosom, wrapped up in a bit of rag, and thirteen shillings and sixpence—another officer found four sovereigns on her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Lompech, of Fore-street, City. The prisoner was in our service up to 26th March—she then left of her own accord—five days after that, I missed four sovereigns, a cornelian snap, a watch-guard, and one yard of black silk from my bed-room—the money was in a piece of paper in a trunk, and the other things in a bonnet-box—the trunk was locked, and the key was in the pocket of a dress that hung up in the same room—when I missed the things the key was still in the same place—I communicated with Sergeant Teakle, and on 3rd April the prisoner was taken into custody—I went to the station, and found the watch-guard and some silk.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, H</hi> 8). On 3rd April I went to a house in Fleet-street-hill, Bethnal-green, and found the prisoner there—I told her her mistress suspected her, and I was come to search her box—she opened the box, and began throwing out the things in a great hurry—she had something in her left hand—I caught hold of it, and she dropped a piece of paper con<lb></lb>taining two sovereigns and some silver—she said, "For God's sake, don't say anything about it"—I examined the box, and found this silk and this watch-guard (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was a young man in the room—on the way to the station, she begged of me a great many times to keep the money, and say nothing about it.</p>

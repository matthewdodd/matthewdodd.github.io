             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 13th of December, the prisoner at the bar was a fellow <rs id="t17940115-22-deflabel116" type="occupation">servant</rs>

I live at Mr. Dean's, the corner of King-street, the Castle, he had lived with us about three weeks before the 13th of December, about seven o'clock he had to go to Mr. Marriott's for the pots, he had to go several times before there. My mistress keeps a public house; a little after ten o'clock my work being done I asked him to let me pass him to sit down, which is a place we always fit in ourselves, he went to move on to let me pass him to sit down, and in his left hand breeches pocket there was a silver spoon, the bowl was down in his pocket, and the handle was out so that I could take hold of it, I asked him what he had got there? he made me no answer, I took the silver spoon directly, and told my mistress it was a spoon that Thomas had got, my mistress told me it must belong to Mr. Marriott, and to go with it there, and ask them whether it belonged to them or not; I did so, the prisoner went with me, and I asked Mrs. Marriott whether it was her property? and she said it was her property, and she said it was one of her best spoons and Mr. Newman was sent for and given charge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You and this man lived fellow servants together? - Three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not agree very well I believe? - We never had any fallings out as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he accuse you of drinking rather a drop too much sometimes? - No, he did not, I do not believe he was sober at that time, he told me that he took it out of one of Mr. Marriott's quart pots, with a design to bring it back, so he told my Lord at the Mansion House.</p>
               <p>Q. He knew perfectly well you was going to Mr. Marriott's, he went with you readily? - He did.</p>

               <p>Q. There was no constable? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a poor foolish, idle, drunken fellow, is not he? - I cannot say about his idleness, he was very short at our house.</p>
               <p>Q. He is rather silly, is not he? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150059"></xptr>Q. He fetched away his pots late that evening? - About seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. He never attempted to go away at all? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Marriott. Is that your spoon? - Yes, my name is on the back of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were your spoons usually placed? - They are usually carried to a house maid, who stands to receive them, and bring them into the house, into a kitchen, there they are washed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you keep your porter pots? - The porter pots stand in different situations in the house, in general by the bar, in order that we may observe who comes to take them, but sometimes they may be left in different parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they find their way to the kitchen, where these spoons are washed? - There is not a doubt but they may do so, the rule is that they are not to come there, though they might come there, but we generally have them near the bar, that they may not have any pretence of going to any other part of the house to seek for the pots; I frequently find them in different parts of the house for pots, and I ask them what they do there? they say they come for pots, I tell them they have no business to come there, if they want pots to speak for them.</p>
               <p>- NEWMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable, the young man was delivered to me and the spoon; I took him before the Lord Mayor and I have had the spoon in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Marriott. You don't know the particular servant in your house who had the care of that particular spoon? - I don't know indeed, that day I might have a hundred and fifty spoons about the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the negligence of a servant might leave it where the pot boy might find it, none of your servants who had the care of the plate are here? - No.</p>
               <p>

            Therefore we cannot tell how they might dispose of them? has not this boy been instrumental in returning to you a piece of plate that was lost at one time? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was in a quart pot, I did not see it till I brought it home, and I put it into my pocket till such time as I had leisure to take it home, which I put in my pocket, and sat down, I did not think of it immediately, the maid took it out of my pocket, I have some witnesses with respect to my character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

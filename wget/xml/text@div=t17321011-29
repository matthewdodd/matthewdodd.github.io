            . My House was broke open on Wednesday the 27th of September, between the Hours of 12 and 4 in the Morning. The Entrance was made at a Back Cellar-window, which I left fast at Night, but found the Grate wrench'd open in the Morning. This Window leads into the Kitchen, from whence my Goods were taken. I recollected, as well as I could, what Particulars were lost, drew up an Advertisement, and went directly to Goldsmith's Hall, and got a sufficient Number of them printed and dispersed about the Town, by 10 a Clock the same Morning.</p>
               <p>Court. What Goods did you lose?</p>
               <p>Mr. Carey. Here is one of the Advertisements with the Particulars in it.*</p>
               <p>* On Wednesday, the 27th of this Inst. September, 1732. Mr. Carey's House in Dorrington-street, Cold-Bath Fields, near Sir John Oldcastle's, was broke open this Morning, and there was stolen from thence one Silver Spoon, with an Arm and Sword for the Crest, the Mouth a little worn. One Pair of large Brass Candlesticks in a Kind of Square or Diamond Cut. One Pair of small ones, with square Bottoms. One large odd one, with round Knobs. One Copper Coffee-Pot. One large Tea-Kettle, both clean scower'd. Two Pewter Dishes, one a little melted on the Side. One Pewter Pint Pot. One Dozen of Pewter Plates, all marked either with HCE or the Arm and Sword aforesaid. One Soop Plate a little melted on the Side. One Water Plate, with a Cover to it. Four Shifes, one mark'd at the Breast with M.C. Four white Aprons, and three colour'd ones. One Pair of Sheets, one Flaxen, the other Irish Cloth mildew'd at one End. If offer'd to be pawn'd or sold, you are desired to stop them and the Party, and give Notice as above, and you shall have three Guineas Reward. P.S. They took likewise one Mourning Sword, one Lacquer'd Sword, one Boy's Hat; a salted Ham, quite white, and just hung up to dry; also a small Leg in pickle. A Bermudas Hat lin'd with red Silk, a narrow Brim, and Hat-band curiously wrought with Bugles and Silk. A small Pestle and Mortar. A Copper-pot, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Court. You may refresh your Memory by looking on it, but it is not to be read in Evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carrey. I lost a Silver Spoon, 5 Pair of Brass Candlesticks, a Copper Coffee-pot, a Tea-Kettle, 2 Pewter Dishes, 14 Plates, one of them was a Water plate, 4 Shifts, 7 Aprons, a Pait of Sheets, 2 Swords, a Boy's Hat, a falted Ham, a Leg of Pork in Pickle, a Bermudas Hat, a Pestle and Mortar, a Copper-pot, and some other Things; and I offer'd 3 Guineas Reward for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173210110014"></xptr> stopping them.

We put the Pewter and Brass in a Bag, and I took the Box, and carried it to Dick's House. In the Morning he comes to my Wife as she was a-bed, and said, Here Amy, here's a Silver Spoon for you. But she was afraid to meddle with it. Well, says he, then my Wife shall have it. But both of them neglecting to dispose of it, I got up on Friday Morning, and swore if my Wife would not go and sell it, I would break her Neck, and so I pull'd her out of bed, and made her carry it to the Goldsmith's, and there she was stopt.</p>

               <p>John. We had put the Things without Side the House before I went up Stairs, so that he had no occasion to go in a doors the last Time. His Wife knew how we came by the Goods, and that made her afraid to sell the Spoon; and therefore, as I said, I was forced to make my Wife go out with it.</p>

            . I am one of the clerks of the Excise-office; on the 24th of this instant, it was a holiday, but there was some business to be attended to in that part of the office in which I am; I was going away, having done my business, I met the prisoner in the passage; I thought he could have no business there; he turned out immediately upon my coming, and went out at the gate; I asked the porters of the office if they had ordered any thing to be taken away by any body; they said, no; I told them to lock the door: the next day, about two o'clock, I saw the man standing at the office gate, made me suspect he came for no good; I stood at the top of our stairs, where I could see him come into the passage; I saw him take this parcel of paper from some others, and run away; I pursued him into the street; I had a stick in my hand, I hit him two or three taps, then he stopped; he seemed extremely stupid, and said he did not know that he had been there (produced and deposed to;) the books are what our country-offices keep an account in; they are sent up to us, and after they have been examined they are sold as old stores.</p>

               <p>I know nothing at all of it; I had a room in the Butcher-row, my stall is in Bell-yard; a gentleman desired me to carry a bundle for him, he said he would come again presently; I took up the bundle at Temple-Bar, Mr. Hall, ran after me, and struck me down with a stick.</p>

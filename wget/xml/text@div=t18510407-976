                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker, of King-street, St. James's-square. On 21st Jan., near dusk, the prisoner Charles came and asked permission to leave an umbrella, which he did—in the course of an hour the two prisoners came, with another person, who I cannot swear to—it was not the father—Arthur said he wanted a pair of dress boots, to go to a ball in Kent—I showed him a pair—he tried them on, and asked the price—I told him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he ordered them to be packed up—I packed them up, and laid them on the cutting-board—they all three left—the prisoners came back—Charles asked me if there was anybody to mind the horse—my son went out to do so, and then Arthur came in and asked if I had another pair of boots to fit him—he tried on another pair—they did not fit him, but he said he would have them, which made me suspicious—then I measured him for another pair—Charles then took his boots off, and asked me to measure him; to do which I had to turn my back upon Arthur, and when I turned round again I missed him and the pair of boots—Charles said nothing, but we both went to the door, and Arthur and the dog-cart were both gone—Charles said, "Why, he is gone"—I said, "Yes"—I asked him the name of the young man who had gone—he said, "Lionel Douglas"—he called himself Arthur, and said they were brothers—he said he would have a bottle of polish and a brush—I said, "Being brothers, you must give me the address"—he gave it, "No. 6, Belgrave-place"—I took the boots, but could only find a Douglas at Belgrave-terrace—I did not leave the boots—I have never seen the other boots since—they have not been paid for.</p>

                  </hi>. I recollect the prisoners coming to my father's shop the second time—Charles asked me to pack up the boots—I did so, and placed them on the cutting-board—they came a third time, and asked if there was any one to hold the horse—I said I would—when I had held it three or four minutes, Arthur came out, and brought a paper parcel, threw it under the seat, and drove away.</p>

            . In the week after the last sessions, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment out of my apartment, but I left no one in the apartment except the prisoner, whom I had taken in out of charity; I was absent but about an hour, during which time the things were taken away; I found part of them upon the prisoner's back the same night; the apron, pettycoat, cardinal, and hat; she had lived with me about a week; I knew her from her birth.</p>

I found she was exceedingly in liquor; these two men did not know what to do with her; she said, O Mrs. Kettle, you know me; I did not know her immediately; soon after she said her name was Rogers, and she lived with Mrs. Johnson, then I knew her; she had the cardinal, hat, cap, and riband on; I desired the prisoner to take these things back to Mrs. Johnson to deliver them up to her; she was taken home by other people.</p>

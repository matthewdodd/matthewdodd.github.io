               <p>I am one of the patroles; on going down the road, on Friday the 30th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I was going through Kensington town, about the middle of the town, I passed the prisoner, near six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner was in company with another man, that is evidence against him, his name is Mac Laughton, Mac Laughton was first and he had the bundle of lead; I says to my partner, stop that fellow he has got something very heavy, and the prisoner at the bar stepped immediately from the path way into the road, to make his escape; it was very dark, we took them both, and took them into the public house. Swain was the man with me, and he took the load from Mac Laughton's back; I asked him where he got that lead. The lead was brought up to Bow-street, and the plumber looked at it the Wednesday following; Swain kept it in the mean time. I made enquiry and found that there was some lead lost in these buildings. I took them both up and Mac Laughton was admitted an evidence on Wednesday.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patroles; I and Hughes met the prisoner and Mac Laughton; Hughes told me to mind Mac Laughton, because he had something heavy on his shoulder; I went to him and took it off his shoulder, and took him into the public house close by, and examined what was in it, I found it was lead, it was directly brought up to Bow-street office, and on Wednesday Mr. Fisher the plumber came and looked at it, and brought some more with it that matched very well in quality, but the pieces did not match; the lead was locked up at the Brown bear; I got it back again; I am sure it is the same.

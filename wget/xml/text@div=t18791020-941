                  </hi>.I am a widow living at 35, Rutland Gate—the prisoner was in my employment as butler—he came into my employ<lb></lb>ment in October, 1873—he is a married man—I had given him warning previous to this, but retained him in my service—he lived in the house, and slept in the butler's pantry—in February last, in consequence of certain matters that came to my knowledge, I went over my plate—I read over the articles from a book, and the prisoner checked them, and from what he said I believed that it was all right—I again gave him notice, and he was to leave on 11th October—on the night of the 10th we went to bed as usual, at 10 o'clock—my family consisted of myself, three daughters, and a niece, and there were four maid servants, and the prisoner—the servants waited tip for the prisoner—the dining-room is on the ground floor, the drawing-room over that, and over that my bedroom in front—between 12 and 1 o'clock on the morning of the 11th I heard my daughters moving over head, and got up and opened ray door, and was overpowered with smoke, which was coming quickly up the staircase—with great difficulty I managed to get downstairs—I could only get down by feeling for the bannisters—the smoke felt very stifling—I and my daughters went down into the street in our nightdresses—we were taken in at no. 33, a neighbour's house—directly after the fire I went through the plate, and compared it with the list that was supposed to be correct in February; it is incorrect now—I have missed a quantity of plate, worth from 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have since seen a portion of it produced by the pawnbrokers, and identified it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not notice any wooden rails in the kitchen to hang dish covers on—there were ulsters and servants' things hanging on the inside of the kitchen door, which were not scorched—the outer part of the kitchen door was scorched—there were two squares of the fanlight broken; I don't know whether that was by the heat; I have no doubt it was—there were some cupboards under the stairs, these doors were scorched, the paint was blistered—that did not show the passage of fire through the passage—I did not go upstairs—there are two windows in the back kitchen—I could not say whether they were cracked by the fire; I have no doubt the glass was cracked, I can't say, I did not look to see—there was a cupboard in the kitchen, the upper part of that door was scorched, it was open, the inside was not scorched, only the outer part.</p>

It was the heat from the fire in the passage that seemed to have scorched the outer part of the door—the fire in the wood closet was the most extensive, it was that hot that we could not stand in front of it—the closet was nearly burnt down—the passage is 4 or 5 feet wide—both the cupboard doors opposite the pantry were blistered; the one opposite the wood closet more than the other—the larder door was scorched and blistered—the wood-closet door was midway between the pantry door and the kitchen door—there was no trace of burning between the kitchen door and the wood closet—there was nothing on the outside of the drawer in the kitchen to indicate that the fire had touched it, all the fire was inside; it consisted of sewing materials or servants' work, pieces of dresses, and one thing and another—there was no fire in the pantry except in the cupboard—the pantry door was not even blistered—it was open when I arrived.</p>

               <p>found the four fires as described by the last witness—I saw the prisoner there sitting on his bed in the pantry, undressed, with his trousers and shirt on—I asked him how he accounted for the fire in the cupboard in his pantry—he said "The flames came through the door and set light to the cupboard"—I pointed out to him that it was impossible, as there was no trace of fire or flames coming through; there was none—the inside of the cupboard was charred and burnt by the flames coming out through the crevices over the door, burning upwards—the door was closed—he made no reply to my remark—he was taken into custody—on the way to the station he said "I was lying in bed asleep and was awoke by the breaking of glass and the smell of smoke; I got out of bed, wrapped a blanket about me, and came upstairs and became insensible, and then came down"—I found a pocket-knife and key upon him—he was subsequently charged with stealing the plate.</p>

I am an officer of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade stationed at Knightsbridge—on 11th October I was called to Montpelier Row—I found a house on fire—I was unable to gain admission that way—I went round to the front of the house—on arriving there with two constables I rang two or three bells alongside No. 35, and after some few minutes the door was opened—I saw the prisoner standing at the door with it open—I said "Have you a fire here?"—he said "We have got something here"—the evidence given by the other witness as to the fire in four different places is quite correct.</p>

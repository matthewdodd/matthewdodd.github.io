The prisoner came on Saturday, 23rd Feb., with a man named Saunders—he stopped at my counter about a minute—(I had seen Saunders the night previous)—we were very busy, and my waiter asked them to walk up-staire—they did so, and dined—they were up-stairs half or three-quarters of an hour—when they came down they asked if they could speak to me—I told them I could not then, I would in half-an-hour; and I asked them to come back—they said, "No," they would meet me at some neighbouring house—I said, "Next door," which is the Green Dragon—I met them there in half-an-hour—it was then about two o'clock in the day—the prisoner said he had been recommended to me by Saunders, and he had a nephew in the country who was possessed of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he was anxious to get him into business, and he had authorised Saunders to look out for nearly two months, and he knowing my house had recommended him to take it—he said his nephew was about to be married—he asked what I wanted for the house, and what furniture was in it, and I told him—he asked all the particulars that a person could ask if he wanted to take the house—he asked if my servants would stop—I said I did not know; I would ask them—I told him he had better let his nephew see it—he said, "It lies with me entirely," and he said to Saunders, "We must write' to my nephew this afternoon, to that</p>

               <p>we shall get him up on Monday morning from Dover"—on Monday, the 25th, we met at the Albion, Blackfriars-road—I got there at four—in half an hour Saunders came—I was drinking a glass of cold sherry and water—in five or ten minutes I saw the prisoner looking in at the window—he came in and said to Saunders, "The moment I sent you out with that letter my niece came in; she came by the train, and I expect my nephew by the seven o'clock train this evening instead of to-morrow"—Saunders had produced a letter to me the moment before the prisoner came; I saw the writing on it—the prisoner then pretended he had dropped his spectacles, and went out for seven or eight minutes—I then said it was no use to wait there any longer, and the meeting was appointed at the same house at seven in the evening—I went there at seven, and found the prisoner—Saunders came in afterwards, and one other, and then a young man, who appeared to be very sober, with a small paper parcel, and the moment after a man who appeared very drunk—the drunken man began to talk—he said he had lost his lady, who had taken something like 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him, but he did not care for that; if he could meet her again he would give her 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—he pulled out a quantity of sovereigns, and said he had been making a bet with a party about throwing a heavy weight, and challenged Saunders—I told him to take no notice of him; we had met there on very different business; and as to throwing weights, I knew nothing about it—Saunders said he had thrown a heavy weight, and he thought he could do it with him, and he should like to try him—the prisoner then said he would go to the Surrey Theatre, and see his wife, who was to meet him there, and see whether his nephew had come up from Dover or no—the young man and the drunken man then left—the prisoner, and Saunders, and me, and the other man, left immediately after to go to the Surrey Theatre—the prisoner proposed going to a beer-shop in Webber-row—when we got there I found the drunken man that I had previously seen, and the other man was leaning over the counter—when we got in they began to talk about their bets, and about throwing heavy weights again—they proposed going to the skittle-ground—eight or ten persons came in from the skittle-ground, and the landlord said, "I have cleared the ground for you to go in"—they all went there, and they said there was nothing heavy enough to throw, but Saunders proposed to play the drunken man at skittles, which he did, and won many pounds of him, and Saunders said to me, "You may as well have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of this fellow as us; he has been and sold two cows, and you may as well have something"—he nudged me two or three times to put something down, but I would not do it—I had first thought that man was drunk, but afterwards that he was only pretending—I declined having any<lb></lb>thing to do with them—they then began to kick up a dispute about their bets, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> up against me several times—I cannot say that the prisoner <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> up against me, but he was near those who did—there were only five in the ground—they served me that way two or three times, and I got in amongst them—I then saw a purse in Saunders's hand—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my purse—I said, "I have lost my purse out of my pocket"—I had known it was safe perhaps half an hour before—it had con<lb></lb>tained 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns and half-sovereigns, and a gold Spanish piece—I said, "Why that is my purse," in the company of all of them; and a man got before me, and said, "Don't say that; don't make a noise about it; I shall lose my situation if I am known to be in anything of this"—that was one of the men that met us at the Albion, and accompanied us to the beer-shop—he kept me back, and there was a scuffle with two or three of them on the other side of the frame—the man who appeared so very much intoxicated</p>

               <p>took up his coat and went away in his shirt-sleeves—the prisoner and the others went as quickly as possible, leaving me and the man who was speaking to me—he said he knew Saunders, and if I would go with him he would take me to a place where he could find him—when the prisoner and the others went out, I wanted to go past to go after them, but the man would not let me—he said he held a responsible situation, and he would not have it known for the world—in two or three minutes I went out with this man, and he took me to two public-houses—I did not see the prisoner after I got out—I have not seen the last man, who told me he was in a responsible situation, since—this is my purse; I found it behind the boards in the skittle-ground, on the Friday morning following, I think—I had picked up the ring of it on the Monday evening—I know this piece of paper; it was written by the prisoner at the Green Dragon, next door to me—I put it in my purse, but I did not know it was there till the purse was produced—I had not drank anything with the prisoner and the other men; they requested me several times; I refused it—I had not played at skittles or betted—I took my purse out at the Albion—I thought I had some silver in it, and I had not—I put it into my pocket again, and felt in my waistcoat-pocket, and found I had two or three loose shillings—the purse was in my right-hand trowsers-pocket—I gave it and the ring to Goff.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has there not been a similar transaction to this when Mr. Raby, a broker in Kent-street, was robbed in your skittle-ground of 10<hi rend="italic">l? A.</hi> I heard of it—I do not know whether his name was Raby—I was never charged with having anything to do with it—I was never charged respecting the robbery of Mr. Sexton, who was robbed of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my house—I know there is such a man as Mr. Sexton, but I do not recollect his coming to my place—if he was robbed it was unknown to me—when Alldis and Goff came next morning, I asked him if there was anything wrong—he said, "Yes, I think there is something wrong"—I asked him what was the matter—he said, "I have been robbed of my purse"—Goff was not present; he was gone, and his friend, to play a game at skittles—I said to Alldis, "How came you to lose your purse?"—he said, "The last pot of ale you brought was drugged; I was the only person that drank of it, and the rest was <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> into the next ground"—I do not think Goff was present when he said this; he was gone through to have a game at skittles—now I come to recollect, I think the policeman was present when he said he had been drugged in the ground—the policeman said, "I want to have a game at skittles"—I said, "You can go if you like"—they went, and I thought they had been there long enough—I went in, and they called for a pint of ale, and then he cane and said he had found a purse.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. O'BRIEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He was out about a quarter of an hour, and came back with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I said, "What is the matter?"—he said, "Never mind; no consequence; nothing particular," and he went away—the next time he came with the policeman, and then he said he had lost his purse and he was drugged, and the rest of the ale was <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> over into the next ground.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character).</p>

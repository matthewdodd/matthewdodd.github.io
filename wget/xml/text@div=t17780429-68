On the 20th of April the prisoner came to our shop, and desired to look at some Manchester moreens, as we sometimes call them. I showed her about a dozen pieces; she described a pattern which I had not got. I suspected her by her motions; I watched her, and saw her take a piece. She bid me much less for a piece than it cost me, She left my shop; I followed her into the piazzas; she had this piece in her hand, (producing it); she was looking at it; it is my property.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>It is true I went to this man's shop. About five or six months ago I bought a piece of Manchester, which was of a doe colour, striped with pink. I had this in my hand, and a tambour worked waistcoat, and a new pair of shoes; when I went into his shop I meant to change that, and give the gentleman 5 s. or 6 s. in lieu. I said I wanted a pink stripe; another gentleman brought a number of pieces, and put them on the counter, and said, will they do? I said, no; I was set to a pattern, and wanted doe colour, striped with silk; I said I bought one of you; this gentleman said, I remember you did. The gentleman pushed them aside to the bottom of the compter, and asked me to turn round and look at some hanging loose upon chairs; I said it was needless, as they had not the pattern I wanted. I had in my hand a pair of shoes and a half piece of a tambour waistcoat. I went out of the shop; the gentleman came after me, and charged a constable with me. I went into his shop again; I laid this piece out of my hand, and told him it was my property. I went on my knees, and begged he would send for my friends; he said no, he had been often robbed, and would make me pay for all.</p>

             sworn. - On the 8th of February, in the evening, I went into the White-hart public-house, <placeName id="t18050220-55-crimeloc332">Leman-street, Goodman's-fields</placeName>

               <p>Q. Where did you find them afterwards? - A. In Red-lion-street, about twenty minutes after I had lost them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner in the public-house? - A. Yes, when I first came in; she came in with a pie-man, whom she called her husband, she was in the house about an hour, and I staid in there an hour and a half; when I came out of the public-house, I saw her in Red-lion-street, she was at a stand, and two watchmen with her; I saw the candlesticks in her apron, and I marked them by desire of the watchmen.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am a constable: I was at the watch-house at the time when the prisoner was brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. When she came into the watch-house did you search her? - A. Yes; I found these six iron candlesticks in paper, and these seven shirts in her lap.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give any account of them? - A. The woman was very drunk, I believe she did not know what she was doing. (The candlesticks produced, and identified by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the woman? - A. No; I have heard she follows selling clothes in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I knew nothing of the candlesticks no more than of my dying-day; I really did not know that I had them.</p>

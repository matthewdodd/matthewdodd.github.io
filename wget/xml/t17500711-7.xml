            . On the 14th of June, just as Hackney church clock struck five in the morning, I was between Dalston and Hackney; Tyler came up first and bid me stand, I told him I had no money; he put his hand in my pocket and took out five shillings and two keys; they divided the money before my face and gave me back my keys and six pence to drink their healths; the other prisoner stood by; they said they had fire-arms, and that if I offered to make any resistance they would blow my brains out. Tyler had a hanger in his hand with a brass-handle. He then had a white frock on. Cook was in a sailor's habit, and a green apron on.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you alone ?</p>
               <p>Darnell. Yes, my lord, I was; I was going to a farm which I occupy. They were taken the Monday following. I was sent for to Hackney-cage to see them. They were had before the Justice, and examined about stealing a shirt. After his worship had done, I said to him, this Tyler is the very man who robbed me; and he cried terribly.</p>

            . I am constable. The prisoner (Tyler ) cried much, and denied every thing, saying, he should be hanged wrongfully.</p>

               <p>Cook's Defence. I was coming from Hackney, and a woman charged me with stealing a shirt. This old man came and shook hands with us, and said I know nothing of you; and after that he swore wrongfully as the child unborn.</p>

On the 4th of January, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was in the parlour, behind the shop, and saw two men at the door; I looked again, and saw one of them just taking hold of the nob of the till, be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120029"></xptr>hind the counter; I ran into the shop - he pulled the till out, and ran out with it. I followed, and kept him in sight for fifty yards, when he put it down. I called Stop thief! took it up, and pursued no further; it contained 8l. 4s. 6d. in silver. The shop was lighted with gas, and I was not above three feet from him; he wore a black shiney cap, with fur upon it. I swear the prisoner is the man - I saw him through the glass door.</p>
               <p>Q. You could only have seen him for a minute? A. I saw his face in the shop; a gentleman brought him back, and I was sure of him.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Fitzroy-market. I heard a cry of Stop thief! ran towards the place it proceeded from, and stopped the prisoner running through an archway of the market; he said, "Is it me? is it me?" and seemed flurried.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I heard an alarm, and ran up to see what was the matter; a butcher said, "You are the person" - I said, "Is it me?" The girl said the man was dressed in blue, but my dress was brown.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter's foreman, 8, Francis-terrace, Barking-road—on 25th December, my family consisted of my wife, a boy, two girls, and a female servant; up to that time we had been living very comfortably together—I did not know the prisoner at all up to that time—we were living in the house by ourselves—the house was furnished—I went out on the morning of 26th to my work and returned at 1 o'clock, and left again—I did not dine at home—when I left at that time, everything was in the same condition as it generally was; nothing at all to excite my suspicion—on my return in the evening, I met my servant, and in conse<lb></lb>quence of what she said to me, I went on to my house, and found that my wife had gone; the curtains in the sitting-room had been taken down from the window, and the toilet-covers were taken—I went up stairs, and found the drawers had been opened; all the wearing apparel, bed-clothes,</p>

               <p>clothes, and everything, had been taken away—I went to my box, unlocked it with my key, and there was nothing in it, except the empty cash-box—40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes and silver, and a bank-book representing 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the savings<lb></lb>bank at Limehouse, had been in that cash-box—I also missed three watches, three chains, and two rings; my clothes were also gone; I had nothing left, only what I stood upright in—the children's beds were entirely stripped; they had nothing except a bundle of rags; the pillow-cases were taken off—the drawers I spoke of had contained my wife's wearing apparel, and also linen, sheets, blankets, table-cloths, and towels; the cups and saucers, plates and dishes, knives and forks, were all taken away—the furniture was left, and my children were left; they took away the baby-linen—my youngest child is two years and a half old, and the eldest nine years old—I com<lb></lb>municated this to the police, and after getting some information, I went off to Ireland—I arrived there on 31st December—I found my wife on that day at some lodgings in Newry—she was occupying two rooms, a sitting-room and a bedroom—the bedroom was in front—the things were hanging up in the other room—I found one coat of mine hanging up, and the other things were all packed away in boxes in the bedroom—I took a policeman there first—I found my wife in the bedroom where the things were—the boxes were in the bedroom, and the other things were hanging round the other room—she was taking tea—the things were taken charge of by the police, and my wife was taken to the station—I found Evans' address on the black box—the prisoner was then sent for from the barracks—I saw him brought into the station, and I saw my gold-plated watch and chain in the policeman's hands—the prisoner was searched there, and nineteen sovereigns and a purse taken from him—I did not swear to the purse; my wife had a purse similar to that—the prisoner was taken into custody; he was remanded for eight days, and ultimately sent over here—nothing was said by the prisoner at that time in my presence—property and money to the value of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd was taken away, besides the money in the savings-bank—I had seen the watch and chain which were taken from the prisoner safe on the 24th, early in the morning; they were then in the box where my cash<lb></lb>box was—I also saw my money safe at that time, because I took out a five<lb></lb>pound note, and made my wife a present of it.</p>

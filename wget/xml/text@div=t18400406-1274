                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Harrow-road, Padding<lb></lb>ton. On the 24th of March a breast of mutton was stolen from me, about half-past twelve o'clock in the day—I was informed of it by a neighbour—I went out, and saw some boys—I followed them—I then went to the pri<lb></lb>soners' room with Ridley, and asked if they had not got a boy there concealed with some meat—they said they had not—I said I was convinced that they had—they said if he was there he must be in the area—I went, and there was no one there—I looked about the room, and found the boy Young in the turn-up bedstead and this meat—John Monteith was sitting by the fire smoking his pipe, and did not say any thing.</p>

On the night of the 19th of July, we shut up the house and went to bed, about twelve o'clock - my husband was out of town. I fastened the door myself, and soon after twelve o'clock, I heard a noise of doors opening, and footsteps about the house, I sat up in my bed, and the noise continued for nearly two hours. I heard the watchman go half-past three o'clock, and heard the bar taken off the stair-case window, I got up in about ten minutes, and opened my bed-room door, and saw a man standing at the back door - it was then light; he endeavoured to escape and got into the area - I spoke to him. He called me very bad names, and said his name was James, when I asked him - he was about five yards from me - it was the prisoner, I am certain - he got out of the area. I heard the parlour window open, and called Watch! he got into the street, and in five or ten minutes, the watchman brought him back with another lad. I found all my tea-spoons strewed about a chair which I had left in a cupboard, my work-box was broken open, and a receipt taken out. I lost three silver spoons from the cupboard; a thimble and pen-knife from a small box near the kitchen drawers. I am sure the silver spoons were in the cupboard the night before - I put them there. All the drawers were opened in the kitchen, and the things strewed about; the fan-light of the area was broken - he must have got through there. When he was brought back he was searched, and my pen-knife and some receipts found on him, and a small lion's head, which an officer, who lodged with me, had given to my little boy - the spoons were not found.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was standing near my box, in Poland-street - Smith alarmed me. I saw the prisoner come out of Poland-mews, I went after him, and took him in Lambridge-street, and brought him back to the prosecutrix - she said she could swear he was the man; a pen-knife, silver thimble, and a lion's head were found on him.</p>

               <p>MRS. BROADFOOT. They are mine, the receipt is in my husband's writing - they were safe in the box the night before. I lost three spoons which are not found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The knife is mine. I was up, looking at the fire-works till half-past two o'clock. I saw a young woman home to Middlesex Hospital, and found these things on the head of some steps - I could have got rid of them if I had knewn they were stolen.</p>
               <p>MRS. BROADFOOT re-examined. The fanlight is in the middle of the area - they got through that, and the door of the house was forced open which I had fastened the night before.</p>

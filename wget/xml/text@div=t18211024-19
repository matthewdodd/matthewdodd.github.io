About the 6th of September in the morning, I missed a 5 l., note, and afterwards missed a gold neck-chain ten feet and four inches long, two gold ear-rings, two pair of white silk stockings, a silver vinegaret, marked E. A. B. a sovereign, a diamond ring, two common gold rings, and some small gold buttons - I went to Bow-street, Nicholls the officer, and I went to the prisoner's father the next morning, and found some brandy and gin, we searched every part of his house, but found nothing else; I said, he had better confess, and in consequence of what he said, I went to a pawnbroker's in Crawford-street, and found one of the ear-rings; I then went to Rundell and Bridge's, and in consequence of what I heard there, I went to Furber's, in Jewin-street. The prisoner's father came to my house, and gave me 3 l. 17 s., or 18 s., in a purse, in which were three of the gold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240012"></xptr>buttons, and said, in the prisoner's presence, that he found them in a hole, under the floor, and it was with great difficulty he could reach them, they were put down so far - I saw some more of the gold buttons, (I think six) found on a boy. The vinegaret was brought to my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. AIKEN. Q. After his father brought you the things, what did you say to the prisoner - A. I said if he would tell me what he had done with the property, I would not prosecute him. I did not care whether it was recovered or not, as I supposed it to be his first offence. I never told him to go down on his knees, and beg my pardon - I allowed him to go home to his father's after the constable had been to my house, I had not given him in charge; if he had accounted for the property I should not have proceeded.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not agree that if the father made up the difference, you would allow him a little time - A. No; the father asked me, I refused. The prisoner said one Benjamin was concerned in it, but he denied it.</p>

            . I am a refiner, and live in Jewin-street. I find an entry in my books (looking at it), that on the 1st of September, I bought thirteen penny weights, sixteen grains of gold, for 37 s. 6 d., of a person named Hill, I believe it was part of a twisted gold chain, he brought a card to me, it was a young man, but I cannot speak to his person - I was applied to about a week afterwards, it was then melted. I gave him quite the full value - I I bought one ounce and a half penny weight of silver, of him also, for 4 s. 11 d., I think that was part of a spoon, he had a basket with him - I thought he came from some jeweller.</p>

            . I am a salesman, and live in Crawford-street. I deal in wearing apparel - I am not acquainted with the prisoner, but know his person; he brought me a gold chain on the 27th of August, about a yard long, and wanted to sell it to me, he said, he found it, I said I could buy nothing of the kind, of a little boy like him - it was a gold twisted wire chain; he had bought a pair of breeches of me a week before, and that was the way I knew him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you known him - A. He came to me on the 19th of August, I had seen him pass my door very often before, but had not spoken to him till he came about the breeches; he gave me 6 s. for them; he took them home to his father's. I did not buy the chain of him, I only dealt once with him, and that was for the breeches - I never bought any thing of him; I make it a rule never to buy of boys. I never spoke to him till he bought the breeches. I am not under recognizance to answer any charge. I have no doubt of his being the boy.</p>
               <p>G. HOWELL re-examined. I saw the vinegaret on the 27th of August, it was brought, I think, on the 8th of August; it was pawned once, taken out, and pawned again - the prisoner's brother brought it one of the times; I do not know which, it was the same brother that brought the ear ring.</p>

            . I work at a muffin baker's, and live in Homer-street, with my father, who is a porter. I knew the prisoner for about a fortnight before this took place; my first acquaintance was by meeting him in Crawford-street. He asked me if I would go with him, I went with him to Park-street (his father lived in a court opposite our house); I met him again in Crawford-street, two or three days after, and he gave me a pair of white silk stockings - I sold them to a Jew, in the street, for 2 s. 6 d. Before this I took them to Neat's, the pawnbroker's, in Duke-street, to pawn, but he would not take them in - he told me to send my mother; I had told him my mother sent me. I met him again three or four days after, standing by Mr. Jenkins's, the pawnbroker's shop, in Crawford-street. There was something in the window like a star - it was like the ear-ring produced. I said it was a funny thing - he said he had sold it. I did not ask him where he got it till just as he was going away and then he would not tell me. He had a gold chain in his hand on that day, and shewed it to me, it was a twisted chain (Mr. Bennett here produced part of the chain, which was taken off before it was stolen), it was just like this, he had it rolled up in his hand, I could not tell the length, he said, he had given half of it to his father, because his brother told his father, that he had it, and his father was going to beat him, and he gave him half of it not to beat him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How came you to tell Neat a different story about the stockings, to what you say to day - A. I said I had them from my mother, which was not true. I swear I had them from the prisoner - the chain was never in my hand, I was not long looking at it, he stood close to me, I saw the piece which was produced, at the office, four or five weeks after I saw the prisoner with the chain; he told me it was a twisted chain. I called it a twisted chain at the office.</p>
               <p>MR. FURBER. I think the chain resembled this, and from the price I gave for it, it must have been of this quality. I bought it as a single chain; ten feet and a half of it would be worth much more than 37 s. I did not buy above two feet.</p>

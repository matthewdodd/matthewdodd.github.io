On 2nd Feb. I went there, on Mr. Varden's business, about half past 10 o'clock—I had a great coat on, and my gloves were in the pocket of it—I took it off and hung it up in the gallery near Mr. Varden's box—I went to the same place about half past 12 and it was gone—my coat and gloves have been since shown to me by the officer Haydon, about a fortnight back—my coat was woith 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

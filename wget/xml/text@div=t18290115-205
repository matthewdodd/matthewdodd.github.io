            . I live in Duke-street, Spitalfields -I am a watchman of St. Bride's parish; Mr. Charles Plumley's house is on <placeName id="t18290115-205-crimeloc1102">Ludgate-hill, in the parish of St. Bride</placeName>

On the 15th of January, about a quarter to eight o'clock at night, I was coming down Ludgate-hill, and saw the prisoner standing against Mr. Plumley's shopwindow - I did not know his person before; I am quite sure he is the person - he turned his head round and looked about him - I was on the same side of the way, about two doors off near to Fleet-street; there was nobody near him - all in a moment I heard glass crash; he directly sprang from the window, and ran across the road to the Albion office, down Bridge-street, and I after him - he went through the coach-stand, and somebody on the other side of the way stopped him; an alarm had been given by several persons hallooing out Stop him! he kept running, and I lost sight of him for about two minutes; two young men brought him up towards the market - I knew him again, and am certain of his person; I laid hold of his left side, and took him to St. Bride's watch-house - I left him there, and went on duty; I did not see him searched - I went to Mr. Plumley's shop, but did not see the property found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Are you quite sure the prisoner is the man? A. I am; I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SINFIELD. I am shopman to Mr. Charles Plumley - he has no partner; I have lived with him and his father nearly forty years. I was in the shop when the window was broken - I heard a crash, looked round, and saw a man's hand in the window; I ran out, and before I could get out the party was gone - on looking over the window we missed a cushion with diamond pins and brooches worth between 30l. and 40l.; two of the pins have been found since - Mr. Plumley picked up one, and I believe a witness another; the house is in the parish of St. Bride.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not Mr. Plumley in partnership with Mr. William Davis? A. Not in the business on Ludgate-hill, I believe; but am not certain - Mr. Davis does not assist in the business; he never lived nor lodged in the house - it is entirely occupied by Mr. Plumley.</p>
               <p>JAMES GRIMMAN. I am a hair-dresser, and live in Fleet-street. I was crossing Bridge-street about a quarter to eight o'clock on the 15th of January - an alarm was raised, and I saw the prisoner running down Bridge-street very swiftly - he was the person pursued; several people behind him were calling Stop thief! I pursued him into Crescent-place; and finding there was no thoroughfare there, he was returning, when I put my hand on his arm and secured him - I am certain he is the same person I saw pursued, and running from the cry - he made no resistance; I asked him what he had been about; he answered, "Why, I have only broken a window; let me go" - I am certain he said that; other persons came up, and he said "Take me quietly, don't make a noise" - I went to the watch-house, but did not see him searched.</p>
               <p>RICHARD SHORT. I am an engraver, and live in Bride-lane. I was crossing Bridge-street, at a quarter to eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner running, and people calling Stop thief! he turned up Crescent-place - I followed, and he was taken; I saw one pin picked up, about the centre of the crescent, which is no thoroughfare - two diamond pins were found there; I saw one picked up, and saw one after it was picked up - Mr. Plumley claimed them.</p>
               <p>HENRY WAKE. I live in Poppin's-court, Fleet-street: the prisoner was brought to the watch-house to me - I am the night-officer; I found nothing on him - I went out with a lantern; Mr. Plumley, and the watch-housekeeper went down Bridge-street, into Crescent-place - and halfway up Crescent-place, I picked up a diamond pin, and a few yards from me, Mr. Plumley picked up another, and claimed them both.</p>
               <p>GEORGE FREDERICK BOOTH. I am an inspector of St. Bride's. I was in the watch-house when the prisoner was brought in; I found none of the property on him - I went with the night-officer to Crescent-place, and saw one of the pins picked up by Mr. Plumley.</p>

            . I am a jeweller, and live on Ludgate-hill, in the parish of St. Bride's. I was not in the shop at the time this happened, but heard of it almost immediately; I stopped at the window to take care of the property - I afterwards went to the watch-house, and then to Crescent-place, and, as near the spot as possible he was stopped at, I picked up two diamond pins - Wake, the officer, has the other; they are two of the pins which were on the cushion in my window - the value of those two is about 5l.; the value of all on the cushion is near 40l. - I have no partner in the business on Ludgate-hill; I have a partner in a wholesale jewellery concern, but none in the shop: it is my sole property - there were eleven pins and two brooches.</p>

On the 1st of June he came to enquire if there would be any work for him; I told him to come next morning - he came in; I had fourteen pairs of boot-fronts there - I asked my apprentice how many he had taken; he said six pairs - I said to the prisoner, "As you are rather cleaner than Sam, go and get a pint of beer;" he did, and I said to him, "Take a potato off the table" - he did so; he then went up stairs, and came down again in ten minutes; he passed us, went out, and said he would call to-morrow - I went up stairs, and missed the eight pairs of fronts; I have never found them since - no one was there but my apprentice; the prisoner did not come the next day - I found him the next night but one in bed.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HARRISON. I am the apprentice. There were fourteen pairs of fronts - I put six pairs on the blocks; when the prisoner was gone, I went up and missed the other eight pairs; I saw him go out very quick - he did not come the next day; I am sure no one but him could have taken them.</p>

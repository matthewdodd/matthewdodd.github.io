                  </hi>. I am a wine merchant of No. 15, London Street, City. The prisoner has been nine years in my service—on 4th Nov. I gave him a cheque for 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; odd—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I gave him instructions to pay the duty on a butt of wine that I had to send to the Earl of Leicester—the customary way to pay it is to get the cheque cashed at your bankers, and give them the money, as they will not receive cheques at the Custom House—at the same time he made out an invoice, and I wrote a letter to his Lordship, which I gave into the prisoner's hands to forward—in the ordinary course of business he would post it that night or the next day—on 6th Nov. he asked me for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for petty cash—I was in a hurry, and I foolishly signed a cheque without filling it up—it was a blank cheque for his usual allowance for petty cash, as his book will show—on Monday, 9th Nov., when I came to town, I found he was not at the office—I thought he might have been ill—I subsequently searched his desk after I had ascer<lb></lb>tained that he had filled up the cheque for 96<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I found in his desk the invoice and the letter to the Earl of Leicester, which ought to have been posted on the Friday previous—in consequence of that I communicated with the police—he was not apprehended—we got a policeman to look after him, but could not catch him.</p>

               <p>take an oath without looking at my book—I dare say he has to the extent of five or six times; I cannot say he may not have done it eight times—I have latterly been, like other mercantile men, hard up for money—the prisoner has not been the means of frequently extricating me from tem<lb></lb>porary pecuniary difficulties within the last year; nothing of the kind—I do not know of his having put himself to personal inconvenience to raise money for me—I have a son grown up—I have not from time to time authorised the prisoner to make advances to him on my behalf—whatever he advanced to my son was included in a cheque at the end of the week, and, if I had to give him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for petty cash expenses, I have drawn it for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or whatever it might be, for the use of my son—the prisoner has not repeatedly, and by my direction, advanced money to my son; it would be quite contrary to my direction—to my knowledge, he has never advanced him money which I have promised to repay—I know of nothing at all of the sort—I have within the last four months accepted a bill of exchange for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the prisoner—he purchased some things on his own private account, at a rummage sale, and he asked me if I would be kind enough to take some candles and a few bottles of sweets that had come back from the Crimea—he afterwards came to me, and asked me if I would be kind enough to accept a bill to the amount of 74<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or something like that; which I did—I have frequently asked him for a statement as to why he drew that bill for 74<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I could not get it from him—I do not believe I was indebted to the prisoner for more than 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for what I have purchased of him—that was for the candles and six bottles of preserved fruit—I do not know who discounted the bill—I know nothing at all about it, further than I paid it, at least my bankers did—I swear I did not owe him that amount of money when he drew the bill on me—there has been no relation between us but that of master and servant—I have been in the habit of entering wines in the Docks in his name; every merchant in the trade does the same—I have done according to commercial usage—he has entered them in his name—I have never entered them in his name—he has entered them in mine—that would be regular and proper—wines which were my property have been repeatedly entered in the Docks in his name—there is none there now in his name—the wines for the Earl of Leicester were not in his name—they were in the name of Turk, Barclay, and Co., to whom my wines go consigned, and he applied to them for a transfer of this butt to send to the Earl of Leicester, but it has never been sent—I do not know whether the transfer was made in his name—it was not by me if it was—I am indebted to a small amount at the Docks, but they do not annoy me about it—they did not stop my wine—at the interview I had with him before he was given into custody, he did not tell me that he had been unable to pay the duties because the wines were not racked off, nor did he say, "You must come to a settlement with me as to the money you owe me;" nothing of the kind—Mr. Sherman was present at the interview—it was at my solicitor's office—I was there when the prisoner came in with Mr. Sherman—a police officer was sent for immediately—he was not in attendance before the prisoner came—the prisoner did not say that I must settle the account with him as to what I owed him, before he parted with the money—I am not aware that at that time a judgment had been registered against me—I know what a judge's order is—to the best of my knowledge, I was not at that time under a judge's order, liable to an immediate execution if I did not pay an amount of money—I can swear that I was not—I was not at that time in communication with my solicitor as to the propriety of placing myself</p>

               <p>been in the habit of coming to the docks for many years—he sent me an order through the Long Room, for racking off this wine, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is signed by the prisoner, it came to me from the Long Room, attached to the warrant for the goods; it reached me on 6th Nov.—there have been several casks of wine entered in Mr. Leveridge's name, but whether they belonged to Mr. Oldham, I cannot say—I have nothing to do with the accounts—the Dock Company have outstanding accounts against many of the merchants for dock dues—I know nothing, of my own knowledge, of Mr. Oldham's account with the dock, it is not in my province—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was written by me to the prisoner; it relates to five butts and eight hogsheads of wine in the docks, which had been fined by Mr. Lever<lb></lb>idge's order, and it could not be racked because there were full casks on the top of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known Mr. Leveridge seven years; during the whole of that time I never knew anything adverse to him—I have never been present when he has had interviews or business with Mr. Oldham—I have had very many post dated cheques of Mr. Oldham's handed to me by Mr. Leveridge—I have cashed them, and also a bill for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on Monday, 9th Nov., I went with Leveridge, at his request, to Mr. Oldham's office; there was no person there; it was about 10 minutes past 4 o'clock in the afternoon—the office door was locked when Mr. Leveridge tried to get in—he rang the bell, and requested to see the housekeeper, and asked her if anybody had asked for him—next morning, about 20 minutes past 10 o'clock, at his request, I went with him to the office of the prosecutor's solicitor, Mr. Ennis, in Billiter Street—we found Mr. Ennis and Mr. Oldham there—I have a memorandum of what passed, I took it down in black lead at the time, and copied it out shortly afterwards, in ink—Mr. Leveridge asked what authority they had to go to his house, and charge him with forgery, and threaten his wife that they would placard the front of his house with bills offering 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward for his apprehension—Mr. Old<lb></lb>ham begged of Mr. Ennis to have a private interview with me, and I believe it was granted by Mr. Ennis and also by the defendant—Mr. Old<lb></lb>ham then told me that he did not believe the defendant knew what he was doing, and he wished, if he had done anything wrong, he would state so, and if he had taken more than belonged to him, that he would hand it over—I could not make any reply, because Mr. Oldham was in a distinct part of the room—Mr. Oldham did not say anything to him about this 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor did Leveridge to him, only as far as this, he said that he had done nothing that he considered to be wrong, and he was justified in what he had done—we were not there, I should think, more than half an hour—during that time the conversation went on between Mr. Leveridge, Mr. Oldham, and Mr. Ennis—Leveridge desired to be given into custody if Mr. Oldham pre<lb></lb>sumed</p>

               <p>to charge him with any offence; he would not undertake to make any compromise, or say he had done wrong—there was some conversation between Mr. Oldham and Mr. Leveridge that I did not hear—there was a great deal of conflicting matter; Mr. Oldham told the prisoner that he could transport him, and I heard the defendant say that he could transport him—at last Mr. Oldham sent for a policeman, and gave the prisoner into custody for embezzlement—I do not think the prisoner made any reply to. that charge—I have seen Mr. Oldham to-day about this building; he said to me that this was a serious affair, in his opinion; in my opinion, it was not so serious; and it was his, Mr. Oldham's, wish that half the money that he found Mr. Leveridge a defaulter of should be paid to him, and he would withdraw the affair—he proposed that the prisoner should plead guilty, and he said he would recommend him to mercy; he said he would like the facts of the matter to be committed to arbitration, and whatever the third party thought the prisoner was a defaulter in, he would take half the amount, and withdraw the matter.</p>

I am not engaged at all in betting—I have never been mixed up in betting transactions with the prisoner—I have had a great many money transactions with him—he was indebted to me in Nov. 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I cannot say exactly how much—since his incarceration, he has owed me nothing—I did not say he owed me 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I presume if I said 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it referred to the bill—I do not think he owed me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the beginning of Nov., nor 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he might have owed me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I would not swear he did not owe me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he is not indebted to me now; he has paid me since—I think he paid me on 5th or 7th Nov.; I think it was the 5th, but I cannot tax my memory when he paid these amounts—he has never paid me what he owed me, because he still owes me a little; he paid me part; during the last seven years he has continually paid me part—on 7th Nov., or I would rather say on the 9th, which was Monday, I received 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as part and parcel of what he owed me—I have not said what he owed me in Nov.; he owed me some amount; he is not indebted to me now—I am quite sure he paid me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 9th—when I say he paid me the balance, he did not pay me in cash—I had goods, goods that belonged to me, that he held in his possession—I had advanced him various sums of. money to purchase goods, and I have had those goods to sell for him, and the profits to be divided, as I presume, between me and him; and when he found he could not sell, they were retained in my possession, and I hold them now—that was what I meant when I said he owed me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the beginning of this year; I meant to the value of that amount—they were wines that he had purchased to sell; they were not sold, and they were returned to me—I had given him money to purchase the goods with—I took the goods myself from a cellar which he had in Jewry Street, Crutched Friars, on the 10th or 11th—I should think that was to the amount of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some was bottled wine, and some wine in cask—I will swear that was either on the 10th or 11th—I was present when he was given into custody; that was on the 10th—he did not give me up the wine, he gave me the authority to take it, and I got it in consequence—that was not the only money transac<lb></lb>tion I had with him—I have had a very great many money transactions with him—when I advanced him the money, I did not know what he was going to speculate in—I had arranged to have half the profits—he gave me the order to get the wine, in Limehouse, at 3 o'clock on Monday, 9th Nov.—it was on the 10th or 11th that I took it—he gave it me on the 9th,</p>

            . Last night, betwixt the hours of four and five, I was sent to a lighter on duty. I saw her moor'd in, I was on the shore and the vessel just by. I saw the prisoner poking his head down in a dark place by a hogshead that was on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing?</p>
               <p>Dudley. He was pudling and mudling about near where my lighter lay. I ask'd him what he was doing there; he said, no harm, that he was a poor man and a cripple; his back was towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Dudley. This was at <placeName id="t17561208-44-crimeloc222">Brewer's key</placeName>

Being walking on shore by my charge, I clap'd my hand upon the prisoner, and saw some hats under his great coat; there had been some hats taken out of a lighter that day, which were not survey'd, and they were under the care of the king's watchman on the key.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Dudley. I am a king's watchman. I got the man by the collar, called out for assistance, and held him till assistance came. Then I took him, and the hats he had got, into our office.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hats were there?</p>
               <p>Dudley. There were fifty-nine hats, call'd chip hats, for women. Then the prisoner was order'd into custody. (The bats produced in court.) These are the hats which I took upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had he got them?</p>
               <p>Dudley. They were under his great coat.</p>

            . I belong to the customs. We had sundry goods in charge, and we discharged all that day but these hats.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of them?</p>
               <p>Muddle. There were six tubs of them, which were left in the king's charge. I went to see for a watchman to set over them. While I was gone fifty nine of them were pilfer'd.</p>

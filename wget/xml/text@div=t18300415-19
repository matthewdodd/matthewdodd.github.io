            . I am headborough of St. Luke's. I was in Goswell-street about a quarter to twelve o'clock, returning home, and saw Collins running very fast, and the prosecutor after her; just as he got to the end of the court, I heard him cry, "Stop her, stop her, Police, police" - I immediately pursued her, and the prosecutor secured her; he said he wanted a Policeman - I said I was an officer; he said, "I give this woman in charge, she has robbed me of a half-crown" - I took her and him to the Prince Regent, searched Collins there, and found 8 1/2d. about her, but no half-crown; as I was taking her to the station, Rowland came along with us, and she said,"No, Sir, it was not a half-crown he dropped, it was only a halfpenny - I saw the halfpenny in her hand;" the prosecutor said he had lost a half-crown, and shewed me the spot where they were standing - I did not look for the half-crown; Rowland said two or three times as we went along that it was only a halfpenny, and I took her into custody - it was a very fine night, and very light up that court by the Prince Regent; there is a large gas light, and the house was not shut up - the prosecutor appeared to me to have been drinking, but knew perfectly well what he was doing.</p>

             re-examined. I went from Nyman's to Wych-street, where I had a man in possession; I did not change the half crown - when I asked Mrs. Nyman for money I had about 10d. in my pocket; I treated the man I had in possession in Wych-street and the man on whom I had distrained - we had a quartern and a half of gin between myself, my man, and the man and his wife; I stopped there till that time, hoping he would be able to settle the amount I had seized for - that was all I drank.</p>
               <p>Collins' Defence. I met him in Goswell-road; he asked me to take a walk with him - I said I could not; he caught hold of my arm, and was very much intoxicated; he asked where I lived - I said in New-court; he asked me to take him home, and in New-court he said he did not know whether he had any money, but he would feel - he put his hand into his pocket, and let a halfpenny fall; I took it up and gave it to him - it went out of his hand; he called a Policeman, and I ran away.</p>

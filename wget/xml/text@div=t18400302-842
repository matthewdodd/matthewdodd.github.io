I was in the cabin on the 22nd of February—the mate called my attention, and I saw the prisoner on the quay of the dock with a bundle—I went on shore after him, and asked him where he got that bundle—he gave it to me, and it contained my flannel shirts, my drawers, smock-frock, stockings, and trowsers—they were all mine—in a few minutes the prisoner was brought on board by an officer, and I delivered him the things which I had taken from the prisoner—they had been kept in a chest in the forecastle which was broken open.</p>

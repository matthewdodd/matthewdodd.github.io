                  </hi>. I am a chemist and druggist, and live in the Edge<lb></lb>ware-road. The deceased applied to me on the 27th, about a quarter of an hour after he received the injury—I examined his knee; it appeared very much swollen, and as if he had received a severe contusion on the left knee, such as might be caused by a severe kick—I gave him leeches to apply, and cold applications—I did not see him again until the 1st of May, when he walked to me, which, in my judgment, was an imprudent thing at that time—I live five or six houses from him—his knee appeared less swollen then, but he complained of more pain—it appeared to have had an application of leeches, which would reduce the swelling—I ex<lb></lb>amined it; and although the swelling appeared very much reduced, still, over-exertion, or other causes, might have brought on that pain—I applied my hand to it—he complained of much pain upon that—I applied more cold applications, and more leeches—I saw him again that day or the next—he appeared some days better and other days worse—I attended him occasionally with Mr. Gerdwood until the day of his death—there was always inflammation more or less about the knee since the 1st of May—the inflammation gradually increased and extended up and down the limb—it might have been brought on by various causes—in the present instance, I think it more than probable, that the inflammation was brought on by his own exertion; I mean the increase of it—if he had not received an injury on the knee it would not have been inflamed—it finally brought on erysipelas; and he died, on the 12th of May, of delirium, the result of erysipelas, pro<lb></lb>duced, in all probability, by the blow—I know of nothing else which could produce it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital, and live in Brook-street, Grosvenor-square. I was called in to the deceased on Sunday, the 10th of May; the disease had made progress, so that the examination of the knee was of less importance—he was in a state of high delirium; and that sort of delirium which is attended with great de<lb></lb>bility—I inquired into the cause—I found he had erysipelas on the left thigh and leg—the cause was then apparent—I inquired farther, and found he had received a slight abrasion or injury on the top of the shin-bone—I saw that the inner part of the knee was tender, and that there had been the injury—the slightest abrasion, puncture, or bruise, will, in some constitu<lb></lb>tions, produce erysipelas—the knee was slightly swollen—when the con<lb></lb>stitution is debilitated, either by excess or any thing else, a very slight injury will produce that effect.</p>

On or about the 4th of August, in the last year, a person, whom I believe to be Hymey Abrahams, called at my shop, about eight o'clock in the evening - I was very much engaged at my books - he produced a chain and bracelets for sale. I looked at them, and told my young man to weigh them. I said it was unusual to buy gold at that time of night - he said I might depend on its being the best gold, that a friend of his had just brought it from the East Indies - it weighed about 8 ozs., and I gave him 28 l. 15 s. for it. I offered him a cheque, which he said he could not take, for he had got to pay the money away that evening, and could take nothing but cash - he was dressed in a surtout coat, and I think a black cravat - he said he was in the trade, and was in the habit of having gold and silver, and, from his appearance I considered him a dealer. In consequence of his refusing a cheque, I drew one for 30 l., and got Tomlinson to get it changed in the neighbourhood, and find by my book that I gave him 28 l. 15 s. I have not put the weight down, for I found shortly afterwards that I was done, and have written the word</p>
               <p>"done" in the book. I found, in an hour or less, upon examining it closely, that it was silver gilt. I did not see him again till within the last two or three months. I called on Levi, of St. Mary-axe, in consequence of information. I went there with Mr. Kidder, of Hatton-garden, and took the chain and bracelets to him. I afterwards went to the prisoner's father,

             - the prisoner Isaac was present, but not Hymey. I stated to the father, that a chain and bracelets, which I had bought some time ago for gold, which turned out to be silver gilt, I had traced to the possession of his son Isaac. Isaac, the father, and others, who were present, declared they had neither seen nor heard anything about it. I said I was convinced, from the information I had, that it had been in his possession. Isaac then said, it had been in his possession, but he had not sold it - that he had offered it to Mr. Levi, and he knew that I had got my information from Levi, and that he offered it only as silver-gilt - they were very abusive, and said, I might go to Hell. Isaac said he had not sold it to me or to Levi, but had sold it in the Jews' Coffee-house, with upwards of 100 l. worth of other goods - he did not know to whom. Isaac constantly dealt with me, and was in and out of my shop, and must have seen the chain there before I went to him about it - I shewed it to him once.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were at the father's, was any doubt expressed about the chain being the same - A. No; but another brother said he was a d - d fool for owning it. I produce it - it is solid silver gilt; the weight of it deceived me - I believed it to be an Indian gold chain - it was as heavy as a hollow gold chain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. If it had been solid gold would it not have weighed considerably more - A. Yes; gold chains are frequently made hollow. I sent next morning to several shops, to know if it had been offered. I instituted this prosecution last Sessions. I saw Isaac at my shop several times after the chain was brought. I pay the expences of the prosecution, and employed Mr. Isaacs, the attorney - I never employed him before. I did not proceed till I saw Mr. Levi. It has always been my determination to do so if I could meet with the party.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. How long have you known Isaac - A. More than twelve years. I have only known Hymey two or three months. I have been to the father's house perhaps a dozen times before I bought the chain, but never saw Hymey till this transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see him, on your oath - A. I do not exactly know; he has come into my shop within the last two or three months. I am not concerned in a commission of bankruptcy against Hymey. Mr. Isaacs called on me (before I employed him). with one Cashmore, or Cashman; I asked his advice on the subject. They did not solicit me to prosecute; I thought, from what Cashmore said, that Mr. Isaac would know more about the party, and was induced to give him the instructions. I think I shewed the chain to the prisoner Isaac within a month after I bought it. He was a good deal among the shopkeepers, and I thought he might have seen it elsewhere. I do not swear to Hymey Abrahams, because I was much engaged at the time; he had a surtout coat on, with a black collar lined with red. Hymey brought an epergne to my shop very lately - I think it was before I saw Mr. Levi.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180042"></xptr>COURT. Q. Did you know him again - A. No, my Lord; the epergne did not suit me, and I did not buy it. He and his brother brought me a bag of silver prior to that.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to stop him - A. I did not know him - it did not occur to me - I did not recollect him, as he was with his brother, who I did more business with than him. It was daylight, and the epergne was brought by daylight. He has several brothers.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. When Hymey came after this transaction, he came in company - A. Generally with his brothers; and my business being with the brothers, I did not notice him. My attention was called to him afterwards in consequence of what Levi said. Mr. Isaacs recommended me to send the chain round the trade, to see if any one had had it offered. I called on the father by his recommendation, and proposed that I should give him a fair opporunity to return the money, if he had sold it in ignorance - he said he had never seen it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is there in the appearance of Hymey to induce you to believe him to be the person - A. From his size, appearance, and countenance.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you know him better now than when he brought the silver - A. Because he has been two or three times since with his brothers. I broke one link of the chain - it is silver gilt. I have never assayed it.</p>

            . I am in the service of the prosecutors, and remember the person coming to sell the chain; the defendant Hymey is the person, I have not the least doubt of it. He brought the chain, threw it down on the counter, and said a friend had brought it from the East Indies, and it was made of ducat gold. Mr. Griffin was busy marking off a lot of plate which he had bought. His brother weighed the chain by his direction - it weighed between eight and nine ounces. Mr. Griffin had not enough money, and asked him to take a cheque; he said his friend was going into the country next morning, and wanted the cash. Mr.

             a cheque for 30 l., which I got changed, and Mr. Griffin paid him; and between ten and eleven o'clock that night, we found that it was not gold. I took it round the trade next day, to ascertain whether any shopkeepers had had it offered, in order to find out the parties who sold it. I did not see Hymey again till I saw him in Duke's-place, two or three months ago, I charged him with having sold it - he denied it, but would not give his name or address at first, but did afterwards. I never recollect seeing him in the shop, except when he offered the chain; the chain is silver gilt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How have you tried it - A. Mr. Griffin filed it. I swear that there is no gold in it. I was not at home when the epergne or silver were brought.</p>

            , that you charged Hymey with being the person - A. Yes. I knew where old Abrahams lived; but did not know that Hymey was his son; my master deals with his brothers. I was assisting Mr. Griffin in putting away the plate when he came; I think he had a dark olive coat, and a black stock on - my master never told me what coat he had on. I mentioned to my master today, that he had an olive coat on; I never mentioned it to him before that I recollect.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did Mr. Levi say anything to you before you saw this man in Duke's-place - A. I had called on him about the chain - he had said nothing to me about Hymey.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came your master and you to have conversation about the dress to-day - A. He was mentioning something, and I said he had a dark olive coat on; I believe it was in answer to a question he put. I said nothing about the black stock.</p>

            . I live in Bury-street, St. Mary-axe. In the early part of last year, the prisoner Isaac came to my shop, and produced a chain; it was the one produced (looking at it.) He proposed to sell it as gold, and asked 4 l. an ounce - I looked at it, and having some doubt about it, gave it to my brother to have it tried with a file - he called out,</p>
               <p>"Don't file it;</p>
               <p>"I said</p>
               <p>"The file will not hurt it, if it be gold;" he said,</p>
               <p>"No, don't file it, for if it is not gold, I can return it to the person from whom I had it." I said it was fit it should be filed, as if it should not be gold, it should not be further offered - he said he insisted on having it back in the state he brought it. I handed it over to him, saying I doubted its being gold; he went away with it. I saw him again two or three days after, and told him I understood the chain and bracelets were sold in the neighbourhood for gold, and 27 l. or 28 l. obtained for them - I had heard that from Mr. Griffin's man, who had called to enquire if such an article had been offered me, by a person pretending himself to be the mate of an Indiaman; the answer Isaac made was</p>
               <p>"I did not get half that money for it." I had promised the man I would make enquiry about it. Tomlinson called the following day, and I told him what had passed; I did not tell him it was

               <p>Q. Why not tell him the person's name - A. I wished to ascertain the fact, as he said he had not had half that money. I thought one had taken advantage of the other.

Mr. Griffin stated to him that he had bought a chain of some person, who he did not know, but had traced the possession of it to him; that if it had been sold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180043"></xptr>to him without knowing that it was not gold, he gave him an opportunity of returning the money, which he should expect him to do - Isaac said he had had the chain in his possession some length of time, and I think he said he had bought it at Bath (the chain was produced - he did not question it being the same); he said he had offered it to several persons in the trade, among whom was Mr. Levi, for 6 s. an ounce; but that he eventually sold it among a quantity of goods, to the amount of upwards of 100 l., to a Foreigner (at the coffee-house), whom he did not know, but should know him if he saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Mr. Griffin was with you, and heard all this - A. Yes. The name of the coffee-house was not mentioned, I am certain. I know dealings are carried on at the Jews' coffee-house.</p>

             re-examined. I have examined one link of the chain; it appears to be composed of silver of an inferior quality; it certainly is not gold.</p>

            , JUN. I am the prosecutor's brother. I was at home when the chain and bracelets were bought; to the best of my belief the defendant Hymey is the man, but we were very busy, and I will not swear to him.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT to LEVI. Q. Have you anything to do with the commission of bankruptcy against Abrahams - A. I am a creditor. I have not employed Mr. Isaacs to oppose him. I have been present when he has opposed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not that opposition been carried on with a great deal of zeal - A. I call it a deserving zeal, as I have reason to believe the accounts very incorrect. My debt is between 200 l. and 300 l. Isaacs is not solicitor under the commission.</p>
               <p>MESSRS. ANDREWS and PLATT addressed the Jury.</p>

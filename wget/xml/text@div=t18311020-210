            . I keep this lodging-house. There were five chests in the room, all corded - the prisoner's was among them; he lodged in another room - on the 16th of September I met him in Rateliff-highway, very much intoxicated, with a pair of trousers under his arm; I asked what he was going to do with them - he said he did not know - (Harvey had come to the house intoxicated a few days before, and left his trunk open;) I said I would take the trousers from him - he came home about ten o'clock intoxicated, and in the morning I accused him of it - he denied it; the handkerchief and waistcoat were in the possession of another man, named Gibson, who used to go to the prosecutor's chest.</p>

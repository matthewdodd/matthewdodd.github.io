It was admitted on the part of the Crown, that the prisoner had been tried and acquitted on an indictment for murder, and that the male child mentioned in both the indictments was one and the same, but that the child was not so well known by the name of Charles William Beadle as by any or either of the names stated in the indictment now before the Court. Upon this plea and replication a Jury were impanneled, to try the issue. (See Fifth Session, page 395.)</p>

             - she was delivered of a male child there - it was in January, to the best of my knowledge; it was baptized at St. George the Martyr- I stood Godmother to it; I do not know when it left the workhouse. The mother brought it to the workhouse on the day it was murdered, to see the grandmother, who was there; this was before it was dead. The mother was single at the time she was delivered - she was married nearly two months afterwards; the name the infant was called by, was either William or Billy, that was after the baptism; a young woman who laid-in at the same time, also stood to the child, and two young men in the house stood Godfathers; I do not exactly know their names - they were strangers to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Should you have known this child by the name of Beadle or not? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If anybody spoke of it you would have known it as Beadle? A. Yes; I should have known it as Charles William Beadle: if any one had inquired of me about the child as Charles William Beadle, I should have known who it meant; I never heard it called by the name Beadle; it was called by the name of William or Billy.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHEEN, SEN. I am the prisoner's father. I did not know my son's child till after it was dead; my wife is here; she knows no more than I.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear, during the life-time of the child, what its name was? A. Yes, Sir, Charles William Sheen, I heard; I have heard that its mother's name was Lydia Beadle. I know nothing of the baptism; I cannot swear that my son and Beadle were ever married.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q. From whom have you heard that its name was Charles William Sheen? A. I heard it from several persons; I do not recollect who; it was not from my wife. I really cannot exactly say what the name was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say on the former trial that you did not know its name, and never heard it till after the child's death? A. I cannot answer.</p>

               <p>Q. I mean, if persons were talking of little Billy Beadle, not in the presence of the mother, should you have known who was meant by it? A. No; I should not know who it meant, because I never heard the name called.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You knew the mother's name to be Beadle, and you know the child to be hers; then if you heard the child called William or Billy Beadle, should you not have known it to be hers? A. In her presence I should; but after her marriage I should have called it Sheen.</p>

            . I am short-hand writer to the Court, and took notes of the trial in question; the witness, William Sheen, was asked, (reads) "Did you ever hear the child's name?" his answer was, "I did not know what the name<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120022"></xptr>of the child was, till after I heard it was dead." He was then asked, "Did you hear that from your son?" and answered, "No." "Did you ever hear the child called by any name by your son?" Answer, "I don't recollect that I ever did." "Are you sure about this?" "Not that I recollect."</p>

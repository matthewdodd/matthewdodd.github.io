On the 30th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner and another man take a puncheon away; they rolled it down the yard - I followed, and they were lifting it into a cart; (I have seen him before - he had no business on the premises) - I asked what they were going to do with it, and the prisoner ran away, I followed and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was employed to assist in lifting it into the cart; I did not roll it down the yard. Witness. He was rolling it across the street, and helping it into the cart.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH KINGSTON. I am carman to Thomas Bull, of Great Dover-street. I was in Bishopsgate-street; the prisoner stopped me, and said he had got a 6d. job for me, to take a puncheon over to the Borough - I stopped my cart; he and another man rolled the puncheon from the yard, and were putting it into my cart, when Wallance came up, and collared the other man - the prisoner ran off, but was stopped.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say a person had a 6d. job for you? A. You said you had a 6d. job.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Bishopsgate-street; a person asked me to step over and ask that carman if he was going to the Borough - he said he was; I said I believed there was a 6d. job for him, to take a puncheon - two men brought it to the cart; I lifted it in, and was to have 6d. for my trouble - the officer found 6d. on me; the man who hired me sung out that it was stolen, and we should all be taken - I thought it best to go.</p>

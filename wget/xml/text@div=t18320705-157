               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Does he not deal in boat-nails, and in all kinds of ironmongery? A. I saw such things there - I have known a man having to pay a penalty for not answering to the satisfaction of the Magistrate; the prisoner was bailed.</p>

            . I am a boat-man, and reside at Lambeth. I bought sixty-one thousand boat-nails of the prisoner on the 12th of April; he called on me with his card, as all ironmongers do; he showed me a sample of these nails, and told me the price, which was 1s. a thousand; the market price varies so much that I considered it a fair price; it was only 2d. a thousand under what I could get them for in my own neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose if a boat-maker should fail, or fall into distress, there would be an auction of his things, as well as of other persons? A. I should think so; there was no concealment in his dealings, and he might have bought them for 2d. a thousand more than he sold them to me, by going fifty yards further.</p>

             has been my servant for four years - I had some conversation with him, and went to Mr. Lyon's, who said he had bought a quantity of nails, but I did not see them - these are part of the nails that were stolen from my premises; the papers they are in are marked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you ever miss any nails till you suspected Perkins? A. Yes, some time before - Perkins had not described these nails - I cannot tell how many thousand I have sold within six months; I never sold any to the prisoner; I cannot say these were never sold - I have only one other person who receives money in my shop, but I have several labourers and warehousemen - Perkins used to work in the shop, but not receive money; the prisoner was a general dealer; I do not call him an ironmonger; the men who weigh these nails put them in paper, and mark them, and, in general, that mark has been on every thousand of nails sold.</p>

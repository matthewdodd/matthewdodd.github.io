            . I am a boot-maker, and live in Carey-street. I knew the prisoner some years ago - he worked for me. On the 7th of October he called, and asked to speak with me in private; I said he could speak there - he then said he had some fronts to sell for a shopmate, who was going out of town, and wanted to raise a little money on them; I told him to let me see them, and he produced three tops of boots, in an unfinished state; I said I would detain him till the person would come and own them - he said he would have them back - I said he should not; he said he would bring an action against me; I then sent for a constable, who said, as he had been a housekeeper he would let him go, and call in the morning; the prisoner returned to me in a few minutes, and said it was useless for him to come again, and I had better give them to him - I refused, - he went away, and next morning I found the owner.</p>

            . I am shopman to the prosecutors; these are odd legs, and are theirs - I never sold them: if sold, they must go through my hands.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the Crown public-house, in Vere - street; a man there said, "Will you buy a little cabbage?" they were quite in a rough state; he said I should have them for 2s., as money ran short; I said McArthur would buy them - he said I had better go, and I went; he would not give them back to me: I afterwards went with the officer to Stonecutter-alley, where I heard the man lived, but could not find him: the officer said Mr. Giblett suspected one of his men.</p>

               <p>CHARLES IRELAND. I am a <rs id="t18270913-348-viclabel1938" type="occupation">ladies' shoe-maker</rs>

On Sunday, the 12th of August, I had been to the Blue Coat Boy public-house, to get a glass of gin and noyeau. I was then going home, and was stopped close to my house, by the prisoner and a female. I had been treating them at the public-house, and we came out together; they wanted me to go further, but I would not; they then came, and each took hold of my arm, and the female made a catch at my watch; the prisoner seized me at the back of my neck, and held me while the woman took my watch - I seized fast hold of each of them, and saw her give the watch to the prisoner, when her things began to tear - I let go of her then; he then gave the watch to her, and she ran away - I detained him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you told the whole story? A. Yes - when the woman was near, the prisoner tried to throw me down, but I kept hold of him; they came into the house, and asked me to treat them at the Blue Coat Boy, and then we went to the Hoop and Grapes public-house - I might drink a drop of gin and water, and some beer - I did not go into any other public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state, at the Mansion-house, that another person was the man? A. I was asked if that was the man, and said Yes, thinking it was the prisoner - I remember the Lord Mayor telling me to come sober next time.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was coming up Petticoat-lane, calling twelve o'clock, and saw a woman dart off as quick as possible, and when I got to the corner, I saw the prisoner in the prosecutor's custody; he dragged him a considerable way - I took him in charge - he said the prisoner had held him while he had been robbed of his watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the prosecutor rather drunk? A. He had been drinking; he was not very drunk - I saw him at the Mansion-house; he was not sober then.</p>

I first became acquainted with the prisoner ten or twelve years ago (looking at a bill.) I received this from him, about the beginning of November last, in part payment for goods which had been delivered to him by me, he gave it me at my house in Norfolk-street. I asked him about the drawer's in Jersey; he stated that they were carpet and woollen manufacturers of respectability in Jersey; I made no further enquiry; he endorsed the bill in my presence,</p>

             and Co." Before that time, I had learnt from the prisoner that Stamford was his partner, that he resided in Northamptonshire, where he had considerable freehold property, and that Stamford was to advance between two and 3000 l. in the business, which he (Needham) was to carry on as his partner; this passed in August last. The bill was in my hands on the 27th of January; when it became due it was not paid; the answer was that the acceptor was a bankrupt; in consequence of which I wrote a letter to Smith, White and Co. of Jersey, to Mr. Packwood, and to the endorsers; the Jersey letter was returned by the dead letter office. I could never find any such persons at Jersey. I have sent my clerk over there since this charge has been preferred. I did not see the prisoner after the bill was returned, but after other bills endorsed,</p>
               <p>"Stamford and Co." had been refused payment; I enquired of him particularly about Stamford; he was very angry at my pressing the enquiry, and said the bills would be taken up in a few days, and that it was not Stamford and Co's business to take them up, but the acceptors, and previous endorsers. Not being able to get the money from any one, I pressed him for the address of Stamford; he said I should hear of him at Mr. Jermaine's, upholsterer, Cumberland-street, New-road; I have not been there myself. I expressed my disapprobation, at his representing Stamford as a man of such property in Northamptonshire, when I had ascertained that he was only a porter to Mr. Jermaine; he then said that although only a porter, he had by his industry saved money, and possessed several freeholds in the neighbourhood of London.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you lived in Norfolk-street - My family went there in June last.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you then - A. I was a prisoner in the Fleet, living in the rules, at Mrs. Hoare's, No. 45, or 46, Ludgate-hill. I was discharged from the Fleet on the 26th of October. I had been there a year and a half. I was eight months of that time in the walls.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not twelve months and upwards - A. I cannot speak to it exactly, but think it was not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You certainly must recollect within a month or so - A. I think it was about eight months.</p>
               <p>Q. You state yourself as carrying on business as a merchant - you must know whether people were giving you credit within the walls - A. They gave me credit within the walls and without.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you more than twelve months in the rules - A. I was admitted to a day-rule before, (hesitating) I think I was eleven months in the walls; I was moved there by habeas, from Ilchester.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you a prisoner at Ilchester - A. Yes; for two years. A circumstance comes to my recollection now, by which I know I got the rules in April.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not more than fourteen months before you got the rules - A. Certainly; I think I was removed to the Fleet on the 14th of May, and in April in the next year I got the rules. I continued doing business at Mrs. Hoare's, till the end of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took you to Ilchester gaol; was it one of the officers of the King's Bench - A. Yes; from the King's Bench prison. I had received sentence, on the floor of the King's Bench court.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a gentleman named Mosley Woolfe on the floor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090063"></xptr>at the same time - A. He was and

            . We were convicted of a mercantile conspiracy.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath have you not said that you transacted your business with the prisoner, at Mrs. Hoare's house, in Ludgate-hill - A. I received the bills in Norfolk-street. I stated to the magistrate, that the prisoner represented Stamford as a freeholder in Northamptonshire - and that he was to advance 2 or 3000 l. I said I took another bill, partly on the credit of the endorsement, but not this; he handed me over 4 or 500 l. worth of bills at once; it was in Norfolk-street, subsequently to my being discharged from the Fleet. The prisoner gave me a character on my trial for a conspiracy. The bills were left with me three or four days before I delivered any goods for them; I paid them all away long subsequent to the delivery of the goods. I know Mr. Wagstaff, but do not know that he carried on business under the firm of Stamford and Co. - I had not seen him more than once at the time of this transaction. The prisoner has done business with me and for me to the amount of many thousands. I should think he did 2000 l. worth of business for me, while I was in the Fleet; he has done business for me by agency, for five or six years past. I have done business to the extent of about 2400 l. with Wagstaffs, who are now bankrupts. I have endeavoured to get money on those bills, on which his name has been, but not to put an end to this prosecution. I made no such proposal to Levi or to Isaacs, but he did to me; he said he came with a view to serve me, and wished to get me my money - he said the prisoner had been drawn into it, and that Wagstaff was the man I ought to prosecute; I did not ask him if Needham's family would accept bills to the amount; I referred him to Mr. Cope, my attorney, and urged him to go there.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did he ever call on you when Cope your attorney was present - A. He spoke to me as we came out of Marlborough-street - Mr. Cope advised me to refer him to him. Isaacs proposed my giving up this charge, and to prosecute for a fraud; and said probably I should get the money from Wagstaff in that event; he urged me to prosecute Wagstaff, and make Needham a witness. I remember advising Cope to go to Isaacs; he said it was his business professionally to call on him.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you, after your discharge from the Fleet, to continue at Mrs. Hoare's - A. A great many people called upon me there, and it was convenient for me to meet people there, who I did not wish to come where my family were, annoying me at meals, and out of business hours, and it was a convenient counting-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you recollect the amount of the fraud for which you were sent to gaol - A. I think there was an affidavit made, that the fraud would have amounted to 50,000 l. but the amount in the indictment was about 10,000 l.</p>
               <p>FRYER TODD. I am clerk to Mr. Kinnear. I went to Jersey, in March last, to enquire respecting the house of Smith, White, and Co. but could discover no such house; I advertised in four newspapers, and enquired at the Custom-House agents, and bankers, and went to five villages; I found one White, and Co. and presented the bill there; they denied all knowledge whatever of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. - Q. You were sent after this prosecution was commenced - A. I do not know that; he had gone to the public-office before that - I have been with Mr. Kinnear four months.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he find you - A. He has been at my house years ago - I first became acquainted with him about 1817, in Curzon-street, May fair.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a merchant there - A. I am sure I do not know. Mrs. Kinnear came to my house, in Curson-street. I do not know where he lived then; it was an invitation which came from my wife; it was an evening party. I did not know where he lived - The first residence I knew of his was at Battersea; some years elapsed between his visiting me in Curzon-street, and my seeing him again - I did not know where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you know him live at Battersea - A. In 1821; that was after he was prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Q. After - A. Mrs. Kinnear had a house there.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, do not you know he was in gaol in 1821 for a conspiracy - A. I do not, I only heard it from report.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say he lived at Battersea, when you knew, from report, that he was at Ilchester - A. I might have been informed afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. After when - A. After I came into his employ. I do not know what year he was in gaol. I went to see Mrs. Kinnear, at Battersea. I did not ask where he was. I heard, by report, that he was at Ilchester, but never saw him there. I saw him in the Fleet. I was a prisoner there when he came from Ilchester. I was sent there in January, 1822, till March; he was a ruler there at the time I came.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he was in the rules of the Fleet in January or March, 1822 - A. After March. He was not within the walls in January. He might be at the commencement of January. I believe he was not in the walls. I have seen him come in and go out. During the time I was a prisoner there, he was not within the walls.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. You are quite sure you met him at one of Mrs. Todd's routs - A. Yes. I renewed my acquaintance with him in the rules of the Fleet. I did not doubt his being convicted of a conspiracy.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you became his clerk - A. Yes. I never accepted bills for him. I have been a merchant, and became a bankrupt twice, and was discharged once under the insolvent act - that was in March, 1822. I lived thirteen years in Bury-street, and then went to Great Winchester-street.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Kinnear. I have been so at various periods since 1817. I knew he was at Ilchester. He came to the Fleet in 1821, and was within the walls about five months, and not more. I believe he took the rules at the latter end of September, 1821, and went to live at No. 46, Ludgate-hill. I was his clerk, from May 1821 till the end of January 1822; and from September, 1822 to the present time. In October last, the prisoner owed Mr. Kinnear about 500 l. I saw this bill in Mr. Kinnear's possession; the endorsement,</p>
               <p>"Stamford and Co," is the prisoner's writing. I have no doubt of it. When it became due I wrote to Stamford, Colville, and to Smith, White, and Co. - the letter to Smith and Co. was returned. I saw a man at Marlborough-street office, answering to the name of

            , at the time this charge was made, he was a round shouldered man, about the middle size and height. I have not seen him since.</p>

From February 1817 to 1819, and the other times, I have; mentioned I went into his service directly he came from Ilchester. I have a perfect recollection of this bill. I called on Colville, one of the endorsers, at St. Mary Axe. I do not believe there was any connexion between him and Kinnear. I recollected the prisoner handing this bill, and several others over. I copied them upon paper, at Ludgate-hill. I copied them there in the back room; they were afterwards taken by Mr. Needham, into the front room. I do not know that I ever saw them afterwards. The goods were not all furnished at once. I know J. and H. Wagstaff, they dealt with Kinnear. I understood they lived in Skinner-street.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Perhaps you attended the Court of King's Bench on the trial of the conspiracy - A. I was occasionally in Court. I heard the charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any situation to go into the service of this infamous conspirator - A. I had been clerk to Mr. Keats, an army contractor; I left him previous to Kinnear coming to town; I had no employment; I have looked for no other since.</p>

No. I know my husband was in the habit of accepting bills, but I do not know for whom; a great many bills came for acceptance; he was clerk to Mr. Jarmaine, and had 20 s. or 15 s. a week. I had no landed property in Northampton. He died of a broken heart in consequence of this business.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY proposed to call the clerk of the police office to read the evidence given by Stamford before the Magistrate. The Court ruled, that as he could not be a competent witness without a release, which he had not at the time he gave his evidence, it could not be received.</p>

               <p>The prisoner, in a long defence, stated, that he embarked in life with most respectable connexions, as an insurance broker, but met with considerable losses, when one Lec, of Liverpool, insinuated himself into his favour, and procured acceptances to a large amount from him, which got into Kinnear's hands, who struck a docket against him, and kept harrassing him till Kinnear went to Ilchester, and since his return, he (the prisoner) had accepted several bills for him - that in July last Wagstaff, who was a friend of the prosecutor's, and who represented himself as a man of property, applied to him to become one of the firm of Stamford and Co., representing Stamford as a man of considerable property, and being treated as a partner, he accepted and endorsed bills in the name of Stamford and Co. - that he derived no benefit from it, but Messrs. Wagstaffs were the principals in the concern, and carried on business in Fore-street, in Stamford's name.</p>

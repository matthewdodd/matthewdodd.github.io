About half-past five o'clock on the evening of the 5th of April, the prisoner came to the station-house and requested permission to examine the pan of the water-closet of the room she had been locked up in, saying the sovereign must have passed through her when she was at the station-house, as she had carefully searched for it ever since, and it must have been there; and added, "I was discharged by the Magistrate, and you know the sovereign is mine now."</p>

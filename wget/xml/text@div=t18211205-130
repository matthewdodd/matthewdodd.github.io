            . On the 14th of November, about three o'clock, I saw a cart unloading next to my house, the prisoner was in it unloading it - I was at the window; he put his hand into a bundle, took out two or three things, looked at them, and put them in again; this excited my suspicion; he then opened a drawer in a chest, while the man and boy were assisting in getting the things in. As he opened the drawer, he took out a book, looked at it, and put it in again, he then took a ball of string, and put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050079"></xptr>it in again, he took out the book again; and concealed it under the straw in the cart - I continued to watch him, he took out another drawer, and overhauled that; took out a gown, as I thought, held it up, and stuffed it into his bosom, and buttoned his coat over it. I gave them information.</p>

             is my brother-in-law. I was receiving the goods from the prisoner, Mr. Duncan gave me information - I jumped into the cart, and saw the prisoner's coat bulky, I kept my eye on him, the people kept looking at him, which I supposed made him think himself suspected; I saw him unbutton his coat, the gown was under it, he dropped it as if he wished to conceal it; and then said, "Here is a gown laying here." I said, "Yes, and it was under your coat just this minute," he asked what good it would do him, to conceal it under his coat; I said just as much as any other thief - I charged him with having a book, he denied it; I sent for an officer, he jumped out of the cart, took the book out of his bosom, and threw it up to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"There is your book." He was carman to Mr. Barlow of Islington.</p>

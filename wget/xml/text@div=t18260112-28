Bath and Bristol note, and at the same time requested me to shew him some seals for his son, who was at school; he chose two seals, which came to 2l. 4s. - which made 3l. 4s. I wrapped up the goods which he selected, and told him I had not sufficient change, and should be under the necessity of getting it - I asked him to be kind enough to put his name and address upon it, which he did, in my presence - this is the note (looking at it;) he has written "Mr. Martin, No. 1l, Dean-street, Soho." My suspicions were excited, and I went to Groom, the constable, and gave him the note, having first marked it. Groom came with me - we called on Mr. Harrison, who accompanied us to the shop; Groom had returned me the note before I went to Harrison. - When we got to the shop Harrison assumed Mr. Haskins; I put the note across the counter into his hand, and asked him if he could give change - he looked at it, and turning to the prisoner, said, he really thought it was a bad note, and was very sorry for him, if he had taken it in the way of business; the prisoner said he believed it to be a good one, and if we went to his lodging, where he referred, to Dean-street, we should find it all right; Groom, who stood behind him, said he must search his person before he left, which he objected to - he was brought into the parlour, and searched; the Pontefract note, which he had tendered to me, was found on him: I marked that also; this is it (examining it;) he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. If you took a bad half-crown Mr. Haskins would not make you answerable for that? A. He might not. I have never taken bad money; I have been six years in his service; he has no partner, nor any other Christian name; the goods were never delivered to the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a tobacconist, and live at the corner of St. Martin's-court, Leicester-square. On the 3d of December Mr. Foster came to me and brought me a 5l. Bath and Bristol note: I looked at it, gave it to him back, and went with him to St. Martin's-court; I assumed to be master of the shop; the prisoner was outside the door, but was called in by the boy; he walked into the shop; Foster asked me for change; I said "I do not know - will you let me look at it?" he gave it me; I said I had no doubt it was a bad note, and was sorry if the prisoner had taken it in trade, for he certainly had got a bad note, he said he was sorry for it too, but he came by it in a regular way, and could give a proper account of it. I said I was sure it was bad, and he must give an account of it; he said he could. I said he must go before a Magistrate to give an account of it; he said, very well; he would very willingly; I said "You must stop to do so before you can leave us;" he said he could give a proper account of it, and it was unpleasant for a respectable man to be shut up. I handed the note to Groom, who was at the door, and said "Stay with this gentleman while I call somebody, who will give us some further account of the note." I called on a Mr. Cools, who said, in the prisoner's presence, that a friend of his had taken one of the same kind. I do not remember that the prisoner answered; Cools said to Groom, "Are you a constable?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120020"></xptr>you must take this man into custody;" which he did, and searched him in my presence, and found a five guinea Pontefract note in his pocket. He was taken to St. Martin's watch-house. I marked the 5l. Bath and Bristol note(looking at it); this is the note I marked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you returned with Foster the prisoner was walking before the door? A. He was outside the door. I understood, but I did not see him - he was not in the shop when I went in - he was called and came in; he said he was perfectly ready to go before the Magistrate and give every information.</p>

            . I am a constable, of St. Martin's-court; I took the prisoner into custody at Mr. Haskins's shop, and found a five guinea Pontefract note on him; I asked who he was - he said he had put his address at the back of the note; I looked at the back, and he pointed to it; I saw"Mr. Martin, 11, Dean-street, Soho," on it - this is it. I asked him if that was correct; he said Yes; I said I must go with him to see whether it was correct. I just took him out to the door, and he said it was no go; I said "Then I must take you to the watch-house;" he said "Very well;" he said "If you go up to Dean-street, it is of no use, for I don't live there." I took him to the watch-house; he asked me if I would go to a public-house, and let him write a note and send a person with it; and said I should have five sovereigns to let him go. Foster marked the Bath and Bristol note which I kept - I marked it also.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he say he had lived in Dean-street, but not now? A. He did not. When I asked his address, he said that was his address on the note, and that it was correct.</p>

            . (Through B. BARNETT, an interpreter.) I live at No. 42, Berner's-street, Oxford-street, and let ledgings. On a Saturday morning, nearly two months ago, the prisoner came to my house, and asked to see the lodgings; I conducted him to the second floor; he was pleased with them, but as I do not speak much English, very little conversation passed; he said he took them for a gentleman from Bristol - that they were to be got ready by Monday evening, at nine o'clock, and ordered two very large fires in both rooms. I asked him to go down into the parlour to ask for a deposit - we went down - he gave me a 5l. note to get change - I read "Bath and Bristol" on the note, and gave it to Mary Barry, the servant - she went and brought the change back; I gave it all to the prisoner, and he returned me a sovereign; nobody came to the lodging on Monday - I have not seen the prisoner since, till to-day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was he with you? A. Ten or fifteen minutes; I did not know him before - I recollect him agian, and cannot be mistaken in him.</p>

            . I am servant to Madame Chelon. I understand French very well. I remember the prisoner coming on a Saturday, between twelve and one o'clock - I do not know the month - it was about two months ago - mistress let him in - I saw him on the stairs - they went into the second floor room; I did not attend to their conversation; mistress called me down, and spoke to me at the bottom of the stairs - I then went into the parlour - the prisoner was there - he handed a note to mistress - she read it, and handed it to me to get change;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120021"></xptr>I took it to Mr. Wilcox, who keeps a pork-shop at the corner of Charlotte-court, Goodge-street; I saw the servant and Mr. Wilcox - I handed the note to him- he gave me five sovereigns, and asked mistress's name; he only wrote the direction, "No. 42, Berners-street," on it; I brought the five sovereigns, and gave them to the prisoner - he gave mistress a sovereign, and said the gentleman was to come on Monday evening, at nine o'clock, and ordered two fires and candles to be ready - he said he was to meet the gentleman and dine with him on Monday - he went away.</p>

               <p>GEORGE SAMS. I am a stationer, and live in Little Queen-street, Holborn; I also get notes engraved. On Tuesday, the 8th of November, the prisoner came to my house, and ordered me to engrave a promissory note of the Bath and Bristol bank; he gave me directions what it was to contain, and ordered five hundred impressions; I saw him again on the following Saturday, the 12th - they were not ready - he called again in the evening - they were not quite finished - he took four or five, to shew some friends - he came again on Monday, the 14th - they were all ready then, and I delivered him the 500; I kept the plate, - this is it (looking at it); it was engraved according to his directions; the notes produced (examining them) are impressed from this plate, and are those I delivered to him, except the filling up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you acquainted with his person before? A. No; he asked me if I could engrave a note for a new firm; I had not the least suspicion of him, and did it without further inquiry. I communicated with Sir Benjamin Hobhouse's bank on the day I delivered him the notes.</p>

            , of the Bath bank. I have been there more than seven years, and am acquainted with the banking houses in Bath and Bristol; there are now two other banks at Bath - Clement. Tugwell, and Co. and Tuffnell and Co. - in November last there were two others, Cavenor and Co., and Morgan and Co.; I know some of the Bristol bankers - I never heard of the firm of Hobhouse, Wright, and Hunter, as a Bath and Bristol bank; Sir B. Hobhouse draws on Jones, Lloyd and Co. I do not know of any bank using such notes as these - they are not Sir B. Hobhouse's notes - they are drawn on Barnard, Savery and Co. I know of no Martin Hobhouse and Co. I have made inquiry of the bankers at Bath.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What names did you put on your notes? A. Hobhouse, Fillott, Fillott, and Lowther.</p>
               <p>Q. No person, in looking at this note, could take it for one of yours? A. I should think persons might be deceived in it - our notes have no Christian names on them, nor Sir Benjamin's title - they are never signed Hobhouse - I have made no particular inquiry at Bristol. I believe any body may set up a bank if they have a license.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Do not Bristol notes commonly pass through your hands? A. They are as common to us as Bath notes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a coachman to Mr. Galloway, who keeps a house in <placeName id="t17971206-41-crimeloc226">Gower-street, Bedford-square</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17971206-41-crimeloc226" type="placeName" value="Gower-street, Bedford-square"></interp>

               <p>Q. When you left the house at nine o'clock, it was quite dark, I suppose? - A. Yes, it was; I lost the things named in the indictment, (repeating them); the box-coat I have had ever since I have been with my master, which is not quite a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any bargain with your master, that you were to be answerable for them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The coat, waistcoat and breeches, had you had them a year? - A. Yes, nearly; all the rest belonged to me; the other things were all kept there ready to put on when I was going out; I never recovered any thing but one shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to be taken up? - A.I was coming down from my master's house, three weeks and three days after, I heard, in Cheyne-row, a cry of stop thief, and I ran down to the stable as fast as I could go; after I had got my stable-door open, I heard them run past the stable-door, just as I was trying to undo it; when I got it undone, they had stopped him, and were bringing him back again; when he was searched at the watch-house, he had got a shirt of mine upon his back; I said, before he was searched, I thought it was mine; I went up to Marlborough-street, and there I took notice of it; the constable has got it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You say it was three weeks after the time she burglary was committed, that the prisoner was apprehended? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you apprehended him, nothing was found upon him but this shirt, which you suppose was your's? - A. No; he was not searched till the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course, he might have got rid of it before the next day? - A. He might, no doubt.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060057"></xptr>Q. But he continued with this shirt on his back till he went to the Public office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing broke, except the box? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not make the stable fast when you went away? - A. Yes, as fast as I could make it.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you venture to swear that? - A. I will.</p>
               <p>Q. And you thought you left it fast? - A. I know I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body left in the stable after you went out? - A.Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Galloway lives in Gower-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This stable is at the end of a garden? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you upon board wages? - A. No, I board in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he rent that stable? - A. No; it is his own.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not given it to you for you and your family to live in? - A.No; I have no family.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, after a certain length of time, the livery would have become your own? - A. Yes; if I had lived there a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it made for you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in his service? - A. Better than three quarters of a year, not quite a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any communication from the house to the stable, or do you go into the street? - A.There is a communication through the garden to the stables by one wall.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SAVIOUR sworn. - I am servant to Barrington Bergen, Esq. On Sunday night, the 12th of November, I was going out, being a very foggy night, I took a lanthorn; going down the Mews, just as I got to the stable-door, there was the prisoner and two other men standing against my stable-door.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that near Mr. Galloway's? - A. I believe it is half a surlong from Mr. Galloway's; it is a street that runs across the Mews; I called out to know who they were, and what they were, but they did not answer me; I suspected they were thieves, and I went up to the next stable-door, and called the coachman; he got up, I told him, there were three thieves; I said, there goes two; he ran after them, I went after the prisoner at the bar; he was going down the Mews, I pursued him, and he was taken; I gave charge of the prisoner to the watchman; the next morning, I went with Brazier to see the prisoner; he said, he thought he knew the shirt that was upon the prisoner's back; I saw the shirt taken from him, and Brazier said it was his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You do not mean to swear that the prisoner at the bar was one of the three men? - A. Yes, I do; I held up my lanthorn to his face, and spoke to him; and he then ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. The man was standing quietly, doing nothing, and you had the impudence to hold your candle and lanthorn to his face, and because he ran away, having done nothing to you, you charged the watch with him? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>VALENTINE ROMLEY sworn. - I am watch-house-keeper of Sr. Giles's: On the 12th of last month, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house; Brazier and Saviour came to the watch-house the next morning to see the prisoner at the bar; Brazier touched the frill of his shirt, and said, I think that is my shirt on your back; then I said to the prisoner, strip; he pulled off his coat and waistcoat, and I assisted in taking the shirt off his back, (produces it); I have kept it ever since; the prosecutor said the shirt was marked, and described the marks with the two first letters of his name; and when he looked at it, he said it was his.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You know a little about forty pounds reward, if you hang this man? - A. If I hear a cry of stop thief, I have a right to stop the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Egremont-place, New-road. I have a house at No. 1, Stanhope-street, Hampstead-road—on Saturday, the 7th of May, I went there, and found part of a sheet of lead cut away, and the flushing and all taken away—about I cut. was gone—I went there again on the Monday, and as I was going down the street, I saw the prisoner at a door, talking to two women—he left, and went down Robert-street—I went to the house, and asked where the thief was—the women said, if I had been there a minute sooner, I should have seen him, he had gone down Robert-street—I went and tapped him on the shoulder, and told him to walk back with me, which he did, and I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Henry-street, at the back of No.1, Stanhope-street. On Saturday, the 7th of May, I was sitting at dinner in my room, and saw two men on the roof of No. 3, which joins to No. 1, Stanhope-street—I then saw them go to No.1—I kept my eye on them, and saw them doing something, similar to what plumbers do, when they cut lead—in the course of a quarter of an hour—I saw the prisoner, who was one of the men, come to the party wall—the other man gave him some<lb></lb>thing over, which I could see saw lead, and he folded it up into a compass</p>

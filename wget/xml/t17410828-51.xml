They told me they sold no liquor but cherry brandy, so I had some small beer an d some brandy, and I pull'd out my purse to pay for it, and they saw what money I had. This was in the kitchen, and there was a girl frying some beef steaks at the same time. After I had paid for my liquor, I fell asleep, and when I 'wak'd I miss'd my money; and then Simon Lewis the Prisoner's husband came in swearing at me, and bid me get out of his house. Upon this I went to a house about half a mile off, and they advis'd me to go to Mr. Rondeau the constable; accordingly I did, and we went to take up the girl that was frying the steaks, but

             lock'd the door upon us, and 2 lusty fellows beat us, and gave us black eyes and knock'd us up and down the house, so that the constable was forc'd to run away and leave his hat behind him for fear of being murder'd. One of the men ran after me, and swore if he caught me, he would kill me; but he fell over head and ears into a ditch full of water, and so I saved my life. The next morning we got more assistance and went to the house and took them all, and the Justice bound them over, but we gave some people money to look after them, and they made them drunk and got away.</p>

Afterwards he desir'd to lye down on a bed in the kitchen; he did so and the string of his purse hung out of his pocket. I was frying a pan of meat, and saw

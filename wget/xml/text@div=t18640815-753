                  </hi>. I am barman at the Carpenters' Arms, Kingsland-road—at the latter end of June, about half-past 9 in the evening, I served the prisoner with half a quartern of gin, which came to twopence farthing—she gave me a king's shilling—I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 33/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I had cleared the till a few minutes before she came in, leaving in it three king's shillings and three sixpences—she then asked for two sixpences for a shilling and gave me a Victoria shilling—I gave her two sixpences and dropped the shilling in the till—shortly afterwards I went to the till and saw that it was counterfeit—I had put no other shilling in in the meantime, and no other person had been to the till; I was present all the time—I marked it and laid it on one side—on 12th July, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came again; I recognised her instantly—she asked for a pint of half-and-half which came to twopence, and gave me a Queen's shilling, which was bad—I told her she had been there previously and passed another—she said that was a mistake—I gave her in charge with both shillings, which I marked.</p>

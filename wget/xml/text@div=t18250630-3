On the 28th of May I went to bed about eleven o'clock; I got up about eight o'clock in the morning, and found the house fastened up as I had left it - this property was gone. I had heard the latch of the back door fall down just before we went to bed; it had been left ajar, as the latch sticks; I went down stairs, and heard footsteps crossing the yard; the door was just put too. I then took a sheet in, which hung in the yard - I bolted the door, and it was still bolted in the morning, but I missed the same sheet that I had brought in from the yard. There was a square of glass broken in the kitchen before - a hand could be put through that, and the hasp unfastened, but if it had been opened it was fastened again. On Monday evening, the 30th, I was sent for, and found the prisoner Thompson talking to a boy named Rayment; I charged Thompson with this robbery, and said if he would give me my things I would not hurt him. Rayment took me to Summers's house, in Peel-ally, Shadwell; I found the shirt on Summers's back, and the sheet and stockings in his house; the stockings were rolled up in a cap belonging to a boy, called the Grecian, and put under Summers's bed; my sheet was cut in several pieces - I knew it by my sewing upon it; it was a coarse brown one; it was cut up to be made into two pairs of trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Summers say? A. Thompson went there with me, and told Summers he wanted those things that the Grecian had brought on the Saturday night; Summers asked where the Grecian was; he said he did not know: Summers said,</p>
               <p>"What does this woman want?" I said I wanted my things; he said to the lad,</p>
               <p>"Go out of the way a bit, and I will settle it with the woman; I said,</p>
               <p>"I wont go till I have got my things; where are they? have you pawned or sold them?" he told the boy to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300005"></xptr>out of the way again; he said I would not let him: Thompson then said,</p>
               <p>"I believe, if I must speak the truth, he has the shirt now on;" I then looked, and said it was the shirt; he took it off, and gave it to Bolton, the headborough. Rayment turned the bed up, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here are the stockings in the Grecian's cap." I had seen Thompson and the Grecian lurking about my house till half-past ten o'clock that night; and as soon as my husband came up stairs I heard the latch fall.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Myddleton-street, Clerkenwell. The prisoner is my brother-in-law—he came to my house on Friday night, the 3rd of of July, about six o'clock—he asked me for some title deeds, which I had for security—he said he wanted them—they were the leases of some pro<lb></lb>perty, at Bermondsey—I said it was no use making words about them; I could not let him have them till I saw myself righted for the two bills</p>

               <p>that I was liable for—he rose up and said, "Then you are dead man—he had a great coat on his arm, he unfolded it, and took out a blunder<lb></lb>buss—I saw him take it from the coat—he could not get it out readily—there was some little difficulty—he held it with both his hands—he was on the opposite side of the room to where I was—the muzzle of the blunderbuss was towards the side of the room where I was, but it was not pointed at me—it was not up at his shoulder—it was as low at a person could hold it—a person who was near him seized him by the two arms, and I rose from my chair, seized him by the collar, and threw him down on the sofa—he was secured—the blunderbuss was never pointed towards me—whatever the prisoner's intention was, it was prevented by Haslehurst laying hold of him—I cannot say whether the blunderbuss was thrown down or not—Mrs. Evans took it, but whether from the prisoner's hand or not I cannot say—this is the blunderbuss—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I did not see it unloaded—as soon as the inspector took it be found there was no flint—I looked about, and found the flint between the lining in the inside of the great coat—it is a ragged flint—when I had bold of the prisoner on the sofa he said, "Don't tend me to prison."</p>

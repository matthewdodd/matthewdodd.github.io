                  </hi>. I am a chimney-sweeper, and live in White's-alley, Chancery-lane. About six o'clock in the evening of the 22nd of March, I was in Chancery-lane, and saw the prisoner in company with another woman—the prisoner was carrying a little boy, and as he passed me he cried very much, and said, "I want to go home to my mother"—I passed on about thirty yards, turned back, and stopped her in Cursitor-street—I said, "Do you know that child?" she said, "Yes"—I said, "Is it yours?" she said, "No, but I know its mother"—she dropped the child, and dropped a boot at the same time—the child said, "Give me my pina<lb></lb>fore"—I asked her if she had got the pinafore—she said no, its mother had got it—I asked her several times—she said the mother had got it—the child turned round and said, "No, you have got it in your pocket"—I gave her in charge, and the pinafore was found on her.</p>

On the 17th of March, about six o'clock in the evening, I locked up the door - the nails were then in a bag; there were about two hundred weight. I returned about six o'clock the next morning, and found the watchman enquiring if we had lost any nails; a ladder was up against the building. I went into the chapel, and found half the nails on the ground. I put them into the bag again, weighed them, and found a deficiency of 14 lbs. The prisoner had no employment there.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The chapel is near my beat. About two o'clock in the morning of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120033"></xptr>17th of March, I saw the prisoner go past my box alone, he had a bundle under his arm - I did not stop him. He came by about three o'clock without anything. About ten minutes after four he came past again, I then asked him what he had got there? he said some nails. I asked him where he got them from? he said from his master. I said he should go the watch-house before he went to his work. I went to the chapel, and asked for the foreman; he went to the watch-house and owned the nails. I weighed them - there were 22 lbs.</p>

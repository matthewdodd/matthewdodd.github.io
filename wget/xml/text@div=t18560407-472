                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames police inspector</hi>). On 22nd Feb., about 1 o'clock in the morning, I was in a police galley on the river Thames, and while off Horselydown saw a boat, in which Matthews, Massey, and Coving<lb></lb>ton ware—I saw them go ashore at George's-stairs, Horsleydown, and Massey carried a potato sack on his back, a three or four bushel sack—Massey lifted the bag on to Covington's back—I then rowed ashore, and followed all three into No. 1, Queen-street, Horselydown—Matthews was behind, and I asked him what those bags contained—he said they contained guano, "and if you go to Mr. Pillow you will find it is all right"—I then knocked at Bailey's door—Mrs. Bailey came, and I asked her if Mr. Bailey was in—she said that he was not—I did not see the bags in the house—I had seen two go in—after I spoke to Massey, Covington came up and spoke to him, and they all went away—I went away, and returned in about three quarters of an hour, knocked at the door, and Bailey came—I said "I want to speak to you, Bailey; you have got two bags of guano"—he said, "They are in the yard"—I said, "Will you let me look at the bags?"—he said, "I do not know whether it will be right; they are sweepings of three barges"—I said, "Can you tell me the barges'names?"—he said, "I do not know"—I said, "Can you tell me the veasel's names that they have gone away in?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Can you tell me who are the consignees for the guano?"—he hesitated and said, "Antony Gibbs I should not like you to go there, because it would give unnecessary trouble"—I left a constable to watch the premises, and proceeded to Antony Gibbs—I then went to Pillow's office, and found Bailey there (I had been there before)—I told him that I had been to Antony Gibbs—he said, "I think you have gone a very wrong way to work about it"—I then left Bailey and proceeded back again in half an hour to Pillow's office, and found Bailey there a second time—I told him that he must consider himself in custody on suspicion of stealing and concealing a quantity of guano—I then said to Pillow, "Where is your <hi rend="italic">prentice</hi>?" meaning Matthews—Bailey said that he was on Fenning's wharf—I walked down with Bailey and saw the apprentice in a barge alongside Fenning's-wharf—I followed him ashore, and told him he must consider himself in my custody on suspicion of stealing a quantity of guano—he said nothing—I took him into custody, and afterwards took him to Bailey's house—I rowed him down in the galley to George's-stairs with Bailey—I left Matthews in the police galley in charge of a constable, and I and Bailey walked up to Bailey's house—Bailey knocked at the door, and he and I and the constable who I had left in charge of the premises, went into his house, and he said, "There are the two bags," pointing to two bags out of the kitchen window—I said, "Have you got any more guano?"—he made noreply—I looked through a broken window of the washhouse and saw five bags uncovered, which held about two bushels, or two and a half—I said to</p>

               <p>Bailey, "You have got some more guano; how do you account for these?"—he said, "They are sweepings of six or seven months' accumulation, and they are my perquisites"—I said, "I shall have to take those as well as the others"—he said, "I do not think you are justified in doing so"—I then conveyed Matthews and Bailey to the station, and left a constable in charge of the house—I came back and found twenty-six bags in the wash-house and two tubs, containing together about one and a half cwt.—twenty-one of the bags were covered with a tarpaulin—the gross weight of all I found is twenty-eight cwt, or it may be a little more—I afterwards took Coving<lb></lb>ton into custody—he said that he had only done as his foreman had told him, and he thought he was a very foolish man to have anything to do with the guano—Massey came to the station on the morning of the 23rd, and I took him—an analyzing chemist has samples of the guano.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employ of Antony Gibbs and Co., they are agents to the Peruvian Government, and are the sole importers of guano—it comes over in bulk, and goes to the West India Docks, and is packed in bags—it is then ready to be sent out to the various persons who pur<lb></lb>chase it—it is delivered to the West India Dock Company for Messrs. Gibbs, and warehoused by the Company—Messrs. Pillow are the lightermen em<lb></lb>ployed—I do not know the prisoners personally—I do not know Bailey at all—the Dock Company are furnished with bags—I do not know whether the lightermen are furnished with bags to put in any refuse or anything that may come out.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been in the employment of Mr. Gibbs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the commencement of December last—I have had three or four months' experience—there are persons who have been in the employ for years—Mr. Gibbs is not here—what I call ordinary sweepings is what escapes from the natural interstices of the bags—there are instances of the bags breaking even in my short experience, and some portion of the good guano escaping—I have not got one of the bags here, and have not the means of showing the jury the nature of the covering which we put over the guano—they were produced before the Magistrate—the defence then was that these were sweepings, and that Mr. Bailey was justified in receiving them. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">stated that a bag had been sent for</hi>). I have not got any samples of the guano—it is supposed to come from an island off the coast of Peru—I cannot say how much of what is called guano, that is to say, the excrement of a bird, coming from an island in the neighbourhood of Peru, gets to the docks—we only trace it from the loading—we take it from time to time and then discharge it—I should say 20,000 tons a month are landed in the docks—it all comes to us—there are no private dealers except the Peruvian Government—I value the 30 cwt. found at 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deducting 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton for dirt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman in an extensive way of business I employ a great many men, and have a great many barges—the prisoners were in my employ in Feb. last, and have been employed to take guano from the docks ever since the commencement of our engagement with Messrs. Gibbs about four years ago—they had no authority to my knowledge to take away any sweepings left in the barges—we were always glad to get rid of it, because it was very much in our way—if there were any sweepings left we were glad to get them overboard or anywhere else; we could not load rice, sugar, or other goods of that description in barges, which had just contained guano, we were glad to get rid of it and wash out the barges—the only way I know in which we got rid of sweepings was throwing them over<lb></lb>board—we have had sweepings brought ashore when there was a larger quantity than usual, we have waterside premises, and it has been put there, and there it is now—there may be half a ton or more of it, we have never taken any account of it, we have simply put it ashore to get it out of the way—it has been accumulating three or four years—I have not examined it—I think I know pretty well what guano is, the half ton is principally guano, and not dirt—our barges are kept very clean, and the escape through the bags would be genuine guano—the escape is, a bag bursting, or if it is thrown down the dust will come out and surround you in a moment—if there is a break in the bag by accident or design the dust will come out too—if there is a break, it is the lighterman's duty to make the bag as perfect as he can, and put it in again—if there was such a quantity out that he could not get it into the beg, it would be his duty to take care of it, and if there was an oppor<lb></lb>tunity of putting it ashore at the docks, to do so; but I do not know that it was ever done—we never had any instructions—as a respectable lighterman, I should not sanction my man appropriating it to his own use.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever given any general order, that in no ease were the men to apply to their own use anything that accidentally came out of the bags? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We did not allow that they should appropriate any sweepings to themselves—if there was any amount we should expect it to be returned to us—sweepings, when barges are cleaned out, would be very naturally thrown overboard—we should not allow them to put it into something for their own use—we never gave instructions to our apprentices or the others, that if there was anything that they felt rather disposed to put into a bag than to throw overboard, that it would be stealing; it did not come into our minds to do so—we never gave any particular instructions about guano sweepings, we always considered it much in our way, and were glad to get rid of it; but there would be an objection if it went away by their putting it into bags for themselves; we should not tolerate such a thing; but we did not suspect that such practices were carried on—I have never heard the question raised—I have never heard Mr. Rueker's protestation against it, not to us, and never heard the question raised at the Thames Police Office, on all these points; never before this time—I have been four years in Messrs. Gibbs' employ, and do the whole of the lightering for that firm—they of course sell to other parties, who may have their own lightermen, but for their account we have the sole business in our hands; we have all the guano orders that they have to execute for parties on their own account—no other guano comes up into the river that I know of than Messrs. Gibbs, nor I think to Liverpool or other places; they are the sole parties—I believe there is none besides that brought by the Peruvian Government—there is a spurious article manufac<lb></lb>tured, which passes off for guano—there used to be another quality besides Peruvian, but I have not heard of any lately; it came from Macapoo; it is a very inferior article.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a professor of chemistry, and am acquainted with the properties and nature of guano—twenty-eight samples have been submitted to me by Mr. Evans—(<hi rend="italic">the samples delivered to the witness were here pointed out by Superintendent Evans</hi>)—I have examined these samples from the two bags, they are marked respectively "Covington" and "Mat<lb></lb>thews," these are both above the average quality; the average quantity of ammonia generally found in Peruvian guano, is 16, and this contained 16: 4: 4, and this marked "Covington" 16: 9: 4—I examined every one of these samples marked from 1 to 21 consecutively—I took a sample out of each bag and analysed the mixed sample, the average was 14 decimal 3-6 of ammonia—the result of my examination of the twenty-one is, that there is an amount of good guano, with some trifling amount of sweepings—I saw evidence of that in the existence of some fluffy matter which ought not to be in the genuine article—it is 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton—I should not deduct more than 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton for depreciation in value, a depredation of less than one eleventh.</p>

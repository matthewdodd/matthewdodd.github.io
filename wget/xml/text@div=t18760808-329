I am the wife of Thomas Foy, and live at 46, Payne Street, Islington—on Saturday, 10th June, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, I was trying to detain some lodger's goods that were being removed—the prisoner came from his own door across to my door to help the person to take away her goods—his wife was with him—my husband told him to mind his own business, and not interfere with him, and the prisoner asked him out to fight; they did not fight that night—on Sunday morning I</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mrs. Foy was not at all angry on this morning, no more so than Mr. Cole; she did not abuse him or use bad language, she was speaking quietly, like a decent, respectable woman—when Cole was down I saw her raise her foot and stamp, I did not see her kick him—we have talked this matter over since—she told me that she stamped her foot and called him a brute—I said before the Magistrate that I saw her make a kick—I did not go to sign my deposition, as my husband had given me a black eye, and I could not go—no one but Mrs. Foy helped Foy up—lam sure of that—Mr. Shellard helped Cole up.</p>

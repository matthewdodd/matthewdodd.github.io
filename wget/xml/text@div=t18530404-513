                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jeremiah Smith, of No, 4, Apple-yard, Seward-street, Goswell-street; he works at an iron foundry. The prisoner lived in the same house that I did six months—a man used to live with her until Saturday, 5th March; they lived as man and wife, but I am certain he was not her husband—when she first came her habits were very sober and quiet; afterwards, she slowly took to drinking, and followed it up very strongly—for about ten days prior to this matter she had been getting intoxicated almost every day—that was after the man had left her; she was getting tipsy when he left her, but she got worse afterwards—on Friday mowing, 11th March, a knock came to my door; I opened it, and saw the prisoner standing before me with her child in her arms—it was about half past 10 o'clock—she did not speak—the child's face was very dirty; it seemed as if it had been rubbing its hands over its face—J have heard the prisoner say it is fourteen months old—finding she did not speak, I looked at the child and saw blood on its neck, and then I looked and saw a wound on its throat—I said, "Whatever have you done? you have cut your child's throat!"—she did not answer me—I took the child into my own room, and locked the door—the prisoner got hold of the handle of the door, shook it very much, and</p>

               <p>said, "Give me my child! give me my child!"—in a minute or two I went to the door with the child in my arms, called the neighbours in, and at that moment a policeman came up, and I told him the prisoner had cut the child's throat—she was still in the passage—I gave the child up to some one else—I heard the prisoner say at the station house that she intended to destroy herself and the child too—she was drunk.</p>

I was called, went to the house, and found the prisoner in the passage, and the child in Mrs. Smith's arms—Mrs. Smith exclaimed, "Take her away, she has cut her child's throat!"—I examined the child's neck, and saw a wound about an inch long, fresh done, and there was blood on the neck—I asked her what she did it with; she said with a knife, and that she had done it through distress and want, as her husband had left her—she said that she also attempted to cut her own throat—I afterwards went to her room with another constable, and found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was blood in one corner of the room on the floor.</p>

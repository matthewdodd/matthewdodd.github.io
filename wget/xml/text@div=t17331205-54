            . I am Keeper of Sir Jeremiah Sambrooke's Park, where Deer have been kept for 4 Years past. On the 13th of June in the Morning, as I was walking in the Park, I found a Brace of Deer kill'd, and miss'd a Leash, 2 white fallow Deer, and 1 red tame Deer; I went to the Park-pales, and found 2 of them broken down; I took Joseph Burgess on Suspicion.</p>

            . I fell into the Prisoner's Company the first Day that I went into the Country - It was at the Two Brewers at Winchmore-hill, where I call'd for half a Pint of Two-penny, and having drank it, was going away, when the Prisoner and one Hill came to the Door with a Brace of Greyhounds, and a Bob-tail Dog. Says I, These Dogs look as if they would run well; and upon saying so, the Prisoner drank to me - We had 3 Pots together, they paid for 2, and I for 1. Then the Prisoner, who had 3 Horse in the Yard, mounted, and rid off; and Hill told me, if I had a Mind to see the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050041"></xptr> Dogs run, I might, in a little Time, and not far off. I said, if I could see it in half an Hour, I should be very willing; I went with him; we came up with the Prisoner, and passing by an Alehouse, says I, Let's have a Pot here. No, says the Prisoner, that's a House the Keepers use. This gave me the first Suspicion of their being upon an ill Design. We pass'd a great white Gate that look'd like a Coach-way, and 10 or 12 Yards beyond, I saw the Park-pales. I hope, says I, you are not going in here, for I never was in any such Affair in my Life, and would not be concern'd for 100l. But I could not tell what to do, for it was dark, and I was a Stranger, and did not know my Way back. The Prisoner took 2 Slips [made 2 Nooses] to fasten the 2 Greyhounds, and bidding me hold 'em, he jump'd over the Pales, and he within and Hill without, broke 2 of 'em down, and they both went into the Park, and the Dogs run after, for I was not able to hold 'em. They came back in 2 Hours, and brought out 2 Deer; I was a white fallow Deer, and the other a red. Hill went in again, and the Prisoner desir'd me to help load 'em; he cut their Heads off, and we put the Bodies into Sacks, and so ty'd them upon the Horse; but my Heart ached all the while. I thought they were very tedious about every thing they did, and wonder'd they made no more haste - The Prisoner said, he knew by the Bite which Dog it was that kill'd the Deer - At last Hill came out again with a live Pawn in his Arms, and we went away together - I ask'd them the Way to Edmonton; they directed me, and so we parted, and I never got the Value of a Farthing from them. I went to Work next Day at Winchmore-hill, but I was so uneasy, that I could hardly eat or drink, or sleep for a Fortnight afterward - I have been threaten'd to be shot if I appear'd as an Evidence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were the Dogs mine?</p>
               <p>Burgess. I thought so - you call'd them by their Names; and on the 6th of Feb. the Friday before I was taken, I saw you with the same Dogs, and 2 Deer before you, going to London.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Colour were the Dogs?</p>
               <p>Burgess. Liver-colour and White, and the Bob-tail Dog was red.</p>

I took him from his House, and held him by the Wrist while another took 2 Pistols out of his Pocket. But - Turner, one of the Prisoner's Accomplices, came and rescu'd him from us, and he got as far as Dowgate, where he shot a Man; but as soon as the Prisoner got from us, we secur'd Turner*, and he is now in Newgate.</p>

            . I saw Mr. Burley knock the Prisoner off his Horse, in Buckler's-bury, and another took hold of his Arms thus - and took 2 Pistols out of his Pocket - but he, some how, got loose again, and pull'd out a long Knife at Burley, and Burley struck at his Legs, but he made off, and ran down by the Tower-royal to Dowgate; the Mob follow'd, and call'd, Stop Highwayman! Stop Thief! and then he shot the Deceas'd.</p>
               <p>Court. Why?</p>
               <p>Shuttleworth. Because the Deceas'd went to take him; but, in my Opinion, he did not die of that Wound - for his Skull was cut by his falling with his Head upon the Stones.</p>
               <p>Court. How came he to fall?</p>
               <p>Shuttleworth. By being shot.</p>
               <p>Court. Sir, do you banter the Court?</p>

            . The Prisoner was taken in Buckler's-bury, but getting off again, he turn'd down Size-lane to the Tower-royal, so to College-hill, and thro' Joiner's-alley to the Water-side; the Mob follow'd, and cry'd, Highwayman! the Prisoner turn'd about, and said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050043"></xptr> he was no Highwayman.

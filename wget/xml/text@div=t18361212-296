                  </hi>. I am a Greenwich pensioner. On the 7th of Sep<lb></lb>tember I got some money from my brother in London—I went down by the coach, and met my friend Morrison—we went to the Coach and Horses in Turpin-lane, and had a pot of beer, and on sitting down a little while, the prisoner came to Morrison and asked him for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said "I have not got it"—I said, "What is the matter?"—he said, "She says she is very hungry, and asked for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I went out, and got her some dinner, which cost me 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on the way she said she had a gown and shawl in pawn—I took it out for her—it came to between 4 and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this was out of pity and humanity—I then returned, and went to the bar and changed a half-sovereign, came and sat down, and just hung my head back—I felt in my pocket, to have a smoke, and my pouch was gone—I jumped up, and Morrison was coming in—I said, "You have got my</p>

               <p>pouch, have you not?"—he said, "I have not"—"Then," says I, "she has got it"—I gave information, and never saw her again till six o'clock the next morning—I cannot say I was drunk—I knew what I was about—I had a sovereign, two half-crowns, and a sixpence in my pouch.</p>

I am a Greenwich pensioner, I met Jones about five minutes after three o'clock, he asked me to go and have a pot of beer—we went and sat down at the Coach and Horses, and had a pot of beer—we talked about different parts of India—the prisoner stepped up and said, "I was brought up in India"—we got into conversation—I got up to light my pipe—she came and says, "Will you lend me a penny, I have not had any thing to eat or drink to-day?"—I said I had not got one—Jones said she should have something to eat—she sat down by him—he got up and went out, and they were gone twenty minutes or half an hour—when they came back he came in and said, "I know you will want some money before the night is out"—he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and said, "Pay me when you can"—we sat down and had a pot of porter—we sat twenty mi<lb></lb>nutes or half an hour—I said "I am going out"—I saw the prisoner put her right arm round his neck and her left hand into his pocket, but I had not the least suspicion of her robbing him, after his being so kind to feed and clothe her—I staid two or three minutes in the yard, and saw the prisoner coming out—she said, "I shall be back again directly"—I went in, and Jones said, "You have got my pouch"—I said, "I have not, have you lost it"—he said, "I have, with 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it?"—I went and locked after her, but could not find her till the next morning.</p>

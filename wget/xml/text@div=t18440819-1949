                  </hi>. I am going on for fifteen years of age, and live with my mother at No. 4, King's Arms-yard, Smart's-buildings. On the night in question I went with my sister to see Mrs. Morris home—I do not know the name of the street—as we were returning home I saw the prisoner and another man—the prisoner laid hold of my sister's arm, and said, "Jane, my dear, where are you going?"—my sister ran away from them across the road—I went with her—we were going home up Holborn—the two men fol<lb></lb>lowed us—when we got to Newton-street we met the two journeymen bakers, whom we knew—my sister asked them if they were going up as far as Drury-lane—they said, "Yes," and walked with us as far as Smart's-buildings—-the two men still kept following us—when we got to Smart's-buildings we bid the bakers good night, and they went away—we turned down Smart's-buildings—the prisoner ran after my sister—I ran away from him—I suppose he thought I was going for a policeman, and he ran after me, and knocked me down, and when I was down he kicked me with his boot in my head—here is the mark—I had not said or done anything to him—my sister came to get him away from me, and he hit her in the mouth—I bled very much indeed—a policeman came up, and picked my sister up—she was lying in the road—I got up myself, and was taken to Bow-street—from there I was sent to the hospital, where I staid six weeks all but three days.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at Charing-cross Hospital when the girl was brought there about one o'clock—I examined her—she had a lacerated wound at the upper part of the forehead, extending to the scalp, and her face was discolored with blood, the result of the wound—it was such a wound as might have been inflicted with a kick from a shoe—the skin was cut—she appeared to have lost about a table-spoonful and a half of blood—I dare say not more—she was six weeks in the hospital—the wound was not quite to the bone—it might have been dangerous—she got well of the wound very soon, but inflammation of the eye coming on, we kept her in for that—that was not the result of the same injury—it was a pustular inflammation, which never occurs as the result of violence, and had no connexion with the injury on the head.</p>

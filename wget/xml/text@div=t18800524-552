I lodge at 25, Oak Village, Kentish Ton; the house is occupied by the prisoner and his wife—on the evening of the May I was at home with his wife when he came home in a Hansom ok after 10 o'clock—we both went and opened the door to him—he asked her to pay the cabman half-a-crown for his fare—she said "she had not got half-a-crown, and asked him to pay the cabman himself—he said he had not got any money—she said "Then let the cabman summons you for it"—he said "How dare you insult me in that manner before the cabman"—she had money at the time, and I took her purse from her, and paid the cabman 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he went away; the prisoner then went down into the kitchen, which is two or three steps from the front door; his wife told him to go there before we paid the cabman; he came back, and I saw him strike at her with a knife—I saw the knife in his hand; it cut her on the cheek; she lost a good deal of blood—I went and fetched a doctor.</p>

I am a surgeon at Highgate—I was called to the rosecutrix about 11 o'clock on the night of 7th May—I found a large wound in her cheek, reaching from the eye to the head of the bone—I dressed it, and did what was necessary, and remained with her for some hours. Such knife as this would be capable of inflicting such a wound; it was a very angerous wound, it went through the cheek into the mouth.</p>

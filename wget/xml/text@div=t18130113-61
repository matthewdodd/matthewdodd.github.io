            . On the 18th of December, about a quarter after six in the evening a man came in my shop and asked for a pennyworth of tobacco, and I not liking the looks of him, I cast my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130039"></xptr>eyes round the shop, I missed a double Gloster cheese. I called my husband, and I told him I had missed a cheese. He considered a minute or two, and went out, saying, he would see if he could find the cheese.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your husband - A. In the back yard. I sent my little girl to him. He came and went out immediately, and in about two minutes my husband brought the prisoner in with the cheese under his arm, tied up in a dirty apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the same person that came for the tobacco in your shop - A. No. My husband charged the watch with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the shop was the cheese laying in - A. It was laying near the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any body take it, did you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your attention was taken with the person you were serving - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the shop door open - A. No, it was latched.</p>

            . My wife called me in, told me that she had lost a cheese. I went out, and went to the corner of the street, where I saw three men standing together, a little distance from the corner. I waited the space of a minute. The prisoner and two others came by me. The prisoner was walking in the middle of the other two. Having got past me I jumped at him, and catched hold of him by the collar. The cheese was in a dirty apron, under his arm. The moment I seized him by the collar he said, he had never seen my shop in his life. I told him, I would soon shew it him. I took him back to my shop with the cheese. This is the cheese. It had my name on it when it was lost. It is there now; R for Roper. I had seen the cheese in my shop about ten minutes before my wife called me into the shop. I am certain that is my property. The cheese cost me ten-pence halfpenny a pound.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought in first to the watchhouse. I searched him; there was nothing about him. I locked him up. I enquired for the cheese; the cheese was brought in by the watchman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down High-street, Marybone, about six in the evening, at a pawnbroker's window, in the corner. I saw the cheese wrapt up in an apron. I instantly picked it up. Two young men saw me pick it up; they said, I picked up a prize. I put it under my arm. Coming by Marybone-lane, Mr. Roper took me in custody. That is all I have to say. I never saw the two young men before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Roper. Was any body in the shop when the man came in for the tobacco, but yourself - A. No.</p>

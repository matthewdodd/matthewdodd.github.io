                  </hi>. I am shopman to James Thomas Hawes, a pawn<lb></lb>broker, in Whitechapel-road. The prisoner came to the shop on the 18th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, and asked if I had a pair of shoes to fit her—I shewed her a pair, which were hanging outside—they fitted, and we agreed about them—she went away, and in about an hour returned and asked if I had a pair of boots to fit her—I showed her three pairs, but they did not suit—she asked if I had any more—I said "No,"—she had not been gone two minutes before I missed a linen shift from the counter—the next morning she came about ten o'clock, and asked if I would change the shoes that she had bought the night before, as they were too tight—I said I had not got any more—I then saw her put some cotton down from the counter and watched her—I went to the end of the shop,</p>

               <p>and saw her utting the cotton up under her cloak—she went out saying, if I would not give her her money back or change the shoes, she must go—she went out—I went out and found this cotton under her cloak—I gave her in charge, and went to her lodging and found the shift.</p>

Yes; I had seen him on the Tuesday in the Christmas week; he came into Brown's house, and Smith asked him to drink out of our pint of beer; he had a sinock frock on; I had a good deal of talk with him; he asked me if that was not Mr. Wigstead's team, I told him it was; I pulled my money out, and said I did not think Mr. Brown had settled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020007"></xptr>right for the hay; he looked at the Bank-note, and gave it me again; I went to Shoreditch-church, and left him in the house; he asked me where I was going with my hay; I told him to London-wall; I went on as far as <placeName id="t18000402-7-crimeloc36">Enfield-park</placeName>

               <p>Q. How far was he from the other man when he knocked you down? - A. A very little way, about as far as I am from you; he pulled my purse out of my pocket; there was a 5l.

                  </hi>. The prisoner is my husband—I live at No. 2, Orchard-street, Kingsland-road. On the 8th of December, I had been with my husband to a public-house in the early part of the morning—I did not leave him there—we came out together, as near as I can tell, about four o'clock in the afternoon—he was then very nearly intoxicated—I then came home—we parted at the top of our street—about six o'clock he came home—I was in the room when he came in—I heard him coming in, and got under the dresser out of his way—we had had a quarrel in the public-house about the money he had earned for his day's work—no blows had passed between us at all in the public-house—it was merely a quarrel by word of mouth—when he came in he pulled off his coat, and I thought he was going to bed, as he used to do, when he is in liquor he generally goes to bed, but he did not go to bed then—when he pulled his coat off he gave me a kick as I was under the dresser—I did not hear him say any thing—I had not heard him speak a word—I had said nothing to him in the house—he kicked me in the eye—he only gave me one kick, as far as I know, but my senses were quite gone, and what more passed I am not able to say—when I came to myself I was outside the door, and all my neighbours round me—I dare say we had been a couple of hours together in the public-house—we were not quarrelling all the time—we had a great many words about the money—I wanted him to give me the money, and he wanted to keep it—we had no quarrel in the street after leaving the public-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Orchard-street, King-street. On the 8th of December I heard a disturbance, and heard Anderson's children screaming murder at the door—I heard Mrs. Anderson say, "For God's sake do not hit me any more, you will kick my eyes out"—that was at the time the children were screaming—I ran over, went into the house, and saw her lying before the fire—I thought she was dead—I heard no sounds besides Mrs. Anderson</p>

               <p>speaking—there was no sound of kicking—I did not hear the sound of blows or kicking till I went in—when I went in I found Mrs. Anderson lying before the fire, and the prisoner sitting on the foot of the bed—Mrs. Anderson seemed insensible—I saw the prisoner kick her once while he was sitting on the bed—he did not get up to do it—he seemed to kick her is the face at that time—I said to him, "For God's sake, Anderson, what are you about, you have killed her"—he said, "It makes no odds to you, go out, and trouble your head about your own business"—that was after he had kicked her—he made his way up towards me, and I ran out directly—I do not know any more that passed—the prisoner had been drinking, but was not so far gone but what he knew what he was about.</p>

               <p>there was a small superficial mark under the right eye, which might be produced by a scratch, or it might be produced by a blow—it was bleeding slightly—I went to see her next morning, and found some marks on her person arising from blows—there were two or three marks on the right breast, and another on the side of the abdomen lower down—I suppose they were all done at the same time as the wound in the eye, from the appear<lb></lb>ance of them—they all had the appearance of being fresh—the bruises might be occasioned by a fall.</p>

            . Did you see the prisoner drop any thing in the passage? - Yes, they dropped a black satin waistcoat, I cannot rightly say who dropped it, I was so frightened, I looked at it on the ground; my daddy first picked up the glass, he fell over it,</p>
               <p>Prisoner Newitt. I was going out of a necessary through Rotten-row, into Old-street-road, and a parcel of men came up to me, and said, I was their prisoner, and I went with them to where the things were lost, but I am as innocent of the robbery as a child just come from his mother's womb.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Davis. My mother lives at the back of Shoreditch Church, I had not been home all that day, because my mother was out, I was coming at the back of Old-street Church, and I heard the cry of stop thief! and some men came out of a public house and laid hold of me, and said I was their prisoner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Newitt called one witness, and Davis three, who gave them good characters.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that bacon to be your property? - I did, it is in court, the police officer has it, and has had it ever since the time that he was committed.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see the half guinea taken from him? - Yes, I did; he was searched in the public house adjoining the office, and half a guinea was taken from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him make any declaration previous to his being searched? - Yes, he said he had nothing but a few halfpence about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the half guinea that was taken from him shewn to Cooke in the presence of parker? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. All the information you gained on this subject was from Cooke? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. He was charged with having stole the bacon? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Cooke throwed it on Parker? - No, first of all he said he had it from Ward.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he said he had it from Parker? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any body lives in this house besides Parker? - Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you concerned in searching the house? - No. I searched Parker at the office, I asked him if he had got the half guinea about him that he had of Cooke for the bacon, the last night? he said he had got none, he had only three halfpence in his pocket; I searched his left hand breeches pocket, and found half a guinea in it, and nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew that half guinea to Cooke in the presence of the prisoner? - Yes, and I asked Cooke what sort of a half guinea it was before I shewed it him; he said it was a strait one; that was all he said. I shewed it him in the presence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300096"></xptr>of Mr. Parker, and he said he believed that to be the half guinea.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You asked Parker whether he had got half a guinea that he received of Cooke? - He said he had none that he had received of any body.</p>

               <p>I am in the tobacco line; I work for Mr. Bailey, in Redcross-street. About a fortnight after Christmas last, I met with Thomas Ward, in Redcross-street, he asked me to buy some bacon that he had; I asked him the price of it? he said, three shillings a stone; which I told him to bring me some of it at night, as it was Saturday night, and I would take some of him, which he brought me as much as came to sixteen shillings, at three shillings a stone; the next day I cut a bit off and put it in the pot to boil, and it was not good, rather damaged, and on Monday morning my wife went to Ward and Parker, to fetch the bacon back; they fetched the bacon back on the Monday night following; they neither of them had the money to return me back; when they took the bacon away they ordered me to come the next night.</p>
               <p>Q. About the 18th of April did you purchase any bacon of either of the prisoners? - On good Friday I purchased some of them. Ward came to me about two o'clock, and told me that this Parker had got some bacon to sell, which I asked him the price of it? and he said about a groat a pound; I told him that I would come up at night to the Two Brewers, Goswell-street; I went there; Ward came up with half an offall of pork, and some pork chops, Ward there got a fighting, and a man cut him over the head with a quart pot, which he went off then; and afterwards Parker came into the public house, and asked me if Ward had told me about the bacon which I said, yes; he asked me if he had told me the price? I told him he talked about a groat a pound for it; Parker made answer and said, it was worth six-pence halfpenny a pound, which I agreed to give him, provided the bacon was good; I gave him half a guinea in part of payment, and he fetched me the bacon, these two pieces; I asked him if he had weighed the bacon? he said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he fetch the bacon to? - Into the street, near the Two Brewers, near his own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appoint to meet you in the street, in order to receive it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing about this half guinea that you should know it again? - I cannot swear to it, it is a very hard thing to swear to money. He told me that he would call on me the next day to weigh the bacon, and I was to pay him the odds at six-pence halfpenny per pound; and I was going home with it, and these gentlemen stopped me with it, Mr. Blackiter and three more that were along with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You was taken up unfortunately for this business at first? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have the good luck to be a witness now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So of course, you save being tried yourself by giving your evidence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The half guinea, you say, you don't know at all? - It is impossible for me to swear to money.</p>
               <p>Q. You dealt in bacon perhaps before? - Yes, at a former time, once</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any Irish bacon before? - I am not a judge of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you attempt to swear to Irish bacon, Mr. Cooke? - I would not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300097"></xptr>Q. You would not believe any body perhaps, if they were to swear to Irish bacon? - Why, no, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you admitted an evidence before the justice? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you come here in custody? - No, I came with the officer.</p>
               <p>Court to Blackiter. Produce these pieces you took from Cooke? - It is these two pieces, a middle piece and a hind piece.</p>
               <p>Ray. I found the fore quarter, they all together make up one stitch.</p>
               <p>Hawkes. These three pieces all belong to one side, and are my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I would ask you whether you did not put a mark on this bacon before the magistrate? - I did, merely to compare the three pieces together, the first, second, and third.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the only judgment that you have about this bacon being your property, is the one that you have described coming over from Waterford, and being your cut? - It is so,</p>
               <p>Q. I will venture this question to you, whether you are not induced to swear to that property from the marks that you made before the magistrate, and not by the marks that you described to the jury before? - I swear to it by the long hocks, all others in Waterford cut the hocks short; there is not a side of bacon long hocks from Waterford but to me.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have you not sold some of this bacon since you have had it, to some shop keeper? - Several of the same sort.</p>
               <p>Q. then how can you take on yourself to swear that the long hocks are your property, and that you had not sold them? - As soon as ever this man was taken in custody the magistrate desired that we would see whether we had lost a side; we goes directly and undoes all the bales of bacon we have, which were one hundred and five bales; I was present, and when we came to count them, after we had undone them all, we found but two hundred and nine and a half side instead of two hundred and ten, and accounting for one hundred and sixteen, which we had sold.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You swear to this bacon by its being a long hock, and by the cut; supposing by chance, in this great town there should be found exactly of the same quality of bacon with a long hock, should you be able to swear to it then? - I can swear to this by the cut and long hock.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen this in the possession of other sellers of bacon you would not have known it to be your's? - I don't know that I should.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak something about the cut, what do you mean by that? - It is a different cut to any other man's in Waterford.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray have you not sold some of this bacon with long hock, and cut in that way? - I have sold one hundred and sixteen.</p>
               <p>Jury. Pray who might you have sold them sides to? - To different cheesemongers, it is not every cheesemonger that knows the Irish from the English, when it is cut in that way.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason of the long hock? - Because people have a preference for London bacon.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any difference in the price? - They will give a penny a stone more for the short hock than for the long hock, because of the weight of bone. These pieces make a whole side, except, I believe, the police officers had a bit to boil with some spinage.</p>
               <p>Ray. It is a mistake, the police officers having the bacon, it was Parker's wife had a piece boiling with some spinage.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Ward, called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Hawkes. Ward has lived with me five years, and I believe him to be a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300098"></xptr>very honest man, but I cannot say so of Parker.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an importer of fancy goods, and live in South Audley-street. The prisoner was in my employ as porter for three weeks—Tuesday morning, the 13th of Feb., he came as usual to the house about half-past seven o'clock, and I saw him go into my office at the back—I came there about eight, he was then gone, and did not return—I went to my office, but not to my desk till twelve o'clock—I then found it broken open, and the cash-box gone—I always kept it in the desk—the prisoner had an opportunity of knowing that—I had been out between the time of my seeing the prisoner and going to my desk—the cash-box contained a great many bills of exchange and promissory notes to the amount of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due and over due, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184403040048"></xptr>
               <p>many valuable papers—I saw the prisoner go twice into the office about half-past seven, and while he was there I heard a great knocking, but thought he was breaking some wood to light the fire, and did not pay any attention to it—I did not see him again till he was in custody next morning about eight, at his own lodging in White Horse-street, Piccadilly.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter.</hi>) I am in Mr. Savin's employ, and live in the house. On the morning of the 13th of Feb. the prisoner came to the house about half-past seven—he went into the back kitchen or officer where Mr. Savin's desk is kept—he took his leather to clean the guard—he left about ten minutes to eight o'clock, and did not return that day—I staid at borne all day—I went to the door after he was gone, and it was open—two young females were in the house besides the prisoner and me, an apprentice and a milliner—they lived in the house, and remained there all day—the pri<lb></lb>soner usually came to the house from half-past seven to a quarter to eight every morning, and left at nine with Mr. Savin, to carry his boxes, and usually came back about one or two—he then remained till eight, nine, or ten in the evening.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Does the yard adjoin other yards at the back of the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there are high walls all round—there are no houses, nor windows—there is no way into the yard except through the house—there is a ladder in the yard—the front door is left open all day, after half-past eight or nine o'clock, but there is an inner glass door which is kept shut.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, William Creed, a tobac<lb></lb>conist, in Hungerford-street, Strand. Between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening of the 23rd of Sept., 6lbs. of tobacco was taken off the counter—it was in a paper, which had my writing on it—this is it—I know the writing on it, and here is a piece of paper pasted inside.</p>

On tne 23rd of Sept., about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was on duty in Little Shire-lane—I saw the prisoner with this bundle under his arm—that was about half a mile from Hungerford-street—I followed him to Newcastle-court, and asked him what he had got—he said he believed it was tobacco, that a man gave it him at a public-house in Clare-market, and he was going to take it to Fetter-lane, and he was to see the man that gave it him on the following morning—I took him to the station.</p>

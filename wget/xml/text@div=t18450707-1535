The prisoner was his warehouse boy—he had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and lodged and boarded in the house—on the 11th of June I gave him ten sovereigns of my employer's to obtain for me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver, and he never returned—oh Saturday, the 21st of June, he was brought back by one of the servants in the house, and given into custody—my master was not present when I gave him the ten sovereigns—I had frequently sent him for change before, and he had brought it honestly—I had sent him with as large an amount as this.</p>

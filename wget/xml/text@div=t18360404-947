                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 159.) On the light of the 11th of March I was in Regent-street—I saw the two prisoners in company with another, walking arm in arm up Regent-street, behind a gentleman, some distance—they then returned to the Quadrant—Mr. Potter then passed, and they followed him—I saw the one, who is not in custody, put his hand into Mr. Potter's coat pocket, and take something out—he turned round Beak-street, and went towards Golden-square—the two prisoners followed him, and in John-street, by the square, they were all conversing together—Hobbs and I followed them—I took Wallis, and Hobbs secured Lyons and the other—the moment that Hobbs had hold of Lyons, I saw him throw form his right hand this handkerchief, which I picked up—a scuffle then ensued with Lyons and the other—they knocked Hobbs down, and kicked him when he was down.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Your suit looks new to me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it has been new this year—I resigned in the police and went to work—that did not suit me, and I took to the police again—I was not in the police at the time I took the prisoner—I was wanting to go on the police on that day—I had come form the watch-house with Hobbs—I went there to see if there was a vacancy, as I was to have the next vacancy—I had been there with two pick-pockets the same night—I was acting then as an amateur—I have had only one situation since I left the police force—I then went to work for Mr. Smart a gold and silver refiner, and melter—I have seen Mr. Smart in the other court—I took a man from his shop, who was transported—I have not known Mr. Smart's house searched for property charged as stolen—Mr. Smart has only been once called to give an ac<lb></lb>count of property—I went there on that occasion, and Mr. Smart was brought here as a witness—two years after that, we arranged that I should leave the police and enter his service—I had been to his house frequently before that—he used to tell the police to give him information if any thing was lost, and we left bills at Mr. Smart's and the pawnbrokers—I did not go to his house before I was his servant, and charge him with having stolen property—he gave it me without my demanding it—I had never been a melter of silver and gold before; but after he was in this Court, I went into his service—he keeps the shop now, for any thing I know—I do not know that it is shut up—I left him the latter end of February.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long was if after you left Mr. Smart, and before you got into the police, before you turned thief-catcher? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Six or seven weeks—it was six weeks to the best of knowledge—I am sure it was more than a fortnight—I did not go out at night—if I saw any person taken by day I assisted—I went into the country as I was ill—I resigned, be<lb></lb>cause I had not been treated just as I ought to have been—I did not ex<lb></lb>pect to be discharged—there was a complaint made against me—I had seen</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 83.) I was in company with Far<lb></lb>rant on the 11th of March, and saw the two prisoners, in company with a third, go up the Quadrant, and follow a gentleman up Regent-street—they went some distance, and then turned back to the corner of Glasshouse-street—then Mr. Potter was going up—they all turned and followed him—I saw the one who has escaped go close to Mr. Potter—they then turned, and went down Beak-street—they got to Upper John-street, when I took Lyons with my right hand, and the one who made his escape with my left hand—I saw Lyons throw a handkerchief form him to the rails—I called to Farrant to take the handkerchief, and they knocked me down, and struck me, and kicked me—I afterwards searched Lyons at the sta<lb></lb>tion-house—I found a watch, a seal, a purse with some money in it—(I be<lb></lb>lieve seven foreign pieces,) and two or three sovereigns, which were given to him at the office—there was a breast-pin, with a chain and a ring, and another handkerchief in his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I live Farringdon-street, and am a medical student. I was in Regent-street—the witness came and told me I had lost my handkerchief—I found it was gone—he told me to wait, and he would bring it to me—this is it—it had been lent me by a friend that even<lb></lb>ing—I had used it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You had it in your possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, two or three hours—I examined it at the office—there was no mark—I will not swear to it—I had a slight cold, and had used it—I had not taken any par<lb></lb>ticular notice of the pattern—I know it had a red border, and white inside—I have not the slightest doubt that it is the one I had that evening.</p>

I went to the west end of the town, and, going up Regent-street, I turned down a street to take some refreshment in a public house—I had just come out, and was overtaken by two persons—as they passed me, one policeman seized me and another young man, and the other police<lb></lb>man took this other man—I put up my arm to put the officer away, and it is not likely I could throw a handkerchief away—I stated at the station-house that I had just come from America—if I had not, he would most likely have said he had known me before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Morriss Myers, a builder, of Charlton, in Kent. In April last he was building some houses in Sand-street, Woolwich—the prisoner was one of the workmen employed there; he had to use cement belonging to Mr. Myers—on the Saturday after 23rd April he left his work, and went to work at some houses close by Mr. Wales', leaving his contract with Mr. Myers unfinished—I believe he is rather more indebted to Mr. Myers than Mr. Myers to him—I am quite certain Mr. Myers owes him nothing.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you say positively that Mr. Myers does not owe him anything? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I consider so; but it may be a very critical point to hit the exact line—Mr. Myers is not here—the houses Mr. Wales is building are within 100 yards of those Mr. Myers is building—the prisoner was not taken into custody for full a month after this happened—I am not prepared to say whether I had seen him in the meantime—I was living near the spot—I cannot venture to say I did not see him many times—he had both jobs in hand at one time, and I cannot say that he was not working at one after he left the other.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe a railway divides the two properties? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I went to the police office within two days of missing the cement, which was about 23rd April—he was not taken before, because the sergeant of police said that the case was not strong enough, and we had better wait a more fitting opportunity and make the case right—it was the same cement that he was taken for afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at Plumstead. I worked with the prisoner at Mr. Myers's buildings in Sand-street—the usual time for his coming to work was 6 o'clock in the morning—on a Thursday in last Feb., I think it was, I got up at half past 5 o'clock and knocked at his door; his wife told me he had gone; it was dark—I went to the houses, and saw the prisoner moving some cement out of one of Mr. Myers's casks, and putting it into a bag—I was about 100 yards from him, but I could see that distance—I did not say anything, but he said, "If anybody should ask you any questions, say you do not know;" but I was not aware that he was stealing the cement—I should think he took about half a bushel away it a time in a</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined, Q.</hi> Was there a Mr. West with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he gave it to West to carry into Mr. Wales's house, but I was not aware he was stealing it, and I never said anything—I have had no dispute with the prisoner—I have not said he charged me too much for my lodging—I did not know but what he had bought the cement.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He took one bag, you say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two bags, and West took them in one at a time. West is a stranger to me; he belongs to the Militia and wears a blue jacket.</p>

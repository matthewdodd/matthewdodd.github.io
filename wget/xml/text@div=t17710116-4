             can tell better than I, I was in the shop a good deal; he went into the shop; then they shut the sash door between the shop and the kitchen, then he went back into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come as a visitor, or customer?</p>
               <p>Nichols. He only came to buy things.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell what passed at the time of the robbery?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I waked in the morning on the twenty-second of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your house secure over night?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes, my chamber door was neither locked nor bolted; I waked in the morning; I heard the rustling of paper; the lamp I had in the room burnt very bright; I looked across the room and saw the line move a bit of cord that run across the room; I was frightened, then I knew it could not move of itself; I looked a little and saw the line move; I looked, presently a man peeped in at the foot of the bed; I got up an end in my bed, opened the curtains, and looked at the man. I said, very well sir; he said D - n you, madam, if you speak another word you are a dead woman immediately: he stood a little, and did not say any thing; presently he draw'd towards the top of the stairs, and called, Come along Jack, very loud.</p>
               <p>Q. When you said, Very well sir, that seemed to be an expression as if you knew the person?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I knew him extremely well; I knew him directly; if I had not seen him I should have known him by his voice.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you said, Very well sir, had you a view of his person?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are to consider this man's life is depending; you can't be too cautious?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I could tell him by his voice or back but I saw his face. I said never a word, only that I would not speak any more.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he went out of the room?</p>
               <p>Nichols. He did not stay above a minute or two.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take any thing?</p>
               <p>Nichols. When I first saw him, he had something in his hand white, like linen; he droped it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing out of your room?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes, my watch and bag of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you carried up any money the night before?</p>

             did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it you saw the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I had a fancy that it was about five in the morning, my watch being gone I could not tell; there was a bag of money upon the dressing-table by the looking-glass; as soon as I could put a few things about me I got up; I heard somebody going out of the yard door before I could get out of my room.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards heard somebody say, Come along Jack; Who was that?</p>
               <p>Nichols. The man in the room; he said it close to my bed-side; I could have laid hold of him if I dared; when I came down stairs the yard door was wide open; the kitchen door that goes into the street was unlocked and unbolted, that is locked and bolted with two bolts; the shop door quite open, the lock was unscrewed; the lock was on it the night before, and the key was carried up stairs; I saw the watch the night before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What was missing out of the shop?</p>
               <p>Nichols. All the canisters were empty; there was some coffee and lump butter, one silver spoon out of the till, and there was three shillings in silver. I know the consequence of an oath; I know what I say; I am positive he is the man; they got in at the sash window where the maid lies.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that sash window the night before?</p>
               <p>Nichols. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find it in the morning?</p>
               <p>Nichols. At first I said I believed he came in at the door; we went up into Betry Brookers's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160008"></xptr> room over the shop, there the sash was up as high as it could go; it used to be fastened down with a nail; the nail was bent in so that we could hardly get the sash down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up into this room as soon as you had examined below?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes; it was above a quarter of an hour; the window curtain had wet fresh dirt upon it, and fresh dirt upon the table under the window; it was a rainy morning; the curtain was daubed in two places, the table in one place; it was quite wet; there was no mark in the room; I suppose he took his shoes off; I lost three loaves of eight-penny sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first give the alarm of this?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I sent for a gentleman; I went out into the garden to see which way they went with the things; the garden gate was open, unbolted, and the lock bursted: there was a leather bottom chair took out of the kitchen and left in the garden, and a brass candlestick from the mantle-piece; the door of that gate was bursted open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the alarm to your neighbours?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I sent to Mr. Williams; I told him of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you name the person?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes, I did; he said he would have me get a warrant of a justice; we went, and they would not grant a warrant. In the afternoon we went to Sir

               <p>Q. Had you a warrant then?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I will not be positive; the prisoner was taken up on Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Sir John grant a warrant?</p>
               <p>Nichols. He was brought before Sir John from prison before we came there; the constable went to the prison for him, but he had been gone some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you examined before Sir John?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes; a little, not much; he asked me but a few questions; what he asked me I answered. He asked me what reasons I had to think that was the man; I said, by his cloaths, his shape, and his voice: he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was he discharged.</p>
               <p>Nichols. The justice only asked me this; Was you in the room alone when you saw the man. I said, no; I had only a young woman in the bed with me, there she is, she was never called. I thought she would have been called; then he said to the man, What have you got to say for yourself? his landlord and landlady both swore (I think it was nine o'clock they swore to) that he was in from nine o'clock on Saturday night, till a quarter after seven next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Only these two; the justice said, Who locks your door; the man said, He locked it himself: the justice said, Who keeps the key; he said, I take it into my own room, and hang it at the foot of my bed every night, I always do it; the justice thought a little while, and said he could not do any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there again?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you was before Sir John again?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I think he was taken up on Wednesday. Yesterday week; I think so, I will not be positive; I went to Sir John again.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to be committed the second time and not the first?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I told him I thought for want of knowledge, and my being so very ignorant and no witnesses called; that I had been counselled to take him up again for the same fact; he said, Then I hope you will sware positive to him. I said, I did that before; he said, No, you did not sware positive to him before.</p>
               <p>Q. You only swore to his stature, his coat and voice?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I swore positively according to my knowledge, and the understanding I had of his person.</p>

               <p>Nichols. No; his coat. I said, stature, voice and cloaths.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you been afraid of him before this time?</p>
               <p>Nichols. He always put a dump upon my spirits, he swore so bitterly.</p>
               <p>Q. All your conversation was about buying of things?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Sitting there to sleep knocked like a visitor?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I did not like him at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the feet curtains were open?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you first see him at the feet?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes, he peeped in.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Nichols. He did not say any thing, but turned towards the drawers, he was sorting things over in the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the things?</p>
               <p>Nichols. The first thing I heard was the rustling of paper in the little drawer he pulled out.</p>
               <p>Q. You said he was sorting things; what did you mean by that?</p>
               <p>Nichols. He was picking out the lies I suppose, thieves generally do.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he spoke to you?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I spoke to him first.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when he spoke to you?</p>
               <p>Nichols. He had turned away from the drawers. I opened the side curtain and looked at him, and said, Very well, sir; then he said, Madam, if you speak another word you are a dead woman immediately. I said I would not speak.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you saw him from head to foot?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distant from the bed?</p>
               <p>Nichols. About so far described, about five foot.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know his voice?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I could sware to his voice among a thousand men.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way is the head of the bed?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Opposite the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. When he passed you, his back was to the lamp?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Side-ways, as he peeped in.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you should know him by his back?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Certainly I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you sware to him by seeing his back?</p>
               <p>Nichols. No, I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you know him by his back without seeing his face?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes, I could know him by his back; I should not chuse to sware to a man that I saw nothing but his back, but I saw his face and heard his voice, which is more evident.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said you should know him by the hanging of his arms; you was terrified I suppose?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. In this situation you might be mistaken, as to the person, I should think?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I could not be mistaken, I was as sensible as I am now, my room was as light as it could be.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the young woman in bed with you?</p>
               <p>Nichols.

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160010"></xptr>Q. You applied to Justice Fielding on Sunday?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you or did you not mention his name to the justice's clerk?</p>
               <p>Nichols. To be sure I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention his name at that time?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When before Sir John, you swore you say, to his statute, his cloaths and his voice?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not at that time doubtful as to his face?</p>
               <p>Nichols. No; but they never asked me any thing about his face.</p>
               <p>Q. They asked for what reasons you accused him of the robbery?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did you give?</p>
               <p>Nichols. By knowing the man, I said by his stature, his coat and his voice.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned nothing about his face?</p>
               <p>Nichols. His face was never mentioned to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you asked whether you could sware positively.</p>
               <p>Nichols. I was not asked the question as I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you, the second time before the justice, the justice said you must sware positive, because you had not before?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes; he did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not recollect that you had not sworn positive before?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I thought I had sworn as positive as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't remember telling the justice you saw his face?</p>
               <p>Nichols. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, another witness was present the first time?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell that to the justice?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes, I did: the justice said, Was you in the room alone; I said, No; he said, Who was with you; I said, A young woman in bed with me, there she is; they never called her.</p>
               <p>Q. This was upon Monday I think?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes; the day before Christmas day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after was it before you thought of taking him up again?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I fancy yesterday was a week.</p>
               <p>Council. That was the ninth, then you let him alone above a fortnight; how came you to think of taking him up on Wednesday; What particular reason had you for taking him up at that time?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I had not had advice before.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to ask advice?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Because I was not satisfied in my mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Had nothing happened between the 24th of December and the 9th of January? Had you received any letter from the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I received a letter from an attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you receive it?</p>

               <p>Nichols. A day or two before I took him up the second time.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you that letter?</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. I have a copy of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you go to after you received this letter from the attorney?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I went to a friend to ask what was best to do. I went to ask Mr. Madan's advice the second time I had him before the justice of peace.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you swear to him?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Just as the justice of peace ordered me.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell the jury what he ordered you.</p>
               <p>Nichols. He said I had not sworn positively before; now I must swear positively.</p>
               <p>Court. Recollect, as well as you can, what you did swear before Sir

             the second time.</p>
               <p>Nichols. I told him positively, that was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any reasons?</p>
               <p>Nichols. He did not ask me any particulars, as I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention any thing else before Sir

            ?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I cannot say I know; I said I would swear positively. He said I did not swear positively before; I thought I had.</p>
               <p>Q. At the first time could you swear positively?</p>
               <p>Nichols. If I had been asked, I would; that question was not put to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you asked by the justice if you could swear to the man?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I really don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your declaring that you could not swear positively to him the first time?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160011"></xptr>Nichols. No, I don't.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you could not swear to him?</p>
               <p>Nichols. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you express any doubt about him?</p>
               <p>Nichols. No, I swore to his stature, his cloaths and voice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you asked whether you could undertake to say he was the man that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I might be asked that.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what answer you made to that?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I cannot recollect?</p>
               <p>Court. It seems natural to me that when you said to the justice of peace you swore to the stature, voice and cloaths of the man, did the justice then say, can you be positive to the man?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I don't know. If I heard it, I did not understand it?</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of cloaths had he on?</p>
               <p>Nichols. It was a coat without a cape, something of a darkish colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him in that coat before?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes, many times.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had received this letter whether you did not say, Let him take care of himself, I may hang him yet if necessary?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor words to that effect?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not angry when you received that letter?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I could not receive it with joy.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say in the first transport of your resentment?</p>
               <p>Nichols. The boy brought the letter. I said, I believe you have made a rod for your own back-side; but I said nothing about hanging him.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been robbed three times, I think?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say you received collections made for you every time?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I never had any collection made for me in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say you had collections made for you at Mr. Whitefields or Mr. Wesleys?</p>
               <p>Nichols. No, I never had, nor never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Mr. Madan's, was it before or after receiving the letter?</p>
               <p>Nichols. After.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say you had lost a hundred pound on these occasions?</p>
               <p>Nichols. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor to the value of a hundred pound?</p>
               <p>Nichols. No, not forty, nor thirty.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. You said you was not asked the question, if you could positively swear to the man?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If such a question had been put, whether you could swear positively to the man; what would have been your answer?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you received this letter, who did you go to upon this occasion?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I went to Mr. Madan.</p>

            . I was servant to Mrs. Nichols in the month of December; she kept a chandlers shop.</p>

               <p>Sparrow. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He used to frequent your house as a customer?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. He had been in four or five times lately since I have been there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you live at this place before this accident?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. About three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his person?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with his voice?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come several times to your house?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. He generally used to ask for small beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming before?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. A fortnight, to the best of my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his being there at any time, and staying when he was desired to go out of the house?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. It was the Tuesday before he came into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that day, what did he do or say?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. He came in and behaved much like a drunken man: he came boldly into the kitchen, and sat himself down and asked for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160012"></xptr> some beer, which was drawn him: and after he had drank part of the beer he desired me to get him some drink, or some sort of liquor. I told him I could not, we sold nothing but small beer; he answered, D - n you, I will have something; after that he desired me to make him some tea; I told him it was inconvenient as we were a washing, and had not opportunity to get tea for ourselves; I desired him to walk out of doors. but he said he would not; I told him he was very much in the way as I wanted to get up our cloaths; after that he got up and went into the shop and shut too the door; he has a remarkable voice, I know it very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time this robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes.</p>

             generally fastened the house; I always looked afterwards to see if it were properly done.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the case this night?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure, and able to recollect, that the doors and windows were fastened on this particular night?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes; I am very particular: I went round to see all things fastened the last thing I did before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a window goes to the room where

             lay; was that fastened?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I did not see that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of seeing a watch in your mistress's apartment that night?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes; I brought the watch up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bring up any thing else?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes; a bag of money, which I always do every night.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that money?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Three shillings in silver and about twenty shillings in half-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put that money?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Upon the dressing table.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a lamp in the room.</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In general?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes; there always was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it placed?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Upon the mantle piece, opposite the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How did your mistress do with regard to her curtains?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. The curtains were drawn at the side of the bed; at the foot of the bed they were always left open.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of locking the door of the bed chamber that night?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I always used to fasten that door every night, and bolt it; but that night I forgot it, and it was not fastened: my mistress waked me that night between four and five o'clock; as she waked me, I saw a man pass down the side of the bed; I only saw him go by the curtains. As he was a going out, he called aloud, Come along Jack.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this after he was out of the room?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. It was while he was going out of the room; there were other words passed, but I was not sensibly awake enough to understand what they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Words? after he was out of the room, as before?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Words with Mrs. Nichols.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your knowledge of the voice of the man, was it that man's voice?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Positively I can swear to that man's voice. I never heard any man's voice like his in all my life. I could distinguish his voice among ten thousand.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up was the money there?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the shadow of the man? or the man himself?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. The man himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at the foot or the side of the bed?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes; I saw him at my mistress's side of the curtains; she had opened the curtains before I was awake, she had opened the curtains by that time.</p>
               <p>Q. The door he went out of was upon the mistess's side of the curtains?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes; the money and watch were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went down stairs were other things missing?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes, the kitchen was in an uproar, one thing here and another there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the doors?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160013"></xptr>Sparrow. The yard door and the fore door were open; the fore door was unlocked, and just put to.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing in the yard carried out as you know of?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I did not go into the yard at that time, but I did at day light; the lock was taken off; the screws were put upon a chair; it was unscrewed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing missing out of the shop?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Seven canisters in the shop; all the tea took out, and the canisters were put down in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the tea in the shop the night before?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any coffee?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. About two pounds of coffee missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up stairs into the room where the other servant lay?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the window?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. When I went up into the room, I saw the window open that used to be fastened with a large nail; the nail was in that night; it was quite doubled: I tried to bring the window down again; I could not do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of the outside of the window?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. There was nothing on the outside, as I could perceive; but there was the dirt of a man's foot upon the window curtains and the table.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. It rained very hard in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe in the yard next morning?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. A chair in the yard by the gate, and a candlestick lay down flat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the candlestick and chair belong to your mistress?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark on the chair of a man having been there?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. None at all, that I could perceive.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at Sir John Fielding's?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes, upon Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the justice ask you any questions?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Not one question at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Not by the clerk on the justice?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. By nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, was there any question put to your mistress, whether she could positively swear to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I believe it was so far put to her as to answer to all questions that should be put to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect if any question was put to her, whether she could positively swear to the prisoner at the bar;</p>
               <p>Sparrow. To the best of my knowledge it was not: she said, there is the young woman that lay with me; and nodded her head at me.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured coat did this man use to wear?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. A lightish colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the same coat on that he had the Tuesday before?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I cannot be particular as to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light or dark colour?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. It was a sort of a drab.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was you waked in the morning?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Between four and five.</p>
               <p>Q. Out of a sound sleep?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I was asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first thing you took notice of when you waked?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Seeing a man in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. The first words you took notice of to understand were, Come along Jack?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to the door was he when he spoke these words?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Almost close to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the only thing you can be certain of, when just waked out of your sleep, is, this man said, Come along Jack?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak that very loud, or only in a middling voice?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Very loud.</p>
               <p>Q. What is there in his voice that you should know it by?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. A rough, big voice, very remarkable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner the first time before Sir

            . I lived with Mistress Nichols at the time of this robbery; I laid in the fore part of the house, up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. That looks towards the street?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there sash of other windows?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Sash windows to that one room.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it fastened down?</p>
               <p>Brooks. With a double ten-penny nail, that went through both sashes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak with certainty that this window was down and fastened, the night before this accident happened?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes; I tried it before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you are not mistaken?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was call'd in the morning, how was the window?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you waked by any noise in the night?</p>
               <p>Brooks. No; I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was either of the panes of the window broke?</p>
               <p>Brooks. No; the nail was bent double almost; the nail was fastened in the wood; It was shoved out of the hole next the street, but not out of the other in pushing it up; it was fastened to the wood-work of another pane.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sash apt to fall of itself?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes; for we used to stick a piece of wood in it, in order to keep it up when we wanted it in the day time.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I am a servant to Mrs. Nichols.</p>
               <p>Q. What family has she?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Only herself, the other young woman, and I. I have lived half a year with her the 24th of this month; the other about a quarter of a year.</p>
               <p>Q. What other maid had she when you went?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Never a one.</p>
               <p>Q. She took another servant?</p>
               <p>Brooks. She had a sister alive; the sister was ill, and died after I was there; so she had another young woman come to live with her; in the morning the sash was up, and the nail fastened in the middle of the next pane.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any glass broke?</p>
               <p>Brooks. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks upon the window-frames of being forced?</p>

               <p>Q. How soon was you alarmed in the morning?</p>

I went to him; and said, You had like to have been in a hobble; he said again, So I had, but I got clear of it; he said, she swore to my stature, my cloaths and my voice, but she could not swear to my face, but I had no more upon my face then than I have now.</p>

            . I am a watch case joint-maker. I live at the next apartment to the prisoner in Mr. Boney's house, up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How many rooms is there on a floor?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Two, the prisoner has one and I have the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Which room do you live in?</p>
               <p>Cripple. The iront, and the prisoner in the back room, he has a wife and two children.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come home?</p>
               <p>Cripple. On Saturday the twenty-second of December I heard him come home about eight or nine o'clock; and about half an hour after nine, as near as I can guess; I heard him in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him?</p>
               <p>Cripple. No. but I heard him; and our partition is so thin, that we can hear each other speak. I heard him speak to his wife in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is his voice remarkable at all?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Yes, I could swear to his voice among twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there particular in his voice?</p>
               <p>Cripple. An impediment in his speech, he speaks inwardly gruff.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you hear him come in?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any conversation; who let him in?</p>
               <p>Cripple. His wife I suppose; I heard him go into the room. I heard him laughing and talking to one of his children. I went to bed about eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his going out in the morning?</p>
               <p>Cripple. I heard his child cry about a quarter after four; his wife had laid in but fifteen weeks; one of the children was ill, that waked the other, and their crying waked me. I lay awake from that time till six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he talk to his wife?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Continually till five.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him after five?</p>
               <p>Cripple. No. He got up about half after seven, and went out; I did not see him, but I heard him speak, and his wife said, My dear shut the street door after you: the landlord always shuts up the street door, and takes the key up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Windmill-Hill from this house?</p>
               <p>Cripple. I live in Featherstone-street, it is about half a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived at this house?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Twenty-two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the landlord constantly shuts the house up that you can't get out?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Every night.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose the door was to be shut in the day time, is there not a spring lock?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Yes - he always calls up of a night to know if every body is within.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure he locks the door always?</p>
               <p>Cripple. I have found it so.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you, upon your oath?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Yes, once.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not found it upon the latch?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you found it so more than once, twice, or thrice?</p>
               <p>Cripple. They are generally up the first in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. But have not you found it upon the single catch?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a window that looks into the yard which communicates pretty near the wall?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Yes, the stair-case window.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any difficulty to get out at that window?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Some difficulty, because there is no way to keep the window from falling down when you push it up?</p>
               <p>Q. You suppose he was in bed from half after nine till the morning.</p>
               <p>Cripple. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know the prisoner before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160016"></xptr> go out at half past seven on a Sunday morning in the middle of December?</p>
               <p>Cripple. I don't know what business he had; I don't remember his doing so any other Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. From five till a quarter after seven did you hear him say any one thing?</p>
               <p>Cripple. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the watch go five or half after five?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you heard the watch go six?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. You say you heard nothing of the prisoner after five; if he had gone out you must have heard him?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Yes, it was not possible for him to get out of his room without my hearing him.</p>

            . I heard the prisoner come home that evening about eight o'clock. I heard him all night. I had been restless all the week, and I sat up till one o'clock in order to tire myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you hear him?</p>
               <p>Cripple. He is a very troublesome man in his sleep, he snores and groans very much; the children were both very cross about four or five o'clock, which waked my husband. I heard him talk to his wife for about half an hour; I heard him get up about a quarter after seven.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had got up at the time the children cried must you not have heard him?</p>

               <p>Q. Who keeps the key of the street door?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Mr. Bonny, the landlord; he takes it up into his bed-chamber, and if we want to go out in the morning before he is up we ask for the key.</p>

            . I keep the house where the prisoner lodged, he came home that night about eight o'clock; I saw him go up into his room, I did not see him till a quarter past seven next morning going out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you lie?</p>
               <p>Bonney. Upon the ground floor even with the shop. I heard him about four, or some time after four, talking to his wife; my wife and I were waked by the children's crying; it was almost seven before we went to sleep. I lay in the room under him. I always lock the door, and keep the key in my own room.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the street door fastened?</p>
               <p>Bonney. With two large bolts and a spring lock.</p>
               <p>Q. If your lodgers want to get out how do they do?</p>
               <p>Bonney. They can open the door, we don't double lock it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you never double lock it?</p>
               <p>Bonney. Seldom.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it that night?</p>
               <p>Bonney. I can't tell, my bed is within two yards of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not a person in the night unbolt the door and let himself out?</p>
               <p>Bonney. They could let themselves out; it is impossible but I must have heard them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went out first that morning?</p>
               <p>Bonney. The prisoner.</p>
               <p>Council. Then it is plain he could get out without the key. What time does he generally go out on a Sunday morning?</p>
               <p>Bonney. I never took particular notice.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe his being at home by his snoring, but by his talking?</p>
               <p>Bonney. I believe he did not snore after twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Cripple's room nearer the prisoner's than yours?</p>
               <p>Bonney. I lay in the room under the prisoner, they lay in the next room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him snore or groan at five or six in the morning?</p>

            . I was at Sir John Fielding's when Mrs. Nichols was examined the prisoner's brother called upon me and desired me to go down to Sir John's. She said it was about four or between four and five on Sunday morning, and that a man came into her bed chamber, that the curtains were drawn, she raised herself up in the bed, and said, Who is there? or something to that purport; that the man d - d her and told her to lie down, or she was a dead woman. Sir John asked her how she came to suspect the prisoner? she said, there was a lamp burning in her chamber, and by that glimmering light she looked upon him to be the man; she said she did not see his face; the justice then asked her what was the grounds of her suspicion? she said, from his size; the colour of his coat, and his voice; and that she heard him say, D - n you, come along Jack, as he went out of the room. She said a woman was in bed with her; Sir John said, Has she any thing more to say than you have said; I think she intimated, No; or that she was asleep. The justice was very minute as to the circumstance of his face; she said she could not distinguish it.</p>

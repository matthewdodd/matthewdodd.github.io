On the 5th of April, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was going down the west side of the pavement in Fleet-market, four men<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181704160034"></xptr>came out of the inner part of the market, and followed me until I got into Holborn; I crossed over, and they all crossed also. I did not speak to them. They followed me up Holborn-hill; I turned back, and went into Fieldlane - They got away from me, and I saw no more of them until I got to the top of Field-lane; I got into <placeName id="t18170416-97-crimeloc505">Saffron-hill</placeName>

I was the worse for liquor, but was quite capable of walking home. They made no answer, but all four came upon me; one struck me upon the back of the neck, and knocked me down into the kennel, and at the same time one of them struck me on my thigh-all four of them continued together, but I did not receive any more blows. The moment I fell down I felt a hand going into my right-hand breeches pocket, but do not know whose it was; my watch was in my fob, they felt it through my pocket; I caught hold of my watch, and got the seal and key in my hand, the ring of the chain was broken, and they got the watch; I kept the seal and key-they took the watch and pocket together; they tore my pocket entirely out with the watch and fob. I had 1l. 15s. in my pocket, which I lost, but I thought it might have been lost in the scuffle, and did not include it in the indictment; I caught hold of the seal and key just as they gave the watch a jerk. I had no oportunity of seeing them so as to know them again - They ran away immediately. When I fell down, I fell on my knees, which hurt me very much and stunned me - I do not know which way they ran. Before this I had a very severe fall from a ladder and broke my legs, I was lame at the time. I called out stop thief! I could not call out before. I did not lose my senses. I got up and stood in the street, as I could not even move my legs. In less than five minutes the watchman brought the prisoner back. If I had been strong in my legs, the blows would not have done me a serious injury. I told the watchman that I was so much hurt that I could not exactly say that the prisoner was one of them. I said he was one of them, because when I turned round to speak to them on Saffron-hill, I noticed one of them more than the others, and thought he was one of them, becuase he had a long beard, as though he had not been shaved for a month. I will not swear to him.</p>

            . I am a whalebone-cutter, and live in Warwick-place, Whitecross-street. On the 5th April, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was going up Saffron-hill (it was Saturday night), I saw the prosecutor fall into the kennel, and four men close to him - They jumped down and closed round him (I did not see any blows given). I stopped to look at them, and saw three of them part from him and go down Red Lion-court-the other man stopped by him, he was laying on the west side; the man caught him by his collar, and turned him round on his back; I saw him push both his hands down into his pockets distinctly-it was his waistcoat pocket; he then looked up and saw me, and ran up Saffron-hill. A young man, who was standing about three yards from me, but farther from the prisoner, ran after him. I did not pursue him, but he took him before I lost sight of him - He did not run above eighty or ninety yards; I saw him brought back and given to the watchman. The prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath then, the man this person apprehended is the very man you saw run his hands down the clothes of the prosecutor, and one of the four men you saw close round him - A. I am certain of it; I am sure he is the man, his beard was very long; the prosecutor appeared stupified and much hurt, another young man lifted him up; I did not hear him call out "watch, or stop thief;" he did not appear to be very drunk - He was upon his legs before the watchman brought the prisoner up to him. I did not hear him make any complaint. I saw the key and seal on the ground by his side, a young woman picked it up, and put into his hand, when he was on the ground - He said his watch was gone; his pocket was torn out. I then went in, it being close to my house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I run or walk - A. You ran.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you saw me put my hand into his pocket - A. He put his hand into his pocket.</p>

            . I am the beadle of the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. On the 5th of April, about half-past twelve o'clock, the watchman and I were together on Saffron-hill, on duty, at the lower end of the hill, I heard the cry of stop thief! I pushed on and saw a young man pursuing the prisoner, he caught him, brought him back, and delivered him to Eyers; we took him to the prosecutor, and he immediately said he was one of the men: he appeared confused, and said, "they have got my watch, and here is the seal and key," holding it up in his hand. I did not see him on the ground; his knees were very dirty; he said they had knocked him down, and that he was very much hurt-his clothes were torn quite off. I searched the prisoner in the street, but found nothing upon him. I took him to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 5th of April, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was on duty on Saffron-hill, with the last witness, I heard a cry of stop thief, and watch! I ran out, and as I passed the prosecutor I saw him laying on the ground - I did not go up to him; I went about twelve yards further, and the prisoner was delivered up to me - I brought him back. I saw the man who brought him to me running after him - He was taken about five yards from where I was; I saw the man take him.</p>
               <p>BARNLEY re-examined. I saw the man who took the prisoner, at the watch-house; he said he would give me his address, but he went away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going down Saffron-hill in my way home, I saw a mob of people together; I saw them go away, and went and laid hold of the man by his collar, to lift him up; I helped him up, but did not put my hand into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Jury to LIDDARD. Q. Do you not live in Whitecross-street. - A. I work in Whitecross-street, but sleep at 143, Saffron-hill.</p>
               <p>BARNLEY re-examined. I know he sleeps on Saffron-hill, and works in Whitecross-street.</p>

On the 4th of February the prisoner came into my shop, and wanted to look at some Bibles; I showed him some about 12s. a piece, and he said had I any which would come to about 16s. or a guines, as he wanted to make presents of them to his sisters, the Misses Le Bretons of No. 15, Russell-square, and he asked if I could send any person with them; I put these articles in a bag, and sent my little lad with them; I went out soon after and saw them at a distance, and either the prisoner or the child were taking the books out of the bag; some persons then intervened and I lost sight of them - I went round another street and met the prisoner with the books; I said to him"Where is the child?' he said "I have sent him home to say I shall be there in half an hour; and I was going back to get one of these changed for a blue one;" I said it was very strange conduct, he put his hand to his pocket and said "If you doubt my respectability here is my card;" but he did not give it me - he then said "Well, the transaction shall stand as it does, and we will go back to the house;" we went towards the house, but when he got there he would not go in, but told me to go in with the child, and they would pay for what books they chose - I refused and sent for the beadle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I say they were for Miss Le Breton or for Miss Duncan at Mr. Le Breton's? A. You said for your sisters Misses Le Bretons; you wished me and the child to go in, or for you and the child to go in, while the other stood at the corner of Woburn-place.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came out to take a walk, and unfortunately passed the prosecutor's shop; I went in and asked the price of some books - I asked if he would mind sending them for Miss Duncan at Mr. Le Breton' to look at, and when I got on to Tavistock-square, I asked the lad to give me the books as I thought I would take them to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210097"></xptr>my mother's to look at, and if she did not choose to buy one, I thought I could get back before the lad did; I certainly did wrong in giving a false address; soon after I left the lad, I met the prosecutor - I told him the books would not do, and asked him to change them; he said he thought it was a swindling transaction; I then went towards Mr. Le Breton's, but did not like to go in because I knew I had done wrong; he sent for the beadle - I did not like to be taken, and ran away; my uncle has written to Mr. Barrett to say that if I am acquitted he will take me a voyage to China with him.</p>

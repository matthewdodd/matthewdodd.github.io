            . I am a Police-constable. About half-past one o'clock on the morning of the 7th of May, I was at the corner of Bell-lane, Spitalfields - I saw the prisoner with a bag, and asked what he had got there; he said a bag of almonds - he was carrying them on his shoulder; I asked where he brought them from - he said Duke's-place, and he was going to take them to No. 21, Wentworth-street, where his father lived; I asked what he gave for them - he said 12s.; I took him to No. 21, Wentworth-street - I knocked at the door, but no one came; I took him to the station, and made inquiries, which led me to Mr. Isaacs' warehouse, near Lamb-street, Spitalfields, which is about half a mile from where I took the prisoner - the prosecutor's warehouse had about a dozen tiles taken off it.</p>

The prisoner had been employed on my premises, but was discharged about a month or six weeks since; he had to attend a horse in my yard. On the 7th of May I received information, and went to the station; I saw the bag of almonds- I knew the bag; it is marked R. - it is a particular mark that we buy; I missed almonds of this description - I had such in my warehouse the night before; I went to the prisoner - as soon as he saw me he said, "Mr. Isaacs, I hope you will have mercy - I took the tiles off the warehouse, and took the bag and almonds;" my warehouse is in the parish of Christchurch, Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>HENRY WHITE. I am a porter to Mr. Isaacs. On the evening of the 6th of May, I put a bag of almonds into the barrel in his warehouse, to colour them - this is the bag; I know it by having cut the tops of the twine - I locked it up at half-past eight o'clock; the roof was then all secure - I went in the morning, and saw about a dozen tiles had been taken off.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BICKNELL. I was at the station-house. The prisoner was brought in there, and when the prosecutor came he said, "Is that Mr. Isaacs? pray do not he too hard with me;" I told him what he said must be told to the Magistrate - he then said he took the tiles off, took the bag of almonds, and that to get into the yard he was compelled to get over the yard door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was rather tipsy; I met a sailor, and went to play at skittles with him - if I had been sober I should not have done so.</p>

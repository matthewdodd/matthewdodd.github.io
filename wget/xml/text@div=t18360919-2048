                  </hi>. I live at Chelsea. On Wednesday evening, about eight o'clock or half-past, I was walking with my brother and his wife, three or four hundred yards over London Bridge, towards the City—a gentleman tapped Mrs. Harding on the shoulder and said, "That gen<lb></lb>tleman has lost his handkerchief, and that boy has got it"—I let go of my wife's arm, and followed the prisoner and another boy, who were together, and took them both—I gave one in charge of my brother and we took both to the station-house—the prisoner said there that he had no handkerchief at all, and never saw it—the policeman found it under his jacket, behind his back—it was taken from my coat pocket.</p>

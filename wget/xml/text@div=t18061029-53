             at Monk's, a little before Christmas last, Smith came to me at Woolwich, where I was then one of the keepers of the convicts, he then said do not you know Smith that you have been in company with at Monk's; I then immediately recollected him, we went to drink together at a public-house, Smith then said you can give me the names of some of the 87th regiment that were on board the Eurus frigate. I did not think there was any harm in mentioning them. I told Smith several names, I have forgot them now, I paid for what we had to drink. Sometime after Christmas, I was discharged from Woolwich, I met Smith and Gibbons, Smith professed a great deal of kindness to me, as well as Gibbons, they invited me into a public-house, Smith asked me for some more names, saying that the names I had given him before were of no use, he did not find they had been on board, I gave him some more names, Gibbons asked me for some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290044"></xptr>names, Smith seemed unwilling to let him have any names; after some words had passed then Gibbons began to ask me a great many questions about them, what sort of men they were, whether they were short or tall, and what complexion, and many other questions; after drinking some time we parted and I went home to my lodging. Sometime in the month of March Smith came to my lodging, and I and Smith went to Monk's lodging; Monk took a roll out of his trunk, Smith wrote the names down and put them in his pocket; we all went to a public house and had some conversation over some beer, nothing particular passed, nor did they say what they wanted their names for. A few days afterwards we stopped close to the commissaries office, a little way down Charing Cross; I had there met Smith and Gibbons, Smith said he would do something for me if I would be a good boy, his wife had gone out and brought a true search of Thomas - . The next day I called upon Smith, Gibbons was there, and Smith said he was not able to find any thing out of the Eurus frigate, I told him then that captain White was major, and that he lived in the Edgware Road.

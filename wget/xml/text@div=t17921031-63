            ; on the 19th of October I remember seeing the prisoner at the bar, and served her one shawl, she did not pay for it; I had seen the prisoner at the bar once before only; she was in the shop about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; Mr. James attended her before me; during the time I was separating the shawl that she had agreed for from the rest, she drew these three shawls from off the counter on her lap; I saw her; she sat side ways, with her elbow on the counter, and she made use of her other hand to draw them off; she did it in the manner as I conceived to be concealing them, I said nothing to her on observing this; after I had cut her the shawl, she went away, and bid me good morning; I went and spoke to Mr. James; I went after her and asked her to walk back, Mr. James wanted to speak to her; I took her into the back shop, Mr. James followed, and observed to her that she had got some property that was not her own; I took the shawls from her, from underneath the cloak; I really cannot say she said any thing.

               <p>What do you call them? - Callico muslin; it is a muslin as thick as callico; the prisoner said she hoped I would forgive her, she had never taken any thing before; a constable was sent for, and we took her in a coach to Bow-street, and the prisoner wanted something at her lodgings, and I went to her lodgings with her to Hide-street, Bloomsbury, and I saw taken out of a drawer about nine yards of muslin; it is worth about 60 s. the constable took out a great variety of things, among which was this one piece of muslin. (Deposed to by the hand-writing). It had never been sold out of one shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How many people sell in your shop? - Seven.</p>
               <p>How long had she dealt in your shop? - About a year and a half.</p>

               <p>How much had she laid out in this year and a half? - 100 l. I suppose.</p>
               <p>Do you always cut off your mark when you sell your goods? - No.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Enfield—the prisoner was my father's carter. On the 25th of Sept. he left my premises with a load of potatoes early in the morning—he had the care of my horses that day, and had more than his allowance of corn and chaff—I saw it on the wagon in a bran-sack—I did not allow him to take more than his allowance—I had told him not to take more—he had no business with any corn but that in his nose-bags, but he had about seven bushels and a half in a sack—it was my father, William Maxwell's property—I live with him—I had not seen the prisoner leave the yard.</p>

On the 25th of Sept., between two and three o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner near the turnpike<lb></lb>gate at Edmonton, with a wagon and horses—I noticed a sack in front of the wagon—I stopped him, and asked what it contained—he said, "Horses-bait"—I said, "I believe you carry your bait in nose-bags?"—he said he had nose-bags full, but that was a little he had over—I asked if any one gave it him—he said no, he took it himself—I went to the prosecutor's and examined the sack—the prisoner was present—Maxwell said he had no right to take it—the prisoner said nothing to that—there were six bushels in the sack.</p>

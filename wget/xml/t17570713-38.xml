               <p>Q. When was this ?</p>
               <p>Groom. This was about ten at night, on the 27th of April, when they went away. I believe they came about seven. My wife ask'd for the handkerchief when she was in bed, while I was undressing myself, and I found it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both go away together?</p>
               <p>Groom. They did I believe. The next morning I went to the prisoner and accused her with taking the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she live?</p>
               <p>Groom. In Drury-Lane. The other young woman and she lived together. The prisoner own'd she had pawn'd the handkerchief to a person in Holbourn, where I went with her, and found it pawn'd for a shilling in her name, and I had the gloves again from out of the prisoner's pocket. I took her before the justice, and there she own'd she did pawn the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the handkerchief was in your house when the prisoner was there?</p>
               <p>Groom. I am sure it was, for I saw it just before in a basket by the bedside.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was four o'clock before we went from his house, and I was in liquor and knew not how I came by the handkerchief; it was his daughter that was with me.</p>

I had taken the prisoner with me several times before. We got there about six o'clock, and staid till ten or eleven, more or less I can't say. My mother-in-law wanted the handkerchief to put round her neck, and it was missing. In the morning my father came to me and ask'd me if I knew any thing of it. I said no.

            . On Saturday the 6th of February, about half after six in the evening, I was going up Church-street in company with Gleed, I saw the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170037"></xptr>coming down Church street with a large bundle under his great coat, buttoned over. I looked hard at him, and he crossed immediately to go the other side of the way; I went after him and stopped him in the middle of the road; I laid hold of him by the collar, and Gleed took the carpet from under his coat; I asked him where he was going with that carpet, he said to his master, he lived at Mile End New Town. I told him he was coming directly from that way. I took him to the office. When I was going to lock him up, he said he would tell me the whole truth; he said another man took it out of the shop and gave it to him; he was to meet the man in Shoreditch.</p>

I lost a piece of beef from a book in my shop; I had seen it about ten minutes before it was taken; I saw it with a carcass of lamb which the prisoner had purchased in the morning - he paid 2s. on it; he came in the afternoon to pay the remaing 17s. 6d.; I told my man to have an eye on him - he told me he had taken a shin of beef; I ran out and saw the prisoner with the carcass of lamb, and a cloth wrapped over it - the beef was in the carcass.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you see how it got into the carcass? A. No; it is a small piece, but it could not have fallen into it, because the beef hung under the lamb - it required some force to get it in.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I understood the scale-man in the morning that he would hang the lamb in the back-yard, and I went there for it; the young man said it was on the right side, and he came and took the note off it; I took it on my shoulder, and some of the shins of beef fell down, one fell into the lamb, and one fell down - the man then caught the lamb and said I wanted to rob him; I said I had no idea of it; I thought it was only a joke; I then went into the market, and came back to Mr. Lee, who was talking with some gentleman; they said "Poh, Poh, nonsense!"</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger and grocer, and live in Catherine-street, Limehouse-fields; I have employed the prisoner two months, and he has always given me satisfaction, and laid out my money honestly; I was with him the day in question, when he paid the 2s. off the carcass, which he bought for me; when I missed him I called on Mr. Lee, and asked if he knew any thing of a man who had paid him 2s. off a carcass of lamb - he said he had been there, and attempted to steal a shin of beef, and he had got him safe enough, and if I would stand 2l. he would not appear against him; I would take him into my employ immediately.</p>

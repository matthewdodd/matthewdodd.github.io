                  </hi>. I am a stationer, of 18, Norfolk-street, New-road—on Saturday evening, 3d November, about half-past 6 o'clock, I was coming along Fleet-street, close to Whitefriars-street—I saw the prisoner rash past me down Whitefriars-street—I followed him—I saw Hetherill stop him down there—I came up at the very moment when he was stopped—Balch came up about two moments afterwards—he said to the prisoner, "Where is my watch?"—the prisoner said, "What watch?" and threw his coat back from his shoulders, and the watch fell from under his coat on to my foot—I did not have the watch in my hand, so I cannot say whether this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the one—it was a silver watch; I saw it on the ground—it was picked up by somebody—the policeman was there—two or three stooped to pick it up, but I don't know who got it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Brewer-street, John-street-road, and am a copper-plate printer—on this Saturday night, about half-past 6 o'clock, I was in Fleet-street, opposite Whitefriars-street—some volunteers were coming down Fleet-street, but they had not got up to me at that time; I was looking at them—I had my watch then in my pocket—I heard a click at my watch—I expected, by the sound, that my guard was cut by the nipper of a pair of pliers—the prisoner was immediately by me—I tried to catch him, but he bobbed his head and ran away down Whitefriars-street—I pursued him, and called "Stop thief!"—I found him at the bottom of the street, in custody—I did not see the watch fall; I saw it picked up—I do not know who picked it up—this is the watch that I saw picked upr—it was by the prisoner's foot—at the time I heard the click I only noticed the pri<lb></lb>soner near me; no one else—I noticed him run away directly I heard it—I</p>

               <p>did not notice him do anything else—this is my watch—I had seen it safe one minute before that—I had not left my shop half a minute.</p>

On Saturday evening, 3d November, about half-past 6, I was on duty in Whitefriars-street—I heard them call out "Stop thief!" as I was coming away from the Temple, towards Whitefriars-street—I saw Balch and Dodd come up—I heard the prosecutor ask the prisoner where his watch was—the prisoner said, "I have no watch"—I took him in custody and took hold of his right arm and Dodd had hold of his other arm—he pulled part of his coat back from his arm and the watch dropped—I did not see it drop, I saw it lie on the ground—this is it—I took him to the station.</p>

I did not steal it; the prosecutor cannot say that I did.</p>

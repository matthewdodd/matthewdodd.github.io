               <p>On Friday the 20th of November I went to the quay, to get four bales of wool weighed by the landing waiter; the quays were so blocked up that it was impossible to get it done; I staid from eleven to one, at which time the land waiters go to dinner; I left them in charge of the King's officers; when I came down at three o'clock I found one of the bales cut open, and a quantity taken out; I cannot say how much, there might be two or three pounds weight of goat's wool missing; it was a large hole; they belonged to Mr. Neale, I entered them for him as his broker.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time was there any other goat's wool upon the quay? -

            There was not; I was informed that a man was taken into custody, in the act of stealing it; the next day I went before the Lord Mayor, but he was not brought up till the day after.</p>
               <p>- RILEY sworn.</p>
               <p>On Friday the 20th of November I came down to Wiggin's quay, where these bales were, and I detected this man in the act of putting some sort of goods into his breeches, or trowsers; I did not know what the article was till he walked off, seeing that I had detected him, to the water side; and there I saw him throw the goat's wool that he had into the river; I then told one of the king's officers, that he should take charge of that man, which he did; I then went to the bales that I supposed he took them from, and found two bales cut open.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him take it from the bale? - A. No; I did not; there was a great<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020022"></xptr>deal taken from it, as much as to leave room for two hats.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this wool ever taken out of the Thames. - A. It was; I believe there is an officer in Court who has it.</p>

               <p>I am a King's officer; I took the prisoner with part of the property upon him; he threw part of it into the River, and I saved the remainder. Mr. Riley gave me the alarm, he had a quantity about him in his trowsers; when the constable examined him, he said he had no knife about him, that he could not have cut the bag, but there was one found upon him by the constable. I examined the bales, there was a quantity taken out of two bales; it is a thing that is very light; I cannot say how much there was of it.(The constable deposed that he took charge of the prisoner, that Hebden delivered the property to him which he produced).</p>

            (To Nichols). Are you a judge of the value of it? - A. The remainder sold at 7s. a pound; I think there was more than two pounds of it; worth 16 or 17s.</p>
               <p>Constable. I examined the prisoner and found the wool in this paper in his trowsers, and a knife; I saw him throw some of the wool overboard; the knife is a very sharp one, it is like a razor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming along and saw the wool lying upon the ground; I turned back and picked it up; I never took a bit out of the bale, nor touched the bale; I have been on board a man of war for 14 years, and was discharged because I was subject to fits.</p>

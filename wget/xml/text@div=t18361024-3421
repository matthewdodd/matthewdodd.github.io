                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Austin, who keeps the White Hart Tavern in Abchurch-lane. On Saturday afternoon, the 1st of October, between three and four o'clock, the two prisoners came in and asked for a pint of half-and-half—I served them—they gave me a five shilling piece—I am not quite certain which of them gave it me—I detected its being bad immediately—I threw it back to them, and said it was a bad one—they said they were not aware that it was had—I think it was Forbes said so—one of them said he had some halfpence, and gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other gave me a halfpenny.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Basing Tavern, Basing-lane, kept by Mr. Philpot. On the afternoon of the 1st October, between four and half-past four o'clock, the prisoners came into the house together—Tomkins asked for a pint of beer—I served him—he said, "You have drawn me boor—I said, "Yes, you asked for beer"—he said, "I did not; I asked for half-and-half"—I changed it for him—he offered me a good crown-piece—I was going to give him change—he said, "Stay a moment, I have three-pence"—I returned him the crown-piece, and he put it into his pockethe felt in his pocket, and then said he had not so many halfpence as he thought he had, and gave me a bad crown-piece—I told him it was had, and I should wish him to give me the first he offered—he said it was a good one, and I did not know bad money from good—I told him I was accustomed to take a great deal of money, and was confident it was had, and would go and inquire—I went and showed it to Edwin Blunden—I took it in again, and said, "You had better pay me good money, and take</p>

I was on duty in St. Swithin's-lane, on the 10th of October, and met Civiall—she showed me a crown-piece and asked me if it was a good one—I marked it, and returned it to her—I told her it was bad, and that I would come round to the bar door, where the prisoners were—I did so, and found them both there—Taylor was trying to take something out of Civiall's hand—I did not see him get it—Forbes was standing by the side of him, and was just going off—I sent for Bates—I seized Forbes—Turl the inspector searched him, and found a good five-shilling-piece on him.</p>

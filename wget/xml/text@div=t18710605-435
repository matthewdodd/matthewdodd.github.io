                  </hi>. I am a detective officer, employed by the Treasury in coining cases—in consequence of information, I went with Fife, Price, Brannan, and other officers, to a house in Coldbath Square, Clerkenwell—the door was open—it was about 9.30 in the morning—we went up to the second floor front room—I opened the door, and found the female prisoner standing just inside—she said "You are wrong; next door, Sir"—I went in, and found the male prisoner in bed—I addressed him as Williams, and told him my name was Brannan, and he was suspected of coining, and I had received instructions from the solicitor to the Treasury to look after him as a coiner—he said "All right"—I found, in a cupboard, near the fire-place, a plaster-of-Paris mould for making half-crowns, the obverse and reverse sides complete, two galvanic batteries, three pair of iron clams, files with white metals in their teeth, as if recently used, a quantity of mixed metal, solder, filings of granulated metal, knives and scissors, with plaster adhering to them, bottles of acid, and plaster-of-Paris, in powder—under the bed was a bushel basket, full of plaster-of-Paris, broken up, which I believe had been moulds; the impressions were partly effaced; six counterfeit crowns, thirty-one counterfeit half-crowns, and a number of shillings and ten-franc pieces—I gave the room up to the landlady, with a request that nobody should be admitted till I returned, as I was engaged at Clerkenwell Police Court; but next morning, she gave me a crown, a half-crown, seven shillings, and these three letters—there were all the materials for making, colouring, and coating counterfeit coin, wires, screws, and porous pots—I compared the half-crowns with the mould, and they corresponded; they also correspond in date with a good crown I found there, and with the crown uttered by the female prisoner at the Zoological Gardens—the male prisoner said, in the female prisoner's presence, "The woman is innocent"—she said nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was a small room, with one bed in it—the male prisoner was in bed—he said "Don't hurt her; she is innocent"—I do not think he said "Don't hurt my wife," but I will not positively swear it—I have known him for years, and have had my eye upon him—I have not seen the woman with him, but I have seen her going to the house—I know her, but I am afraid my knowledge will not serve you much—I saw her two or three days before this—they only had one bed-room.</p>

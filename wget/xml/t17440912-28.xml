We walked along Hog-Lane till we came to the Baker and Basket , and then I felt Roach's hand in my breeches pocket; finding his hand in my pocket, I called out to Mr. Newton and told him I was robbed: with that he turned from my left side to Roach and collared him, and then they skuffled together in the road - I lost 8 s. - I had in that pocket 23 or 24 s. and in my left hand pocket I had 3 guineas - I did not know what I had lost till I came home. Mr. Newton secured Roach that night, and the next morning he told me he had taken the other; the Constable shewed me a paper which was taken from Roach, which was a bill of parcels I had taken that night in Shoreditch of 30 l. odd money.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the bill of parcels in that pocket the money was in?</p>
               <p>Brampton. I can't tell which pocket it was in; whether it was my waistcoat or breeches pocket. - I had 13 s. when I came home - A watchman and Mr. Newton went home along with me. - I am sure I lost 8 s. and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Jury. You say the Prisoner said to Newton you are heavy loaden, was you in liquor?</p>

            . I was along with Mr. Brampton at the Swan Tavern, with a person he paid twenty six guineas to: Mr. Brampton was very much in liquor and wanted a coach. I said, if they would give me a broomstick I would see him home; these two lads were at the end of Hog-Lane, and I had a full sight of them. They said, master, you are very heavy loaden ; and, as Mr. Brampton says, they agreed to go with us, and Roach took hold of his right arm: we went together as far as the Baker and Basket in Hog-Lane; then Brampton said, hollo, Newton! the fellow has got his hand in my pocket, and said that his pocket was picked. I had got the broomstick in my hand, and I said I would knock his brains out if he offered to move, and then the money fell down - I don't know how much: then he pretty artfully catched hold of me and threw me over the rails into the road, but we both tumbled over together. Bucklimes was looking for the money: I still held Roach by the collar, and Bucklimes seeing I had managed him, held this stick up and said, G - d - your eyes , if you don't let him go, I'll knock your brains out; when I had him down I cried out murder, and in some little time the watch came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of the money?</p>
               <p>Newton. I'll tell you, Sir; I found one shilling that night, and there were three shillings found afterwards - The money was found in the place where Brampton lay down, for he was very drunk.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you hear the money chink after Brampton told you his pocket was picked?</p>
               <p>Newton. Yes, and the money dropped out of Roach's hand; there was some money found in the tenter ground, and some in King Street. Roach was carried to the watch-house, and that money was delivered to me at the watch-house, and one shilling was found in his shoes: then I went home with Mr. Brampton and examined his pockets; the next morning Roach was examined before a Justice of the peace, and there he said I had robbed him of 3 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Roach. What was the first place I met you at?</p>
               <p>Newton. It was at the end of Hog-Lane.</p>
               <p>- Bricknell (Constable). This note was taken out of Roach's hand in the watch-house, and there was a shilling found upon the ground near him - The watchmen were searching him when this paper was taken out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Jury. When did Mr. Brampton fall down?</p>
               <p>Brampton. Not till after my pocket was picked.</p>

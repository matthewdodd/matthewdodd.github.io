            . I missed these articles on the morning of the 15th of January, when I was going on board a ship in the river - I had seen them about five o'clock on the evening before; these are them - the prisoner was on board.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH. About seven o'clock last Thursday morning, the prosecutor went below, and missed these articles; he came up and said so; I said, "Then I will go and look for the boy," meaning the prisoner, who the Captain had allowed to stay on board for charity; he had been on board the same morning - I found him in Ratcliff-highway, about ten or eleven o'clock; he had the cap on his head, a pair of boots on his legs, and the looking-glass.</p>
               <p>BOVD SILVESTER. I am an officer. I took the prisoner; and took this cap from his head, and this pair of boots from his legs; I asked him where he had sold the other pair of boots: he said "That way for 6s.;" I went, but could not find the place - I afterwards got this coat, and this pair of boots in a public-house; the people recognised him, and said he left them; I asked him if these were the things he left; he said Yes - one pair of boots, which were quite new, have not been found.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

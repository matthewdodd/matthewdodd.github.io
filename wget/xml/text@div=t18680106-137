                  </hi>. I am an outfitter, of 233, Upper Street, Islington—the prisoner is my son, and lived with me—on 28th December, about half-past one o'clock, I was at dinner with my daughter and her husband, Mr. Grubb, and their three children—I was conversing with Mr. Grubb about</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186801060024"></xptr>
               <p>the Christmas holiday, and the prisoner, who was in the room, called out to Mr. Grubb, "You are a liar"—the prisoner was not dining with us, he had had his dinner—Mr. Grubb asked him if he was alluding to him; he said that he was; he asked him a second time, and he said that he was—he got up and they had a little tussle together, and I think Mr. Grubb said that he would put him out of the room—I did not interfere in any way during the altercation; I still continued to sit there—I heard the prisoner behind me sharpening a shoemaker's knife, and with that he put one arm around my head, drew my head back, and with the other hand he drew the knife across my throat—I put my hands up to save my throat, and got three fingers cut—my throat was cut too, and there was another attempt down below, where he cut through six folds of my linen shirt, but did not wound my skin—he said nothing to me—I did not bleed a great deal from my throat, but very much from the wounds on my hands—I cannot say whether he was drunk or sober, I had not seen him since about twelve that day, and had not spoken to him at all that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son-in-law of the last witness, and live with him—we were at dinner on 28th December, and the prisoner was standing at the back of his father's chair with his back towards him—my father-in-law and I were talking about something, having nothing to do with him, and he suddenly turned round and called me a liar—after that we had some words—I was eating my dinner, and my wife suddenly said, "Knife!" I looked up and saw him suddenly with his hand across his father's forehead—I immediately pounced on him, seized him I believe by the wrist, and held his hand, which enabled my wife to take the knife out of his hand, and give it to a servant, who ran away with it—it was a shoemaker's knife—my father-in-law struggled away and went to a doctor's, and the prisoner got upon me, but did not do me any particular harm—he was given in custody.</p>

               <p>of it, and was perhaps more excited than usual in consequence of that—my wife asked him if he was tipsy, and he said, "No, I am not," and seemed quite angry with her for asking him—he is generally like that after taking drink, rather excited—I have not observed anything wrong in his mind—he is very harmless, except that when he has been out his blood seems excited, and he fancies this, that, and the other, but I think he is perfectly sane—he fancies that he is entitled to money which his father has, which is an erroneous idea; his father has been very liberal—he fancies that his father ought to give him more money than he has—he is not under any delusion that he has a right to it as his own money—he has no other fancies—I never noticed anything else.</p>

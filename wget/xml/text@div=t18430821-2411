                  </hi>. I am shopman to Thomas Vesper, a pawnbroker, in Sydney-place, Commercial-road. On the afternoon of the 8th of August the prisoner came and asked me for a pair of shoes—I said there were some on a ladder outside the door—she looked at some, and said there were none to fit her—she went away—a person then spoke to me—I looked, and missed some shoes—the prisoner afterwards passed the shop—I sent the foreman after her—he brought her back, and she was asked if she had not got a pair of shoes—she denied it—we said a person saw her take them—she still denied it—the foreman then asked where she had been—she said, "Down the Highway to redeem a gown and a sheet"—these shoes were found beneath her shawl—they are my master's.</p>

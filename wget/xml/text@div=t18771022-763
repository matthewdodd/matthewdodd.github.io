                  </hi>. I lodge at 24, Red Lion Street, and am a packer employed at Covent Garden Market—I occupy the front kitchen with my wife and two children—on 3rd October I left home with my wife, my</p>

               <p>children were at school; my wife locked the room, leaving nobody there—she put the key in her pocket—I left her, and went to Covent Garden Market, and about 12.50 she came and told me something—I went home and found the door burst open, and the room in great disorder—the bed was in one place, and the mattress in another, and I could see that there had been a fire; it had been put out—the bed and mattress had been burnt; we had no bedstead—there was very little fire burning when I left, only as much as you could put in your hand, and no gas—the bed was usually rolled up and put in a corner, but on that day it was not rolled up, because we wanted to go out, and it was huddled up in a corner, where a spark could not get to it—when I got back the bed was dis<lb></lb>tributed all over the kitchen, it had been removed out of the corner, and torn to pieces to put the fire out—I also found part of the sheets—the walls are wood, they were not burnt at all, but the floor was burnt close to where the bed was, and under the mantelpiece it was all charred—the prisoner was formerly landlord—I cannot say whether he was then—his sister used to come for the rent—he did not live in the house—I have heard Mm say a great many times that sooner than lose the house through not being able to pay the rent he would burn it, and all the b——people in it—when he gave way to drink he always said so, but not when he was in his sober senses—I went to the fire brigade station, and gave information to the police—the value of my things was 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I am a bootmaker, of 24, Red Lion Street—the prisoner is my landlord—on 3rd October he came into my shop a little before 12 o'clock and stopped there some time until he saw Mr. and Mrs. Lintott go out, and then within a minute he went towards the kitchen, and was absent about a quarter of an hour, and came back and eat down in my shop again, but said nothing till some people passing saw smoke coming from the front kitchen, and I said, "It looks as if the house was on fire, Leach"—he said, "It does"—Lintott's little girl then went through, and came back and halloed out, "Oh, Mr. Leach, the house is on tire"—he said nothing, but sat there till the alarm was given, and then I told him to go out, and I locked my shop door and went down to the kitchen and found the door open and a great smoke and a blaze—I could hardly get in for the smoke, and I told the women to fetch some water—thu mattress and bedding were all piled up against the fireplace, level with the mantelpiece—I soused water over it and turned it over—there was a bundle of wood between the mattress and the floor; not the whole bundle, it was opened and it was burning with the mattress—there was a mass of blaze altogether—the floor was burnt and part of the mantel-piece and the wainscoting—after I put the fixe out I came upstairs and saw Leach standing on the threshold, where some people were accusing him of it, and he said "I mean to burn the b——lot out," and with that he went away—he has been in the habit of drinking on and off all the time I have known him, about eight months—I can't say that he was drunk on this day.</p>

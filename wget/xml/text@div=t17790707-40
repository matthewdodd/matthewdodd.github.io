While I was showing, them to her, I missed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070051"></xptr> something off the counter from underneath the goods I was showing her; presently Owen put her hand to her pocket-hole, I suppose to pull something up between her legs; she said there was none that she liked, and asked if we should have any more soon; I said, yes, I believed on Saturday; they then said they would come on Saturday, and went out of the shop; I sent two of my young men after her; but they not bringing her back, I went after her myself. I began feeling about her petticoats, and she dropped the lawn from under her petticoats; I saw it drop.</p>

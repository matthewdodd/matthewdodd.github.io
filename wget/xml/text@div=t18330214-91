On the evening of the 5th of January, I came home and found the prisoner in the warehouse, in conversation with my lad; when he saw me, he turned about and asked if we could tell him where the cork-cutter lived; I said I did not like his coming to the place so late in the evening - I detained him, and found this fish-sauce and other things on him; I sent for the officer, and gave charge of him - he had before produced one of the bottles of pickles, and said that was all he had, but the whole of these were found on him, some in his bat, and some in his pockets - I am agent to Mr. Griglietti, and these were his property; ours is a wholesale warehouse; we do not sell small quantities.</p>

            . I am in the service of the prosecutor. The prisoner was in the habit of coming to the warehouse to sell jars, and he used to have things from there. On the evening in question he came and asked for these things - I delivered them to him; he said he wanted them for a relish; he was going off with them when the witness came in - the prisoner used to give me a halfpenny or a penny at different times.</p>

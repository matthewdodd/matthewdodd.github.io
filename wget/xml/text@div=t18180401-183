I left the table to get my great-coat, and recollected that I had left my snuff-box on the table - I returned, but could not find it. The table had been cleared where I sat-the prisoner was the man who waited upon me at table. I applied to Mr. Cuff. The prisoner turned his pockets inside out to convince us he had not got it. I found it next day in the officer's hands.</p>

He was searched, but the box was not found on him. After business was over, I went to a public-house with him. We got into conversation about the box. We then went into another public-house in Little Queen-street - he asked for a pipe of tobacco - I then saw the snuff-box between his neck and neckcloth; he took it out and gave it to me - I secured him, but let him go. Next morning I informed Mr. Cuff, and he was apprehended.</p>

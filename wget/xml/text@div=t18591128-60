                  </hi> I live at 73, Belitha-street, Caledonian-road, and am a house painter—on 12th August last I lent the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he was to repay me, but did not—somewhere about 27th August he came again and said he had a bill from Mr. Clark, of Towcester, and could I let him have a little money on it—he had altogether 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of me, at different times—this was a bill of exchange for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was to pay the balance when the bill became due—I went to Smith, Payne's, with the bill on the Monday, but there were no effects—I let it go about five weeks, and then I wrote to Towcester, to Mr. Clark—I did not get the money—no Mr. Clark took up the bill.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Is the acceptance in that bill in my writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not—when the bill was dishonoured, I said you had better write to Mr. Clark—I did not see a letter that you wrote—I never posted a letter directed to Mr. Clark—you said you had done business with Mr. Clark before the acceptance of that bill, and that you were in the habit of travelling about from time to time—I am not aware that Mr. Clark lived at your house for two or three months—when I gave you in-custody I expected that the money would be paid—I did not, particularly, intend to compound what I called a felony—when the case was before the Magistrate, I did not state to a party, that if</p>

               <p>the money was paid I would say Mr. Clark had paid the money to me, and the case would be done with—when you brought that bill, in the first instance, I objected to it, and said I would rather have one for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> I am a shoemaker and live at Northampton—I know the prisoner—I lived in his house in London at one time—I left on 2d August—I went to Towcester in Northamptonshire—I have lived in the High-street there, but not for this last two years—I never accepted any bill of exchange for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that acceptance is not in my writing—I have seen it before—I had nothing to do with it—I gave the prisoner no authority to use it—there is one more John Clark in Towcester that I know of; a shoemaker—he does not travel about; he never did in my remembrance—he is a working journeyman shoemaker.</p>

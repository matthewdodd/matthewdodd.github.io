               <p>I am a constable. On the 16th of February, which was Sunday morning, about eight o'clock, I saw Prosser and another man walking on Thames street, towards London bridge, Prosser had this bundle under his arm; they went out of Thames-street into <placeName id="t17940430-86-crimeloc461">Little Bush-lane</placeName>

When I got into the warehouse Prosser said, here is another of us coming, I asked him what was that he brought? he answered me, why, if it was mine, I might have it or take it; I asked him again, what it was? he said, it is ginger; he broke the paper, made a hole in the paper bag, and said, you see it is ginger; I asked him what he was going to do with it? I am not positive to the answer he made me directly at that time; but he said he was going to carry it to one Mr. Hanson's, Maid-lane, in the Borough. Mr. Jones said, Mr. Wainwright it is only fourteen pounds weight of ginger, it is not worth notice, and not of any account. Prosser said, he had brought it from St. Saviour's church yard; I told him I thought it very odd he should bring it from St. Saviour's church yard and have it to carry again to Maid-lane, almost there again. I told him I was not satisfied with that, I should take him into custody; I said Mr. Jones do you know the man? he said he knew him very well; says I, do you think he has come honestly by it? he said he did not doubt but what he had, I told him I was rather dubious of the matter, I should take him into custody; why then, says he, I have brought it from Smithfield, and I was to deliver it last night, and I am going to deliver it this morning, he said he was a <rs id="t17940430-86-deflabel462" type="occupation">porter</rs>

Mr. Jones, I had not him in custody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this Mr. Jones deal in ginger? - I don't know, he <rs id="t17940430-86-deflabel463" type="occupation">deals in indigo and drugs</rs>

               <p>Q. Have you found any body that has lost this ginger? - It has been advertised, but never owned.</p>

               <p>Wainwrigt. Here is a note that Prosser produced before my Lord Mayor, where he bought it; before my Lord Mayor on Monday, he said he had a friend in the country that had sent him a letter out of the country, with an order to buy him fourteen pounds weight of ginger, and that he bought that fourteen pounds of ginger, and that he called on Mr. Jones, Sunday morning, to know whether he could get it ground, and he said he bought it of Mr. Hamson, Maid-lane; I asked him what he gave for it? be said he gave fourteen shillings for it, he said he had not got the receipt, but he believed he could find it; my Lord put him back till Tuesday, and ordered me to get Hamson, to know whether he had bought it of him or no, and Mr. Hamson said he had not.</p>

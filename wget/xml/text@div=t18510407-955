                  </hi>. I am butler to Mr. Henry Buckle—he lives at No. 40, Westbourn-terrace. On Tuesday, 25th February, Connibeer called on me in the evening—he went in the pantry—there is a cupboard there; the key of it is generally turned, but it was in the door—there was a plate-chest in the room, the key was in it—I will not swear it was locked—Connibeer left at five minutes before nine o'clock in the evening, and on looking at the plate the next morning I missed a table-spoon out of the cupboard—I had seen it safe on the evening of the 25th—on Friday I went to Connibeer's house and did not see him, bat I left word, and he came to me in the evening—I told him I felt confident, as there was nobody else in the pantry but him that evening, that he took the table-spoon—he said he did not—I told him I was confident he did—he said sooner than I should suspect him be would pay for the spoon or half-a-dozen spoons—he said if I would give him the name of a silversmith he would go and get one made—I gave him the name of a silversmith in Cheapside—I saw him again on the Saturday; he called, and said he had not been able to go, but if I would meet him on Monday morning, and take a table-spoon with me for a pattern, he would have one made and pay for it—on Sunday, the day afterwards, I went at half-past five o'clock to the plate-chest for a salad-spoon and a fork that we have for dinner every Sunday—I then missed two forks—I had seen the plate safe in the chest on the Monday morning before—I had not occasion to go to the chest again till the Sunday—I gave the prisoner in custody on Monday, the 3rd March.</p>

I was standing at the door with the boy; the boy asked the tall man if he would buy any clothes; he said, no, he could buy them of his master; the boy asked him who was his master; he told him he was over the way; he immediately knocked him down; I told the man he had better desist, and not do it again, or else he would get into trouble; I endeavoured to pull the boy in, when the other prisoner came up, I shut to the half door, and bolted it; I had not time to put to the top door; they both rushed in, and knocked me down on the counter; there was a candle on the counter, which was likewise knocked down; they both came in, and the short man 
               <persName id="t18030420-62-person564">drew</persName>
             a knife upon me, and swore a very wicked oath; we had been serving clothes, and I saw the tall man take two garments off the counter.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they get over the hatch, or force it? - A.They broke the hatch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the bolts broke? - A. Yes; there was a kind of hasp, and that was broke in two; I shewed it to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200065"></xptr>it after this man had been in the shop that they were taken? - A. I believe, about half an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. What time in the evening was it? - A. Between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had just before been serving some customers? - A. Mr. Nathan had.</p>

               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you always charge more for a coat with a velvet collar than for a coat without? - A. No, we don't make any difference in old garments.</p>
               <p>Q.One of the men drew a knife upon you? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Was not that knife which has been shewn to you, upon your oath, the knife that your husband had been himself continually in the habit of using? - A. I did not see the knife.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you not a conversation with Trott about the knife? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not admit to them that it was your husband's knife? - A. No, I never did.</p>

               <p>Q.Have you not exprssly stated, that these men were never in your shop at all? - A. I could never have said that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said it? - A. No, I never did, or any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to the officers at the time the men were taken, that they had taken the great coats? - A. I said, I was robbed; but I was in too much confusion to recollect exactly what I said; both the officers were disguised in liquor; Mr. Nowlan got a reprimand from the Magistrate; I told them I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been selling any other garment that evening in your shop? - A. Yes; Mr. Nathan had been selling some pantaloons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any pantaloons? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Who were the officers? - A. Trott and Nowlan, belonging to Lambeth-street; when Mr. Nathan came home, I went immediately for an officer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did you not tell me, that you did not tell the officers what you were robbed of, because they were disguised in liquor? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not tell me, that the officers were intoxicated? - A. I told you I was confused, and did not know hardly what I said to the officers.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you or not know, at the time the officers came, what you had been robbed of? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot undertake to say, whether you told them what you had been robbed of? - A. I cannot; I told them I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. They were taken to the watch-house, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you or the officers go to the watch-house? - A. I could not get at it, there was such a riot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the constable of the night that night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you tell the constable of the night you had been robbed of two great coats? - A. I told him I had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not confused then? - A. I was very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a long time after it happened? - A. No, it was not long.</p>
               <p>Q.Surely you could not have been so much agitated at that time? - A. I don't know that I told him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go to Lambeth-street on the Monday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Again I ask you, did you not tell both Trott and Nowlan that this man had not robbed you of any thing? - A. I never said any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q.Again I ask you, did you not say they had never been in the shop? - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Your servant's name was Mary Cotterell, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether she is here, or not? - A. I have seen her in Court; she was knocked down at the same time in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. The first of this transaction took place when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200066"></xptr>the men were passing by, and the boy accosted them as usual? - A. Yes; I saw the tall man, I dare say, twenty minutes before, on the opposite side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the man say he did not want to buy any thing, and upon his opening his mouth, being an Irishman, did you not call him a Vinegar-hill rebel? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was no such expression used by your servant? - A. Not that I heard of.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, was no such expression made use of? - A. I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Q.And you were standing by him all the time? A. I am very sure he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You would have us to understand, he knocked the boy down without any provocation whatever? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never said, you were robbed of a waistcoat and two coats? - A.Never.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to that? - A. I said, who is my master; upon that, he up with his fist, and knocked me down; then my mistress tried to save me, when the shortest man came up to my mistress, and knocked her down; then we shut the door, as well as we could, but we had not power to shut the top hatch; they forced the hatch, and broke the bolts off; they broke two or three of the windows, and knocked down the candle on the counter; we had a customer, who wanted to buy a pair of pantaloons and a waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they do any thing to your mistress after they got in? - A. The little one drew a knife upon her.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. Did you see which way they went? - A. They ran right over the way into a court; I don't recollect the name of the court, I believe it is White-horse-court.</p>
               <p>Q.Directly opposite your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a thoroughfare? - A. No; with the fright my mistress fainted away; I said, mistress, don't be uneasy, for I know the men who robbed you.</p>
               <p>Q.Did she call out before the men went out of the shop? - A. She called out, when the men went out with the two coats, murder! fire! I am robbed.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see what became of them afterwards? - A. No; I shut the door, and ran after my master, and after the officers; I could not find my master, he came home while I was out.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find a constable? - A. I could not find one on the beat; I went up to the watch-house, and brought two with me.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the reason of your leaving Mr. Davis? - A.Because he did not give me money enough; he gave me seven shillings a week, and I had to board myself.</p>
               <p>Q.Who did you live with before? - A. Mr. Phillips.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you lived with him at that time? - A.About a twelvemonth; it may be four or five years ago.</p>

               <p>Q. You are sure the bolt was off? - A. Yes, the bolt was given into my hands by a servantmaid; one staple seemed to have been forced out by some means or other.</p>

Yes; as soon as we went into the house, she said she was very glad we came; I asked her what was the matter; she said, there were a parcel of Irish people had bred a riot about her house, and broke her windows; I asked her what was the cause of it, and she said there was one Leary, that lived right opposite, who always took an advantage when her husband was out of the way, to send these Irish people to breed a riot, and to ill treat her; I asked her what they had done; she desired I would lay hold of the candle, and see the window broke; there were two squares of glass, and likewise the bolt of the hatch; the staple that held the bolt was broke; I asked her whether they had stole any thing, and she said, no, I cannot say that they have; I asked her if they came into the house, and she said no, they had not come beyond the threshold; I asked her if she knew their names, or where they lived; she said, they lived in Whitehorse-court, of just opposite; she knew their names, and where they lived; she said, I insist upon your going and taking charge of them immediately; I told her no, I did not think I was justified, as I saw no peace broke; I told her to come up on Monday night to get a warrant, and I would apprehend them for her, and get them punished.</p>
               <p>Q. If she had told you a felony had been committed, you would immediately have apprehended them? - A.Immediately; Mr. Nowlan said, if you will not take charge of them, the patrols will; I replied, if the patrols do wrong, that is no reason I should; that is all I know till I saw them on the Monday morning at the Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you they had knocked her down upon the counter? - A. No, she did not; we asked her several times if she had been robbed of any thing, and she said, no; I was called in before the Magistrate, and asked why I did not take charge of them for the felony; I was sworn, I declared, upon oath, she did not charge them with felony; and then she said it was Trott.</p>

               <p>Q.Upon your oath, do you mean to swear you told the Magistrate you had asked her the question, and she had told you she had lost nothing? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to tell me so at first? - A. I did not rightly understand the question.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You lived servant with Mrs. Nathan? - A. Yes, my mistress told me to come here as a witness, and she would make me a present of a gown and a petticoat.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose? - A. To come and swear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200071"></xptr>against these men; she told me, as I was an Irish person, and a Christian, a word from me would go farther than ten from her.</p>
               <p>Q. She is a Jewess? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise her you would come? - A. No, I refused to come.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of your refusing to come, did she do any thing? - A. When I found the purpose for which she gave it me, I threw the gown at her, and the petticoat she tore off my side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she keep you in her service, or did she dismiss you? - A. I left her place.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of not appearing against these men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you see the men in the shop, or see them attempt to take any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet this woman asked you to swear against them? - A. Yes; I said, they had never been in doors, and she said, Oh, you fool, there is no harm in taking an English oath, any more than kissing a thumb.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this, you left her service? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. She told you it would be a special recommendation, not only that you were a Christian, but an Irish woman, you are sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what religion are you? - A. I am a Roman Catholic; there was one of the panes of glass broke when I first came there, and the other she broke herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there when this riot took place? - A. Yes, on Saturday night; these two men passed by the door, and her barker and herself stood by the door plying customers, and they wanted to bring these men in by force as customers, and the men refused to come in; they were rather in liquor to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in liquor? - A.These two men; then they said, they would come in to no d-d Jew's house; then she said, d-n them, let them go, for they are Irish rebels, they are Vinegar-hill rebels; then the barker went and struck the men, and the men struck the barker; upon that, my mistress and I got the barker in doors; then the barker broke the bolt off the door to get out to sight them, and my mistress broke one pane of glass.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she break the pane of glass for? - A. She was trying to get out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who prevented her getting out? - A.The door was locked, and the barker broke the lock off the door to get out, and she broke the square of glass trying to keep the men in doors; she and I endeavoured to keep the barker in, and after she had broke the glass, she fell in a faint.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that for; nobody touched her? -- A. No; but she was frightened; there was nobody in doors but the barker, and I, and my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. So this little fellow, the barker, had a great desire to go out and fight these two great men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the officer when he came, that it was the barker that broke off the bolt, and not the man? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told Trott and Nathan it was the barker that broke off the bolt, and not the men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are quite sure of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he had broke off the bolt, and got out, what did he do then? - A. We kept him in, we would not let him go out, and the men returned again.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you? - A. I was inside the shop door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see which way the men went? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What prevented the man getting out, when the bolt was off? - A. My mistress and I prevented him.</p>
               <p>Q. But your mistress fainted away? - A. She came to again, she was not long in a saint; he only tore off one bolt; the door was not opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when you went out of Court, was not you in the gallery? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. So you told all this to the officers, Nowlan, and to the others? - A. No, I did not tell them nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell them the barker broke off the bolt? - A. Yes, that was the night the men were taken up; my mistress said they had not stole any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. But you told them, the barker pulled off the bolt? - A. My mistress herself told them so.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Nowlan.) Did this woman tell you the barker had torn off the bolt? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And did her mistress tell you so? - A. No; my mistress told me the men burst it open; my master said, he could not confine the men, if he did not say they stole the coats.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. Q.Did you ever hear where these men lived? - A. No, I never saw the men till I saw them the day before yesterday; I saw one of them at the Old-bailey, and the other at Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Lee. One of them lives in Blue Anchor-yard, and the other in White Horse-court.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you live in the neighbourhood of Rosemary-lane when you are in London? - A. I live opposite the prosecutrix's door; the two men at the bar were passing; Levy plied them in the usual way, do you want any clothes? they said they did not want any; he heard their tongues were Irish, and said you b - y Vinegar-hill rebels; his mistress came out, and said we will give the Irish crew their due, or something to that purpose; the men enraged at the expression returned, and asked for what reason they called them rebels; the man very properly could make no reply, and they asked him again why he called them Vinegar-hill rebels, and they could like to have satisfaction for what he had said; a scuffle of course (the men being enraged) ensued, and they struck the man; he told them he had licked half a dozen Irishmen before, and he was sure he could lick half a dozen now; the tallest of the men made a blow at him, and he ran in doors.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they ever go into the shop? - A.They never went into the door at all: Mrs. Nathan came out, and said let them go, they are Vinegar-hill rebels; they might have been gone ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, when they came back again; Nathan's man put up his hand to his mouth, and abused the men again; the mob gathered, and Mrs. Nathan got a rattle from somewhere; when Mr. Nathan came home, she gave him the rattle into his hand to spring.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.There was no scuffle ensued before Mr. Nathan came home? - A. Yes, there was, because Nathan's man blew after them, and made use of horrid expressions.</p>

            . I am porter at the Old Hummums, Covent-garden. On the 20th of March a gentleman in the house asked for a porter; I went to him in a room called the Old Rose, in the Old Hummums; he asked me to fetch a badge porter from the Temple; I told him I was a porter myself, and could do anything that a badge porter could do, and that my master was responsible for anything he wished me to do; he said, No, he wished me to go to the temple and fetch a badge porter - I asked him the name of the porter he wanted; he said Hopkinson - I asked if he was not there, whether any other would do - he said I was to bring any one. He did not say what he wanted the porter for. I took Burt to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round, and say if the prisoner is the man who employed you - A. I cannot say, for when I saw the man he was naked; I cannot say whether he is the person or not. I went up with Burt, opened the door, and said that was the gentleman who wanted him, but I did not see the gentleman. I shewed him into the same room. I only enquired of Burt for Hopkinson.</p>

            . I am a Temple porter. On Saturday, the 20th of March, the last witness came for me at the Temple, and took me to the Old Hummums. I followed him to the top of the house; he knocked at the door, and said he could not find Hopkinson, but had brought me. I went into the room - the gentleman was not dressed; he asked what o'clock it was; I said half-past ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man he introduced you to - A. Yes, he is. He gave me 2 s., and told me to get him a 1 s. 6 d. bill-stamp; he said I was to get it at Pounce's in Long-are - I came back with it, and gave him 4 d. change. He wrote me a direction to go to the Bull-inn, Leadenhall-street, to take a place by the Brighton three o'clock coach, to take him up at the Elephant and Castle (looking at a direction;) this is what he gave me, and at the same time gave me this cheque (looking at it;) I can swear to it, because here is his hand-writing on the back; he wished me to get the money. He said he was going to Charing-cross to breakfast, and if I came back before he returned, I was not to go up stairs, but to wait outside the door till he came to me; he told me to take the cheque to Messrs. Pattisall and Bond, No. 2, Change-alley.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he say why you were to wait outside the door - A. No; he only told me to wait for him outside the door. I got him to write down on the back of the cheque what I was to get for it, in case I should forget; (looking at the back) - he said four 50 l. notes, and fifty sovereigns. I went to Messrs. Pattisall and Bond, and presented it to Mr. Pearson - he looked at it for a few minutes, and then went backwards, returned to me, and asked who I brought it from; I told him. I was then handed into a back room, where I saw Mr. Pattisall, who went back with me to the Hummums; I went up stairs and the prisoner was gone. I stopped there till two or three o'clock in the afternoon, went again at four, but saw no more of him till I saw him on the Monday at Bow-street. I left the cheque at the banking-house, in the clerk's hands, with the direction.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was the bedroom light, or was the window curtain down - A. I did not notice; it was light enough for me to see him; he was writing at a table - he had no coat, boots, or hat on; there was daylight enough for me to see him, and to have a full view of him - I was close to him at the table; he was sitting down; I stood at his side. I am sure that I know him again. I know all the Temple porters: there is no one of the name of Hopkinson. I belong to the Inner Temple - there are six of us, and three at the Middle Temple.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Look at the cheque and see if you have written anything on it to know it again - A. Yes; I wrote my initials J. B. on it at the banking-house. I know all the badge porters by sight; I do not know such a name.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you went to the hotel, he was in his shirt - without coat, hat, or boots on - A. Yes, I was about ten minutes in his company. I was gone about ten minutes for the stamp, and did not observe, when I returned, whether he was any further dressed. I am quite sure that the prisoner is the person. I never had a doubt of it. I did not see him again till the Monday, and then knew him directly - he had a white great coat on at the office.</p>
               <p>The direction was here read, and was as follows.</p>

             and Co., and has kept cash at our house for four or five years. This cheque(looking at it) was presented at our house on Saturday the 20th of March, about twelve o'clock. We generally have more cheques presented on a Saturday than on any other day, and twelve o'clock is a very busy hour with us. Burt is the man who presented it. I immediately saw that it was a forgery, the hand-writing being a little different to Mr. Ridley's, and it not bearing a private mark, which we had agreed upon with Ridley about fifteen or sixteen months ago. I gave the cheque to Mr. Pattisall. I wrote my initials, J. P., on it at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know a man named Pullen - Yes, he has kept cash at our house. I am not aware that there was any suspicion upon him. Mr. Pattisall was up stairs when the cheque was presented. I saw him on the subject. I did not hear him say any thing about Pullen.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you look for the private mark on the cheque - A. Not for five or ten minutes after I had declared it a forgery. I detected the forgery by the handwriting, and looked for the mark afterward - that confirmed my opinion, but I should not have paid it from the writing. It is like Ridley's writing.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. From the first moment you saw it had you any doubt whether it was his hand-writing or not - A. None.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. How do you know that Ridley has no partner - A. We have only his signature as drawer, and I know there was a dissolution some time ago, and he has never given us any intimation of his having a partner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that Pullen's cheques have been paid into your house on account of Ridley - A. Not that I am aware of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that one Smith was clerk to Pullen - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When Burt presented the cheque, what did you do with it - A. I took it to Mr. Pattisall, and he went to the Hummums with Burt.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 20th of March, about a quarter to ten o'clock at night, I apprehended the prisoner at the Old Hummums, Covent-garden. I had been waiting at the house all day for him. When he came into the parlour I asked what his name was - he said 
               <persName id="t18240407-89-person839">
                  Samuel

            . I said,</p>
               <p>"Where do you live" - he said next door but one to the White Hart at Reigate. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have sent a porter into the City this morning with a cheque for 250 l." - he said he had. I replied that that cheque was a forgery - he said he had taken it of Mr. Smith in the Strand. I said,</p>
               <p>"I will accompany you to Mr. Smith" - he said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, it is of no consequence." I searched him, and found some oxalic acid in a phial, and a small quantity in a paper not mixed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the effect of that - A. I have taken it to a chemist, but did not see him try any experiment. I took him to Bow-street - he gave his name there as John Hill Wagstaff.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He told you he got it from Smith - A. Yes, and said Smith lived in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he lived in the Strand, or that he got it from him - A. He said he got it from Smith in the Strand. I said I would go to Smith with him; he paused for a moment, and then said it was of no consequence.</p>
               <p>The cheque was here put in and read. See indictment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - A man placed at this bar, conscious of guilt, and forced to hear its detail in evidence, with a knowledge of the awful punishment that awaits his crime, has indeed a painful and afflicting task to support; but a man placed in my position, conscious of innocence, and forced to listen to a detail of evidence, intended to implicate him in a crime of which he is not guilty, has a part to support, infinitely more painful, infinitely more distressing - a part indeed insupportable! That, Gentlemen, is my position! Gentlemen, were I to take leave of you with this my simple assertion, feeling as I do that it will have its proper weight with you; and feeling, too, that the case laid before you has in it so many doubts and so little of positive proof or confirmation; were I thus to take leave of you, I have a sentiment in my breast which not alone gives me hopes, but that confidently assures me of your verdict of acquittal. My mind, agitated and disturbed as it is; my feelings, harassed and goaded as they are; my wretchedness altogether, does not admit of my calmly and dispassionately sifting, and observing on the evidence; but I have a confidence the Learned Judge will do so on my behalf, at once with humanity and discrimination; and I have firm reliance that you, my Jury, will do me justice. In contemplating an address to you, Gentlemen, I have not collected the various topics likely to bias your judgment through the medium of your feelings; yet that you may know on whose fate you are to decide, I cannot refrain from telling you, that, like some of yourselves, I have been a tradesman - but I have been an unfortunate one; that I now occupy the important relations of husband, father, brother, and, to my aged parents, an only son; that from my earliest age I have been taught habits of honest industry, and that if ever I deviated transiently from that path of honour, it has been occasioned more by the force of untoward and unfortunate circumstances, than from any lack of principle. In the case which has been stated to you, and attempted to be proved, I am sure that you will unhesitatingly decide, that either I must have been confident that I was acting no guilty part, or that I must have been acting the part of a lunatic. And although it is not possible that I can be prepared to produce evidence on oath, to rebut testimony which I could not beforehand know would be set up, yet I may give explanation sufficient to destroy all insinuation, and which I know ought also to repel all accusation. It has transpired in evidence, and an air of importance given to the fact, that there was found on my person, when taken into custody, a small bottle,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070040"></xptr>containing oxalic acid. Now had there happened to have been found on my person a needle and a thread, the very same consequences, by construction, might have attached to these implements. I could not commit forgery with acid, but, on the contrary, it is an article peculiarly calculated to destroy or detect such a scheme on a coloured cheque. But, however awkward or far-fetched the explanation may be, when that explanation is the fact, I venture to make it, fearless of any bad consequences. On reading Bell's Weekly Messenger of the 25th of January last, which fell into my hands, I found the following paragraph, which I shall read to you from the Paper itself. [Here the prisoner read from the paper the paragraph, stating that oxalic acid, in small quantities, was good for punch], and to make the experiments alluded to, I bought the acid. It has been insinuated that I might have had this acid as an immediate and destructive poison, but that idea will vanish when it is known that the bottle was so sealed up that without much trouble it could not be got at. Some stress may be placed on my giving another name than my real one of Wagstaff, but when the Jury are told that I did not appear to an adjourned meeting of my bankruptcy, and that a reward of 100 l. was, in consequence, offered for my apprehension, I am sure that will sufficiently account for my using another name, without looking for the crime of forgery to account for it. You all know, Gentlemen of the Jury, that the expence a ticket porter is not more than that of an ordinary porter at an inn; and that the security is much greater; and, if fraud had been intended, you also know that a ticket porter is more likely to be the cause of its being detected, than any other ordinary porter, inasmuch as the name and address of a ticket porter is more easily traced and obtained. It has been stated in evidence, that part of my instructions to the porter were, that when he returned with the money, he should stop at the door, if I was not in room. It will probably known to the Gentlemen of the Jury, that at the Old Hummums there is no coffee-room; that Gentlemen occasionally sleeping there, as was my case, pay for their bed and leave the house, so that, in fact, the only place I could appoint to meet this porter, was at the door, and I had the less difficulty in doing this, as his name and address were known to me. It is my misfortune, Gentlemen of the Jury, not to be able to place witnesses before you to show you through whom I became possessed of this checque of 250 l.; but there will be no difficulty in satisfying you that it bears no similarity to my hand-writing in any of its parts - and were it necessary, every one who ever saw me write could testify to that. Mr. Smith, from whom I received it, who represented himself as the messenger of Mr. D. Pullen, and who indubitably was so, delivered the checque to me at the door of the New Exchange Coffee-house, in the Strand, on account of Mr. Pullen. With this Mr. Pullen, who was a bill-broker, I had various dealings previous to my leaving London, but availing himself of the circumstances of my being obliged to be out of the way, he took advantage of me, and amongst other bills, which he kept from me, besides money I lent to him, was one for about 240 l., drawn by the very Messrs. 
               <persName id="t18240407-89-person840">Wm. Ridley</persName>
             and Co., who purport to be the drawers of the cheque in question, and for which I never got any value; but lately, I intimated, that, at any personal risk to myself, I would expose him, if he did not pay me something on account, and it was in consequence of this threat of mine, that I received the cheque in question by the hands of Mr. Smith. I never had any address from Mr. Smith, nor do I know him otherwise than as the accredited clerk of Mr. Pullen; I have made every enquiry for him, but in vain. I am sure Gentlemen of the Jury, you will not fail to remark that it is an extraordinary coincidence of circumstances, that this same Mr. Pullen, who sent me the cheque, possessed the bill of 240 l. the signature and hand-writing of Messrs. Ridley and Co. - and Messrs. Ridley and Co. knew that he did so possess that hill - and it is also to be observed by you, that Mr. D. Pullen kept a banking account with Messrs. Bond and Co. These two incidents will account for he or his clerk having the means of obtaining a coloured cheque of Messrs. Bond, Sons, and Co., and the means of imitating the hand-writing of Messrs. Ridley and Co., and added to all this, it is, if possible, more extraordinary that something or other about the cheque should have excited the suspicion both of Messrs. Bond and Co., and Messrs. Ridley and Co., so as to cause them to say as soon as it was presented, that the cheque emanated from Mr. Pullen. Here is Mr. Pullen owing me money; here is a cheque given to me in a hand-writing I was familiar with, and therefore could not doubt its being geniune. Here, then, in the absence of this Mr. Smith, whom I have tried in vain to find, here then is, as I trust you will consider, enough to satisfy you that I had no knowledge of the cheque being a forgery, nor were any of the circumstances under which I received it, or about the cheque itself, calculated to excite in my mind a suspicion that it was a forgery. Gentlemen of the Jury, I would not willingly tire you by needless detail. It must be unnecessary to ask you to divest your minds of anything that has transpired to my prejudice, unconnected with the matter at issue. I confidently repose in your dispasionate decision. My life is in your hands. If you have no doubt of my innocence you will at once relieve me from suspense. Do by me as you think you yourselves would be entitled to be done with in my situation, and I make sure of a favourable determination.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Cope, solicitor for the prisoner. I received directions to go in search of a person named Smith.</p>

               <p>Q. When was the first time you received that direction - A. Yesterday; I went to No. 24, Hutchin-lane, and asked there for a person named Smith, who had been clerk to a Mr. Pullen; the answer I had was that the person did not know the name of Smith, and as for Pullen they knew nothing of him, for he had not lived there for three years. I then went to Mr. Faucett, No. 21, Little St. Thomas Apostle, by Mr. Cope's direction. Faucett was not there; a woman answered me; I asked her where Faucett lived - she said she did not know. I then went to No. 10, Water-lane, and enquired for Mr. Hughes, but did not find him; I asked a woman for him. I made no further enquiry for Smith. I did not know him or Pullen myself.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 5th or 6th of April did you make any enquiry for Smith or Pullen - A. I enquired of a Mr. Ridley about Pullen. I did not tell him what I wanted of him. I was informed that Faucett very likely could inform me, and in consequence of which I went in search of Faucett. I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070041"></xptr>not been able to learn anything of Smith, Pullen, or Paucett.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to take so long time before you enquired - A. I had enquired before; I was first asked about enquiring for Smith.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you been clerk to Cope - A. Nearly four months. I do not know when he was first employed for Wagstaff.</p>
               <p>Q. The 6th was on Tuesday, you made no further enquiry from that time till Sunday - A. No; I was not desired.</p>

            . I live at No. 9, Hercules-buildings, Westminster-road. I do not know Pullen; I know a man named Smith - I do not know in whose employ he was; he was a man who professed to discount bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time about the beginning of last March see a bill in Smith's hands - A. I did; a bill and cheque; the amount of the cheque was 250 l. - it was drawn by Messrs. Ridley and Co., on Messrs. Bond, Sons, and Pattisall; it was on a coloured paper, with yellow bars. I saw it; but did not take any very particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see the cheque - A. Smith was indebted to me in the sum of 30 l. on a cheque, and had been so indebted since the middle of September last. I had repeatedly applied to him for payment, and he had as frequently promised to pay, but always excused himself when I asked him for it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the cheque - A. In the middle of March, in the evening, I was sitting at the Bay-tree tavern, St. Swithin's-lane, kept by one Philpot; I had to meet a gentleman there on business. I was reading the newspaper, Smith came in accidentally, and sat himself down in the same box; I asked for my money, but did not get it. He produced a bill of exchange, and a cheque for 250 l.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. In the early part of March you first saw the cheque in his possession - A. About the middle; it was the latter end of the week, certainly, either on Thursday or Friday in the week previous to my seeing in the paper a report of the arrest of Wagstaff - I will swear that it was either Thursday or Friday; my impression is that it was on Thursday evening - I had known Smith for two or three years; I do not know where he lived in March or February, but can give a very good reason why I did not. I never knew where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any note of his for the 30 l. - A. I had a cheque of another person's, which I had from him, and on which he owed me 30 l.</p>
               <p>Q. You deal a good deal in bills and cheques - A. I do. I have lived but three weeks in Hercules-buildings, before that I lived at No. 8, Waterloo-road, and lived there about three months.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you lived in a much larger house than either of those - A. I was four months in the House of Correction, Clerkenwell; that ended in October, 1822; it was about some bills of Sir

            . I went there by sentence of the Court of King's Bench. Smith had given me a cheque which was not paid. Waterloo-road and Hercules-buildings are not in the rules.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you put to hard labour at the House of Correction - A. No. I think the cheque I saw Smith with was payable to a number - I do not remember what the number was; I noticed the banker's name, as I had a cheque on the same banker myself, and have it here (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with the prisoner - A. I have known him two or three years; I never saw him write. I never knew where Smith lived.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have dealings with a man to the amount of 30 l., and not know where to call on him or to enquire after him - A. I usually found him at the Commercial Coffee-house, Skinner-street. Mr. Cope did not apply to me to know where he was to be found.</p>

               <p>Q. When did he apply to you - A. I met him on Saturday by accident; I knew him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you had known the prisoner two or three years, and heard he had been taken up for forgery, had you never the kindness to go to him and tell him all this - A. I went to him at the House of Correction, but could not get admittance; I never went to Cope. I have seen the prisoner every day since he has been in Newgate; he told me who his attorney would be, but I did not go, as Cope held a judgment against me, and had a writ against me. I told the prisoner of the dealing I had with Smith, and put this cheque into his hands, to make what use he thought proper with it. I told him a fortnight ago that I had been accustomed to meet Smith at the Colonial Coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is the cheque you have produced, now look at the one for 250 l. - A. I have no hesitation in saying it is like it; the writing is not the same. The writing I remember appeared in a tremulous hand; the front of the paper I remember was the same. I did not see the back of it.</p>

On the 24th of October I received this basket containing twelve pairs of boots, it was done up carelessly—it contained this invoice, by which I found that thirteen pairs ought to have come, and I wrote on the bottom of the invoice, "One pair short"—this is my writing on it—I have brought two pairs of the boots that were in the basket, and the officer has produced one pair which were found—these are the three pairs—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—they are all one man's work.</p>

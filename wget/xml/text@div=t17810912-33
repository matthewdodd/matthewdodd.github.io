               <p>On the 17th of July, at about three in the morning, I was, with an acquaintance, coming down Bow-street, Covent-garden. I met the prisoner: she and I went into the <placeName id="t17810912-33-crimeloc168">play-house passage</placeName>

These two men ran up Hart-street. Upon that, the prisoner went out of the passage, and I came out after her. She walked on in Bow-street. My friend told me to search my pockets. When I came down Bow-street, he stood on the outside of the passage. I searched my pockets, and I missed my purse, containing a bank-note for 10 l. five guineas, and some silver. It was taken from my right-hand breeches pocket. I had felt it on coming out of the White-hart tavern. I had been at a feast at the White-hart the day before: I went and spent the evening at Sadler's-Wells, and then returned to the White-hart, and staid till two o'clock. The waiter asked me for my money when I went in, and gave it me when I came out again.</p>
               <p>Why did he ask your money of you? - Because it is a house bad women frequent.</p>
               <p>Did you look to see what was in the purse when he gave it you back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you quite sober? - I was really sensible, but not quite sober. I followed the prisoner, and demanded my purse. She denied it. The watchman happening to come by, I charged the watch with her. She was carried to the watch-house, and searched. The purse was not found upon her: it was found in the watch-house by the beadle. There was not any thing found upon her. When I charged her with robbing me, in the watch-house, I told the number of the note, the sum of money in the purse, and described it particularly.</p>
               <p>Was it found in your presence? - No; there was nothing found while I staid.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay with her in the passage? - To the best of my knowledge, not above ten minutes.</p>
               <p>During the time you were with her, might not your purse have dropped out of your pocket? - No; it did not.</p>
               <p>Was not you in such a situation that it might? - No; I had no connection with her whatever.</p>
               <p>Was your breeches unbuttoned? - No; they were not.</p>

               <p>I was beadle of the night; and being in the watch-house, when the charge came in, she was searched. Nothing was found upon her: but the purse was found in the watch-house, about two or three hours after. There is a back-room we were in: it was found dropped down in a corner. There was another person brought in with her, and searched likewise. The prosecutor and the other man said they knew nothing of the other woman, only that she met them as they were coming to the watch-house; and she was examined, because she was in company, left the prisoner should have given it to her.</p>
               <p>The young man did not give charge of her? - No; they said they did not think she had it.</p>
               <p>What did the prosecutor say when he came to the watch-house? - He charged the prisoner with robbing him of a purse, containing a 10 l. note, five guineas, and some silver; that the purse had but one tassel.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be sober, or in liquor, when he came in? - I can't take upon me to say he was sober, nor that he was much in liquor. The purse contained what he had spoken of.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner been near where the purse was found? - I don't know: the room is very little. When I found the purse, I charged her with it again, and she declared she had not got it, but the other woman had it; and so she declared before the justice.</p>
               <p>(The purse was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I know nothing at all about the matter; nothing in the world. The gentleman came down to me in Clerkenwell, and said he would give me a guinea not to tell where he was in the quarrel in the night-house.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Is there any truth in this story about a quarrel in the night-house? - None. I went to Clerkenwell, to see a friend of mine, who was there for debt. I asked for this woman. When I saw her, I asked her if she knew me? She said, No. I asked her how she would stand trial? She said, I should have my property again; she had given it up to the beadle. I said, Why did not you tell me, when you gave it to the beadle; and I might have made you an acknowledgement? I thought, if they had told me they had got the property, and given it me, there was no occasion to go before the justice at all.</p>

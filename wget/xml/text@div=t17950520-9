               <p>Q. What did you do with the other? - The other at that time was left behind; when I got her about had my down the street she wished me to call her matter back, and she would confess the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise her any thing? - Not any thing; she said that the property was very safe, and he should have it in the morning, I told her that would not do , we must have it to night; I asked her  where it was? she told me in the Curtain-road, at one Mrs. Duboix's; I went with her according to her directions, and found it under the bed, in the room where she said it was.</p>
               <p>Q. In Mrs. Duboix's lodging house? - No, I believe not, she is a lodger in the house, I don't know who is the landlord of the house.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you find the things contained in the indictment? - In a bundle under the bed, she shewed me the room, and told me it was under the bed.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. You was drinking with this man the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you had a conversation about a horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As soon as this conversation began about the horse, he let you into the secret that it was not honestly come by? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You immediately agreed to buy it? - Yes, to be sure I did.</p>
               <p>After he had told you that the horse was not honestly come by, after you received that intimation, you agreed to purchase the horse? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>How long have you been accustomed to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180004"></xptr>buy such horses? - I thought it was my duty to get at the knowledge where the man was.</p>
               <p>Then you bound the bargain, and gave him earnest for it? - I thought it was a duty to bring the man to justice, he would not have brought the horse, provided I did not give him the earnest.</p>
               <p>Then you wanted him to commit a felony? - No, I saw the horse at large at

               <p>What are you? - I am a higler.</p>

               <p>Have you never been in any scrapes about purchasing things not honestly come by? - Never.</p>
               <p>Nor never tried at Hicks's Hall? - I never was at Hicks's Hall.</p>
               <p>Have you never been tried any where else? - I never was tried any where.</p>
               <p>Have you never said this, that you was very glad now you had got an opportunity of routing this man out of the town? - I never said so to anybody.</p>
               <p>Have you never said so? - No, I never did say so, the man never did me any injury.</p>
               <p>Did you never say so to Gates the constable? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - I never did.</p>
               <p>You refused to purchase it at four pounds ten shillings? - I thought to the best of my knowledge it was not worth more than four guineas.</p>
               <p>Why could not you as well agree to give him the whole four pounds ten shillings as four guineas, if you did not mean to make a bargain with him? - A man may make a bargain; he told me it was another man's property, and he thought it was not honestly come by.</p>
               <p>If it was your only motive to bring the man to justice, why not agree for four pounds ten shillings, for you never intended to give him any money? - I had the money to pay for it, provided it was honestly come by; if I had not agreed for the money, he would never have brought the horse.</p>
               <p>Did you intend to buy the horse? - Yes, if it was honestly come by.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. Did I understand you right in your first examination, that you told people of this before you bound the bargain with the shilling, and before you bid four guineas? - Yes, the night before, the Tuesday night, before I gave any money, and before I saw the horse; it was a brown gelding, the inner leg white behind, a star in his forehead, a brown muzzle, and grey about his eye brows.</p>

               <p>Were there any promises made to him to tell the truth? - No, he said in the Mermaid that he had stolen the horse; he said it was a horse that had been straying on the common a year or two, and he thought it was no use to the gentleman, and he thought he would take him off the common to sell for three or four pounds, to set him up in some thing.</p>

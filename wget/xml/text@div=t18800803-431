                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On the 17th July I was in Philpot Lane watching the premises of Messrs. Mill and Grant, of Botolph Lane—about 7.10 a.m. I saw Bailey leave the warehouse, No. 35, carrying a bag of Brazil nuts on his back—I watched him to Fish Street Hill, where I saw Donovan standing with a barrow—Bailey threw the bag of nuts on the barrow—Donovan wheeled the barrow—Bailey pushed behind—I went into Cannon Street for a man named Rogers who was charged and ischarged—Donovan,</p>

               <p>Bailey, and Rogers went through King William Street Moorgate Street to the corner of For, Street where they went in to a public house, leaving the barrow of nuts outside—I stayed about 20 minutes, when all three came out, Donovan and Rogers wheeled the barrow towards london Wall, Bailey went towards the Bank sent Detective Davidson after him and he brought him back—I afterwards stopped Donovan and Rogers—I told them I was a police officer and asked them what they had in the barrow—Donovan said "A bag of nuts"—I said "Where did you get them from?"—he said "I bought them of a man on London Bridge"—I said "How much did you give for them?—said" 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I had to borrow 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Rogers-Rogers made no reply—I asked Bailey, who had been brought back if he knew anything of the men—he said "No, I know nothing about it"—I said "I saw you leave Messrs. Mill and Grant's warehouse this morning with nuts, and I shall take you all to the station and you will all be charged with stealing nuts"—I took them to the station—after I had explained the case to the inspector, Donovan said "I bought them in the barrow of a man who had some business in the East End"—these are samples of the nuts—the same afternoon about three I went past Messrs. Mill and Grant's, 30, Pudding lane—I saw Miles—he made a statement to me—Mr. Grant and Mr. Taylor were present—at the Mansion House Bailey said "What Miles said is quite right, he did let me in"—on the 23rd I went to Kingston—I saw Phillips leave the train from London—I said "I am an officer of the London Police—I have a man named Bailey in custody for stealing a quantity of nuts"—he said "Yes, I know"—I said "I have traced a quantity of nuts to you by South Western Railway"—I asked him about his shops—he said he had shops, and "I have not had any Brazil nuts this season"—I reminded him that he had some—after hesitation he said Yes, I had them—I said "Who did you get them from?"—he said "Piggott"—I said "Who is he?"—he said "A porter"—I said "How much did you give for them?"—he said "42"—I said "Have you any order or invoice?"—he said "No, I have none; I do not keep them"—he said Piggot sent them down, he called for them the same day and sent him the money—I then went with Mr. Grant, Junior, to One Acre Road, Kingston-on-Thames Phillips' place—there I found in a basket a quantity of Brazil nuts—I said "Here are the nuts"—he said "Yes, they are some of the last parcel I had, they came down on Friday" Mr. Grant then turned over the stock and found another basket—it was a private house with a bar window fitted up as a shop, with oranges, lemons, and sweets in the window—I told him he would be charged with stealing the nuts—I brought him to Seething Lane Police Station—he said he thought they were all right, but he was sorry he had had anything to do with them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer at Norbiton—I hare known Phillips eight or nine years—he has been carrying on business at Kingston eight or ten years—I produce a bundle of his invoices for inspection—I have gone to market with him—I know Piggott—he buys nuts—he is a <hi rend="italic">bumaree</hi>, that is, he buys or sells—on the 17th July I was with Phillips at Kingston market—I saw Piggott—in conversation Phillips said to Piggott "By-the-bye, how much is that bag of Brazils you sent me yesterday morning?"—Piggott said 42<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 43<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I will not swear which, and I saw Phillips give him two sovereigns, and put his hand in his pocket for the remainder—I was not aware Phillips had been convicted—he has conducted himself as an honest man since I knew him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> These are receipts for goods sold to Phillips—I do not know if Piggott has a place of business—he had a wholesale trade—he supplied all the big shops in Surbiton—I never bought of him.</p>

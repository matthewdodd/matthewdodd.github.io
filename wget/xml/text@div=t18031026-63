               <p>Q. Did you offer to buy the mare of him? - A. Yes, I asked him if he would sell it; he said he would; I asked him what price he would have for it; he said, eleven pounds; I told him I was not a judge of it, that I would give him five pounds for it; he then said, if I would give him six pounds, I should have it; I told him, if he would take the horse into the yard, I dared to say he and I should make a deal, which he did; I asked him to go to a public-house, and have something to drink; he said he would have some beer; I said, what do you mean to say about the mare; he said, if you will give me half-a-guinea more, you shall have it; that was half-a-guinea more than the five pounds; I told him I thought he had not come honestly by it, and I should take him, and the mare too, which I did, and sent for Maynard, the constable, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Q.While the mare was in your custody, did you shew her to Mr. How? - A. Not that I know of.</p>

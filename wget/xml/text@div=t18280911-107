On the 23d of July I was lodging in Jewin-street; I accompanied a friend in a coach to the Peacock public-house at Islington; we then strolled about the place, and went into the Belvidere gardens about nine o'clock, played a game or two at skittles, then went into the house and staid till near twelve o'clock, when I left alone - I went down Goswell-road as I thought, but understand I went Clerkenwell way; it was a dark night, and the prisoner accosted me - it might be in Aldersgate-street; he asked where I was going - I said home; he said which way, and I said to Jewin-street; he got hold of my arm, and said he should be glad to walk with me; I said I did not wish him to put himself out of his way, I could walk myself; he said he lived that way and would walk with me; I said very well; and we walked arm-in-arm; in coming down Aldersgate-street I met a gentleman at the corner of Jewin-street, who said, "Is this <placeName id="t18280911-107-crimeloc555">Jewin-street</placeName>

Yes, said he; I went and knocked at my own door, and was immediately thrown down in the street by the prisoner; the gentleman had followed us up the street, and walked past us before I was thrown down, and got ten or twelve yards behind us just as I was in the act of falling, after I had knocked at the door; the gentleman ran up and said,"Have you been robbed?" I said, not that I knew of; he said, "Feel in your pocket;" I felt, and my handkerchief and gloves were gone; the prisoner ran away, and the gentleman pursued, calling Stop thief! he was stopped somewhere in Aldersgate-street and brought back to me by the watchman before I got in, and we went to the watch-house; my handkerchief and gloves were found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you a warehouse of your own at Manchester? A. Certainly I have, in Dickenson's-court; I was there last in June - my business has been going on there since; I believe I had not been in London for ten years before; my friend is not here - he lives at Manchester; the prisoner accosted me about twelve o'clock; I was not quite sober nor quite drunk, merely merry.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is not true that you solicited this man's help to lead you along? A. Certainly I did not - I cannot tell where he accosted me, I believe it was in Aldersgate-street; I think I left the Belvidere before twelve o'clock - I do not know the time; I had a watch but no money - I spent it all.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, were you not standing in a state of drunkenness and helplessness on Mutton-hill when this man came up to you? A. I tell you it was no such thing; I felt him suddenly feel my waistcoat pocket in Aldersgate-street; I did not fall till I got home - that I swear; I asked him to go in doors when I got home, and if I had got him in, I should have taken a little examination.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no watchman to give him to in your way. A. They are gentlemen I do not wish to fall into the hands of.</p>

            . On the night in question I was coming home from the Theatre, and saw the prosecutor at the corner of Jewin-street - the prisoner had hold of his arms; Hudson was rather intoxicated, and was rather pulling to get away from him; I heard Jewin-street mentioned - I stopped and said, "Is this Jewin-street?" they said Yes; they went on together; I thought from the prisoner's appearance that they were friends, but the prisoner said, "Come along, we are all right Sir!" and his saying Sir, I thought perhaps it was not so; I followed them, and in the way there was a scaffolding, and about ten yards from that is his lodging - hearing one of them knock, I thought I would walk past, and as I went by I heard Hudson say, "Will you come in, and have something to drink?" The prisoner said "No - I have seen you safe home Sir;" I passed about twelve yards, and looking back, saw him push the prosecutor into the middle of the road; I immediately ran back, and said, "Have you hurt yourself Sir?" he made no answer; I then said, "Has he robbed you of anything?" he said "He is a regular thief;" I then called Stop thief! the street was quite clear - the prisoner heard me, and must have been aware that I was the person who followed him - he ran nearly a quarter of a mile, from Jewin-street and I after him, the watchman took him several paces off; he was taken to Hudson, who was still at his door - the watchman examined his fob, but he had puthis watch-seals in; I saw the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110080"></xptr>soner searched at the watch-house, and the handkerchief was found in his hat, and a note was taken out of his breeches pocket with Hudson's name on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had not the watchman to put his hand to feel if the prosecutor had his watch safe? A. I do not think he had; I was very near them till they got to the door; the prosecutor said at the watch-house that the prisoner had put his hand into his waistcoat pocket; he did not say so in the street; I was about twelve yards off when he was pushed down; the prisoner must have seen me pass, but there is a turning two yards further; I am a law-stationer - my office is in Mitre-court, Fleet-street; it is not my office, but Mr. Furlong's; I have a little business of my own - I live in Old-street - this was my road home: it was about a quarter past one o'clock.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. No objection was made by the prisoner to be searched? A.

            . I am patrol of Aldersgate-ward. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house - I saw him take something from his pocket - I did not know what it was then, but watched, and from his left hand saw him throw a pair of gloves under the desk; I picked them up, took them into the other room, and asked if he had dropped anything; he said No, he had no gloves - the prosecutor owned them; he was sensible enough to describe his handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How many people were in the watch-house? A.

               <p>The prisoner in his Defence, which was partly inaudible, stated, that he had seen the prosecutor leaning against the railings on Clerkenwell-green intoxicated and had assisted his home, that when they got to Jewin-street he insisted on his going in, which he refused; but the prosecutor endeavoured to pull him in, upon which he forced himself from him; that on the road they fell and their hats came off; he picked his own up, and thinking the handkerchief had fallen out of it took that also, but had never seen the gloves or the note; but if he had the note, he muat have picked it up conceiving it to be his own; he stated himself to have an income of nearly 500l. a year, and could have no motive to commit a robbery.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live in Leather-lane. On a Wednesday night in July, I was going for some medicine for my son, who was very ill; it was twelve o'clock or half past when I went out; I came across Ray-street, Clerkenwell, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor - the prosecutor was much intoxicated, dreadfully so, he could not stand; he was close to the rails just by a small ironmonger's shop; the prisoner, who I thought I had some knowledge of, made me stay to look at him, fearing the prosecutor would be robbed - he had a watch and umbrella, his seals hung out from his fob, and his hat fell off; he asked the prisoner to take him to Jewin-street, City; I did not understand what the prisoner said, for I was in a burry: I saw them go away together - the prisoner picked his hat up, gave it to him, and they went up the Green together: the prisoner lead him - he could not stand</p>
               <p>Q. Might he not have robbed him in the road about the Charter-house, and then run away very well? A.

On the 23d of July, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I saw two gentlemen, one of them was very much intoxicated, and asked the way to Jewin-street - he had an umbrella on his arm, it fell after I had directed him; and the gentlemen, who I believe to be the prisoner, picked it up - one of their hats fell off, and directly after it was picked up the other fell off; I was not close enough to see anything else picked up; I followed them off my beat, and saw them go down Jerusalem-passage; I am positive the man who had the umbrella was drunk; I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> On the 15th of Sept. there was a disturbance with Pickard and Cole, about eleven o'clock, and throughout the day—at nine o'clock at night I went to bed—I and my wife had had a few words in the morning—I left the door open—about twelve o'clock, hearing people talking outside, I opened the window, and told my wife to come in—in the prisoners attempted to keep her out—I came down stairs to persuade her to come in, and Cole and Pearman said, "No, she shall not come in, you starve-gutted b----y villain"—Stephens came over and challenged me to fight—I told him I would have no words with him—while I said that, Pearman came over, broke the skull of my head with a life-preserver, and broke my arm—I have had no use of it since—Mrs. Pickard told him to go and give it to me several times—she men<lb></lb>tioned that word to him, and he said, "Is it me you want, you b---- r?"</p>

                  </hi> I came home about five or six o'clock on the 15th Sept.—about twelve or one o'clock I saw the assault—perman, by the ad<lb></lb>vice of these two woman, struck Ellis on the head with a deadly weapon of some sort—I never heard such a blow in my life—he struck him on the head two or three blows—the woman where abusing him very much—they called Pearman out, as Stephens stood in a fighting positjon befor Ellis, and when Pearman got out, he ran over and struck Ellis the blows, and one of the women said to Pearman, "Go it, Harry"—I saw him strike very repeatedly, and Ellis felt against the door-post—I called out, "you murderous crew, you have done it at last—you have concocted this—this is the most cold<lb></lb>blooded murder I ever saw"—I called "Police"—the policeman came and took hold of Ellis—I said, "Take the four person"—he said, "No, I have got charge enough here"—there was a pool of blood under Ellis as large as a tea-saucer, and his head was broken and his arm—I wished the policeman to take charge of the four person, and Mrs. Pickard said, "if anybody at<lb></lb>tempts to come into my house, policeman or not policeman, I will split his b—y head open"—I head the cramp so bad that I went in-door—the policeman took Ellis to the hospital, and I traced the blood about 300 yards the next morning—Ellis, through being disabled, is now in the poor-house—I have been a deputy corn-meter above thirty years.</p>

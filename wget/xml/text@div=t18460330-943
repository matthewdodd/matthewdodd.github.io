                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 259.) On the 19th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was passing a marine-store shop, in William-street, Poplar—I saw a quantity of nails in they scale, being weighed—I saw the prisoner in the shop—I went in and asked if they were his property—he said yes—I said I doubted his statement, and must take him to the station—I took him as far as the East India-road, and gave him to another constable—I went back and got the nails—there were sixteen pounds of new nails—I took them to the station—I then asked the prisoner who he worked for—he said for Mr. Tomlin—I went and gave him information—he came and identi<lb></lb>fied the prisoner as his servant, and asked how he got the nails—he said he picked them up two or three at a time, in sweeping out the floors of the new houses—we went to where he had been working, and missed some nails out of his new bag.</p>

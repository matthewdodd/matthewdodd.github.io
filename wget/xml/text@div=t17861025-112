               <p>Mr. Fielding, Prisoner's Counsel. You seem to be a very odd old gentleman; we have seen you in all the Courts I am sure: So a part of this house is where your coal-shed is, where you keep your few coals, and your sticks? - Yes, my few coals; I suppose Mr. Cassell might be indebted to me ten or twelve pounds; at the time he was in prison, I was such a blockhead as to let him have money.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250198"></xptr>How came this poor woman into your house? - By the instigation of Mr. Cassell.</p>
               <p>Then upon that you received that woman into your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now you receive the things belonging to Cassell also? - Yes, but in the same room.</p>
               <p>Did not you receive them things of Cassell for safe custody? - Of himself.</p>
               <p>Was ever Cassell to have these things back again? - Whenever he paid me the money.</p>
               <p>How many goods might you have received? - I did not take any inventory; I received them from different people.</p>
               <p>Then you knew at the time you received these goods, that they belonged to the creditors? - I paid the money for them.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a plaister's labourer; I pawned a quadrant, but I cannot swear to this being it.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of its being it? - I made no remarks on it; I believe to the best of my knowledge it might be this.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did you ever see it out of the case? - Yes, when Mr. Hill took it into his hand; I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>How came you by it? - The prisoner delivered it into my hands, in her own apartment, No. 4, in the Broad-way, Westminster, in the two pair of stairs backwards; she said it belonged to Mr. Cassell, and she said, she would be much obliged to me, if I would be so kind to go with it; I carried it to Mr. Hill, the same day she delivered it to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did not Cassell send you with it? - Mr. Cassell desired me, when he was in prison, to pledge something for him, and I carried this; I went by Cassell's orders and desire, and I got this and pledged it for him, and returned the money to Susanah Redman; she made no secret of it at all.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know this was done by Cassell's order? - Cassell gave me orders for going himself.</p>
               <p>Did Cassell desire you to pawn the quadrant for him? - He desired me to pledge any thing I could, for he was distressed.</p>
               <p>- CASSELL sworn.</p>
               <p>I understand you had the misfortune to be in prison? - I had.</p>
               <p>At the time you was in prison, did you give any orders about a quadrant that was in the hands of Mr. Thomlinson? - I gave him an order, whether it was a written order, I will not be clear; I sent him to the prisoner, and desired her to let him take my quadrant.</p>

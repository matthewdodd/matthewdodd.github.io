                  </hi>. I am clerk to Whitehouse and Sons, who have a wharf in City-road basin—they are carriers from Birmingham and Leaming<lb></lb>ton. The prisoner was in their employ on the 7th of March, as boatman to the Dudley Castle, which arrived in town on Monday night, the 6th of March—in consequence of what I heard, I went to Clerkenwell prison, on Fri<lb></lb>day, and saw the prisoner there—I have an entry of a box from Leaming<lb></lb>ton, for W. H. Lampet, Esq., London—we received a box with that direction, and it was delivered to the gentleman—it weighed 1 qr. 141bs.—I weighed it at Hampstead, without the clothes, and it weighed 391be.; 3lbs. short.</p>

Q.</hi> Where was the prisoner on the 6th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Coming from the country to London—about forty miles from town, I believe—it would not be his duty to be further from London than that—on the Tuesday when the boat went out, he was absent—he had arrived with the boat—there was a person named Lake with the boat—he is not here—I heard the prisoner say George Lake took the clothes out, and gave them to him, and hat was all he knew about it.</p>

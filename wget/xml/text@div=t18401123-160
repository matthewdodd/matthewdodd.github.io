                  </hi>. I was in the service of Mr. Nicholls of Heston at the time in question. On the 25th of October, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was going along the road near the Bell public-house at Hounslow—I had just come out of the Bell and had a bundle with me, containing two shirts, a pair of stockings, a handkerchief, and another handkerchief which they were tied in—I was with Bowler—there were a good many people in the tap-room, and Thomas, Gurney, and New-man were there—there was a fourth man there dressed the same as Frewin, hut I could not swear to him—I left the Bell and was going down Hounslow, and four men came up and knocked me down—they, were before me, not going in a direction from the Bell but coming towards it—the prisoners had left the Bell before me—Gurney and Thomas knocked me down by coming up and striking me in the face, and all, four fell on the top of me—they took 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of my pocket and Gurney took my bundle from me—I had some halfpence which they did not take—I called to Bowler and he came back—after I got up I snatched my bundle out of Gurney's hands—Bowler had come and pulled me up before that—I then followed them down to the Coach and Horses, half a mile, and the prisoners were all there—I stated there what had happened, and Gurney got up and knocked me down—I got up, and he knocked me down again, and I ran out for a policeman—they all ran away—I secured Thomas—I saw the others in custody next morning.</p>

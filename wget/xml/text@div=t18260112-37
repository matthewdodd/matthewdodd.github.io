               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How can you swear to it? A. It is of a particular shape - it supported a story post at Vintner's Hall - another piece came from Damer and Co's cellar. I have had two of the prisoner's children in my employ - I believe he has four or five. I missed the iron from the cellar.</p>

            . I am an officer of Dowgate-ward. On the 23d of December, about nine o'clock at night, I stopped the prisoner with a bag on his shoulder, in Upper Thames-street, about two hundred yards from Mr. Allen's; I asked what he had got, he said he believed old iron, that he was in a public-house, and a man in a white coat desired him to take it to London-bridge, and was to meet him there. I asked where he worked, he said, any where, and would not tell his name - the bag contained 70lbs. of old iron, which Mr. Allen claimed.</p>

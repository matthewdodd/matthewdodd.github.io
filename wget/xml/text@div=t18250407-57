            . I am in the employ of Mr. James Towers, of Great Titchfield-street. On the 26th of February, about eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070029"></xptr>came into the shop, and inquired for Mr. Towers; I said he was down stairs; she said,</p>
               <p>"It is of no consequence, you will do as well; I called to look at some glass dishes, which I looked at a few days ago" - I shewed her two, and she asked the price; I told her 33 s. each; she said,</p>
               <p>"I think Mr. Towers said 23 s.;" I went below to inquire of him - when I came up I found the prisoner in the shop - I told her 33 s. was the lowest price; she said,</p>
               <p>"Now, I recollect that is the price Mr. Towers told me." She selected two; she then asked to look at some glass salts, and I got three out of the window; she selected two of them, and said,</p>
               <p>"I will take this pair." She then wanted to look at some china articles, and after selecting some she ordered a bill to made of them; the whole amounted to 5 l. 4 s. 6 d. After Mr. Towers had made the bill she said,</p>
               <p>"I wish a receipt to be sent with me, and I will send back the money;" Mr. Towers asked in what name he should make out the receipt: she said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Turner, No. 25, Devonshire-place." She said, as I was putting the dishes into the basket.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid you will chip the dishes, and the salts, I will take them in my basket," which she did; I then followed her to the corner of Wimpole-street, when she said to me,</p>
               <p>"Go to the door of my house; I am going to Mr. Dixon's, the butcher's" - she went away. I went to the house, and found a Mr. Still lived there, and they knew nothing of Mr. Turner. I took the articles into the kitchen, and waited half an hour till the housekeeper came home, and no such articles were expected; I did not see the prisoner till the 23d of March. I have traced the dishes and the salts to two pawnbrokers.</p>

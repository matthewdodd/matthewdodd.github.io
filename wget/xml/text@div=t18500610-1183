                  </hi>. I am steward of a steam vessel, and live in Cornwall-road, Lambeth; I know all the prisoners. On 1st Feb. I saw an advertise<lb></lb>ment in the paper—on the 13th I became acquainted with Wright—I had been previously in his father's service, who was then in Whitecross-street—I went to 16, Upper Wellington-street, Strand, where there was up over the door, "E. Wright and Co., auctioneers and emigration-office"—I saw Stanley there, and said I had come from Mrs. Wright to see Mr. Wright—he said he believed he was gone to New Oxford-street; that is where old Wright used to live—I afterwards saw Wright, the son, in New Oxford-street, and he asked me to go with him to Whitecross-street, as his father was in trouble—as we went, we called at 3, Kingsgate-street, and saw Sparks there—as we came back we called again, and saw Stanley, Sparks, and Campbell, and we all went to the public-house next door but one—I asked Wright what we went to Kingsgate-street for, and he said about getting his father out of prison—I have frequently conversed with him about an office—he wanted me to get an office and become his partner, and carry on the same business, to advertise for young men, and get the money to share it between us; he said he would be the responsible person, and sign everything—I did not agree, and he said I seemed to be afraid—I said, "No," I was not afraid particularly, but it was not a game that would suit me; I would become partner in anything where there was a chance of getting an honest living—he said there was an office in Manchester-square we could have, and would I go and put down 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I went and looked at it, but put no money down—he said they could not do anything; there was no fear; if one place got too hot, we could move about and get another—I saw Stanley on 19th April, and he engaged me to mind his office, 3, Kingsgate-street, on the Saturday, for which I was to have 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I only got 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went next day and minded it—he told me there would be several young men come, and I was to give them some slips of paper which he wrote, and which I believe were to go to some distance, and when they came back in the after<lb></lb>noon I was to tell them he had gone to Southampton—Loten, George, and Nelson, came—I gave them the message in the morning—Stanley came to the office the very same day, between twelve and one o'clock, while the young men were out—I saw Stanley on the Monday, at a coffee-shop in Great Queen-street, where there is "E. Nixon and Co., auctioneers and estate-agents," over the door—Stanley was then going by the name of Nixon—he</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and know all the prisoners.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185006100148"></xptr>

               <p>April I went to a public-house next door to the Adelphi theatre, and there saw Sparks, Wright, Stanley, and two or three others—a person named Pen<lb></lb>nington was one of them—I asked Wright for my money back—they said it was not worth coming after—Pennington gave me a slap on the face, and Stanley was for putting me out of the house—on 14th May, I saw Stanley and James in Wigmore-street—I followed them, and James said to Stanley, "That is one of Wright's victims for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Stanley said that paltry sum was not worth noticing; if he was taken before a hundred Magistrates he would meet them all, for they were all a set of d—fools, and did not know common law—he said if any of them asked him for money, he would set to and give them a good <hi rend="italic">milling</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">pitch</hi> into them like a <hi rend="italic">brick</hi>, as he had to one the day before—I asked if they could tell me where Wright was, and James said if I would stand something to drink, they would, but they roust be d—d fools to tell where the others were, for nothing.</p>

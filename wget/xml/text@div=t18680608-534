                  </hi> I live at 58, Queen's Road, Dalston—on the night of the 19th May, I went to a public-house, the Old Kent, Nichol Street—Bailey came in and said, "It is a nice day, sir"—I said, "Yes"—he went out and returned shortly afterwards with two others—Hutchinson was one—a young gentleman and two boys were with me—Bailey charged me with committing an abominable crime on the two boys—the boys were not with me the second time he come in—I forget whether he said "intending to commit," or "having committed"—Bailey and the man not in custody unbuttoned my coat and exposed my guard—I struggled and called to the landlord to send for the police—he got me out—there were ten or twelve more in the bar—the doors were closed and I was left with Bailey, who held</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186806080041"></xptr>
               <p>me by the right shoulder, and Hutchinson was at my back—the landlord passed me in the street and told me to run—I said, "Oh, good God, I shall be run down, pray send for the police and protect me"—I was knocked down two or three times, once on the steps of a door, and forced into a passage—I was then held down by four men, one kneeling on my left loin—I cried "Murder!"—two hands were passed, one tore away my watch and the other my guard—I heard cries of "Police!"—the men got off me—I got up and was knocked down again—a policeman came and I made a statement—at 12 o'clock that night I saw Bailey and gave him in custody near the spot—I saw Hutchison the next day at the Police Court, and gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you in the habit of using this public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I came there to identify a man and point him out to these boys, whom I intended to bring forward as witnesses in a divorce suit—their ages are about 13 or 14—I never saw them before—I instructed the sister of one of them, who sells oranges before the Post Office door, to get them—I intended to pay them—my friend Mr. Searle suggested going to the public-house—he went with me as a friend—I should call him as a witness if he could assist me—I don't think I mentioned about my coat being torn open and exposing my chain before the Magistrate—I was excited, and my memory was not so clear—I caught hold of the landlord as he passed me, and asked him to protect me, and he shook me off—I then put my hand to protect my watch—I am sure it was there safe before I was knocked down.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 20, Upper St. John's Street, Hoxton—I was with the last witness—I went with him into the public-house and had some beer—there were two boys—I saw the prisoners outside—I went in twice—the second time I saw the prosecutor surrounded—I said, "What are you doing to the man?"—Bailey accused him of committing an unnatural crime—I said it was all nonsense, and wished them to leave him alone—I told them our business there—when we got out Bailey still held the prose<lb></lb>cutor by the right arm, saying, "I sha'n't let him go, I see him do it"—I was struck several times—my friend was bonnetted—I went for a police<lb></lb>man.</p>

               <p>he denied doing—I told them all they had better leave the house—I questioned the prosecutor myself, and led him away from my house some twenty yards, and returned—I saw some men and women hitting him, but I did not get to the mob—I went back and saw no more.</p>

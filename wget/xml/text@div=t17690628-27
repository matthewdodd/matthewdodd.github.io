I came to live there the 4th of May, between three and four in the afternoon. The prisoner was taken ill in the evening. She went up stairs about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280027"></xptr> nine. I went up between ten and eleven in the same room. I found the prisoner sitting on the side of her bed. She complained she was very ill, so that I did not go to bed. She complained of her leg swelling, and said she was very full of pain across her joins and back. I thought it proper she should have assistance. I went into mistress's room, and desired she would get up. She did; mistress gave her something to drink; I believe it was brandy. Seeing her so bad, we thought proper she should have a surgeon. We sent for Mr. Abel, a man-mid wife: this might be between twelve and one in the night. The prisoner got into bed before he came. He asked her what was the matter with her; she said she was very full of pain; he ordered her a draught and went away, after being there about five or six minutes. She drank the draught; after that she said she found herself better. I left the room and went down stairs. I did not stay long below.

This was about a quarter of an hour after Mr. Abel was gone. I heard her make a noise as if moving about in the bed. I thought I heard her open a knife. I heard it clash. This very much shocked me. I had hardly power to stir; I thought she was doing something to herself. She seemed to be very busy under the bedclothes. I went into mistress's room, and told her that I heard her make a noise, and thought I heard her open a knife, and imagined she was going to make use of it.

During the time I sat I think the prisoner drank one draught which I had put in a bottle at her desire, and put it on her bed. I went to bed about four, and slept till about eight; then I got up and went down stairs. When I awaked, the prisoner was in bed, she seemed to be asleep; but I said nothing to her, nor she to me. I carried her up a bason of tea about nine; she drank it, then I think she was sitting on the side of the bed. She got up and made the man's bed in the garret by herself. She came down, and began making her own bed; I came up at the time, and assisted in putting the blankets on. She had changed her sheets, and got a pair of clean ones. I went and told mistress of the clean sheets; then my mistress and I went up into the room. We saw the foul ones, and then we began to think something. Then the prisoner was go: down stairs; there was an appearance on the foul sheets, as if she had been brought to bed. We found them in the drawer. I did not see the child till after it had been seen by other people, about the middle of the day. After we found the sheets, mistress came down and desired the prisoner to go to bed.</p>

            . I live at Edmonton. The prisoner was my cook four months. On the first of May she complained of her legs swelling very much. I saw them on the fourth: they were very much swelled. I then had not the least suspicion of her being with child, having at that time a very good opinion of her. I was going out of town, so I desired her to keep her legs on a chair. When I came home about ten, she was gone to bed. I went to bed also about eleven; and just as I was got into bed, my servant came and told me the prisoner was very bad, and desired I would come to her. I put my under petticoat and bed-gown on, and went and asked her how she did; she said she was in such pain in her stomach and all round, that she did not know what to do. I gave her some pepper-mint water. I did not suspect then that she was with child. She continued in pain. After that I ventured to give her some gin. I told her, I thought her very bad, and that I durst not give her any thing else. I said I would send for Mr. Abel. He lives but a few doors distant. She desired I would not, saying she was out of order, and was sure she should be better. I sent my maids out of the room, and hoped to make some discovery. Then I told her I was frightened very much at her, that I had a great opinion of her, otherwise I should not know what to think. She gave no answer, but seemed ignorant of what I aimed at. I did not mention any thing farther. She had told me before she had had a long illness two or three years ago. I asked her whether she was as bad now as she was then: she said she never was so bad as she was now; and added, in her illness before, her mistress gave her strong things that made her almost drunk. She said the drinking of gin had done her good, and that she was much better, and begged I would go to bed. I said I was so uneasy about her, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280028"></xptr> could not think of going to bed, and that I would send for Mr. Abel. I did so, and directed he should not go up till I had seen him. She said there was no occasion for him. When Mr. Abel came, I went down and told him my suspicions, and desired him to question her. He went up stairs, and asked her a great may questions, which I cannot particularize. I was by at the time. He stayed with her about five minutes. She did not appear worse. He told her he would send her a draught. I went down with him, and asked him what he thought. He said he thought she was in labour. I saw her a great many times that night. He desired me to charge her with it. I told him, if he would stay a little, I would go up again to her, and hear more what she said. I went up, and sat down by her, and told her I was very uneasy and frighted at her, and could not tell what was the matter with her. She asked me if Mr. Abel was below. I said, Yes. She asked what was the reason he did not go, she could not think why he stayed so long; adding, that there was no occasion for him to stay. I told her he stayed to see how she did. I went down and told him what I had said, and that I had not courage to say any more to her. I told him if he would go home and prepare her a draught, I would send a person for it, and that there should be no bad consequence, she should not be left alone a moment. When the draught came, I went and gave it her. She then seemed better, and said she was very sleepy, and begged I would go to bed, for I should get cold without my cloak. She seemed then a little easier, yet I could discover she had little pains now and then. She pressed me very much to go to bed. I told her I would, but insisted upon it my maids should stay by her. I was not satisfied with this, but told them by no means to leave her. They promised me they would not. Then I went to bed. As soon as I got into bed, one of them came and knocked at the door, and said the cook wanted a little water. I told her she might fetch a little, but she must put some brandy in it to take the rawness off of it, and bid her make all the haste she could. I believe in about a minute after

             came, exceedingly frighted, and said, For God's sake, madam, come to the cook; I don't know what she is doing, she is doing something to herself: she has got her pocket in the bed, and I think she has taken her knife out; I heard it clash; and she is very busy under the bed-clothes. I sent her back again directly; my daughter was in bed with me; I desired her to go to the door and hear if she heard any noise. She came back again and said the cook lay very still and quiet. She heard nothing. I lay till about four. I was very fearful the maids were gone to sleep, hearing no stir. I sent my daughter to see. She came again, and said the maids were laid down in their clothes, and the cook was snoaring. I lay till six: then I went into the room, and found the cook fast asleep. I then went to the other bed, and waked the other two. My room is close by theirs. I desired them to get up: they said they had stayed some time by her, that she slept very well, and they thought they need not stay any longer, therefore they lay down. I desired them to call my daughter as they came through my room. This was between seven and eight. I asked them how the cook did when they came; they said she was not got up. As soon as I was dressed, I went into her room, which was about a quarter of an hour after eight, and asked her how she did. She said she was a great deal better, but she was so much out of order, she was afraid to move. I said I hoped she was no worse than common. She said, No. I desired she would stay in her room, and I would go down and make some tea, and send it up. I sent her a bason of tea up. I said I was certain there was something more than ordinary, she looked so shockingly. She came down a little after nine into the kitchen. One of my daughters came and told me the cook wanted clean sheets, for she was going to wash her foul ones: they were very dirty. I bid my daughter give her a pair, but would not let her wash the others. I sent

             up to help her to make her bed, as I heard she was going to make it. I went up, and saw them both putting the blankets on. I looked about, but saw nothing then. I went down again. When the prisoner came down, I desired my daughter to keep her in the kitchen, while I went up and looked about the house for the foul sheets. I went and looked in the garret, where the foul linen is kept. I could not find them there. I looked under her bed in her room; I found there a blanket, her under petticoat, and a bedgown that I had lent her: though I had not found the sheets, I was satisfied there was something more than ordinary. At last I found the sheets in a corner of a drawer where her things lay: then I was thoroughly satisfied she had had a child. They were bundled up in a very bad<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280029"></xptr> condition, I have had many children myself, and was quite sure she had had a child. Then I went to get her out of the kitchen: she was wanting to do some work, but I thought her not in a condition to work. She went up stairs. I went up and kept her in talk the while my daughter tried my keys to see whether any would unlock her trunk in the garret. After that I came down, and consulted my daughter what I should do. I took the chare-woman, who is a married woman, up with me. I first sent her into the room to the prisoner to ask her how she did: then I went in, and said, You look sadly, will you have any thing? She said she thought she was a little saint. I said, Cook, you may very well be saint, for I am sure you have had a child. She denied it at first. I said, Though I was so ignorant last night, I am not now, for I was very certain by what I had seen, and if she would not tell me, I would send for a constable. Then she said, there was a child. I asked her where it was; she said in her trunk in the garret, and gave me her keys out of her pocket. I told her she shocked me very much, and bid her go to bed, as the most decent place for her. I got her into bed, and got her some caudle, went with the chare-woman, and found the child tied up in a handkerchief in a corner of her trunk. The trunk was locked. The chare-woman brought it in her apron into a parlour, which we made but little use of. I did not care any body should know of it then. I saw the child was cut down from the ear, and then another cut across the throat, about two inches long each cut. It was a boy. The cut seemed to be to the bone of the neck. I saw the bone, but did not care to look at it much. It seemed very deep. It was very bloody, and bled very fresh till the Monday. This was Friday. The handkerchief was very bloody in which it was. I sent the chare-woman to tell her, I thought she had murdered her child, and I could not see her any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it seem to be a full grown child?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Steers. It did; it appeared as if she had gone her full time.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Low. I am a chare-woman. Mrs. Steers sent for me. She went up stairs and I along with her. This was after the sheets and things were found. We went up to search for the child. I went to the prisoner and asked her how she did; she said, she was very poorly. Madam came up a little after; we then went up into the garret. Madam said, she was certain there must be a child by the things she had seen. The prisoner denied it at first, but not much; afterwards she owned it. Madam asked her for the keys; she gave them to her. Then we went up into the garret, and found the child in the prisoner's trunk. It was very bloody, so also was the handkerchief in which it was. The child bled fresh then from the neck, where there was a wound. It was cut down the neck and cross the neck. I saw the bone. I staid with the prisoner three nights, she never said any thing to me.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Steers. I bid this chare-woman to ask the prisoner for her pocket, thinking she was not fit to have a knife. She gave her her knife out of her pocket, but that was not bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. What growth was the child.</p>
               <p>E. Low. It was at its full time. I have had children. It was tied up in a snuffy linen handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Steers. Had she made any preparation to put the child in?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Steers. The prisoner sent me word, if I would look into her trunk, I should find some child's things. I looked in her trunk, and there I found a neckcloth for a child, that was formerly used about a child's neck: that I found on the Friday. She was taken away on the Monday in the afternoon. (Produced in Court.)</p>
               <p>E. Low. There was a linen cloth, that seemed to have been made for a clout, wrapped about the child's head in the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Barthelomew Abel. I am a man-midwife. I was sent for to Mrs. Steers's, at about eleven o'clock at night, on the 4th of May. Mrs. Steers told me she was exceedingly frighted about her cook. She had lived with her about four months, and was a very good servant, or else she should suspect something was the matter more than ordinary. I asked her if she thought her with child. She said she looked big, but not bigger than she was at her coming. She informed me, she had not been regular for the time she had been there; but would not have me take notice to her that I suspected her to be with child, but go up and have some talk with her. She was cautious of the girl's reputation. We went up stairs together. I asked her several questions, particularly how long since she had been out of order; she told me four months before she came to that place, and that she had been taking some pills, which began to have a proper effect, and that she expected she should soon be better. I looked at one of her legs, and found it very much swelled. I came down stairs. I could not be absolutely certain she was with child, but it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280030"></xptr> my opinion she was, and that she was in labour. I thought it proper for madam to go and tax her with it. After some little time she went up in order to do it. She came down again and told me, she told her that Mr. Abel thought her much like a woman in labour, but the prisoner said it was a particular time, and asked why I staid; saying, I need not to stay; if she had any occassion, she would send for me. I said I would send her something by way of amusing her, and if they sent for me, I would come directly. I sent a draught, and desired she might not be left alone. I went home, and lay down between the blankets, and fell asleep, and heard nothing till morning; when about nine I went to see how she did. She was then not up. I was told I might go up stairs. I went up, and found her dressed, sitting on the side of the bed. Upon asking her how she did, she told me she was much better, that she had had a considerable alteration, as she used to be at particular times, and was quite easy and free from pain, and should soon be well. As she was up, I looked at her to see whether she was big as usual, but not having seen her before to observe her, I could not tell. I went home. After this Mrs. Steers beckoned me. I went into her house. She told me there was a child found. She and I went up into the garret, and there I saw it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Steers. The child had been washed and cleaned, and carried up there when Mr. Abel saw it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abel. It was a full grown male child, with a considerable wound on its neck. It was cut straight down the neck, and afterwards across the neck. The first began about two inches or an inch and a half below the right ear, and came down right about two inches or an inch and a half long . It reached to the first bone of the neck. It penetrated quite to the bone, about an inch and a half deep. The other cut across was full two inches long, and full two inches deep. It appeared to have been washed when I saw it. I did not see any blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Is any thing to be inferred from its fresh bleeding, as Mrs. Steers has given an account, that it was born alive?</p>
               <p>Abel. No. If it had been born dead, it might have bled. On the Monday the coroner sent to me, and asked if it was necessary to open the child, to find out whether it was born dead or alive. I told him it was a received opinion, if it had been born dead, the lungs would sink, but did not know it was an infallible sign. I took out the lungs and put them in water, and they swam. I don't mention this as an infallible rule.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your judgement, upon the whole, of the appearance of this child, or can you form any judgement upon it, whether it was born dead or alive?</p>
               <p>Abel. I would rather think it was born alive.</p>

               <p>I awaked in the morning and found there was a child; that frighted me very much. I was not sensible what I did. I can give no account how I did it.</p>

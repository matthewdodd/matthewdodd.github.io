I put my waistcoat and trowsers under the pillow and under the bed, and in about an hour and a half she wanted to go away. I turned round and found my waistcoat under the pillow, but missed the money; I sung out, and one of the women went for a watchman - nobody but her had been in the room. I had not been asleep.</p>

            . I am a watchman, of George-street; the servant at No. 47, fetched me about twelve o'clock. I found Rogers charging the prisoner with stealing four sovereigns and a half, and 7 s. 6 d.; she denied it, saying she had no money of his. I found a shilling and some halfpence on her; a female searched her in the watch-house, and produced four sovereigns and a half, wrapped in a paper, and 5 s. 6 d.; she then became violent.</p>

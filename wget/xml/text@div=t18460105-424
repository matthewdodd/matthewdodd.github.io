                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 174.) On Saturday afternoon the prosecutor came to me about one o'clock—I saw his head was bleeding very profusely, right down into his neck—he took me to the Kettle and Drum public-house, in Rateliff-highway—I found the prisoner there—he gave her into custody—I told her she must come along with me—she said she would come when she liked—she was intoxicated—she dared me to lay a hand on her—I said I did not wish to do so if she would come quietly—I let her be for a minute or two—she did not offer to come—I laid hold of her to take her out, but she was very outrageous—with the publican's assistance I got her out—when we got her outside she laid on the pavement—I tried to get her up, and she laid hold of my thumb in her mouth and bit it—I have the marks now.</p>

I examined the prosecutor's head on the Saturday evening, the 27th of Dec, very shortly after it hap<lb></lb>pened—I found a contused wound on the left side of the head, of considerable depth, down to the bone—it was not an incised wound—not done by a knife—the skin and flesh were separated down to the covering of the bone<lb></lb>there was a considerable quantity of blood.</p>

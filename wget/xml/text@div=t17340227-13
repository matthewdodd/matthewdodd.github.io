I went and brought Brown and John Barns with me. Then the Prisoner said, Lord I am sadly frighten'd! I am afraid I am ruin'd! Bess Morris ( her right Name is Palmer ) has fell out of Window and kill'd herself. We open'd the Yard-door, and there she lay under the Window, with her Face bruised and stone Dead and Stiff.

            , Surgeon, I view'd the Body of the Deceas'd; she had a large contused Wound in her Forehead, but no Fracture there. Both her Thighs were broke, the left was Fractur'd near the Middle, and the right near her Knee, which was much contused, and there was a Wound on her Ancle; and I have reason to believe that these were the Cause of her Death.</p>
               <p>Another Surgeon gave the same Account of the Wounds and Fractures; but added, that he could not say they were, tho' they might be, the Cause of her Death.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I heard her cry out in the Yard, and ask'd her how she came there? She said she had been for a penn'orth of Muscles, and had got the Cramp in her Knee; I bid her be quiet, and so she was. And then I went to Bed, and lay 'till six in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Court. 'Tis very strange, that a Woman in such a miserable Condition, wounded, and bruised, and both her Thighs broke, should talk of buying Muscles, and complain of nothing but the Cramp.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I suppose she was drunk.</p>
               <p>Court. It's intolerable, that such poor Wretches should be suffer'd to drink till they have lost their Senses. The Houses that allow of such scandalous Practices ought to be suppress'd.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was but a Servant to one who put me in the House, and I have not been in it above five Weeks. John Brown, whom I sent for, was a Porter belonging to the Shop; and when he and Barns came, they told me, if I did not move the Body, there would be 5 l. to the Coroner, 5 l. to bury her, and a Fine of 30 l. laid upon the House.</p>

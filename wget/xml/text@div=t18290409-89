On the 3d of April I saw these scales safe, at seven o'clock in the evening; in about half an hour I heard the door open as I was in the back parlour; I went into the shop, and missed them - I opened the door, and saw three persons running; I could not follow them, as I had no one at home; I waited till eight o'clock, when my husband came home; I told him - he went to Palmer's.</p>

            . I live at No. 12, Wheeler-street; I deal in marine-stores. On the evening of the 3d of April the prisoner came and asked if I would buy a pair of copper scales; I am sure he is the person - I said I bought nothing after dark; Patey came to my house afterwards, and asked if I had a pair of scales; I said, No, but a young man had been with a pair of scale, and I should know him again; he fetched me to his shop in half an hour, and I saw the prisoner - I said, he was the man; he then told the watchman if he would go to his mother's garden, he would find them under the currant-bush.</p>

We went to the prosecutor's shop, and bought 1d. worth of tobacco and 1/2d. of small beer - we then went up the road, and as we came back, an elderly man was at the door of this shop with the scales; he said if we could sell them, we should share the money between us; being allured by the money, we went to Palmer's - the man then asked if we knew where he could hide them; and said, would it not be a good place to put them in the garden? I said, No; he said, "I shall put them there," and I should not bear the blame of it.</p>

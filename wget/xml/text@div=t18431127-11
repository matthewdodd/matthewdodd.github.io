                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On Sunday, the 5th of November, about a quarter past twelve o'clock in the day, I was in the neighbourhood of Barbi<lb></lb>can, in plain clothes, with other officers—I saw Coggleton pats me, and go into the shop of the prisoner Wilkinson, which is a little way up Golden-lane—I did not know the shop before—it is a ceppermith's—there were kettles in the window—I went in in about a minute, and found Coggleton on one side of the counter, Wilkinson on the other, and another person, who I ascertained to be Wilkinson's brother, by the door—Coggleton's clothes were uabuttoned, and he was in the act of handing a piece of lead from his person to the scale, and Wilkinson was in the act of adjusting 1/4 of a hundred weight in the scale, in which there was one piece of lead—here are the two pieces of lead—I asked Coggleton how he came by the lead—he said "Lead? I have no lead"—I turned round to Wilkinson, and said, "How do you aooount for it?"—he paused, and then said, "If I must tell the truth, that man brought it."</p>

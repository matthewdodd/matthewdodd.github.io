                  </hi>. I am a beer-house keeper of Woolwich—about half-past 4 o'clock in the afternoon of Tuesday, 13th March. I was at the Inverness Arms beer-shop, at Plumstead, in Kent—I was standing in front of the bar—the door of the tap-room was wide open, and I could see in—I saw Robert Ford lying asleep—I saw Holland in the tap-room, standing before the bar—I do not think anybody was with him—there was an old gentleman there reading the paper—I don't think he had anything to drink—Holland had some half-and-half with a man that came out of the street; a man that was working outside, and came in in his shirtsleeves—they had a pot of half-and-half—the man then came out, and Holland after him—the old man that was reading the newspaper was sitting in the same room—I saw the prisoner take the watch out of Ford's righthand pocket; not the guard—I won't be sure whether it was from the waistcoat or not, I would not swear—I saw the watch—I think it was silver—I was some little distance off; it might be three or four yards—I did not see his hand go towards Ford without a watch; but I saw it come, and it came away with one—then Hol'and went into the street—I went out to the door and watched him to the bottom of the street, and there I lost sight of him—I saw him afterwards near Beresford-square, about a quarter or half-past 5 o'clock—I followed him to the bottom of Inverness-place—the Inverness Arms is about the middle of the street—I saw him meet Ford and speak to him—I did not hear what they said to one another then—they came back again into Wool-wich, and another man with them—I joined them—Ford spoke to me, in the presence of Holland, about his having lost his watch—Ford took Holland into the Burridge Arms to give him something to drink—I said that Ford need not go far, for the man was there that had got his watch—I asked Ford whether he was going to give Holland in charge—he spoke to Holland, and Holland said that he would go and get his watch, that he would make the watch right for him, he would get it for him again if he did not give him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186004020089"></xptr>
               <p>in charge—I then asked him whether he would give him in charge or no, and he said, no; if he would give him some recompense—he would not come to terms with him, and so I went for the constable—I saw the constable take Holland into custody—the constable asked him what he had to say about the watch—Holland did not say that he had not had it—he never spoke to the policeman at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When the Magistrate asked you whether you ever heard me say that I would make some recompense for the watch, did not you say that you did not hear anything at all about it; that you did not hear the words? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer of the Royal Arsenal, at Woolwich—On the afternoon of Tuesday, 13th March, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I was in the tap-room of the Inverness Arms beer-house, at Woolwich—when I went in there I had a silver watch—when I came out of the tap-room I had not got my watch with me; only the guard and the ring—I have got the ring now—I do not know who took the watch—when I woke up I found it gone—I do not know how I lost it—it was broken off—it was safe when I went to sleep—I was a little the worse for drink—I don't know how long I was asleep—I met Featherstone, later in the afternoon, at the Burridge Arms, where he told me that Holland was the man that took the watch—I asked Holland if he had got it, to give it me, or to give me some recompense for it—he said to the other man, "Will you make it right with him for the watch?"—the man said, "I don't know"—Holland told me he had planted the watch—when the witness went for a policeman Holland ran away from me, and I ran after him—he said, "Don't give me in charge, I will make it right with you for the watch; I have planted it"—when the policeman came I gave him in charge—he did not say anything else to me about the watch—he did not deny having taken it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you not recollect stopping me in the Plumstead-road? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I stopped you to ask after a man that had gone by—you said, "What's up?"—and I said, "I have lost my watch"—I told the other man we met that I had lost my watch—you said, "Let us go into the Burridge Arms and have a drop of beer before we go and look for it"—I did not know the man we fell in company with—I do not know whether the tap-room wae open for every one while I was asleep—the watch was in my pocket when I went to sleep—you said that you would find the watch.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 151). On 13th March, soon after 5 o'clock in the evening, I came up to where Ford and Holland were, in Woolwich—Featherstone came for me to where I was standing—when we came to where they were, the prisoner had run away, and Featherstone and I ran up the Burridge-road together, and I took the prisoner into custody—I asked him what he had to say about the charge made against him of stealing Ford's watch—he would not speak—I repeated the question two or three times</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186004020090"></xptr>
               <p>and he answered nothing—I have made inquiries about the watch; but could not find it anywhere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He never said anything? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No. <hi rend="italic">The witness' deposition being read, stated</hi>: "I took the prisoner to the station, and he then said he had not the watch"—When he got to the station, he said he never had the watch—that was the first time he said it—I told the magistrate that he said that—he was searched and I found a pawn ticket for a pair of trousers—I have not got it here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> On the 13th of last month I went into this house; I was told to go in by this man in the street to have a drink of beer with him: he came in after me and we had a pot of beer. I came out again; if he saw me take the watch why did he not stop me; and when I met the man that lost the watch, if I had got it, should I have gone down the road with him again to look for it? I should have tried to get out of his way. He said, "Have you seen a man with a white jacket going down here, as I have lost my watch?" I said, "No; but I will go with you and look for it," and he took me into the Burridge Arms, and then I was accused by Featherstone. I get my living by working hard.</p>

                  </hi> I am a sailor, and live at the Sailors' Home. On the evening of the 6th of July, I was going home, I met the prisoner, and went with them to a public-house—I had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and copper, loose in my fob—I had a watch and guard-chain—I was not exactly sober, but knew what I was about—we were at the public-house about an hour—we came out—the Sailors' Home was locked, I could not get in, and went home with the prisoners to their house, in Angel-gardens—they both went into the room with me—Hornsby remained in the room with me—Fairburn went out before I undressed myself—Hornsby and me then un<lb></lb>dressed and went to bed—I put my clothes on a chair—the money was safe in my fob-pocket then, and my watch in my waistcoat-pocket—about half an hour after I had been in bed with Hornsby, she got up—a girl, who I do not know, came into the room, remained there about half a minute, and they both went out together—a few minutes after they left, I got up, found my money was gone, and the door locked—I attempted to open it, but could not—I cannot say whether I attempted to open the door, or to go to my pocket first—it was all in a moment—I opened the window and screamed out for the police—I cannot swear whether Hornsby came in before the police—the policeman and all came in together—I saw the watch after the policeman came in—this produced is it.</p>

               <p>about it—she denied having the money or watch—we turned the bed over several times, and at last found a pocket underneath it—Hornsby said, "Let me go back again?"—I said, "What for?"—she turned away, put her hand up her clothes, and I saw the chain of the watch as she was putting it under the bed—I took the watch and guard—this is it.</p>

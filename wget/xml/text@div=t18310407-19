               <p>ROBERT ROBINSON. I am a <rs id="t18310407-19-viclabel125" type="occupation">painter and glazier</rs>

On the 16th of March, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening. I went to a house at the corner of Bryanstone and Cumberland-streets, and got very much intoxicated; I went out, and in Edgware-road, going towards home, I met three young men; the prisoner Trigg was one of them: I knew him before well by sight, by his being at a fishmonger's, in Dover-street; Marylebone - I had never been in his company; as I passed them I received a knock on my hat - I turned, and asked what that was for, and they came up towards me; I said, "Trigg, is that you?" he said, "Yes, what are you going to stand to drink?" I said it was late, and there was no house open - they said they knew of a house, and took me to a house in Adam-street, which I believe is the Carpenters' Arms, but I am not certain - we had two half-pints of gin among us; I paid for it - I had my full share - we came out together in about ten minutes, and walked together to the corner of <placeName id="t18310407-19-crimeloc126">Praed-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You were very drunk when you met them? A. Yes, but not so much so as afterwards; they were in custody when I received the sovereign - I recollect paying for three pints of ale and a glass of rum and water; I had nothing more to my knowledge till I got with the prisoners.</p>
               <p>MARK HARRIS. I am a Police-constable. On the 16th of March I was on duty in Praed-street, and saw several persons coming behind me; I thought they were in familiar conversation - I heard somebody say, "What do you mean? - Police!" I heard several repeated blows on the crown of a hat - I went to the spot, saw the prisoners Trigg and Fenn running, and saw the prosecutor still running after the others; I saw three persons running, and a fourth following them; the two ran into a shed in Irongate wharf - I kept my eyes on that shed till a serjeant of our division came; we then went in, and found Trigg and Fenn - I was afterwards in the watch-house; Robinson was there - all the prisoners were then in custody; Robinson pointed out Kitchins distinctly to me, and said, "You are the villian that attempted to rob me of my watch, but got my chain and seals, and struck me;" Kitchins denied it -I have received a sovereign from the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were the prisoners searched? A. Yes, minutely - nothing was found on them.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BRUCE. I am a Policeman. I was in Edgware-road, at the corner of Church-street, and heard a cry of Police! and Stop thief! for about ten minutes - I went to the corner of Bell-street, and saw the prisoner Kitchins come through the passage - Robinson was running, as if trying to overtake him, and calling Police! they appeared<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070028"></xptr>to have been running a considerable way - neither of them could speak for a time; they were out of breath - I stopped Kitchins, and Robinson said, "You d - d villain, you have robbed me of my watch;" he then said, "Not my watch, it is my chain;" I searched him at the watch-house, and found five keys on him, of rather a peculiar description.</p>
               <p>Kitchins' Defence. I was walking through White Lion-passage when the Policeman stopped me - the prosecutor was coming behind, hallooing something.</p>

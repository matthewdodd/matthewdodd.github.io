I believe I lost four. I advertised a reward of two guineas for a discovery. On the Thursday following, at night, I heard a noise of somebody in a carpenter's shop, which is at the back of mine. I fired off two horse pistols and waited some time, and found every thing quiet. About two in the morning, I heard somebody call, Mr. Hopkins! Mr. Hopkins ! you have been robbed again! the thief is in the carpenter's shop, and here are two of your coppers dropt in the street. I came down and went into the yard. We surrounded the place. I went into a back place, and, under a form in a wash-house, I found the prisoner at the bar; he is my neighbour's apprentice. He was asked how long he had been there; he said, Ever since eleven o'clock. A neighbour of mine told him he saw him in Mr. Ewers's shop, a little before the coppers were found in the street.</p>

            . On the Friday morning I got up by three o'clock, and about a quarter after five I heard these coppers fall into Bedshire-street. I went to the door and saw them lying, they had been concealed between the carpenter's shop and the prosecutor's shop. There is a parapet wall behind, in which they might be concealed. After this I heard a noise in the carpenter's shop. I looked through the key hole, and saw the prisoner within that shop. I saw no more of him till after he was taken, and brought into the smith's shop where I work. It was me that alarmed Mr. Hopkins first.</p>

            . I was at work, blowing the fire up, when I heard a noise. I and my partner, the last witness, went out, and saw the coppers lying: we brought them into the shop. I saw the prisoner in the carpenter's shop; we knew him before, and it was daylight, so that we could see him, so as to know him. I went out into Denmark-street, that he should not go out that way. I got over two or three pales to get at him, and by that time I got there, he was taken.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I apprehend these coppers had been concealed between the carpenter's shop and a sugarbaker's shop, for an opportunity of fetching them away. We all imagine they fed from that place.</p>

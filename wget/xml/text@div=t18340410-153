               <p>JOHN GEDGE. I live in Munster-street, Regent's-park. On the 21st of February, the door of a vault in my area was broken open, and I missed some fowls - I went, the next morning, to the prisoner's shop, in the <placeName id="t18340410-153-crimeloc874">New-road</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe they are very common fowls? A. No; I never saw any like them - this other one is not the same - I could swear to them, if I saw them running in a field in Yorkshire - 
               <persName id="t18340410-153-person975">Harris</persName>
             was with me when I went to the prisoner's shop, when the prisoner said he knew the fowls were stolen - I have always told the truth on this subject - I saw Anderson after I had been before the magistrate - he is a paper-hanger, in the North-road - I told him that the prisoner was committed to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him that you should never have done any thing of the kind, if the prisoner had not written a note to you, telling you you should not have the fowls any more? A. No; I did not - I said a message had come to me, by Harris, saying that I should not have the fowls again - he was committed and locked up in my presence - the magistrate said he would bail him, if he could get bail.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that it was a very foolish business, and that the prisoner might have settled the whole affair for a shilling? A. I do not recollect that - I frequently said it was a very trifling thing - I might have said that it was only a shilling or two matter - I said it was a foolish thing, but not that he might have settled it for a shilling - I had him taken up on the Monday, two days after the fowls were missed - they were in his custody till the Monday - he might have disposed of them in the time - Mr. Harris is here - the prisoner said, in his presence, he thought the fowls were stolen.</p>

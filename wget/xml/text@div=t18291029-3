               <p>MR. LEE. Q.Was any of this linen marked off as old? A. I cannot tell till I see it; on the two last occasions that any was marked off, I objected to it being worn out too soon - she showed me some table-cloths, which she said could be cut into napkins, and used as dusters.</p>

Yes - it was the last thing I had to sell; when I bought the sheets I told her there was a mark of the club on them, and if any thing should happen I should say I had them from her - I cannot read, but I had seen the linen so much, I knew the mark: she said they belonged to the club, and were given to her by the club, or I would not have sold them - I sold the table-cloths for 2s. - they were very old; I gave her the money.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was fetched to the AEthenium; the prisoner was called in before the committee - no threat or promise was made: I told her I was an officer - that the committee had reason to believe she had taken things belonging to the club, and sent them out of the house - that she need not answer any question unless she pleased - I said, "Have you sent any thing out?" she said, "No, I have not;" I said she was suspected of taking sugar, tea, meat, and things; I asked if she had sent out any linen - she said not; I then asked if she knew Mrs. Gray - she said she did know her; I said, "Have you not sent linen out by her?" she said she had not, nor had she sent any thing by her - Mrs. Gray and the linen were then brought into the room; I said," Do you mean to say you have not sent that out?" she said, "Oh, that was old linen, and I thought I had a right to it;" that Mr. Macgrath had looked it out, and put it by- Macgrath said, "Never such linen as that;" the napkins were not produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Did you ask if she had sent out old worn-out linen? A. No - she denied having sent an article out; she said nothing about perquisites - the napkins are old, but fit for the use they are now made for; she said she had herself cut them into napkins.</p>
               <p>MRS. HOOD. I cut the two table-cloths up myself.</p>

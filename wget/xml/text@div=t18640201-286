I reside at Hazleoak-house, Guildford-road, in the parish of West Ham—on the evening of 8th January I went in the field ad<lb></lb>joining my house, and fed my fowls; I had thirteen then—I can't say that I saw thirteen there then—I did not count them—I went into the field next morning and found the front part of the fowl-shed broken away, and missed eleven fowls—on the afternoon of that day I examined some fowls which were in the possession of police-sergeant Bidgood—they were mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. William Chaplin and Benjamin Worthy Home; they are carriers. Brain was their carman—I sent him to Deptford on the 18th of September, with a load of bales of blacking—he had his nose-bags full of mixed corn for the horses, consist<lb></lb>ing of white oats, black oats, beans, and chaff, mixed together—he had no business to do any thing with it but to give it to the horses—he was to feed them when he pleased—here is some corn which I believe to be the same we sent by him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. On the 18th of September, about half-past five o'clock, I was on duty at Rotherhithe—I saw a cart with two horses, standing at a public-house door—I passed on the near side, and saw Brain at the tail of the cart, and Stone, the ostler, went from the horses with a nose-bag under his arm, which appeared to be half full—I saw him cross the road, and go into a shed or stable which he occupies—he came out instantly, with an empty nose-bag—I did not see Stone take the nose-bag from the horses—Brain was at the stern of the cart—he saw him and saw me—Brain went on a short distance with the cart and the empty nose-bag—I went and asked how the ostler came in possession of the nose-bag and its contents—he said Stone asked him for the corn, and he gave it him—I asked if his master allowed him to do it, and he said, "No"—I told "m to come back, and I would make the ostler give it him back—he came back, and I told Stone to give the corn back which he had taken—he took the nose-bag from Brain, and went into the stable—I followed him, and he</p>

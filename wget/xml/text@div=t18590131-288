                  </hi>. I am a private in the Royal Marines at Woolwich—on Tuesday morning, 13th January, about 10 o'clock, I was in a room in the barracks called B 1—the prisoner came in with two others who had just come from parade, Dumbelow and Rickards—they followed me out of the room again—my tunic hung up behind the bed, where it always hung when I was not on duty—it had been there three days—I saw my tobacco box about 10 minutes before ten—there was 14 shillings in it—I counted it; a witness who is here saw me do so—nobody else saw me count it—the pri<lb></lb>soner saw my box—he owed me sixpence; and after he got his pay at a quarter after 8 that morning, he came to pay me; he gave me a shilling, and I gave him sixpence out—I took it out of the box, out of my tunic pocket—he saw the box, and remarked, "You have got a lot of money there;" I said, "Not much"—about 10 o'clock I went out to get a shave—the prisoner, Dumbelow, and Rickards were then in the room—Dumbelow followed me out first, and then Rickards, and the prisoner was left in the room—I came back in about five minutes, and the prisoner was alone in the room—I went to my pocket to get the money to go and pay for a pair of boots, and I found my box and money gone—the prisoner asked me what I was searching for; I said, "for my tobacco-box, containing 14 shillings"—he said, "You must have mislaid it somewhere"—I looked about the room, but could not find it—I have not seen it since—I went and gave information to the corporal, and went with him to the Coach and Horses public-house—the corporal went in and came out with the prisoner—the prisoner said to me, "You do not think I have got your money, do you?"—I said, "I think you have"—he said, "All the money I have got is twopence; I only had sevenpence when I came out"—the corporal wanted to get him to the barracks to have him searched—he was not willing to come—I had to go after the picquet, he then went with us—the corporal went after the ser<lb></lb>geant; and while he was gone, the prisoner pulled off his boot and stocking—he held the stocking in his hand for a few minutes, and when he thought no one was looking, he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it under the bed—I heard something jink in the stocking—I went across to him and asked what he had there—he said, "It is the twopence I flung out but now; you can take it if you like"—I took up the stocking, and found in it 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and amongst it was a six-pence that I could swear to—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know it by this hole at the bottom of the head, and it is rather dented on the tail side—I saw that sixpence amongst the other money just before I lost it—I asked the prisoner if anybody had been in the room while I went to be shaved, and he said no one had been.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the Royal Marines quartered at Woolwich. About 10 o'clock on the morning of the 13th January I was in the barrack-room B 1—The prisoner Drake and Dumbelow were with me—I saw Drake go out, Dumbelow followed him, and I followed Dumbelow, and left the prisoner behind.</p>

I am sergeant in the Royal Marines, quartered at Wool-wich—on Tuesday morning, 13th January, about 10 o'clock, I went into the room B 1, and searched the bags there—I did not find anything—at a quarter to 9 in the evening I found the prisoner in the room, and the pro<lb></lb>secutor told me in his hearing that he had found 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his stocking—I sent the prisoner to the guard-room—on the way there he said to me, "This looks rather black, but I am all right—when I came in from the Com<lb></lb>mon I saw a friend, and she gave me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—we had been on the Common to drill—he said he had met his friend at the corner of the Queen's Arms, and she had gone to London—he did not give her name and address, he said he did not know it—next morning, between 9 and 10, he was taken before the field-officer—he there stated that a friend, a man, had given him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he could not produce the man, in fact he did not know him—the prosecutor told me in the first instance of having lost his money, and I went and searched the men in the room—I did not search the prisoner, for I had very little suspicion of him at that time—it was his sudden disap<lb></lb>pearance from the barrack-room, after coming in from drill, that caused my suspicion—he left suddenly without taking his coffee, which was very unusual.</p>

               <p>to London, and he would come again on Sunday to see me, and then he was going away for a long time—the other marine was going down the town and got among the girls, and I said I must take care of my money, and I went backwards and put 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my stocking—I have been nearly 11 years in the service—it is not likely I should do such a thing—and in another 12 months my time is up—Edward Phipps is the marine that was along with me at the time—he is not here—neither he nor I were allowed to speak, only the witnesses against me.</p>

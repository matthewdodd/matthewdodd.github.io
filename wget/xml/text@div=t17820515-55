             and his father came on board: after that, I heard the deceased say to King, What, gallows! King said, What, York! - Weir being a Yorkshire-man. I took very little notice till I saw the deceased strike at King's legs, and set him down on his backside on the quarter-deck; it appeared to me to look serious; I took more notice; King got up, and they both took their jackets off.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any thing before King got up? - Yes; I saw him strike him a slap on the face with his open hand: upon that they instantly stripped, and went to fighting.</p>
               <p>Did Weir return the blow before they stripped? - I can't be positive, whether before or afterwards; they stripped instantly, and sought; King fell down; he rose, and they made several closes; I cannot say how many; there were several bouts, and several falls.</p>
               <p>Which appeared to have the better in the fight? - I can't say which had the better; King fell three or four times, and Weir fell three or four times; the last fall, they went both down together; I don't know positively which was next the deck.</p>
               <p>Did they fall over any thing? - No; on the flat deck. Upon the last fall, I put my hands round Weir to take him up; he put his head back, and gave one single groan, and departed.</p>
               <p>In what manner did King behave, upon that? - He appeared to be very serious, when he saw what the circumstances were like to turn to.</p>
               <p>Was he a good deal concerned? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he much hurt? - I don't know upon my word.</p>

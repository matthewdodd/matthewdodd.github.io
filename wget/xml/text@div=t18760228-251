                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Bellamy of Gordon Wharf' Rotherhithe—I have known Latimer some time—I had seen him about a month previous to 15th December—I saw him on 15th December about 1 o'clock, as I was passing from the office to the wharf—he said "I have come down to sample five quarters of wheat sweepings that are lying outside the wharf in a barge, and I want you to land them for me"—I asked him for his dock note or a landing note—he said that he had not got either; he had only got a sale note—I told him I would not land them upon that—he said "I have come from the market, arid I have seen Mr. Bellamy, and he has given me permission to land it here"—the men were going to dinner, but I stopped them, and gave them directions to land the wheat—I saw the barge—it was made fast from barges from the wharf—I saw that she had more than five quarters in her—I called out for the name of the barge, but Latimer had then gone—I left before the sacks were landed—I returned in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and the barge was gone, and five quarters of wheat in ten sacks were on the wharf which were not there before—I made an entry of them in my rough entry book—it was one of our men who called out the name of the barge; but I cannot say who—he may be here, and he may not; there are four men, and two of them are here. (<hi rend="italic">The</hi> Court con<lb></lb>sidered that as the men went into the barge where the wheat was to unload it, what they said in the course of doing so, was part of the transaction, and there <hi rend="italic">fore admissable in evidence.</hi>) One of our men called out the name of the barge <hi rend="italic">William</hi> and I chalked something on ten of the sacks, and entered it in my book at the same time—no goods are allowed to be landed without being entered—this is the entry I made "December 15th, ex. barge, Latimer. <hi rend="italic">William</hi> five quarters wheat sweepings"—that is in my writing—a landing and delivery book is kept by the clerks in the office—they have the notes, or, if they have not, they take it from my book; mine is only a rough memorandum—there being no note in this instance, I made a communication to the clerk—a bulk book is also kept, and the clerk who keeps it gets his information from the day-book—I did not make a communication to him—I saw Mr. Bellamy next day, who directed me not to deliver the sacks till we got the note—1 next saw Latimer on the Friday or Saturday—this delivery order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) had been left on my desk the same day—when he came in he asked me if I had delivered the five quarters of sweepings—I said "No</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wharfinger of Gordon Wharf, Rotherhithe—our general rule is not to permit anything to be landed without a voucher for ownership—I do not recollect anything ever being landed and not entered in our books—it was Latimer's duty to make the first entry in his own rough book, and of my clerks to prepare entries in the other books of the firm—the landing and delivery books are here; the bulk book is posted from them—I have known Latimer fifteen years—he was a factor's waterman at one time, and a lighterman as well as a dealer in wheat, sweepings and so on—he did not apply to me previous to 15th December, for permission to land ten sacks of wheat at Gordon Wharf, without documents—on 16th December, I first saw the ten sacks on my wharf and gave directions about them—I saw Latimer at the office on the Tuesday following—he said "Mr. Bellamy will you deliver those five quarters of wheat landed on my account"—I said "Yes, if you will give me an order"—he said "Oh, yes, I have got the order," and put his hand in his pocket and gave it to me—I said "All right," and he left—this is it.

                  </hi>. I live at Jamaica Level, Rotherhithe—my sister, Elizabeth Berridge, carries on her late husband's business of a lighterman and I am employed by Messrs. Hadley, and I also assist my sister in her business—my sister's barges are hired at times by Messrs. Hadley to bring wheat from different, places on the river—Hester was formerly in my sister's service and his brother Edward worked under him at times—the course of business was to send empty sacks down in barges" to be filled at the place where the bulk was and brought back full to the mills at Black-friars—in Messrs. Hadley's business full sacks would not be sent down the river, only empty ones—on 13th, 14th, and 15th December there was a cargo of Calcutta wheat in the Victoria Docks belonging partly to Messrs. Hadley—the prisoner Hester made out this account of his work during that week; it is in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">This contained the following:</hi> "Tuesday night, <hi rend="italic">William</hi>, from D. to Deptford. * Wednesday, <hi rend="italic">William</hi>, from Deptford to Mill.") It was Edward Hester's duty to load the barges at the Victoria Docks and bring them up the river to the mill—he could get to Blackfriars in one tide—I did not give the prisoner Hester directions until Tuesday evening about 6.30 or 7 o'clock to go to the Victoria Docks and join his brother—he had been employed on Monday navigating another barge, the <hi rend="italic">Lizzie</hi>—I gave him no intimation till Tuesday evening that he would have to go to the Victoria Docks to his brother—I have to direct the men where they shall go—I never employed the prisoners on the <hi rend="italic">William</hi>—the <hi rend="italic">William.</hi> was not employed at this time by any one except Messrs.

Bellamy's Wharf being made fast, and after Hester came ashore I'gave him his orders; at the time I was speaking to him I saw ten sacks of wheat on. Bellamy's wharf, three marked "Hadley," and seven marked "Starkie—that is the usual way in which our sacks are marked—Starkie is a sack-lender; I have borrowed thousands of sacks of him—I never lent any sacks of Hadley's—I said to Hester "You are having a pretty nice game"—he said "Nothing to do with you, Governor"—I gave him in custody—I saw the barge <hi rend="italic">William</hi> there—I was present when the police took possession of the ten sacks—up to the time of seeing them there I had no notion what<lb></lb>ever that ten sacks were there—these chalk marks were more legible than they are now, they have got rubbed off—I can see now "Swp," I believe,</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLET</hi>. I personally saw the cargo of wheat at the Victoria Docks about November last—I believe the ship was <hi rend="italic">City of Manchester</hi>—the wheat was then on the jetty—it was Indian wheat—a large quantity of wheat of various kinds is imported here from India—we have missed Hadley's sacks, and sometimes they come back, and sometime they do not—we use thousands of Hadley's sacks—we also hire Starkie's sacks—I was at the City flour mills when I told Hester to go down and join his brother on board the <hi rend="italic">William</hi>; that was about 7 p.m.—I do not know that I detained him later, and that he complained that the last train would be gone—he did not tell me afterwards that he lost the train, and was obliged to walk down—I cannot say whether he accompanied me to the corn market on the 15th, but he most likely met me there—the market is from 11 o'clock to 2.30—he was not with me at the Corn Exchange from 1 o'clock to 1.30; nor was he there to my knowledge—we were in want of that very barge of wheat, and Mr. Hadley was very angry that the barge was not up—I did not see Hester that morning till after he got up with his bargs-1 swear I did not see him before the barge got up to the flour mills—to the best of my belief I saw him in the market that afternoon—persons are not admitted into the market from 2.30 to 3.30, but plenty of sales are trans<lb></lb>acted after 2.30—the door is closed, and you cannot go in, but those inside can transact business or go out—I believe I was in after it was shut that day, but I should not like to swear that I saw Hester—it is the best part of five miles from Victoria Docks to Deadman's Dock, and from Deadman's Dock to Gordon Wharf, is very nearly two miles, or it may be under it—it was high water at London Bridge at 3.42 on the morning of the 15th, and the difference at Victoria Docks would be about twenty minutes—I do not know whether it is more than that—if the wind was blowing hard from the S.W. it would obstruct the progress of the barge—I was not out that night—Hester was in my brother and sister's employ about four years—I can only speak to eighteen months of my own knowledge—each barge on the river has a number as well as a name, but lots of barges have one man's number on them—there are many <hi rend="italic">Williams</hi> navigating the Thames.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Newbon &amp; Co., of Doctor's Commons, solicitors for Mr. Hadley—I was engaged in the prosecution of Hester and attended before the Magistrate at Greenwich police-court—I saw Marsh there on 30th December, the morning that Latimer surrendered, and before Lati<lb></lb>mer was put before the Magistrate—Marsh had seen Hester previously in my presence; Laxton, Marsh, and I were going to the station at the time; Marsh and I were walking alone, and I said to him "You see, Marsh, Laxton will prove the false pretences and that the goods were landed, and you will identify Hester as the man who brought the barge up"—he said "Oh yes, he is the man right enough"—I am sure that was said by him after he had seen Hester in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a miller, in part<lb></lb>nership with my father, Samuel Mumford, and my uncle, Peter Mumford, in the Greenwich-road—Bulpitt has been in our employ, as foreman, about six years of the time—our counting house is thirty yards away from the mill—Bulpitt's duty was to be in the mill—his duties were, to see to the general working of the mill, and to deliver goods to customers that came for goods—when a customer comes wanting goods, he comes into the counting house, which is away from the mill; if he wants bran, for instance,</p>

               <p>he asks for bran; the clerk in the counting house writes a ticket, which is taken out of this book, for the goods which the customer asks for—the ticket is, "Deliver to Mr.—, four bushels of bran," and a counterpart is written here—one part is torn out and given to the customer—he takes it up to the mill, delivers it to one of the men appointed to deliver goods, and it is the duty of that man to take this ticket and enter it in thin book, which they keep at the counting house in the mill; they put the folio of this book in the ticket, and then deliver the goods according to the ticket which the customer has—Hawke has been a customer of our firm—this green book is kept at the counting house in the mill, in the custody of those men that are in the mill, whose duty it is to attend to the customers—there are three, Bulpitt is one of them—Hawke has been in the habit of coming there for years, I cannot say exactly how long—on 19th Oct. Hawke came to the counting house about 20 minutes before 1—I heard him ask Roper, the clerk, for four bushels of bran—the clerk wrote the ticket for four bushels of bran, and said, "2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." and Hawke paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the clerk gave him the ticket—Hawke then went into the mill—after he was gone, for some reason I had walked down the yard, and stood at the door of the engine house—after Hawke had had his goods delivered to him, he drew close to me, and through a hole in the sack, about a foot from the bottom, I saw that he had not got bran in it—the yard being Mocked by other teams, his cart was stopped, and as I walked by I put my hand into the hole in the sack, and took out these middlings—I did not stop Hawke on that occasion; I took no notice—there was only one sack in his cart—Bulpitt was in the mill on that Thursday, between half past 12 and 1—there was no other delivery man there besides Bulpitt at that time—I put my thumb and finger into the hole in the sack—it was not necessary to put my hand in to see that it was middlings—I could see through the hole, and I took out a pinch—Bulpitt was the only delivery man in the mill between half past 12 and 1; that was the time Hawke came on both occasions—according to the regulations of the mill, Bulpitt would be the only man there—the other men had all gone to their dinner—I speak from the general conduct of the business—I saw Bulpitt in the mill—on Saturday, 21st Oct., Hawke came again, about 20 minutes to 1—he came to the counting house, and asked Roper, the clerk, for four bushels of bran—Roper wrote the ticket for four bushels of bran, and said, "4 bushels of bran, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," and he took the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is the duty of the man, after he has booked the ticket in the green book, which is kept in the counting house in the mill, to deliver it to the customer again—I have since seen those tickets—we found Thursday's ticket upon Hawke when we searched him at the station—Saturday's ticket was left in the mill in the green book, and we found it there—after Hawke received his ticket he took it down to the mill, and I saw Bulpitt deliver a sack to Hawke—he dropped it down on a stage about the height of the cart, and Hawke took it off and put it into his cart—he then drew away, and went away some distance—I stopped him in Deptford Broadway, which is about as far from our mill as from here to Ludgate-hill—I said, "Hawke, what have you got there?"—he said, "I don't know, Sir; something heavy"—I said, "Well, then, you had better come along with me to the station house"—I took him to the station, and he there said he did not know what he had got—on examining we found he had got middlings—I have a sample of it here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—this is not what I took out of the sack, but it is exactly the same—I then gave him into custody—he went with me to the station without any officer—there was a</p>

E. R. in my master's hand writing; I can swear it to be his hand writing; he was not at home at the time; I saw the dimity on the counter after the gentleman was gone out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? I can swear it.</p>
               <p>What is the lowest value of it? - It cost my master nineteen shillings and three pence; we sell it for more.</p>
               <p>Did not you see her hand or her cloak move? - I saw her hand behind her all the time she was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Then she was leaning against the counter where this piece was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you see her move? - I saw her elbow move.</p>
               <p>Now, have you no doubt but that was the time when she took this piece of dimity? - I have no doubt but what it was.</p>

               <p>The man took me and sent for a constable, and then he picked up this piece of dimity, and told the Justice, that he went to the further end of the shop on purpose to give me an opportunity of taking it; he said, you have robbed me, but shall never rob me any more; here I am as innocent as the baby unborn.</p>

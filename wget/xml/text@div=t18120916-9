             - A. Yes. On Monday, the 17th of July, she came to our shop, she had strawberries to sell. She purchased two yards of ribbon, and at the time she was in the shop there came in a man. He bought about a yard and a half of galloon, and while we were serving it I saw her take her hands from the drawer, and put them under her coat, but there being no one but me and my sister in the shop, we suffered her to go from the door, and on looking over the drawer we found that she had taken two pieces. We sent my little boy after her to the end of the street, and the same man that was in our shop was talking to her. She had not seen the little boy before. She came back with him, and when we taxed her with it she said, she had not got it. We sent for a constable. She said, that if we would suffer her to go she would send the ribbon back; instead of which she brought some money, which we did not chuse to take. She said, the ribbon she could not get, but if we would excuse her, if it was six pounds she would pay.</p>
               <p>Q. How much ribbon was taken - A. In one piece about eighteen yards, in the other upwards of twenty. One piece was worth about fifteen shillings, and the other about twenty.</p>

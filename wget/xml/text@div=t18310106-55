Neate's men came out; I told him which way they went - I went into Oxford-street, and saw them both in Orchard-street; I saw the coustable, and gave them in charge - the handkerchiefs hung inside the prosecutor's door; he took them from there - Henwright was standing not half a yard off when Roach took them; I followed him when he run away.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I am a country drover, I drive for Mr. Ireson: On Sunday, the 7th of September, I was in <placeName id="t18000917-86-crimeloc466">Smithfield-market</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was there any particular pen to which your attention was drawn? - A. Yes; a pen with fifteen sheep in it; there were amongst them three polewethers; they were marked with a dot on each hip, and a dot between the shoulders; they were ruddle marks; I saw them all in the pen between eleven and twelve on the Sunday night; I then saw

             bring some sheep down towards the next pen to that in which the fifteen were; I saw him open our pen-gate, and turn a sheep out of the pen; it was one of the three pole-wethers that I have mentioned; he put it amongst the others that he had brought down, and then he drove all the sheep back towards one of the empty pens, near St. Bartholomew's-hospital.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he driving them down in a direction from your pen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner, Christmas, at all? - A. Yes; when Thomas drove the stock towards the other pen, Christmas followed him, and assisted in driving them.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that stock, after your polewether had got into it? - A. The two prisoners drove them away; they both helped to drive them right across the market, from Long-lane to Cowlane.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time of night was it, when you last saw the two prisoners in that act? - A. Better than half past eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had you got with that stock, in which your pole-wether was? - A. About fourteen or fifteen yards from our pen.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you many other sheep to attend to that night? - A. Yes; about four hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see your master? - A. Not till about five o'clock on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information that was given to your master, was any thing done? - A. I shewed my master the remaining two pole-wether sheep that were in the pen, and then I told my master how it was; I took him to the pen where the sheep was, that had been lost; it was Curtis's pen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes; they used to work with Curtis, and did then; they are what we call London drovers; they drive for Curtis to the market, and from the market.</p>
               <p>Q.At five in the morning, you took your master to a stock of sheep? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In that stock, was there or not, the wether sheep that you had lost? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say, that you are sure that sheep was the same that you had lost? - A. Yes, I am sure of it; it was a pole-wether sheep.</p>
               <p>Q.Had the mark of which you speak, been altered or not? - A.It had; it was ruddled right across the dots; right across the loins, from hip to hip.</p>
               <p>Q.Notwithstanding that alteration of mark, are you able, upon your solemn oath, to say, that that was the same sheep that you lost from your pen? - A. The very same sheep; I have been in the habit of looking after sheep these twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. I will put it to you again; are you, upon the solemn oath you have taken, certain that it was the same identical sheep? - A.It was the same.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. In what pen was it that you saw this sheep, when you shewed it to your master? - A.Seven or eight pens further from our pen, than the stock were, before they drove them towards our pen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. What was done with the sheep that was so pointed out? - A. My master took the sheep out, and had it locked up at the Bear and Ragged Staff; that was between seven and eight in the morning, and it is there now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have had the care of four hundred sheep? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you drove them from the country? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not a shepherd, but a drover? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. We know that a shepherd knows the face of every sheep as well as a man knows his wife's face; but you, as a drover; cannot know the laces of the sheep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is the occupation of the prisoners to remove sheep that have strayed from one pen to another? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found it in the possession of the prisoners in Curtis's pen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Curtis attending there? - A. No; his salesman was.</p>
               <p>Q. He was there before you took this sheep away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell the prisoners that they were doing wrong? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had supposed they were stealing it, you would have stopped them? - A. I knew they were doing wrong; I followed them, and saw the sheep safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, in point of fact, you had never lost the sheep at all, you always knew where to find it? - A. They might have taken it away.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170084"></xptr>Q.But it was not taken away it remained in Curtis's pen till you found it? - A. I found it there in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You wished to have an opportunity of letting this sheep go astray, that you might have an opportunity of prosecuting these men? - A. I saw them drive it away.</p>

               <p>Q. But, you know, you might have saved the sheep, and saved this prosecution, if you had told them they were doing wrong? - A. I followed them to see where they went.</p>
               <p>Q.There were no other pole sheep in the market but your master's? - A. Yes, there were.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, don't you know there is a reward for sheep-stealing? - A. I have heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. So this sheep was never lost at all; and you came here to prosecute, in order to get a share of the reward? - A. It was drove away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. You do not know the countenances of the sheep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But I suppose you are pretty well acquainted with the marks of sheep? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you at all account for that cross-line from hip to hip? - A. It was put to blind the mark, I should suppose.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, did it or not resemble the mark of any other sheep in that pen where you found this sheep? - A. No, it did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When the gate of the pen, where the fifteen were, was opened, was Mr. Curtis present? - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoners were? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Nobody else? - A. Yes; there was another man just by.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a salesman in Smithfield market: On the 7th of this month, the last witness, Sculthorpe, was in my service, he was employed by me to watch my sheep; I had amongst them three pole wethers, in a pen of fifteen; I came into the market on the Monday morning about five o'clock, when I received some information from Sculthorpe.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that information, did you go with him to another pen? - A. I did; and found one of my pole wether sheep; the country mark, before I lost it, was a dot upon the shoulders, and a dot upon each hip; when I found it, it had a fresh ruddle across the loins from the one dot to the other; it appeared so fresh, that it must have been done since the first mark.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time does the market commence? - A. About five o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Could there be any transaction of sale, or delivery, at eleven or twelve o'clock at night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did these sheep belong to you, or were you only the agent to sell them? - A.Only the agent.</p>
               <p>Q.Who did they belong to? - A. Mrs. Gilbert.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps you never saw this sheep at all till you found it in Curtis's pen? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Though the market does not begin till five, any person might have drove the sheep out of the market between twelve and five? - A. Not unless they give a good account of them, there are so many constables about.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you belong to this prosecuting society? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. If a man is seen driving a sheep out of the market before market hours, he would have a good chance of being stopped by the constables? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are answerable for these sheep; and if they are lost, you must pay for them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were there any sheep in Curtis's pen that were marked in the same way that this was? - A. I do not know of any.</p>
               <p>The prisoners did not say any thing in their defence.</p>

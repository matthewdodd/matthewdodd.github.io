               <p>Q. What is Mr. Dean's name? - A.Robert; he is a customer of mine; he said he came from Mr. Dean's for a leg of mutton for a few friends' supper; I weighed the leg of mutton, and he desired me to put a note on the leg of mutton; I delivered the leg of mutton to him, and when he had left me about two minutes, I thought I had done wrong; I was writing in the shop, and I took my hat and endeavoured to overtake him; I overtook him going down Long-lane, by Charterhouse-street; he went through Charterhouse-square, the contrary way to Mr. Dean's; he went up to two men, who seemed to be waiting for him, and gave the leg of mutton to one of his companions; the man who took the leg of mutton went a contrary way from that which he had been; I followed the man with the leg of mutton till he came to Red Lion-street; I stopped him there, and brought him back to Mr. Dean's; I found the prisoner the same night between nine and ten, on Clerkenwell-green, at a public-house; upon seeing me and the officer, he got up to go away; upon that I stopped him and gave charge; I am sure he is the man.</p>

I went into the back kitchen to see if all was fast; I saw a string under the dresser; I laid hold of it, and pulled a cloth apron of mine out of the fish-kettle. I observed the prisoner had on a pair of my stockings; I watched her taking them off, and took them from the side of the bed, the instant she took them off. There was my name on them; she begged my pardon, and said she was ashamed of what she had done; she confessed taking my linen out of the clothes bag; and said it was through distress she had done it.</p>
               <p>Did you say it would be better for her to confess? - No I said nothing to her before she owned it. She said she must lie in the street if I turned her out; and begged I would let her stay. I had compassion on her, and consented for her to stay till she had cleaned the house. On Saturday I looked up every thing. On the Friday night I had some company playing at cards; she went up stairs and picked the lock, and took the muslin and some other things; I have never found them since.</p>

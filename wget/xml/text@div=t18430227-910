                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, and live in Chapel-street, Marylebone. On the 1st of Feb. I had twenty cotton handkerchiefs in one pile, and twelve silk handkerchiefs in another, at the corner of my window—the window had been broken a little, and I had placed a pasteboard against it—I saw the handkerchiefs safe at eight o'clock that evening, and the next morning, when I was taking down my shutters at half-past seven o'clock, I missed them—I found the pasteboard had been removed, and the glass was more broken than before—I saw three of the handkerchiefs afterwards at the station—these now produced are them.</p>

On the 16th of April they sent four loads of brick there, from their wharf, by the prisoner; I saw them loaded: he took one load at eight o'clock, one about eleven, one about half-past two or three, and the fourth about five o'clock. Between twelve and one o'clock I am sure he was at the City-road-basin, which is nearly a mile from Cold Bath-fields; he asked me what time it was; he had then a load of between eight and nine hundred bricks - he was the only person with it.</p>

            . I am foreman of the works at the House of Correction. On the 16th of April I saw the prisoner come there about eight o'clock in the morning; it is my business to receive the materials that come there; he came again about eleven, and the third time about five; I had not left the place from eight o'clock in the morning till five, except between twelve and one, when I went to get my dinner, and again soon after two, to go to the office, and then I left Robins there; when the prisoner came about five o'clock, I asked him how he came to be so long - he said he could not get loaded, on account of the number of carts; I said he need not have been five hours; he said, "I brought you one load between twelve and one o'clock, while you was at dinner, and put them down here" - but I am quite sure there were no bricks there but what I had left in the morning, which were about twelve hundred. I went to the City-road, and inquired how many loads had been sent, and the foreman showed me a paper, which stated that he had delivered four loads to him, at the times he has mentioned.</p>

Yes; he asked me if he should have his dinner - I said, "Just as you like, I am going to get something to eat." He was in the wharf till two o'clock, and then he went out with his load.</p>

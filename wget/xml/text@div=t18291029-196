Longman, Rees and Co., Westley and Co., and Mr. Marshall, to take impressions from steel plates for the forthcoming annuals, the Friendship's Offering, the Gem, the Literary Souvenir, and the Juvenile Forget Me Not; I was employed first about June last - the respective proprietors find paper for those plates: I had struck off impressions from them all, previous to the 19th of September, but never gave any of them out of my custody. The female prisoner was in my employ, as <rs id="t18291029-196-deflabel1104" type="occupation">servant</rs>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290078"></xptr>COURT. Q. Did you say they had been sold? A. I said she had almost ruined me by giving these prints to her mother, and their being exposed for public sale, as it would show I was not a trustworthy person; I could not ascertain how many I had lost - we have an immense quantity, and it would be impossible to detect one or two dozen - at that time none ought to have been issued to the public - I had delivered some of the Juvenile Forget Me Not to Messrs. Westley and Davis.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. Had you any right to any of them yourself? A. According to the custom of the trade we consider ourselves entitled to one or two impressions, not more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. I believe you were suspected of having parted with them? A. Yes, at first: after the examination at the office I asked Simpson how he came by the prints, and he said an elderly woman with a child sold them to him - he asked me if there was any one I suspected about my house; I said I could not possibly suspect any one of my work-people; at my suggestion he went willingly to my house, to see if he could point out the person who sold them - he said it was not my female servant; it struck me it might probably be her mother - we went to her mother's in London-street; he knocked, and I staid outside - her mother came to the door, and he told me that was the woman; I had parted with some of them to Messrs. Westley's binders, to be bound in the usual way, and I think to some others. Simpson was out on bail; I believe there were some impressions exhibited by the resective proprietors.</p>

             Longman and others. I went to Simpson's house, in Tottenham-court-road; he deals in books and prints - this was on the 19th of September; I saw him, and asked for some prints - he produced several portfolios, and I saw some impressions for the Gem and the Literary Souvenir for the coming year; the publishers of those works get them out about the end of October - I bought two of them at 6d. each, and asked if he had any more; he said he had had more, and might possibly have some in a week or two- I marked the two I bought - these are them; these letters at the bottom of the print are not put by the engraver, but by a person he sends them to - we receive them perfect - this one is "Jacob's Dream," published by Longman and Co., and this is</p>
               <p>"Saturday Night," published by Marshall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. When you went to the shop did you see any other prints of a similar description? A. No; I saw none in the window - I went into the back shop: they were in the port-folios, among others - no doubt persons buy a great many prints, and sell one print for more than they give for the whole; these are in the same state as I bought them, except my marking - one of them was soiled; when they are soiled they are of little value.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What would the value of them be if not soiled? A.Perhaps 6d. or 1s., or 1s. 6d.; Simpson sells second-hand books - these could not be the engraver's proofs, because they have the letters to them.</p>

On the 19th of September I went to Mr. Simpson's shop, and bought five prints of annuals and another; these are them - some of them are good prints: there may be one or two damaged or dirty - I gave 2s. for the five; I asked where he got them - he said from a girl who represented that she had been sent by her young mistress, and he supposed they were engravers' proofs.</p>

               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Do the prints vary in value? A. Yes; the plates cost from one hundred to one hundred and eighty guineas a piece - these prints are worth 1s. or 1s. 6d. each.</p>

            . I married the female prisoner's father, and live at No.30, London-street, Tottenham-court-road; she brought me some prints about the 15th of September: I did not count how many - there might be a dozen and a half or two dozen; she said she brought them for Tommy, a little boy, I have to nurse - I put them into a press, and kept them till the Thursday or Friday, and being very much distressed for money to buy food, I went to the corner of Howland-street, and saw Mr. Simpson - I asked if he would have the goodness to buy these prints; he said they were of little or no value to him, and he did not care about purchasing them; I begged of him to purchase them, and said I wanted 6d., or at least a few pence - he gave me 6d.; I think these are the prints - they were this kind; I begged him to give me two back, which he did, and they were taken out of my press by the officer; there was a gentleman in Mr. Simpson's parlour at the time - he did ask how I came by them; I said my husband's daughter had given them to me, and I supposed her mistress or master had given them to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe she gave them to you for the child? A. Yes, but I had not given them to the child; Mr. Simpson did appear to be engaged, and refused to take them at all, but by my begging him he took them, and gave me two back; I believe there was only one person in his shop - he just pulled them asunder, and looked at them; he seemed anxious to go into the back shop.</p>

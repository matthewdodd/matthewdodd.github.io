               <p>Q. Did you lose a great coat at any time. - A. Yes, on the 18th of December, between twelve and two o'clock; it was taken out of the kitchen; I was up at work; I heard Mr. Andrews coming in, I heard some woman speak to him in the entry, enquiring after the name of 
               <persName id="t18080113-64-person687">
                  Elizabeth

            ; I came down stairs, hearing Mr. Andrews voice; I saw the prisoner coming down stairs just by the entry; I saw a bundle under her cloak, I went into the kitchen to see whether my coat and waistcoat was hanging there; she seeing me, dropped on her knees, she said, she knowing me a poor hard working man, she could not find it in her heart to rob me. I examined the bundle, it contained my coat and waistcoat.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I knowing Mr. Johnson, by working for Mr. Remington of Milk-street, and knowing that he kept looms for workmen, I went to ask for a loom; while I was there a gentleman came in the entry. I asked if a person of the name of Smith was there; he said are you going to take this coat and waistcoat, they were on the bannisters; I said, do you suppose I would take it away knowing of you.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

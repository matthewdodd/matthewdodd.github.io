                  </hi>. I am a plumber in the Commercial-road, Bermondsey—the prisoner occupied two rooms in my house in July and August last, at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—on 18th July, he owed me two weeks' rent, and that evening he paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to my wife in my presence for two weeks' rent—I saw him give it to her—she placed it in a drawer; there was no other money there at that time—about 12 or 15 minutes afterwards she went to the drawer, took a piece out and gave it to me—I went to a shop and offered it in payment for some ham, and it was returned to me as a bad one; it was never out of my sight at the shop—after that I came back to my house and looked at the other five pieces and they were all bad—I took them all next morning to the Southwark Police-court and gave them to the police constable—the prisoner continued to lodge in our house after that—I did not say anything to him about the two weeks' rent—on 9th August, my wife gave me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I did not see who gave her the money—I looked at them and found that five of them were bad—I gave them to police constable 249 M, the same day—I gave the six pieces on 19th July to Henry Upton—the prisoner was taken into custody on 9th August; he was not taken at my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Orrell—the prisoner was a lodger at my house; we did not live in the house ourselves—on 18th July, he came and paid me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for two weeks' rent—I put the money in a drawer, there was no other money there—about 15 minutes afterwards I went to the drawer and took out one of the pieces and gave it to my husband—on 9th August the prisoner paid me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I gave them to my husband—I believe the prisoner is a brace maker.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you look at the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I take a great deal of silver in my time—I detected the shilling—I did not say anything to him—I do not keep money in that drawer; I have never kept it there before—I had no pocket on then—I had just changed my dress, so I put the money in the drawer—once or twice the prisoner made some trifling complaints about the paper, and I told him if it did not suit him he could leave, that was all—it was about 8 o'clock in the evening when he paid me on the second occasion; he staid in his own house after he paid me the money—I went to the station-house and a policeman came.</p>

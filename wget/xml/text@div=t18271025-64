George and Byers came to me afterwards, and told me they wished to have a trial; I borrowed a cart of my neighbour, harnessed the horse to it, and we went as far as Mary-le-bone, riding him about; they seemed to approve of it; they then said they wanted to call at a public-house in Southampton-buildings, Holborn; I think this was the Saturday before the 15th of September; I went to the public-house with them, with the horse and cart (I had not then seen Child); they seemed to be satisfied with the horse, and called for something to drink; Byers said "You had better take home the cart, and bring me a saddle and bridle, to lend me till Monday; I will ride the horse home, and send the saddle and bridle home on Monday;" I went and left the cart with the man I borrowed it of, and returned with the horse; my little boy rode the horse, and Harrington came with me, and brought the horse back to the public-house, with the bridle and saddle; when I got there, I met George at the door; he said he was poorly, and could not stop there any longer, for there was a smoke there; Byers and Child came out, and all three went down with George to a house in Chancery-lane; my little boy rode the horse there, and went with us; I thought they were then going to pay me - they asked if I had the balance of a bill, note, or cheque, or something; they produced a paper to me - I can neither read nor write - I thought it was a cheque - they were to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250035"></xptr>give 25l. for the horse; Byers was the purchaser; they gave me the paper, and said it was as good as gold, and would be payable on Monday; they knew I could neither read nor write, for I told them so; I relied entirely upon what they said about the paper; both George and Byers said it was as good as gold; Child was close to them, and must have heard that; upon their representation I gave them four sovereigns in exchange; they gave me 1s. 6d. and the piece of paper - they said it was to be paid in Euston-square, by a man named Palmer; Harrington was close by, and said he would not sell the horse for that paper, for it was of no value; I said, "Here, take it, and show it to somebody, and see if it is right;" he took it to the bar, but the publican was not there; he left the room, and brought it back to me, saying,"I am not satisfied with that paper - I am certain it is not right; I would not take such a thing for my horse:" I then turned round to show it to a gentleman in the parlour, and while I was so doing the prisoners all slipped out, one after the other; and, when I went out, my boy was off the horse, and the horse gone: I went to the door as soon as the gentleman had read the note and returned it to me; I went, in consequence of what he said, to tell them I would not take the paper - they were all three gone - I could see neither of them; I gave the paper that night to the officer of the night; I did not go to Euston-square; I have not received the money for the paper - the horse was found in Fleet-market, about two o'clock the next day; at the door of a public-house; I laid hold of it - it was put into the Green-yard, and I have got it back; Palmer came to Guildhall when the prisoners were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was this your horse? A. Yes; my master is dead; Harrington and I found the horse next day in the open street, harnessed to a chaise; I do not remember Byers telling me at what number in Euston-square Palmer lived; they called for gin and water, rum and water, and ale: I was not sober, but sober enough to know what passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell a man named Stone that you sold the horse? A. I might; I do not recollect that I did - I will not swear that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see George that very night? A. Yes; he was taken that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. About what time did they go away with the horse? A. About seven o'clock, as near as I can say; I saw George in less than ten minutes, for Harrington kept his eye on him.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who was the buyer of the horse? A. Byers; George was with him, and said to him "I will take the horse, if you don't like him in a little time, by your taking a little less;" I did not see them go away with the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember riding over a man in St. Giles', when you were showing the horse? A. Not that I know of; the cart came against him; I did not stop to see if I had hurt him, for they kept calling out, "Keep on, keep on;" there was no cry raised after me - my horse was kept in Harrington's stable.</p>
               <p>Q. What house in Chancery-lane did this happen at? A. The Hole-in-the-Wall public-house, kept by Randull; no objection was made to Harrington's showing the note to the publican; I did not know George before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you given the change before you showed the note to any body? A. Yes; I threw the change down; I did not know whether I was going to have a cheque or not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BYERS. Q. Was not the bill read over to you before you handed over the sovereigns? A. No; I thought it was a cheque; he might tell me to bring the difference of the paper, when I went home with the cart; I do not recollect his telling me to bring a friend with me - I do not think he did, but cannot say whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not Byers charged before Sir Peter Laurie with having forged the bill? A. The man it was payable on happened to be there; Harrington said it was not a good bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the man acknowledge the name was put on it by his authority? A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BYERS. Q. What did you fetch Harrington for? A. To see me paid for the horse, as I was a little in liquor; if I had known it was a bill, I would have had nothing to do with it; I have seen cheques, but I cannot read, and do not understand them.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did you make to me when I asked you to let your son go home with me, and bring the bridle and saddle back that evening? A. I told you to send it home, and it would do as well.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he propose for your son to go home with him, to fetch back the saddle and bridle? A. I will not say that he did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BYERS. Q. Was not that three quarters of an hour after you had taken the bill and given me the difference? A. You did not let me show the bill to any body before you were off - George wrote a receipt for the money.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is this your receipt? A. It may be the same; I put my mark to a paper which George wrote, and which they called a receipt. (reads)</p>
               <p>Received of Mr. Byers, Twenty-five Pounds, for a horse, delivered on the 13th of September, 1827.</p>
               <p>£28 0 0. P. DESMOND, his X mark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner CHILD. Q. When the bill was given to you, did I represent myself as Palmer's clerk? A. I do not recollect that you did; you said you had come to pay Byers a bill for some eggs for a gentleman, that is all I heard you say: I gave the bill to a gentleman to read after they went out - I forget whether I heard it read before they went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Byers tell you he was disappointed in getting the bill cashed, but there was the bill if you would take it? A. I did not hear that - I did not know but that I was going to get sovereigns when I took the cart home: the bill had not been shown me then.</p>

            . I live in Cockpit-yard, and am a labourer; at the time in question I was a costermonger - I have known Desmond about twelve months; I went with him and his little boy with the horse to the public-house in Southampton-buildings; George came to the door, and said he could not stand the smoke - the other two came out afterwards; we all went to the Hole-in-the-Wall, public-house, in Chancery-lane, with the boy and horse - we went into the parlour; I left the boy at the door, telling him not to part with the horse till I came to him - I told him his father was tipsy; the three prisoners, I, and Desmond were all together in the parlour - several other gentlemen were there; they called for some gin and water, rum<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250036"></xptr>and water, and ale - I considered Desmond at that time to be drunk; Byers and George both wanted me to drink, but I would have nothing but one glass of ale - I was perfectly sober; I told Desmond several times, in the prisoners' hearing, that he was drunk, and told Desmond he was an old fool for taking such a thing after they wrote it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they write? A. I am no scholar - I saw them write more than one paper; Desmond put his mark to a paper which George wrote, and I called him an old fool: Byers took a paper out of his pocket, and told him that was a bill for 28l. 18s. 6d., payable on the Monday following, and that it was as good as gold; Desmond put four sovereigns on the table - Byers took them, and gave him 1s. 6d. back; I heard him read the bill to us, but I told him I did not understand bills or cheques; it was after Desmond gave the money and took the paper that I called him an old fool; he then gave me the bill, and asked me to show it to some gentlemen, to see if it was right - I went to the bar - the landlord was not there; and as I returned from the bar, I met Byers and George rushing out of the parlour - I said nothing to them; Child and Desmond were sitting down at the table; I gave Desmond the bill, and told him to show it to some gentlemen: I then followed them out, and George had some gin in a half-pint glass - he wanted me to drink; he stood by the side of the horse, and the little boy was on it; Byers pulled the boy off the horse, and got on himself; he did not do it with violence, he took him off quietly; Desmond and Child were then in the parlour, not within sight of the horse; I told Byers the man was not satisfied with the bill, and I should like him to wait till he came out - George was by at the time, wanting me to drink gin; George told him the gin was not paid for - Byers pulled a red pocket-book out of his pocket, and gave him, saying that would settle for all, and galloped away on the horse: I then told George to go in and see if Desmond was satisfied, but he said he had nothing at all to do with it - Child came out, and walked away in another direction towards, Holborn; I laid hold of George, and kept him till I came up to a watchman - I said he had the pocket-book belonging to the man who ran away with the horse, and if he did not settle for the horse, I would deliver him to the watchman - I did so; he said he did not know any thing about Byers, or the bargain - he did not know any of the agreements, or at all about it; this was on Saturday night, after dusk: the next day, at half-past two o'clock, I saw the horse harnessed to a chaise, at a ginshop door in Fleet-market; I gave it to a constable to take to the Green-yard; a groom, who was in the chaise, was brought before Sir Peter Laurie, and discharged - I have not seen him since: on Monday, Byers and Child came to Guildhall - Byers threatened that he would lock me up, for taking the horse on Sunday; I did not go to Euston-square about the bill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Nobody presented the bill that you know of? A. No; Byers and Child came voluntarily to Guildhall - Desmond told me they had been trying the horse; he was told the bill was for 28l. 18s. 6d., and gave the change in my presence - Byers did not object to my showing the bill to the landlord, but as soon as I went to show it, he ran out and took the horse away.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you and George sitting together in the public-house? A. I was there listening; I did not know but hey were going to pay for the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any force used to compel him to take the bill? A. Not in my presence; it is a very large room - there were eight or nine persons in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BYERS. Q. Did not you hold the horse while I mounted it? A. Yes; and I told you to wait till he came out, but you wished me good night; I heard you say, "Will you lend me the saddle and bridle till Monday?" Desmond said, "Yes, and the boy shall go with you if you like;" this was in the public-house, after he had paid the sovereigns; Desmond was in the public-house when he got on the horse - I bade him stop, and he gave George his pocket-book, and said, "That will settle for all."</p>
               <p>JOHN DESMOND. I am twelve years old. I rode my father's horse to Southampton-buildings, with the saddle and bridle; I afterwards went to another public-house in Chancery-lane; the prisoners walked with my father there- I recollect George and Byers; Harrington was with us; I staid outside on the horse for about half an hour, walking it up and down; a man came out with a white apron on - I believe it was Byers; I saw George with him: Byers pulled me off the horse, and jumped on himself. I said,"Sir, you must not have the horse till my father comes;""Oh, my boy," said he, "your father is paid, and it is all right:" he galloped away with the horse - I saw no more of him; George walked away down a street - Harrington followed and caught hold of him; I am sure I told him he must not have the horse till my father came out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Harrington present all the time after Byers came out? A. He was just coming out when he did; when my father came home with the cart I did not see him take any money out with him; George did not go away with the horse; he walked quickly away - Harrington kept his eye on him, and overtook him easily; he went very quick when he got into the other street. I heard nobody ask for the money for the liquor.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. - George was brought to the watch-house; I found three pocket-books on him - one was a red one; Harrington said Byers had given him that; there were several bills in George's own pocket-books, and some duplicates in the red pocket-book, which were returned to Byers; I did not go to Crescent-street myself. Byers and Child came voluntarily to Guildhall on Monday, the 17th, and were detained.</p>

            . I keep the Golden Horse public-house, Theohald's-road. On Monday, the 10th of September, Byers and a man named Geary called at my house, and had a pint of beer at the bar - Desmond came on his cob; Byers said he wanted a horse, and thought that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250037"></xptr>would suit him very well - that he had got a broken kneed horse, and if they could swap he would do it. On Thursday, the 13th, George and a young man came, and said they understood I knew where they could see the horse; I took them to Desmond - his stable is near my house: this was about five o'clock in the afternoon, and in about half an hour Byers came and said they were two friends of his, whom he had sent to see the horse; he then went down to Desmond - he returned to my house with Desmond, and stopped there drinking till about eleven o'clock at night; they were both in liquor when they went away on the Friday evening. George and Desmond came again and were there above three hours. Byers said if Desmond would let him have the horse for two or three days, to try, he would leave the value in any body's hands - Desmond objected; he said he might have a trial, but he would be with him. I went with Desmond on the Sunday, and found the horse at Mr. Lay's wine-vaults, at the corner of Fleet-lane; the groom was taken before the Magistrate, and discharged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BYERS. Q. Did Lay tell you I had lent him the horse? A. He did.</p>

            . I returned the pocket-book to the prisoner, by the Alderman's order; Palmer was examined, and was arrested at Guildhall - he is in Whitecross-street prison now.</p>
               <p>PATRICK DESMOND re-examined. Q. Did you see Byers go out of the room after you sent Harrington to inquire about the bill? A. Yes - I did not expect he was going to take the horse; I did not mean him to have it till I was satisfied about the paper - he did not say he was going to take it, nor did I think he was going to take it, till I had received an answer to my inquiries. I had met him twice about the horse besides on this Saturday. I saw Palmer at Guildhall - he was not arrested at my suit.</p>

            . I was on duty at this Court - Sir Peter Laurie sent me to make inquiries in Crescent-street - I did not have the bill, I had a direction on a piece of paper: I went to a house close by Euston-square - I am not certain of the street or number - the person was not at home: I left word for him to come to Guildhall - I understand he did come.</p>

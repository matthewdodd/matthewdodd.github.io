                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and reside at Hillingdon, The prisoner was in my service. On Thursday, 12th Oct., I sent him to London with a load of hay, for sale—his instructions were to make the most he could of it—when he came home I asked him how much he had made of it and he said 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had no hay in the cart when he came back.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long has the prisoner been in your employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About five months; I have heard that he was in Mr. Clark's employ before—he went with my horse and cart to London, and did anything on the farm with the horse and cart—I have other persons in my employ—I have no person whose special duty it was to sell on my account—it was not the duty of any one to go out and collect the money due to me, unless specially directed—the prisoner had frequently sold for me before to various persons—I dare say he had received as much money as this, or more, on various occasions—when he sold hay on former occasion! I expected the money when he came home—he might have accounted to me for the money he received at the next convenient opportunity if I were in town—it has not happened that he has not accounted for several days—it may have been the next morning—he paid me this money when he came home on the Thursday—he said he made 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the hay, and he paid me that 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was taken into custody on the Saturday—when I sent the prisoner with the hay I told him if he could not get more than 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, to take it, but not to take less—I did not say I should be satisfied if he brought me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not speak to him at all about the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was not spoken to at all till he was before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cow keeper, and live in Ranelagh-street, Pimlico. I purchased a load of hay of the prisoner last Thursday week—I paid him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I saw the name of Roadknight on the cart—I wrote a letter to Mr. Roadknight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you had hay on former occasions of Mr. Roadknight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had one load on the Thursday before, for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I paid the prisoner that money—I told him I should want another load shortly—I complained that the hay was rather dark, and he said he would bring me a better load—I did not tell him I would not mind giving him something for himself—on the former occasion I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as I always did—I did not on this occasion promise him anything, nor did I give him anything, only the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

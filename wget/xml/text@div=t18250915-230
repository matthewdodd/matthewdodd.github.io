On the 1st of August the house adjoining ours was on fire - we came out, and no one was left there to my knowledge. My father was not at home - I went there next morning about eleven o'clock, and found a pair of shoes missing, which were there the day before, and several other things, which I cannot recollect. I had left the door open the night before.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 1st of August there was a fire next door to this house - the door of their house was left open, and a gentleman wished me and my brother officer to go in and turn the people out; we went in, and met the prisoner coming down stairs, with a bundle, containing many things, which he put into the parlour. I then searched him, and found these shoes in his hat - he was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left my employ about half an hour before the fire happened; I was in Baker's-row, having a pint of beer, when I heard the cry of fire; a man of the name of Edwards called me to assist in getting the things from the top of the house - I brought these things down, but they were not in a bundle; they were loose in my arms - the officer asked me if I had any thing else - I said, Yes, I had some old shoes; I took off my hat, and gave them to him. I have lived in that neighbourhood a year and a half.</p>

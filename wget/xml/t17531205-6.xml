                  Nicholas 
                  Potts

             that was in the House and the Prisoner; the Deceased came in and called for a Halfpennyworth of Gin. He said to Potts, Why do you keep such Company as this? The Prisoner's Wife said she was as good as he, or any there; he damned her for a Bitch. Then the Prisoner and the Deceased laid hold of each other, I can't tell which struck first; they had two Falls, and the third the Deceased's Head fell against the Fender. Then he was taken up and carried to the Hospital, where he lived three Weeks and two Days after this. I saw him about four or five Days after this happened, and asked him how he did: He said he thank'd God he was a great deal better than he had been, and that (only for his Head) he should be well in a Week or ten Days. Have you, said I, any Animosity against the Man that hurt you? No, said he, I have not, I'll assure you; had I not been in Liquor I should not have meddled with any Body whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in Liquor?</p>
               <p>Kernan. Yes, he was, and the Prisoner very much. They have known each other some Time. The Deceased said he freely forgave every one.</p>

            . I was drinking along with the Prisoner at the Time the Prisoner and Potts had some Words; the Prisoner's Wife got up and took her Husband's Part, and the Deceased coming in he took Potts's Part, and called the Woman Bitch. Then the Prisoner got up, and laying hold of the Deceased said, what Business have you to call my Wife Bitch? Then they fell to it. They had three Falls, the last of which the Prisoner's Head came against the Fender. As to Blows, I don't know which struck first; the last Fall they fell both together.</p>

            . I am a surgeon at St. George's hospital; I remember the deceased's being brought in; he had a wound about an inch and a half long on the left side his head, probably it was done by his falling on the sender.</p>

On Saturday the 21st of February, I missed three birds and the cages out of my tap room; these are the three cages and the three birds, (witness producing them). I know they are my cages and my birds, one is a goldfinch, a linnet, and a chaffinch; I missed them on or about ten or eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss them all at one time. - A. I did not; I missed the goldfinch first, about twelve I missed my linnet, and then looked round and missed my chaffinch. From information I received, I went in pursuit of them, I met the prisoner in Finsbury square, he had two handkerchiefs tied up with the cages, and the birds in them; I got the handkerchiefs off, and I saw they were my three birds and my three cages, each bird was in its own cage; I am sure they are my birds and my cages.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the cages. - A. Three shillings.</p>

            . - Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes. On a Saturday, I cannot recollect the day of the month, the prisoner called upon me with a chaffinch and a linnet in cages, they were tied up in a handkerchief, he told me he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080008"></xptr> given fifteen shillings for them; he told me that he had got a very good goldfinch, he would fetch it for me to look at, and he had given a guinea for that; he went and fetched it, and asked me what I thought they were worth; I told him I could not tell him. He left the birds in my room about ten minutes, and then he came and took them away; I had a suspicion that the chaffice belonged to Mr. Hagger, I went to him, and asked him if he had sold it, he told me no; I told him I had that bird and a linnet, and a goldfinch brought to my house by the prisoner; we pursued the prisoner, and overtook him in Finsbury square with three birds, and three cages that I had seen before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

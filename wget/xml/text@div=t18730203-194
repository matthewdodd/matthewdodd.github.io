Burnet"—I was not quite satisfied with it, and wrote to the Rev. Mr. Ormiston, enclosing not that acknowledgment, but one signed "Jas.

Sir, In answer to yours of Saturday, I beg to inform you that the cheque you forwarded in aid of the Mission in Spain was quite correct. Yours, J. Ormiston."—I afterwards compared the signature "Rd. Burnet, "to the first acknowledgment, with the "Rd. Burnet" on the back of the cheque when I got it back from my banker's, but only from my recollect-tion, as the acknowdgment had then been sent back—I immediately com-municated with Mr. Ormiston at his private address, and gave him certain information.</p>

J. Ormiston, Secretary to the Spanish Evangelical Mission"—on the 24th I went again to the office; I found no such letter there—in consequence of that, I went to the Islington Branch of the London and County Bank, taking with me Detective Boyell—I made a communication to the bank authorities there—later in the day Boyell brought the prisoner Mills to my house with this cheque—these four letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi> 1, 2, 3, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 4) were afterwards shown me by the detectives—this one was found open; it has the post-mark of Charing Cross—another has the post-mark of Preston, December 24, and London, December 25; that had not been opened—the third was not open, but I believed it had been opened and closed again; that bore the Peter-borough post-mark; the other one bears the post-mark of Chipping Sodbury—I believe that had also been opened and closed again—I cannot say from memory whether any of them contained money—they were all opened at Bow Street in the presence of the inspectors very carefully with a pen-knife, without disturbing the flap of the envelope—2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in stamps was in the Preston letter—these two letters numbered 5 and 6 were also shown to me; one had been decidedly opened in my opinion, and the other had been torn sufficient to allow of an inspection of the contents.</p>

Daniel Wilson, vicar of Islington, another—they may come there occasionally—the object is to disseminate Evan-gelical principles in Spain—we issue circulars and appeals, and receive funds—Spain is the scene of operations—6, Duke Street is our address for the society—the letter-box to the outer door has no lock to it, nor has ours—I was never there before 10 o'clock in the morning—I remained sometimes two or throe hours—on 23rd December I arrived there about 12 o'clock, Mr. Thorpe was not there then—by pre-arrangement I have on many occasions found the post-letters on the table in my room when Mr. Thorpe has been there—he never opens the letter—there are several other offices in the house—I presume the housekeeper would take the letters from the street door letter-box, and deliver them at the different offices.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. Mr. Ormiston did not arrive at Duke Street till nearly 12 o'clock on the 27th—I remained there all that time, and Hinds also; he never left his chair—I left my chair repeatedly to search for things, but never left the house—I was examined at the Police Court—Mr. Vaughan put questions to me—I can't say whether I mentioned about the letter being damp until Mr. Vaughan questioned me—I should say I must have done so—I believe what I said to Louisa was, "You are, I believe, the niece of the housekeeper?" and she replied, "No; I am the grand-daughter"—I feel positive she said "grand-daughter"—before the magistrate I said "Are you the daughter," and she said "No; I am the niece"—I am under the impression now that she said "grand-daughter "I know she said she was some relation—it is a thing I should not bother much about in a heavy case like this—it must be a mistake—I have made mistakes before to-day in names and dates—I have been suspended by the Commissioners, about two months ago, in reference to illegally going into a house after stolen property—Sir Thomas Henry marked the sheet for invest<lb></lb>tigation, and I was suspended for fourteen days—T have been in the habit of working with Hinds nearly five years, and have given evidence in most of the cases where he has given evidence—he has been with me in lots of cases, and so have other officers; one is dead and another has resigned—Hinds was also suspended in the same case—the sheet was marked by Sir Thomas Henry, and the prisoner discharged—it was a woman—that is the only time when any stipendiary magistrate has expressed his dissatisfaction with my evidence—I swear that—when I first saw Louisa Martindale I said I had come to make inquiries about some missing letters; she said she did not know anything at all about it—I won't swear she did not say, "I don't know what you mean"—I can't say that I said "Never mind what I mean"—I did not hear her say, "Thinly letters that are here are on the window ledge"—I will not swear she did not—I did not push her away as she went towards the window ledge and take the letters myself from the window ledge—I swear that—she said she had been in the habit of taking the letters from the box and taking them up stairs to distribute—she said a good deal about that—both of them were talking for about two hours about these letters—she did not say the letters had come open by my handling them so roughly—I don't know whether Hinds saw the damp letter—she said she had never heard of any letters being miscarried—neither Mr. Condy nor Mr. Antonio are here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My suspension arose in this way; I followed a quantity of stolen goods into the house of a notorious man, who had been tried here on two occasions for receiving stolen property, and aoquitted; the woman kicked up a row, and struck Hinds, and bit him through the thumb, and assaulted me and others, and she was taken into custody for the assault; the Commissioner said we ought to have summoned her, and not charged her before the Magistrate; and that was the reason Hinds got censured—I was absent when he took the woman into custody—she was a notorious character, and when, before Sir Thomas Henry, she tried to swear my life away, he did not believe her, because he ordered an investigation.</p>

               <p>was going on between Boyell and Louisa, I heard Susan call out "Who's there?" from a bedroom opposite where we were—Louis asaid "Two police officers"—I then went across the passage towards the door—Susan said "You can't come in here"—I told her I was a married man, she need not be ashamed of me—she tried to push the door in my face, I shoved it open and entered the room—before that she said something about letters; I don't exactly remember what, and she said "There are two here"—when I got into the room she handed me these two letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from a little dress ng-table under the window; one is addressed to Mr. Burnet, the other to Mr. Ormiston—from 20th November to 27th December I had that house under observation—I have seen Mills go there, I should think on quite ten or twelve occasions, between 8 and 10 o'clook in the morning; more fre<lb></lb>quently about 9 o'clock—sometimes he has stayed ten minutes, and some<lb></lb>times it has reached quite half-an-hour—I saw him go there on the morning of the 24th about 20 minutes to 9 o'clock—on the occasions when I have seen him go there I have seen him with the two women; I have seen him at the door talking to them, and part with them in a very friendly way—I have seen him go out with Louisa, and I think I have seen him about three times with Susan—the bedroom appeared to be used by both the females.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">SLEIGH</hi>. I first assisted Boyell in this case on 20th November—we were not always in company; we were on several occasions—I know Mills's wife now—I have not seen him go there with her, or with any person—I generally watched from a few minutes before 8 o'clock in the morning till 9.30 or sometimes 10 o'clock, and occasionally of an evening after dark—my orders were to be there every day; I did not carry out those orders because I had other cases on hand that called me away—I have not seen Mills go there with his wife of an evening and stay for half or three<lb></lb>quarters of an hour—I think I saw the old lady (Susan) come to the door with the niece about three times, without any bonnet or shawl—they would have some conversation and part in a friendly manner—I don't suppose there was anything to excite the suspicion of a passer-by—I never saw the old lady come out but once—I have seen Louisa come out with Mills and walk into Buckingham Street, and then she returned.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BESLEY</hi>. We were there about three hours on the 27th—I think it was about 11 o'clock when Mr. Ormiston came—they were then given into custody—Boyell asked Louisa something respecting the letters that he took from her hand, and she said they were hers, her private property—she may have said she did not know what he meant about missing letters—he might have said "Never mind what I mean"—she said the only letters there were on the window-sill—I don't remember her saying that some had come on Christmas Day and some on Boxing Night, and that it was her duty to deliver them to the persons in the house; I won't swear she did not say so, but I don't think she did—Susan said that the two letters she had on the table had come that morning—the blue one was torn in the back as it is now—she did not hand it to me through the door, but when I had got into the room—she did not say "It must have been torn in your taking it"—I called her attention then to its being torn, and she said it must have been torn by a little nephew who had taken it out of the letter-box—he was not there—I never saw Mills go into the next house—he generally came from the direction of Charing Cross railway station—I have seen Louisa leave the house two or three times of a morning, as if going on an errand, and I have seen the</p>

I live at 27, Red Lion Square, and am a professional expert in handwriting—I have been engaged for many years in the com<lb></lb>parison of handwriting—I have had various papers and cheques shown to me in this case—as regards the post-office order signed "Burnet," looking at the cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., admitted to be in the handwriting of Mills, I believe they are the same handwriting—I don't form that opinion from those documents alone, and if I was only shown those I might be in doubt—upon examining all the documents I say that the post-office order signed "Burnet" is in the handwriting of Mills—here is a cheque for 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. signed L.

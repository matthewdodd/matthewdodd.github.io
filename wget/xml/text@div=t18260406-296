            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoners at the end of Sweeting's-alley - I followed them to Queen's-street, and saw them follow MR. Cleobury; about half-way down the street key picked his pocket of a handkerchief - the other was close to him, and Jones was behind, but close together - I followed them till they crossed the street - I went to Mr. Cleobury and told him - I then followed the prisoners and took them - the third one did not stay with them a minute after it was done -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060112"></xptr>the prisoners had three handkerchiefs; but not Mr. Cleobury's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw the man pick the pocket and did not touch him? - A. No; he did not go quite one hundred yards.</p>
               <p>JONES's Defence. There was a man playing music - I went down the street to hear it, and met Key there - Mr. Cleobury came with the officer, and they took us.</p>

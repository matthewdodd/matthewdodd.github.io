On Sunday se'enight, about two o'clock in the night, I heard somebody go by my door along the entry to the street door: I lie in the back parlour; he then rattled off a large chain that hung a-cross upon a worm, and threw it on the ground with great violence, lifted up the latch of the door, went out, and pulled the door hard after him; I got up directly, and as soon as I opened my door, I saw the entry door open; I went further and found the kitchen door open, and the poker bent almost double; I went further and the window of the kitchen that goes into the church yard was open, and propped up with a piece of stick; it was a sash window. I then saw the desk was broke open, and a bag was taken out of it containing 100 guineas; the desk was in the kitchen. I suppose he had concealed himself in the church yard, and so broke in out of the church yard. I suspected the prisoner; I went and informed the watchman of it; an alarm was given at the watch-house, and the prisoner was taken, and brought to me about seven o'clock that morning; they found the bag upon him with 99 guineas in it; one he said he had taken out, which was found in his breeches pocket.</p>

            . I am next door neighbour to the prosecutor: between seven and eight o'clock on Monday morning I saw the prisoner brought by two men to Mr. Beaumont's house; I went in to know what was the matter; Mr. Beaumont seemed very much oppressed with trouble, and told me the cause as he has described it here; he had the money in his hand; there was nobody present then but the two watchmen, his housekeeper, himself, and me; he desired me to keep the money; he tied it up and sealed it, and I have kept it ever since; there were 100 guineas in it when it was delivered to me; this is the bag (producing it).</p>

               <p>I know nothing of the fact. My landlady gave me warning to remove my lodgings; I was up betimes moving my things, and the two men came into my room, and said I was their prisoner. The money was my own that I had saved up and received from my friends; the bag was once my master's, but was not then. I served him eight years duly and truly, and never lay out of his house, and never disobeyed his commands we had a dispute after I was out of my time, which gave rise to this prosecution.</p>

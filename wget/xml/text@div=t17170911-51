                   of 18 l.5 s.
            </rs> The Prosecutor deposed, That the Prisoner pretended to him he was Lieutenant Governors of the Tower and Warden of the Mint; he using to frequent the House of a Woman that was his Neighbour, took Acquaintance with him, asking him how Trade went, and what be made by his Business, telling, him be appearing to be an honest industrious Man be had a mind to be kind to him, and would help him to a Store-keeper's Place in the Tower, which would be 60 l. a Year for Life, but that he must furnish him with Money for taking out a Deputation and such incident Charges; that he thereupon, being elevated at the hopes of his Preferment let him have Money in order thereunto; that the Prisoner often came and sent to him for more Money, pretending that he met sometimes with one Obstacle and sometimes another, but a little more Money would remove all, and he would he put into the Possession of his Office; but at last perceived he had been trick'd out of his Money. The Prisoner denied the Fact, saying he never made any such Pretences; that the Prosecutor had lent him the Money, and that he never had any Mony of him but what he took Notes of his Hand for the Payment of. The Prosecutor reply'd to this, that he never took any one Note of him for his Money, but only that the Prisoner had put a Note into his Hand to go and receive 5 l. for him of a Hoy-Man, but would never let him go to receive the Money upon the Note. And that he had also given him a Note to go to his Sister's Steward and receive of him 151 l. but could never hear of any such Person. It appeared that the Fact was committed before the Act of Grace and so the Prisoner was entitled to a Pardon; but upon this Condition, that the Prosecution being begun before the Act commenced, he was obliged to pay the Prosecutor his Charges, which was about 50 s. and accordingly he was informed by the Court that if he did so he might lay claim to the benefit of it; but he pleaded he was so poor he had not 50 Farthings: Upon which the Court asked the Prosecutor if he would take his Word for the 50 s. to which he replied, no, not for a crocked Pin. The Court ask'd him how he could suffer himself to be so imposed upon from time to time by him, he reply'd, because he thought he was bewitch'd. The Fact being plain the Jury found him <rs id="t17170911-51-verdict261" type="verdictDescription">

                   of 40 l.
            </rs> The Prosecutor deposed, the Prisoner using to come to the Tilt Yard Coffee-house, where he lived, took an Opportunity of telling him that he was a pretty Fellow, and it was pity he should spend his Time in filling out Dishes of Coffee,&amp;c, and that he took such a liking to him that he would prefer him, telling him he had a great Place in the Treasury, and was a Commissioner of the Customs, and would put him into a Land-Waiter's Place, and wheedled him under this Expectation out of Money at various Times to the Sum of 40 l. making the same Excuses as he had done to the other Person for the deferring his being put into Place; one time it could not be till Term, and then he should be sworn in the Treasury, and another time another Hinderance; and that he told him he should go down with him to his Estate in Kent, where he was to receive a 1000 l. And this was within the Limits of the Act of Grace, as well as the other; but he could not comply with the Conditions of the Act, by paying the Prosecutor his Costs, as before, and so the Tryal went on. The Prisoner, as before, denied his Pretences, and said it was Money lent, and what he would pay whenever he should retrieve his Misfortunes. He said likewise it was a Debt, in that he had given him Notes of his Hand for it. The Prosecutor acknowledged he had a Note for 20 l. and that he gave him a Bill to receive 150 l. of his Sister's Steward (in Nubibu) as he had done the other Prosecutor. The Prisoner alledged that he had unkind Usage, in that the Prosecutors had contrived to defer his Tryal to this time, when those Persons who would have spoke in his Favour were out of Town; and being asked who they were, he answer'd, the Lord Townsend, Mr. Walpole, and some other Great Men: The Court told him, that was a very pernicious Contrivance indeed, if it were so; out however since these Great Men did not appear in his behalf, desired him if he had any Persons of less Figure to speak in his Reputation, challenging him to find one in the whole Court (which was then very full) to do it; but none appearing, the Jury found him <rs id="t17170911-51-verdict263" type="verdictDescription">

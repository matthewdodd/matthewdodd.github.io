A man came up with a stone bottle, he asked us if we wanted any gin, I took a glass and gave the prisoner a glass, for which I paid six pence, we took a walk between the booths and by St. Bartholomews hospital, the prisoner and I sat down on a board, I was taken with a little sleep. There came a party and said,</p>
               <p>"halloa, who is here, it is time to go home," I said,</p>
               <p>"by all means it is," one of them said, had I lost any thing, I said I had not, I recollected in a moment, I said I had, my watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q, You were not quite sober. - A. I was not, some man of the party went behind the booth, and said he found the watch.</p>
               <p>- HODSON. I was at the fair, I am an officer, I spoke to Gregory and the prisoner, and desired them to go home, the prisoner said, that is my father, my partner woke Gregory, he told him to mind that he was not robbed, he said he believed not, the prisoner got off the platform, said</p>
               <p>"I'll go to water," he went away; then the prosecutor said he lost his watch, I immediately pursued him, I saw him throw something away from his hand which glistened much, I directly made a spring and took hold of him, I said to my partner,</p>
               <p>"get a candle and look under the show for the watch," he got a candle and the watch was picked up, I took him to the Poultry Compter. This is the watch, Groves found it in the place where I saw him throw it, I searched the prisoner, I found a pocket book with eighteen duplicates, one of which led to a watch claimed by another person.</p>

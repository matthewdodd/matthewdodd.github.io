On Monday the 2d of August, the prisoner came there—he was served with a pint of beer—I did not see him pay for that—he then called for another pint—I served him, and he laid a bad shilling on the counter—my wife said to me, "William, is this a good shilling?"—I looked at it, and found it was bad; I bent it up with my teeth—it had not been out of my sight. I said to the prisoner, "Have you any more of this sort, old fellow?"—he said, "No, I have just taken it at the public house, at the corner of the street"—he said, "I will go and get it changed, I can't afford to lose it." I gave it him, and he went away. There was another person with him, but the prisoner gave me the shilling. It was about 10 o'clock in the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband, Charles Loader, keeps the Red Lion at Old Brentford. On Monday night, 2d August, the prisoner came about 11 o'clock—I served him a pint of beer, and he gave me a shilling—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I did not take much notice of the shilling; I put it in the till—I don't know whether it was bad or not. The prisoner was after<lb></lb>wards served with another pint of beer—he gave me another shilling—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change and put that shilling in the till; I did not notice that. The prisoner afterwards called for another pint of beer, and he gave me another shilling—that roused my suspicion, and I put that shilling into a separate till, and gave him change, and he went away soon after, as it was time to shut up. After he was gone a policeman came in—I then examined the last shilling, and it was bad. I gave it to the policeman. I had changed away all the money that was in the till, so that I don't know whether there was any bad money amongst it or not The policeman brought the prisoner to my house the game night, about half-past 12 o'clock—I recognized him—he had some struggle with the constable.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, T</hi> 220). I was on duty at Brentford on Monday night, 2d August. I received information, and about half-past 12 o'clock I went to a lodging house—I found the prisoner sitting on the step outside with another man—the other man was accusing the prisoner of having enticed him down to Brentford, saying there was plenty of work, and he was passing bad money—I asked where he had passed bad money, and he pointed to the Red Liou, and said, "He has passed three there,"—I said, "Where has he passed any more 9"—he said, "He has passed one in the public house on the other side, the new building;" that is the Feathers kept by Mr. Piper. I asked if he had passed any more—he said, "Yes, at a corner house up the lane," which might have been the Royal Oak. The prisoner said nothing—I took him in custody, and took him to the Red Lion; and the landlady gave me a bad shilling, and gave the prisoner in custody. He struck the other man who had informed against him, and I went to part them and he got my finger in his mouth and bit it—I took him to the station. This is the shilling I got from Mrs. Loader, and this one from Mrs. Piper. I found on him three good sixpences and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. all in copper—I found no bad money on him. The other man told me he kept bad money in the dog-kennel at the lodging house—I went there, and found this bent shilling there; that was at the house where I had found him sitting.</p>

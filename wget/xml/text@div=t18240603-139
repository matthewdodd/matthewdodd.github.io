            . On the 1st of May I lived in Turnagain-lane, Fleet-market - I was going down <placeName id="t18240603-139-crimeloc743">by the side of Fleet-market</placeName>

               <p>Q. What kept you out so late - A. I am generally out at night; I had been walking in the street; I am an <rs id="t18240603-139-viclabel744" type="occupation">unfortunate girl</rs>

               <p>Q. That was not knocking you down - A. No; one pulled me by my cloak, and Stephenson knocked me down with her fist; I only received one blow, and that was on my breast. Stephenson put a handkerchief into my mouth, and Woodfield put her hand to my pocket, and took out my pocket-book, while I was on the ground. Stephenson said to Woodfield -</p>
               <p>"We are all right," and both ran up the street with it. I got up as soon as I could, and went to the bottom of the street and called the watchman; they ran up that street, and came down the same street again, and met me and the watchman; the pocket-book contained 4 s., and thirteen duplicates. When they got me down I asked what they were going to do; they said if I made any resistance they would cut my throat; this passed while they were taking the handkerchief out to put into my mouth.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you not call the watchman when you fell - A. No; I had no power; I was stunned. I laid there for ten minutes before I had power to get up, after they had run away.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you tell which way they went - A. I heard them run, and told the watchman which way they went.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you sober - A. I was perfectly sober. I had gone out about nine o'clock, and only had one glass of liquor. I had not been with any gentleman that night, I never saw the prisoners before, and never spoke to them.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH EVESON. I am a watchman, and was stationed in Skinner-street, close to Turn-again-lane. At three in the morning I saw the prisoners come out of the lane into Skinner-street, running as fast as they could; but not hearing any alarm, I did not take them - if there had been a cry. I am certain I must have heard it. In about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards, I found a red pocket-book against the door at which the prosecutrix says she was knocked down. I did not see her till I got to the watch-house, which was in about twenty-five minutes - she appeared perfectly sober.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About ten minutes past three o'clock in the morning, I was sitting by the Rose Inn, Fleet-market. The prosecutrix passed me, and the prisoners behind her, singing a song. The prosecutrix bid me good night, and in about ten minutes I heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030048"></xptr>a cry of Watch! at the bottom of Castle-street. I ran there, and the prosecutrix said she had been knocked down and robbed. I ran up Castle-street and Turn-again-lane, but could not find them. I was returning to my beat, but a man said two women were coming down the lane - it was the prisoners. I knew them to be the women who had followed prosecutrix - she also said they were the women, and I took them; and as they went along, Stephenson said, three or four times over, that she would have the prosecutrix's *** life; and Woodfield said,</p>
               <p>"If I cannot do it myself, I will get somebody else to do it."</p>
               <p>MATHEW BANKS. I was constable of the night; the prisoners were brought to the watch-house. The prosecutrix said they had knocked her down, and robbed her of a pocket-book and 4 s. 6 d.; they were very ontrageous, and said the would serve her out. I found 1 s. 6 d. on one of them, and a few halfpence on the other. The prosecutrix gave the same account of it them as she has now - she had been drinking, but was not drunk.</p>
               <p>STEPHENSON. Q. Did she not say that she had been drinking with us from a quarter to twelve o'clock - A. She said she had been giving them a glass each, and that she had been with a gentleman, who gave her the money.</p>

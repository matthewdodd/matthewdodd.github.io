                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Clark, who keeps a public-house on Tower-hill—I took the prisoner into my employ, as servant, on 18th April last—she continued in my employ until Sunday, April 22nd—a little after 6 o'clock that evening I gave her leave to go to chapel—she left the house—whilst she was away I discovered a piece of paper on my chest of drawers, outside a workbox, which I knew ought not to be there—I had seen the workbox on the Monday previous, locked—there was then in it 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver and gold—in consequence of finding that paper I examined the box; it was still locked—I missed 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a silver thimble from it—the coins that were in the box were principally new florins—I searched the clothes-closet on the landing at the top of the stairs, and missed 2 chemises, a pair of goloshes, 2 skirts of dresses, 2 petticoats, and a twill silk handker<lb></lb>chief—there were some other things missed belonging to Mrs. Clark, out of her own room—I had seen these things in the closet when she came into my employ—I did not give her leave to take them—she returned about half past 9 o'clock on this Sunday evening—I asked her where she got the neck-tie</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070107"></xptr>
               <p>from that she had had on on the previous evening—she said that it was her own, and that she had another piece like it—I said "Very well, Mary, but that is not all"—I thought that necktie was mine; it was just like mine—I had missed mine, and could not find it anywhere—I said "That is not all; I have missed other things, which I have found in your box"—before she came in, I had gone and searched her box, and found the articles which I have just mentioned—she said, "All the articles that were in my box before I went out, are mine"—I said, "Come and see"—I took her there—I had not put the things in again which I had found; they were on a chair—Mr. Cox, a friend of my husband's, came up then—he said to her, "Will you allow me to search your pocket?" she said, "Yes"—he did so, and found my necktie and Mrs. Clark's gold ring; it had no stone in it—I said, "Mary, have you anything belonging to me?"—she lifted up her dress, and I saw two petticoats—I said, "They are mine"—she said at first that they were hers—she pulled them off—a policeman was then sent for; he came, and some other things were found—the policeman showed me a purse which he found in the prisoner's box—it was mine; there was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it, all silver.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What public-house is this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The Sun, on Tower-hill—it was open on this Sunday evening—the prisoner's room where the box was, was at the top of the house—it is not easily got at from the bar—there are three pairs of stairs—there is nothing to prevent any person getting into the passage from the bar—the prisoner came into my employ from a Mr. Solomon's, where she had been five months—I had a good character with her—she had been in my employ four days when this happened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> All the money that you missed from your box, you say, was 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; so that the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., was not yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We missed a great deal out of our pockets—I last saw the box safe on the Monday—between that time and the prisoner's coming into my service, no person had been acting as qut servant—we have one barman; no other servant.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know your box had not been opened on the Tuesday, and things been abstracted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because there was no one there that would do it—there is a barman in the house—I am not in the bar always—the barman does not go out with beer—I do not think there had been any opportunity for a clever thief to slip up stairs—there is always some one down below, or up stairs—no one could go to our bedroom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When had you been to the cupboard last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the Tuesday evening; I cannot say the time exactly—the prisoner came into my service on Wednesday—I did not look into my cupboard on Wednesday morning—I do not know whether the things that I lost from the cupboard, were taken before she came into my service—the work-box was in my front bedroom—no one sleeps in that room—I sleep in the adjoining room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you last see the two chemises, and other things? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the Tuesday evening—I saw them when I opened the cupboard—they were on the floor—one was dirty; the other was in a box—I lifted the dirty one up and saw what it was—I did not lift up the clean one—I saw the pair of goloshes in the closet—the two shirts were there, and the two petticoats—I had only two petticoats in the closet—I have got some in my drawers—Tuesday is the day that I look out my washing, ready for the Wednesday morning—I did not give these things out on the Wednesday morning—I suppose I did not observe them—I always make a list of articles for the washerwoman; I made a list of the things—I sent the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070108"></xptr>
               <p>things to the laundress on Wednesday morning, the week previous, and she brought them back again on the Saturday night—I did not count them—I saw the prisoner go out on the Sunday night; I did not perceive any bundle under her arm—I think Mrs. Clark took in the things on the Saturday night.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 190). I was sent for to this public-house on Sunday night, about half-past 11; and saw the prisoner in the bar parlour—she was given in my custody—Mr. Clark said in her presence, "This ring and things were found on her person"—Mrs. Clark was present—there were three rings, two gold ear-rings, and a silver thimble—I said, "How did you come by these?" she said, "Sweeping up the bedroom, under the drawers"—I said, "How did you come by the thimble?" she said, "I was going to sew, and I took the loan of the thimble out of my <hi rend="italic">missus's</hi> work-box"—I said, "What about the petticoats?" she said, "They were old things, and I thought I might take them"—I said, "Come along with me and see what is in your box"—I went up and searched the box—there were some things lying on a chair by the side—I found the purse under the bottom of the box, amongst a lot of old rags—it contained 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "What about this purse?" Mrs. Clark said that it was hers, and the money too—I then said, "I must search the bed"—I took the bed<lb></lb>clothes off, and between the bed and mattress I found four new florins, a sixpence, and a threepenny piece; making 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; a silk handkerchief, and a dirty towel—I said, "What about this?" she said, "Oh! it is all my own money."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had Mrs. Clark told you that she had missed some money from her box before you looked under the bed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; Mrs. Clark did not examine her own box while I was there—she said she had missed several amounts of money from her pocket—as soon as I found the money, she said, "That is out of my box"—directly I got there, the prisoner was given in my custody—Mr. Clark came outside the door and called me as I was passing—he said, "I am going to give my servant into custody for robbing me"—I went in, and she was in the bar parlour—Mr. Clark then said, "That is the servant;" and I took her into custody, and asked her about the ear-rings and thimble—I am sure that it is generally part of my instructions, after I take prisoners in custody, to ask them how they became possessed of things—I have been a policeman eleven years—Mr. Clark said he should charge the prisoner.</p>

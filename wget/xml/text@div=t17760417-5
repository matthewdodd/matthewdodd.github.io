               <p>I am servant to the prosecutor: upon the 15th of February the prisoner came to my master's shop in order to see some cornelian stones unset; I shewed him some, he tumbled them over; he asked me the price of them; I being but a young lad could not fix the price; I told him to call again in the afternoon, when my master would be at home: he said it would do no good to call again; he went away without purchasing any thing: about a week or nine days after that my master missed the seals.</p>
               <p>JENKIN JONES. A week or ten days after this fifteenth of February I was putting the things to rights, and missed two seals, one a sardonyx with the figure of a woman upon it, another a white cornelian; I advertized these two rings; hearing the account my lad gave of the prisoner having been there, I described the prisoner; I had no effect from that advertisement: upon the Monday my lad and I set out to search the toyshops about; going through Russell-court I obseryed in the window of Mr. Spicer, who is a seal engraver, the sardonyx and the other; I went in and immediately charged these seals as being my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177604170006"></xptr> property; Mr. Spicer's lad the same day took the prisoner into custody; the other seal the prisoner's father gave me as he was going to justice Welch's; but the father is not here.</p>
               <p>NEHEMIAH SPICER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a seal engraver in Russell-court: upon the fifteenth of February the prisoner came to me and offered two seals to sale, the one a white cornelian and a double seal, the other a sardonyx, and a small little onyx that was unset; I bought only the sardonyx and the onyx of him. (They were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor). He asked me twenty shillings for the sardonyx, four shillings for the onyx; he took half a crown; I don't think that is much under the mark; the sardonyx might be worth forty shillings; the onyx is not worth above two.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I gave two guineas and a half for the sardonyx as set.</p>
               <p>Mr. SPICER. I am positive as to the prisoner; these things lay in my window ten days, when the prosecutor came by and challenged them as his property: my lad as he was going to Bond-street upon some other affair, saw the prisoner that very day, and immediately apprehended him.</p>

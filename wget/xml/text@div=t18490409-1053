                  </hi>. I live in Brett's-buildings, Camberwell-road, and am a cheesemonger. The prisoner was in my employment about two years—I discharged him on 10th March—he was employed to go about and take orders, and receive money for me—he took some goods to Mrs. Dennison's on 17th Feb. to the amount of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and on 21st to the amount of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and some on 9th March—I have a customer named Blaber—there was a dispute about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. alleged to be received from her—he has never paid me these sums—when he returned on 21st I asked him if Mrs. Dennison had paid—he said, "No"—I said that made two bills—on 9th March, when be brought 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I told him there was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before, which was not paid—he went a second time, and I told him to mention the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he returned, and said there was some one in the shop, which was the reason he did not.</p>

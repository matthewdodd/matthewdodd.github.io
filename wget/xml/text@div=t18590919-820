                  </hi>. I am a plumber, in the employ of Mr. Lawrence—I was employed on 3d September in repairing a water-closet at Mr. Schloss's; on removing a portion of the seat I found a piece of leather tied up with some money in it; it lay nearly upright—I examined the contents—there was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—I took it to the warehouseman and spoke to him about it—I kept it by me and returned to the water-closet, and I found a cap with a quantity of money in it—I did not count it—I gave the cap and the leather bag and money to Mr. Hockley—while I was at work, after I had found the first lot, the prisoner came to me—I had then got the top of the</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Joseph Schloss, of 13, St. Thomas the Apostle—the prisoner was in his employ the last year or two—on 3d September I was told something by the last witness, and I received a cap from him which contained money—I gave it to the policeman, after consulting with Mr. Schloss—I had some idea that the cap belonged to the prisoner from his having worn one like it—I sent for the prisoner, and he came up in the counting-house—I asked him if he knew anything at all about the coin or the cap, and told him I believed it was his cap—he said it was not his, and he knew nothing at all about it—after the officer had left the counting-house I told the prisoner if he knew any<lb></lb>thing about it he had better inform me—he said, well, he would tell the truth about it; that in the house in which he was living he had seen a man named Burns, or Burney, place this money in a recess on the first floor, and knowing he had no right to it, he considered that he himself had as much right to it as Burns, and he took it from there—he said, when he first took it he thought it was good, but he afterwards found it was bad—I asked if ho had passed any of it—he said "No."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 63). I went, from informa<lb></lb>tion, to Mr. Schloss's warehouse on 3d September—I received this cap, which contained a quantity of coin—here are 6 half-sovereigns, 7 crowns, 12 half-crowns, and 73 shillings—I went away and went back again, and saw the prisoner—Mr. Hockley said he suspected the prisoner of having concealed the counterfeit coin in the water-closet—I asked the prisoner if that was so—he denied all knowledge of it—I asked him his address—he said, at the White Hart, Baldwin-gardens—I ascertained that he did live there—I asked him who were his associates—he said, persons living in the neighbourhood of his residence—I left him in charge of Mr. Hockley—I came back again, and the prisoner was taken to Bow-lane station—after the charge was taken he made a statement, which I took down in writing—I said anything that he said would be given in evidence—he said, about three months ago he frequently saw a man called <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Burns go to a cupboard on the first-floor at the White Horse, and knowing he had no right there, it induced him one morning, about six weeks ago, to search that cupboard, where he found a cap containing the same counterfeit coin that was found in the cellar of the warehouse: when he brought it to the warehouse he looked at it and found it was counterfeit coin, and he concealed it under the seat of the water-closet.</p>

                  </hi>. These six half-sovereigns are all bad, and from one mould—all this coin is bad—here are 210 pieces altogether—many of these are from the same moulds as those produced on the trial of Jane Hatton.</p>

About the end of November or beginning of December I lost a writing-case and manifold-writer out of my shop; I lost a great many, and cannot state when I had seen them last: I know nothing of the prisoner - I saw these two articles again last Tuesday week at the office; I know them to be my manufacture, and am satisfied they had not been sold.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. You have sold many of the same kind, have not you? A. Yes - I should like to see them; I lost twenty or twenty-four that evening, and have seen about eight - part were fitted up ready for sale, and part were not; I never sold them not fitted up.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Nicholls, a pawnbroker, of No. 43, Gray's Inn-lane. I produce a manifold-writer and writing-case which were pledged on the 11th of January - I did not take it in, but was present, and saw the person who pawned it, and am quite certain the prisoner is the man; he has pawned at our shop for a year and a half at least - I cannot be mistaken in him; he pawned it in the name of Thomas Cooper, Gray's Inn-lane, for 12s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you seen many of these manifold-writers? A. I have not; it appears to be fitted up complete - I did not hear the prisoner give the name; I knew him by the name of Cooper for eighteen months - he always went by that name at our shop; I know his wife, and always took her to be Mrs. Cooper - I do not know her name before marriage.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Griffith, a pawnbroker of Ossulton-street, Somers'-town. I have a writing-case, pawned on the 14th of January, by the prisoner, in the name of John Cooper, No. 10, Drummond-crescent; we had done business with him before; Mr. Wedgwood saw and claimed it at the first examination.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He pawned it in the name of Cooper? A. Yes, we always knew him by that name: he was in Mr. Griffith's employ about three years ago I understand - there was no concealment.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he go by the name of Cooper at Mr. Griffith's? A. To the best of my knowledge.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner in Little Drummond-street; he and his wife both stood a few paces from the door - we went into the house; it appeared a chandler's shop - we inquired if Gast lived there; a person pointed him out walking down the street - we went after him, and asked him to come back with us and go into his room; he went readily with us, and said he knew what we were come about, that he expected us; we asked what? he said respecting the business of his brother Gast, who has been tried - we asked if he had been pawning any thing? he said he had pawned a writing-case at Griffith's (we had been there before and saw one) - he was asked if he had pawned any other; he said No; we searched him, but found no duplicate - he said he had pawned things for Ellis, and always gave him the money and duplicate, but denied pawning any other writing-case - I do not know that a manifold-writer was mentloned, except as a writing-case; I found a ticket of a manifold-writer in a room in Tottenham-court-road, said to belong to Ellis, and went to Nicholls' - it is called a writing-case on the duplicate.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know positively that the room belonged to Ellis? A. No, only it has been sworn so here; it was the attic of Mr. Thompson's house - this conversation was a considerable time after the pawning; he might have forgotten it - he was within five yards of his own door; I did not know him, and do not know that he did me - he did not attempt to escape; his brother and Ellis had been taken up - I found nothing at his lodging.</p>
               <p>MR. WEDGWOOD. This is a patent manifold-writer, and I am certain was never sold - this case is mine; it was the cover of a manifold-writer, not fitted up for sale -I would not have sold it in this state; it originally had printed directions on it on both sides, but they appear to have marble paper pasted over them, to disguise it.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor was cross-examined at very great length as to his means of identifying the property, and finally pointed out several marks in them, and that the case was stamped "Warranted genuine, R. Wedgwood," with a punch, which never went out of his possession.</p>

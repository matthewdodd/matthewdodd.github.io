            . I live in Tibberton-street, Newington-causeway, and deal in fruit. At a quarter to seven o'clock in the morning of the 22nd of June, I saw the prisoner in <placeName id="t18310630-268-crimeloc1397">the Strand</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You thought he had stolen the hat? A. Yes - I was going to endeavour to stop him, but he went off; I was placed there to watch - I was four or five rods from him: I waited to see another person go in, who was walking to and fro - I had not turned my head before he was out of my sight; he had the hats under his arm - I sell fruit in the Boroughmarket; I saw the prisoner for several minutes before he took the hats, and am certain of him.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I took the prisoner in Broad-wall, Surrey - Pattenden had described him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300125"></xptr>me, and pointed him out to me; I searched his lodging, which he directed me to in Broad-wall - I found a hat in a box on the second floor, and part of a lining on the first floor; a young man named Duncan has been convicted of robbing the prosecutor in the other Court to-day.</p>

            . This hat is mine, and has a privatemark on it - so has this lining, which belongs to another hat, both in my own writing; they had not been sold, as I enter every number in the stock-book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you tell, except from your book, that you had not sold it? A. I am sure I had not; my shopmen enter what they sell.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the prisoner ever in your employ? A. He was with me only one day, as errand-boy, four or five months ago - he was engaged for a longer period, but left at night, and did not return; ever since that I have lost hats; Duncan was also a shop-boy of mine for four or five months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The hat does not belong to me, but to my brother, and I understand he bought it of Duncan, as a damaged hat, for 8s. 6d.</p>
               <p>HENRY REEVES. I am the prisoner's brother. I bought this hat of Duncan - there was no lining in the bottom; I got it lined myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where is it damaged? A. He showed me beaver was off at the side - I met him in the street, and bought it; the part of the lining that was in it was a little soiled - there was no mark on it.</p>

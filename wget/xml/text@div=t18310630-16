On the Tuesday morning I was called up to go to Mr. Charrington's - I found him at his house; he had just got into bed - he was bleeding at the head: he told me the spot where the struggle took place - I went there, and picked up the cover of the hone, laying in the path; it was split in two pieces - I observed marks of blood there; I also found in the ditch two hats and this silk handkerchief - the prisoner owned one of the hats - it has got his name in it; I saw him in the cage without a hat - I found a sixpence on him all over blood; I found the writing-desk in the river, about forty yards from the bridge, under a barge, about two hours after - it had floated down the stream; I got the hone from Cragg, Mr. Charrington's servant; I found one boot outside the kitchen door in the garden, the other was inside the door, on the mat; the pannel of the kitchen door was taken out, and fitted the centre-bit which I received from Moyes.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Charrington. On the 16th of May I went round the house, locked the garden-gate, and barred and bolted the kitchen door - the parlour doors were locked, but the keys were in; the front door was made fast. I heard no noise till Mr. Charrington came home - my mistress called me down between two and three o'clock; I found master in his bed-room: mistress thought he was murdered - I went down to the kitchen to get him a glass of water, and found the pannel of the kitchen door out, and the boots out by the kitchen door; I know this hone - I had seen it in the house on the Saturday; the boots hung in the back kitchen when I went to bed - I saw the desk the night before; it was kept in the front parlour - the Prayer-book was by the side of the desk, the coat and silk handkerchief hung in the passage; I know the silk handkerchief - this is it: I found four phosphorus-matches outside the kitchen door, and a phosphorus-box; I found them as soon as I opened the kitchen, on coming down - I know this hone and boots to be my master's.</p>
               <p>MR. CHARRINGTON. This hone is mine - this great coat, boots, and the Prayer-book are mine; the Prayerbook has my name in it; the handkerchief is my father's - I never lost sight of the man from the time he dropped over the palings till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, (written). From the evidence you have heard I am convinced you must feel satisfied that I am not the person who committed the robbery - I beg leave to state that I am a mechanic, who was returning to the arms of my family after walking many miles in search of employ in my honest avocation; that I should be seized, beat, and most unmercifully treated, then dragged to a prison, to be tried for an offence which my very soul shudders at the thought of - my principles have not deviated so far from the paths of virtue as to commit a crime so heinous in its nature; I trust the gentlemen of the Jury will consider my awful situation, and examine with attention the imbrobability of the prosecutor's evidence, for the darkness of the night in question was such, that it was impossible to see any one at ten yards distance from the place you might be in - nor was I aware that any one was coming after me, until I was collared by a powerful man, which naturally alarmed me; considering myself attacked by a robber, I tried all the resistance in my power, and struck him with something I had just picked up, which proved to be a hone, but his strengh so far exceeded mine he overpowered me, and struck me with the hone till I was quite insensible - thus my Lord, stands my situation; the desk and great coat I know nothing of - I also beg leave to state that I never was in a Court of Justice in my life, and have always heretofore been considered and known as an honest, sober, and industrious man; I therefore submit my case to the wise dictates of an omnicient God, whose more weighty influence may induce this honourable Court to deem me worthy of their mercy.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

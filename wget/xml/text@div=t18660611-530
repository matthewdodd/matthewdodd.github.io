I occupy the first floor of 47, Skinner-street, Snow-hill—on the afternoon of 4th June, about half-past 3 o'clock, I went out and locked the door, leaving a roll of about fifteen yards of carpet there and two bags—I took the key with me—the street door is generally left open till dark—next morning I found my door fastened with a padlock, and a policeman there awaiting my arrival—the lock was broken, the woodwork broken away, and the door had been found open—I missed the carpet and the bags—I do not know the prisoners.</p>

            . I lived in the prisoner's family. I was in the passage to the front door, when I received a wound on my thigh; which I suppose was done with a gun or a pistol. I did not see what it was; neither did I hear the report.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you think gave you that wound?</p>
               <p>E. Laker. I believe the prisoner did.</p>
               <p>Q. Give your reason for your belief:</p>
               <p>E. Laker. I really think he was not in his senses. He had snapt a pistol at me in the kitchen before, but it did not go off; I do not believe he did it maliciously; he had never threatened me; and I have reason to think he looked upon me as his greatest good. I look upon him not to have been in his senses a great while before that, and have often mentioned it to his sister. He has said, he would make away with himself; and has taken a knife and cut across his own wrist; I have seen him do it: he at another time took laudanum.</p>

            . I live in the family: We have looked upon him to be out of his senses for five months past; his behaviour was that of a melancholy dejection, with much wildness in his countenance; never delighting to be in company: Had he been in his senses, he never would have done what he is charged with. She is a person, that he, when in his right mind, is far from having any aversion to; we all of us thought, by his behaviour, he was not in his senses, and used to speak of it to each other; and he has been in a mad-house ever since. He came from there to-day to this court.</p>

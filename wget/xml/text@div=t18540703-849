On Sunday evening, 25th June, I was on duty at the pier at Greenwich; I saw the prisoner on the pier, and Sophia Allen was close to him—I saw the prisoner put his left hand down by her pocket, on her right hand side—she removed about a yard on the left and the prisoner followed her, and placed himself by her right hand side—he put both his hands down by the side of her dress, and stood in a stooping position for about a second—he then turned himself sharply round, put something in his right hand pocket and walked away—I told the lady she had been robbed, and told her to follow me—I went after the prisoner and apprehended him on the stone pier, about thirty yards from the floating pier—he became very violent, I was obliged to throw him down—the lady came up, and said she had lost her purse—I put my hand in the prisoner's right hand pocket and took this purse from it, which the lady identified.</p>

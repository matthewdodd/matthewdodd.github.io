                  </hi>. I met the prisoner and Fowns together about twelve o'clock on the night of the 6th of June, and went to a house near Petticoat-lane with them—I went up stairs with Fowns and left Tucker below—after Fowns had gone away the prisoner came up stairs and pretended to make the bed—I asked for Fowns—she said she would come directly, but she did not—I took my coat off in Tucker's presence, put it on a chair, and went-down to look for Fowns, who I told her had got my ring—there was a pocket-book, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, an invoice, a pencil case, and a purse con<lb></lb>taining silver in my coat pocket—I went up stairs again, put my coat on, and came down—I then felt in my pocket, and missed my pocket-book—I told the prisoner I had lost my pocket-book, and said I would give her half a crown to go up stairs with me—she did so, and she said there was no pocket-book there—I took a light, and looked myself, but could find no<lb></lb>thing—she crossed over the way, and no doubt put it away somewhere there—I have never found it since, nor the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I did not stay up stairs with the prisoner two minutes—I told the policeman of it when I came down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He never took his coat off at all—he went away for a quarter of an hour or more, and then returned, and said he thought he had left his pocket-book up stairs—I went up with him with a light, and looked all about, but could not find it—he then gave me half-a-crown to go to bed with him—he said, "If you see the other girl, stop my ring and pocket-book; I have lost nothing particular, there is a pencil-case worth two shil<lb></lb>lings</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. The prosecutor gave the pri<lb></lb>soner into my charge, and said she had robbed him of his pocket-book and crossed over the way, where he considered she had deposited it—I searched the room, but did not find it—next day, by order of the magistrate, we went to search the room more minutely, and between the sacking and the bed found these tassels, which belong to a purse—nothing was found on the prisoner.</p>

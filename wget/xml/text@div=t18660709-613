I am assistant to Mrs. Rait, who keeps the receiving house in Manor Place, Upper Holloway—I received this letter of advice, and afterwards, about three o'clock, the prisoner came in plain clothes and presented this order—I said I had not sufficient cash, as I had been paying a large amount away, and asked him to call about five o'clock—he called at five, and waited ten minutes, and then gave me the order not signed—I gave it him back again to sign, and he at once signed it "B.S. Williams," which was the name in my letter of advice—I asked him who it came from—he said Mr. H. Allanson, of North Shields—that corresponded with my letter of advice—I asked him his name—he said, "B.S. Williams," and I at once paid him—he did not count the money, but swept it off the counter and dropped some of it on the floor—that excited my suspicion—he seemed to be in a great hurry—I got out and gave instruction to another assistant, Mr. Paddy, to watch him—I afterwards picked the prisoner out at the Holloway sorting office.</p>

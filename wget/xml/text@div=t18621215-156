                  </hi>. I am waiter at the Somerset-hotel, in the Strand—on Thursday evening, 20th November, the deceased, Edward Lee, and the prisoner after ordering dinner, came there to dine—no liquor was supplied to them during dinner—at the end of the dinner, after partaking of cheese, the prisoner and Mr. Lee began to play with the cheese knives—Mr. Lee began by tapping his plate with the point of the knife he had been using for his cheese—the prisoner cautioned him not to play with knives, it being dangerous—upon that a conversation ensued respecting the difference be<lb></lb>tween <hi rend="italic">carte</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tierce</hi>—the prisoner endeavoured to show Mr. Lee the difference with the cheese knife; he could not explain it satisfactorily to Mr. Lee, so they rose and stood in the middle of the room, each with a knife in his hand—Mr. Lee held his knife with the blade pointing towards the prisoner's shoulder, and the prisoner held his knife underneath towards the belly of Mr. Lee—they both stepped forward together and made a blow simultaneously, Mr. Lee over the prisoner's shoulder, and the prisoner at the belly of Mr. Lee—Mr. Lee was much taller than the prisoner; he stood over six foot—Mr. Lee immediately put his hand to his side, and sat down—I asked him if he was hurt—he said no—the prisoner then said, "My God, I am sure I have cut you"—Mr. Lee said, "I will show you"—he unbuttoned his trousers, and I saw a wound a little above the groin, on the right side—the blood was flowing, but not very freely—I took him into a private room, and went for a surgeon—Mr. Dunn came and saw the wound, and advised that he should be taken to a bedroom—that was done, and he remained there until the 30th, when he died—both the prisoner and the deceased had been drinking prior to coming to the hotel—they were drunk—this occurred between half-past 7 and 8 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, at 14, Clement's-inn—on the evening of 20th November, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I was called to the Somerset-hotel, and there saw Mr. Edward Lee—I made an examination of his person—I found him suffering from an incised wound just above the right groin—it was about an inch and a half long and about an inch and a half deep; it penetrated into the abdominal cavity, and entered the belly—I directed what was proper for him, and attended him at the hotel, from the</p>

               <p>evening of the 20th until the 30th, when he died—the ultimate cause of death was inflammation of the bowels—the wound in the belly was the exiciting cause of that inflammation—it is a common effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It was a very slight wound, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a very severe wound indeed; the bowel was wounded—when inflammation takes place in a bowel, death is nearly certain—I did not think him in danger till the Sunday morning, when inflammation set in—up to Sunday he was doing very well indeed—his habit of life was certainly against his recovery—if he had been a more temperate man, inflammation would not have been so likely; he would have had a better chance of recovery—I have known the prisoner on and off three or four years; he is the head porter of Dane's-inn, where Mr. Lee had chambers—I have since been informed that they were very good friends, and had been for some time—I may say that Mr. Lee distinctly told me it was more his fault than Morris's.</p>

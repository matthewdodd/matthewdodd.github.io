                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Settins, of Park-place, Old Ford-road—he keeps a chemist's shop—on 22d December the prisoner came and purchased a pennyworth of violet powder, two-pennyworth of pills, and three-halfpennyworth of lozenges, making 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a half-crown—I thought it looked bad, took it to my neighbour, Mr. Smith, and he returned with me to my shop—I said to the prisoner, "You have given me a bad half-crown; did you know it? "she said, "No"—I asked her if she was known to any neighbour; she said, "No"—I said, "You must give me back my goods"—she did so, and said she had no more money—while this was going on Mr. Smith went away, and came back with a constable and a young man named Joyce (<hi rend="italic">See last case</hi>), whom I saw here just now—I gave the half-crown to the constable—I brought back the same half-crown that I got from the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live next door to the last witness—on 22d December she came to me with a half-crown—I looked at it and found it bad—I kept it in my hand, went for a policeman, and afterwards gave it to him—I am sure it is the same—I cannot say whether I gave it to the policeman or any one else, but I saw him get it; whether I gave it him, or she did, I do not know—when I went for the policeman two men were waiting opposite, one of whom was Joyce, who had given me a bad shilling a little while previously—he was about twenty yards off, and was given in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> There were two half-crowns. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I believe there were—one of them had been passed before; the policeman had it—there was also a shilling, which was supposed to be Joyce's—I had given Mr. Settins change with that half-crown a week before.</p>

On Saturday, the 16th of November, I went on an errand, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, leaving the door a-jar; I returned in five minutes, and found it more open than I left it, and the prisoner coming out with these things under his arm. I missed them off the line, and pursued him. I called for Patrick who lives close by; he stopped him in about five minutes, in my presence, with them under his arm. They consisted of three frocks and a petticoat.</p>

I was going home rather intoxicated, having been drinking with a friend, and in Old-street two women stood at the corner of James-street, and took me with them into a room in James's-court; she took two shillings from me, and bolted off; the other came up, and turned me out, and I foolishly took these things off the line to make them return the money.</p>

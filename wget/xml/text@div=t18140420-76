On the night of the 5th of that month, I was doing duty at Dungeness; I had a party of my own men in my own cutter, the Carter; and also a party of men from the Lively cutter; about ten o'clock at night, I saw a lugger; she was standing towards shore, and she run aground. I boarded her immediately; she was a shore. I boarded her with my own men and the men belonging to the Lively.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your boarding her, what became of her crew - A. They immediately left the lugger, and went on shore. The name of the lugger was the Diana; her cargo consisted of six hundred and sixty-five casks of brandy, one hundred and eighteen of rum; (by casks, I mean half anchors, four gallons) twenty-three of vinegar, four of wine, a case of wine, one basket of wine, one hundred and nineteen bags of tobacco, forty-three bags of ditto, twelve bags of pepper, and two chests of tea. I sent to the barracks, and got some of the Lancashire militia. After I got them and was giving the Serjeant orders, the smuglers fired upon me; upon that the Serjeant gave orders for the soldiers to fire; that cleared the beach immediately. I remained with my vessel all night.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any number of persons assembling and coming on shore - A. Yes; it might be half an hour after the seizure.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any one of the persons that came down doing any thing particular to yourself - A. No, I cannot remember who it was. I was wounded in my thumb; I suppose it to be by a cutlass. There was a firing. This musket was presented to me; I twisted it away from the man, and hove it to the other side of the lugger. This musket was presented to me by somebody; the musket touched me; I threw it in the lugger.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was there firing from the people on shore - A. Yes, before we began firing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that musket presented at your body - A. Yes; I took it out of the man's hand, and threw it in the lugger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine it to see whether it was loaded - A. No. After I was wounded I was taken to a surgeon to get my wound dressed. I cannot say whether it was loaded or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plasterer, of Crofton Terrace, Rich<lb></lb>mond.—on 20th September I was at the corner of Acton Green, just inside the gate of Mr. Basham's new buildings, where I had been working (<hi rend="italic">Pointing out the spot on apian</hi>)—the prisoner drove round the corner towards me in a two-wheeled one-horse cart of Carter Paterson's—the deceased child then ran off the footpath into the road, and was five or six feet from the footpath, when the horse struck it, knocked it down, and the wheel passed over it—the prisoner drove on about 40 yards—I ran after him, and when he saw me coming he pulled up—I had not called out then, but when he stopped I said "Good God, you have run over that child!"—he said "I know I have, I could not help it"—I said "Why don't you turn round and go and take the little thing to the hospital?"—he turned round, and then I saw Mr. Brown with the child in his arms—I have had one horse, and I should say that the prisoner was driving about 10 miles an hour—I was about 100 yards from where the child was struck—the horse was trotting very fast—the first I saw of it was the accident—I could not see him in front of the school, not till he turned the corner, and I judge the pace from that corner to the place where he stopped—drivers usually sit on the right side of the cart, but he was on the left—he could see where the child was playing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. I ran very fast—you had not jumped out of the cart when I got to you—you jumped out then, and told your boy to fetch a parcel.</p>

I saw the child leave the pathway—I saw it before it was struck playing on the waste ground with several other children—the pathway is between the waste ground and the road—I saw the cart at the moment the child left the path—the horse might be 12 feet from the child at the moment it began to run and left the path—the cart was about 6 feet from the path—it was a nice little lad about 6 years old, and about 3 or 4 feet high—I saw no grown-up people near the children until I got up to the child, and heard nobody call out.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Swan, Acton Green—I was on the green and saw the prisoner driving along the road in front of the Catholic School at a pace of fully 10 miles an hour—I have kept horses 40 years—he was not trotting very fast indeed—I drive faster than that on a main road in the country, but not on Acton Green—I did not see the accident, as the corner of a house prevented me, but I picked the child up and held it up to the prisoner when he was brought back, and said "This is what you have done through furious driving, you have killed the child"—he said "I don't go fast"—I said "You always go fast"—he said "I have not been long on this beat"—Mrs. Snell carried the child ho Mr.;</p>

You were going about eight miles an hour round the corner, which you increased to 10 miles by the time you passed my house <hi rend="smallCaps">EMILY LOUISA SNELL</hi>. I am the wife of George Snell, a gasfitter—I was opposite the Roman Catholic School, going the same way as the cart which passed me, but it did not strike me as going particularly fast—the next thing I saw was the wheel going over the child—I heard some one call out but I did not take much notice, I had my baby in my arms.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the assistants of Mr. Charles Frederick Hancock, jeweller, of Bond-street—in consequence of my wife saying some<lb></lb>thing to me, I went to 10, Curson-street, Mayfair, about the 8th or 9th of August, and there saw the prisoner and his wife—they told me they wished to get some plate as they had none for use, and they asked me the best way to go about, to get it—I asked them whether they would like to have new or second-hand, and we arranged that I should get them some second-hand spoons and forks—I gave them an estimate of that and went away, saying that I should get the plate—I did nothing more that day—I afterwards called on them again the next day in consequence of a note I received from Mr. Johnston—I was out when the note arrived, and I called the next morn<lb></lb>ing—I saw the prisoner and his wife on that occasion—they said they were going to have a dinner party in the evening, and wanted some plate for use, because I could not supply what they ordered before, in time enough; I agreed to lend them about four dozen spoons and forks to use for this dinner party—I took the plate myself—I next saw the prisoner in the evening of the same day that I took the plate; between 5 and 6 o'clock, at 39, Bruton-street—his wife was with him then—he said he should like to borrow some jewellery for her to wear at the dinner party, as we had previously been talking about hiring jewellery—I asked them what kind of ornaments they would like to have; head ornaments, bracelets, or necklaces</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186010220088"></xptr>
               <p>and they said they would have a bracelet and a necklace, which they selected from some I showed them—the prisoner said he was going to have a dinner party and some friends, and amongst them there would be a live counters, and he wished his wife to astonish the natives—I lent him these two brace<lb></lb>lets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are worth about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—when I gave the bracelets into the hands of Mrs. Johnston, I introduced her and Mr. Johnston to a Mr. Brook, in our house; and they agreed and perfectly understood that Mr. Brook was to have the bracelets returned to him at 1 o'clock the next day in Curzon-street; he was to fetch them—I told them the reason why Brook was to come, and not myself; that I was going out of town the next day<lb></lb>they knew that perfectly well—I next saw the prisoner after that at Marl<lb></lb>borough-street police-court—I had in the meantime been to Wiesbaden—I started on the 6th—I think it must have been the 8th or 9th September that I arrived there—I there saw Mrs. Johnston—I did not say anything to her—I did not get the bracelets.</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Your wife had known Mrs. John<lb></lb>ston some time, had she not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they had been intimate for some years—my wife made a remark to me about the plate, but she told me that Mrs. Johnston wished to see me on some business at Curzon-street—I know that Mrs. Johnston is connected with a highly respectable family—I have heard also that the prisoner is connected with a very respectable family, but I know nothing of him previous to this—when I first went there I took some expensive jewellery with me—I took several diamond rings; one very valuable, worth something like fifty guineas—I do not know that I put it on I the prisoner's finger; he tried it on, himself—I did not try to persuade him I to take it—I might have suggested to him that it should be booked to him, and that he had better keep it; but not with the intention of making him buy it—I do not recollect saying that I would book it to him—I cannot I swear that I did not say so—there was only one thing I thought he might I have bought; a little bracelet for his wife—I had some with me at about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not offer to book a bracelet—the plate was to be paid for at Christmas; and to be supplied as soon as I could get it—I cannot swear I that I did or did not propose to him that a diamond ring should be booked to him—I proposed to him the same as to any other gentleman that I call on with goods—he said the ring was too expensive, but I never proposed to I him to book anything at all, except the plate—I should not have allowed him to have bought the ring unless he paid ready money for it—I could not let a man look out jewellery and plate like that at a first transaction—he was to have credit for the plate, but nothing more—that would amount to about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I would not have allowed him to have both; I would go beyond 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—no letter was written to me, asking me whether the plate was ready—I had a letter requesting me to call, as Mr. Johnston wanted to see me; and I did call—I took nothing at all with me then—I did not take any jewellery when I took the plate—in the course of the conversation about jewellery I said, "If Mrs. Johnston is going to a party, if you come down to our house I shall be happy to let you hire some jewellery": that is our business, we charge 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent.—it was on the next day, Friday, that they called and selected the bracelets—I was not in when the neck ornament was returned—that was worth thirty guineas—they had two bracelets and a neck orna<lb></lb>ment—the plate that lent was some plated and some silver—at a rough guess, the quantity I should think, would amount to about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., taking plate and silver together—I was not in when they were returned—Mr. Brook is here—when they called and looked at the bracelets and other</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186010220089"></xptr>
               <p>things, they did not propose to take one bracelet first, and I suggest that they had better have the two—I did not wish to dictate to them what they were to wear—they chose both bracelets—they did not choose first one and then another—I might have shown Mrs. Johnston five or six diamond tiaras—I showed her one worth about 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not recollect whether she said it would be too showy—I did not propose to her to hire it; they were merely shown to her as to anybody who would come into the shop, as a curiosity—Mr. Brook was there at the time I was showing them—I will swear there was no proposal that she should hire or borrow it—I will swear that I did not say, "I have known Mrs. Johnston a long time; I can man<lb></lb>age these matters; and you shall have them without paying any per centage—Mr. Brook was present when they chose the things—there is a Mr. Dewling in the establishment—Mr. Brook showed me a letter that was written by Mrs. Johnston—I don't recollect showing it to Mr. Johnston's servant, in Curzon-street; I might have done so—I believe Mr. Lewis has the letter in his possession—if I showed a letter to the servant, purporting to be written by Mrs. Johnston to Mr. Brook, that must have been the letter—I did not say that I was aware that the bracelets had been taken back to the shop with the other plate, and had been hired at the shop from Mr. Brook again—I could not say anything of that kind for I was away from London—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the book in which I made the entry of the bracelets when they were taken out—it is a book which we all use—Mr. Dewling is here—as a description of the things is entered, with the stock number and price on hire, every figure and letter is my writing—when the necklace was returned it was crossed out—I could not recollect the num<lb></lb>her without referring to the stock-book—there is no price to that, because I could not recollect the price; the ticket had got torn off—the price is put to the other things, because I had the tickets before me and copied them without any trouble—I wrote these words, "on hire," at the bottom of this same entry—I wrote the whole of that entry—I did not scratch this part out—that was done in my absence; when the things were returned the next day—here are four here; one was a small chain with a separate number—it is not our way of doing business to make an entry here to show the time at which the articles were to be returned: we trust to people's words—we enter them on sale or return—everything in that book, nearly, is on sale or return—it is for memoranda of everything that occurs in the day—the date is quite sufficient for us—they are not on hire as long the party chooses to keep them—these articles were agreed to be lent for one night; for a dinner party—there is no memorandum that they were to be returned at one o'clock—we never make memoranda of that sort—they are booked in a day-book, but there are only the words, "See waste book," in that—this is the waste book, and it is the book in which we generally enter articles lent on hire—"on hire," and "on sale or return," I understand to be one and the same thing—all through the book you will find articles entered "on hire"—sometimes we write "lent" and sometimes "on hire"—I was not present when the bracelets were returned—I was out of England when the officer was at the pawnbroker's—I did not go to the house on the Tuesday, the night before Mr. Johnston was taken—I was in Belgium—I did not get the address in Wiesbaden, from the servant—I got it from Mr. Wetherall, an ironmonger, of Chapel-street, Mayfair, close by the prisoners; a man who supplied Mr. Johnston with ironmongery—he knew the address and supplied it to me—the only entry made by Dewling would be the cross<lb></lb>ing, the scratching out, upon the return of the two things; the others would be left open.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Attenborough of 33, Pica<lb></lb>dilly, pawnbroker—I know the prisoner—he has pledged various articles from time to time, at my master's shop—he pledged these two bracelets with me on, I think, 9th August—I have not the duplicate or my book with me—(<hi rend="italic">The witness was directed to fetch them.</hi>) <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY SMITH</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, A</hi>). On Tuesday, 11th September, I watched the prisoner's house, 10, Curzon-street—I was not able to see him there—I ultimately went to a coffee-shop in Davies-street—about half-past 5 o'clock in the evening of 12th September I went to Mr. Attenborough's shop—I took the prisoner into custody as he was leaving the shop—he was out on the pavement, just going to get into a cab that was waiting—I told him my name was Smith, that I was a sergeant of the detective police, and should apprehend him for stealing two bracelets, the property of Mr. Han<lb></lb>cock—he said, "Cannot it be arranged?"—I told him I had no power over Mr. Hancock, and he must come to the station at Vine-street, close by—he handed me these two bracelets—they were wrapped up in paper in his hand—we then went back to Mr. Attenborough's—I asked Mr. Attenborough who was there, and the young man Topp, who took them in, to give me some particulars—they refused to do so—the prisoner was taken to the station and locked up—I searched him—before we got to the station Sergeant Robinson put his hand in the prisoner's coat-pocket and took out these two cases for the bracelets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him if his name was Dimsdale, and he said, "No; my name is Johnston"—he was searched at the station—amongst other things I found upon him this passport (<hi rend="italic">granted August 10th, 1860.</hi>), these two telegrams, and 77<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—I did not find various pawnbroker's duplicates; Robinson found those.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were they ever taken out of your possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only partially by my man—the interest was taken for that day, before the second ticket was made out, and then they were repledged—the interest was paid afterwards when he redeemed the bracelet—there was some paid at the time—I am not quite certain what interest was paid when the 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced—I charged them a certain amount of interest—I did not charge them the month's interest—the sum will appear from our books—I paid 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner was in the habit of threshing for me—a policeman produced a sample of oats to me, in consequence of which, I gave directions to have him apprehended—I can judge of corn in the bulk by the sample—this is winnowed, and there is barley among it by which I can identify it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant B</hi> 29.) I searched the prisoner's premises, at New Hampton—he was down stairs—I went to his bed<lb></lb>room, and found about three bushels of oats in a sack—I showed a sample of it to Grist before I told him where I found them, he identified them as his—I then told him the prisoner was in custody—the prisoner said they were his own—he did not say how he came by them—he said a man from Twickenham had left them there—I asked who he was—he said he did not know his name.</p>

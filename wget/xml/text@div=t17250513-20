             thus deposed: I live in the Meuse: I had been in the Temple to receive a little Money, and afterwards staid there drinking till One or Two in the Morning; at which time, being pretty well in for it, I came away; and as I was going along the Strand, I overtook three Soldiers. They jostled me as I pass'd by them; but I went forward without saying any Thing to them: And soon after I met the Prisoner. My Dear, says she, will you give me a Pint? I being willing to shun the Soldiers, who were not far behind me, stept with her into the <placeName id="t17250513-20-crimeloc97">Crown and Harp Tavern, the Corner of S. Martin's-Lane</placeName>

I called for a Pint of Wine; but before we had drunk it, I happened to put my Hand into my Pocket, and miss'd Half of a Guinea and some Silver. She ran down Stairs a-cross the Way, and I after her: But presently the three Soldiers came up to her Assistance. She cry'd to them, Kill the Dog, kill him. So they all drew their Bayonets, and forced me up again the Wall. Gentlemen, I hope (says I) you will not be so honourable as to kill me.</p>

             thus deposed: As I was coming by the Bottom of S. Martin's-Lane, (the Night was very dark) I heard a Slap o' the Face given, and somebody say, You have pick'd my Pocket you Bitch of Half a Guinea. Coming nearer, I discovered three Soldiers, with their Bayonets drawn, and pointed at the Prosecutor, who was forced up to the Wall. I called the Watch, and the Soldiers ran off. But the Woman endeavouring to get away too, ran against a Coach that stood in the Street, and so was taken.</p>
               <p>The Constable deposed, That when the Prisoner and Prosecutor were brought to the Watch-House, they were both confoundedly drunk. She said, if She had any more about her than 4 s. 6 d. she knew nothing of it; but in searching her Pocket, I found Half a Guinea and more Silver. The Prisoner thus made her Defence: The Prosecutor took hold of me in the Strand, and would make me go to the Tavern. I was very unwilling; but he would not let me alone, and so I went. We had three Pints of Wine. He gave me Money to lie with me, but no Gold that I know of. It is possible indeed that Half a Guinea might slip in among the Silver; but I saw none. And because I refused to comply with what he required, be charged me with picking his Pocket, which I was surprized at. However, he paid his Reckoning, went down before me, and waited at Door; and as I came out, You Bitch, says he, give me my Half Guinea. I ran away, and two or three Soldiers came up; but I knew nothing of them, for I never saw them before. The Jury <rs id="t17250513-20-verdict98" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Can you tell when this happened to you? - Of a Tuesday.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - About two months ago, I was up at four o'clock in the morning; they all went to dinner at one o'clock; the prisoner was not long gone to his dinner, not a quarter of an hour, as I could guess, they left their dinner and the men went to sleep upon the kilns where they burn the bricks; I eat my own dinner, and was going to lie down in the straw to sleep; the prisoner came, and hit me over the shoulder with a piece of cord; he bid me get up to pull down the barrow, for he was going to work; before I could get hold of the barrow, he dragged me by my arm into the stable.</p>
               <p>How many yards might that be distant? - The stable is about as far as from here to the door; he shut the door, and then put his hands up my petticoats; I was going to cry out; he stopped my mouth by putting his hand over it; he took and laid me upon the stones upon the ground; then he pulled up my petticoats, and got a top of me, and put something into me; he said, if I stirred he would have my life; he got off me, and buttoned up his breeches.</p>
               <p>What situation were his breeches in when he got upon you? - He unbuttoned them.</p>
               <p>What was it that he put into you? - His private parts.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive any thing come from him? - Yes, something wet; after he had done this, he gave me a halfpenny, and bid me say, if my mother found it out, that it was the Bearer off did it, that is the man that wheels off the barrow when it is full of bricks; he said that to me when he had done with me, when I was going to get up; then he went out; he said, do you stay here till I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160026"></xptr> come, and he bid me bring another girl down that was playing with me, for he wanted to serve her the same.</p>
               <p>Did he say what girl; did he mention any one in particular? - Yes, a girl whose hair curled, and who wore a short eared cap; she played with me every day. I came out about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>How many minutes do you suppose after he left you? - He went out, and then I came out in two or three minutes after him.</p>
               <p>Where did you go? - I went and sat down in the straw, and he went some where across the fields in his shirt sleeves. Before he went across the fields, he saw my shoes were all over bloody; he threw some ashes upon them to hide the blood. I lay in the straw from that time, which was about one o'clock till four; the prisoner crossed the fields, and I went to sleep in that condition in the straw; some of the men came down and waked me, and told me to go for the four o'clock beer; instead of going for the beer, I made the best of my way home to my mammy. The first woman that saw me was one Mrs. May; I told her how I was used; then I called my daddy down, and told him of it; the neighbours came together, and they went and fetched a constable, and a gentleman that is in court; and they set me upon a chair in Mrs. May's room. The constable and the other gentleman went with me back to the brick field; the constable told me to go first, and see if the man was there; they followed me; when I went back the men were just beginning to work, and my mammy was there; she did not know where I was; I showed the constable the man that had used me so, which was the prisoner, and they took him, and carried him directly before Justice Blackborough.</p>
               <p>Jury. You are sure the prisoner is the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you known him very well before? - Yes; I had worked with him a fortnight and two days.</p>
               <p>Did you tell Mrs. May the name of the man that had used you so ill? - Yes,

               <p>I am a constable of the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell, on Tuesday the 14th of July last, between six and seven in the afternoon as near as I can guess, I was at Sadler's Wells; I attend there to keep peace. This girl's father and a woman came to me, and desired I would go along with them immediately, for there was a Moulder, (they did not mention his name) that had committed a rape upon the body of his daughter, and he could not get any other officer to go with him; he had been to several. I went to Mr. Charlton's room; there was the girl; she was very bad; there were two or three women about her; they pulled up her clothes, that I should see the condition she was in; her thighs and legs were all over blood. From thence I went along with the girl to find out the prisoner; we went into a brick field, at the back of the <placeName id="t17780916-47-crimeloc230">Lower-street, Islington</placeName>

As soon as we came within sight of him, the girl pointed at him, and said that is the man. I went immediately and apprehended him, and had him before justice Blackborough.</p>

               <p>Were there any other persons in the field besides the prisoner at that time? - Yes; there were two women there; the girl's mother was there.</p>
               <p>Was there any other man besides the prisoner? - I did not observe; I did not look; my eyes were upon the prisoner; I got another constable to assist me in taking him to prison, after he was committed by the justice, for fear he might get away from me. The other constable asked him how he came to serve the girl so; his answer was that, she said, if he did not - her, somebody else should.</p>

            . Did you consent to his doing this? - No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say to him that if he did not lie with you, somebody else should? - No; I was going to sleep in the straw when he came and did it; he did it against my consent. I was going to cry out, and he stopped my mouth with his hand.</p>

               <p>Did you in the course of that evening, or how soon after examine her? - I examined her about eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Mention the condition in which you found her? - I found she had been considerably abused; and likewise there was a laceration of a quarter of an inch in her private parts: the laceration was on the lower part of her private parts; I found on examination some coagulated blood that came out of her private parts.</p>
               <p>Can you say from the appearances that you observed, what had occasioned that injury? - I cannot pretend to say what had occasioned it: force had been applied, and she appeared to have been injured.</p>

               <p>I went home at dinner at the usual time, I believe it was twelve o'clock, and my wife and my mother were both a getting dinner ready, hashing a piece of shoulder of mutton; I waited till it was done, after it was done I went to a public house which is hard by; (I thought the young woman would have been here as a witness, but thinking the trial would not come on, I did not send for her.) I had two pints of beer, I went down to work, after I had been down to work, the people were not there, it was very hot weather. I said to an old man who was there, (who would have been here if he had known it). I said it is very hot weather, he said he had been looking for me, he would go and get a pint of beer, and work later in the evening, I did not stay ten minutes, we went up to the Crown and had two quarts of beer, and then another; it drew on to about six o'clock; as this man and I were going down to the field, we met the people coming up that work with me. I said where are you going to? They said they were going to see for me; they said they had sent the girl for some beer, the mother of the girl was with me at the same time, coming up with these people; I asked how long she had been gone; they said an hour and an half. I said, Peter, if they want any beer, do not let us go away to lose all the day, let us go to work, do you go and fetch five pints of beer, the usual allowance; he went: while he was gone, the mother of this girl said, Mr. Jones, I will put some bricks into the barrow, I dare say my girl will be here presently, she is playing about I suppose; the constable and the girl came in before I had made a barrow full of bricks, they took me before the justice, I had no money to get witnesses, and since I have been committed my wife has laid-in; the parents of the girl have been to my wife and extorted money from her; they said they must have half a crown to throw the clause out; they said they must have some money, they could not make it up for less than twenty pounds; her father said it lay in his power to hang me or set me at liberty. A friend of mine gave him a guinea to see if that would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160028"></xptr> pacify him; he took that and got drunk, then he pretended he would come down and release me; here is a witness who heard the mother say, that she could tell the girl to say any thing, and make her swear any thing, they wanted five or six shillings a week of me till twenty pounds were paid.</p>

               <p>I have known him above twenty years, I never knew any harm of him till now, he is an honest hard working industrious man; the girl's father and mother came to my house and wanted twenty pounds; they wanted four pounds down.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown.</p>
               <p>This prosecution is carried on by the governors and guardians of the poor of the parish of Clerkenwell; they have kept the girl in the work-house, without the parents having access to her ever since this affair, for the parents, the father particularly, would no doubt have taken a sum of money.</p>
               <p>Nichols, She said she could make the girl swear any thing, or could make her swear that she was asleep, and knew nothing about it; she said she could make the girl swear, that it being nine weeks ago, that she had forgot what she said, and she said the girl could give change for a guinea as well as she; and that was the reason she could make her swear any thing.</p>

               <p>I am the prisoner's brother's wife. He has been a hard working man ever since I have known him, that is ten years. The father of the child said that she should not appear against him upon his trial; and last night the father of the child came and said, he must have half a guinea to make some fraud in the indictment to clear him; he said he could save him from being hanged; but there would be some damage lie against him for the damage he had done his child; but it would lie at his option to let him out of prison when he pleased.</p>

               <p>Counsel for the Crown.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jones the surgeon, has disclosed to me a circumstance, that as it makes for the prisoner, I think it equally my duty that it should be laid before the court.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Mr. Jones, you will please to state to the court what answer the girl gave to you upon a question you put to her? - I asked her what occasioned the appearance, she said she had been ravished; I then asked her whether she perceived an emission; indeed, I asked her whether she perceived any wetness coming from the man; she told me she did not.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you ask her the question? - At the hospital, I asked her the question two or three different times; I believe the sister of the ward was present; I am not positive; she always said she did not, till two or three days afterwards; then she said that the blood coming from her; probably, she did not perceive it; but it was three days after, that she said that.</p>
               <p>I believe no one could have access to her there but the sister of the ward and the people there? - Her mother, I saw with her there.</p>
               <p>

               <p>I am the mistress of the workhouse for Clerkenwell. I had this girl under my care about a fortnight; justice Blackborough gave the master and me a strict charge not to let her go out. I have had her under my care ever since.</p>
               <p>No one has had access to her during the last fortnight? - No, only her father and mother, and I always stood by while they were there: the father and mother are I believe abandoned people, but the girl seems a sober, pretty behaved girl as ever was.</p>
               <p>I believe the father wanted to make it up? - The father said the life of the man was of no service to him; he thought there was to be recompense made the parish if he was to be cast; and he thought he should get it; he said he thought if he could get fourteen or fifteen guineas, it would be of more service to them than the man's life.</p>
               <p>Jury. You never heard them dictate to her what to say? - No; I always had her in my hand.</p>

They wanted to extort what money they could from me and from the parish, so to make up a sum of money and to quit their neighbourhood. The mother went to get a subpoena for herself; and the husband said they should get two shillings with it. The mother would sometimes over-run the girl's wages, drinking gin at the alehouse.</p>

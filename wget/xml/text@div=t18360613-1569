I am a police-constable, and live in Arbour-square, Commercial-road—on the 24th of May I was on duty in Tent-street, Wa<lb></lb>terloo-town—I saw the prisoner, about a quarter before ten o'clock, going along—he saw me, and threw away a bundle, and ran off—I pursued him, and sprang my rattle—Bolton pursued and took him—I had not lost sight of him from the mine I saw him drop the bundle—when I first saw him he was about five minutes' walk from the prosecutor's.</p>

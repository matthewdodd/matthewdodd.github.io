               <p>Q.Who was in the shop at the time the prisoner was there, besides yourself? - A. My wife and the grand boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he ask for the nutmeg-grater? - A. The errand-boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No, he is under age, he is about eleven years of age; I did not think it necessary to bring him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. In what state did I appear when I went into your shop? - A. He appeared to me in the same state that he does now, tipsey.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It cannot be supposed that he is now in that state, just coming from the prison? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he appear to be sober? - A. I thought he was tipsey, but after that, I had no reason to think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what he had in his hand before he went out of the shop? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You certainly said before the Magistrate, that you saw the grater in his hand? - A. I saw that he had something in his hand, but I had not missed any thing.(James Hall, the marshalman, produced the grater, which was deposed to by Mr. Aughtie.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, it was not my intention, originally, to have given the Court any trouble; the next morning after it happened, I had not the smallest recollection of the situation I had been in the night before; Mr. Aughtie said, that he knew perfectly well, that I was intoxicated the night before, and he offered me to go on board a man of war.

               <p>Q. Did you lose a shawl at any time? - Yes, some time in February, a buff coloured shawl, with a kind of black leaf on it, out of my drawer in the parlour; I pulled it off my neck on Tuesday morning, and on the following Friday I went to wash it, and it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever have it again? - No, I have seen it at the pawnbroker's since, last week.</p>

               <p>I have got the shawl (Produced.) It was taken in on the 12th of February on pledge, of whom I really cannot tell, I believe it was taken in by me, but I have two young men that write tickets, and it is one of them that wrote the ticket.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I know it by the particular dirt I made in it when I left it off, and by my suckling my child when I had it on, because it is dirted with it, it is not marked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - I knew her by coming sometimes to my shop, the had lived sometime before with a woman in the kitchen out of place, in the same house where I live.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the live there then? - No, the woman was gone away as well as herself. I left her in the room, when I missed my shawl; she called in one morning for something the wanted in the shop; it was before I missed my shawl that the was in my apartment; I left her in the parlour about ten minutes, rocking of my child, I went into the shop to serve some people; whether it was Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday I don't know.</p>

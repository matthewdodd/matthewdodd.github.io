Hillman, Linen Draper, Seiner's House, Baling, W."—I posted it at 2.45 at the Western Office in Chapel Street, Vere Street—I had pre<lb></lb>viously given information at the office—I went to the office about 5.30 the same day, and went up stairs to the Postmaster's room—Mr. Hewitt came into the room, followed by the prisoner, Mr. Smith, the chief clerk, and Rumbold the constable—I said to the prisoner "I am an officer of the General Post Office, you are suspected of stealing a great many letters; there</p>

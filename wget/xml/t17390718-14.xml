The Prisoner wanted embroidered Thread Hose, which I shew'd her: I had some Suspicion of them, and keeping my Eye on them, I saw the Prisoner take one Pair out of the Parcel which lay before her. She bid me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173907180010"></xptr> Four Shillings for a Pair I had asked Six Shillings for, and then I told her I believed she did not want a Pair, for she had got a Pair already; and I immediately whipp'd over the Counter, and found a Pair upon + her. Then I had her into my Parlour, and there she dropp'd another Pair, which she had stole from the Black Lamb over-against St. Sepulchre's Church. She had tuck'd my Stockings under her Stays through some Holes in her Cloaths, with her right Hand. These are the Stockings, and I swear they are mine. Here's the Maker's Name on them.</p>

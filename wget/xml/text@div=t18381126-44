                  </hi>. I am a pensioner from the Grenadier Guards. On the 3rd of November I was in the Canteen at Westminster, about half-past seven o'clock—the prisoner was there—he is a soldier in the Grenadier Guards—he sat very near me—we drank together—I had been drinking with the regiment—I cannot say I had known him before—I took my snuff-box out, and placed it down before him and others—they claimed each to have a pinch from that snuff-box, it being presented from the regiment to me—when I wanted it again it was not forthcoming—I then missed the prisoner—I called in a policeman, and went to two pawnbrokers and at the second one found the box, and the prisoner was taken—I was sober—I did not give him leave to pawn it there—I was twenty-three years a staff sergeant in the regiment, and twenty-six years in the service, and two years and a half in the navy—this is my box—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in St. Martin's-lane. This box was pawned on Saturday evening, the 3rd of November, by the prisoner, in the name of John Pratt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. You asked me whether I would sell the box—I said, "No, on no account." <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I said nothing of the kind—we never buy—I asked how he came by it—he said it was given him, and he would not lose it for double the money—he pawned it for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as old silver—it is engraved, which takes a great deal of the value off.</p>

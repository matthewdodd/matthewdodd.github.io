            . I am clerk to Charles Sayer, who has no partner - he lives at No. 86, <placeName id="t18340102-127-crimeloc708">Great Tower-street, St. Dunstan in the East</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. How long had you missed the keys? A. From the 5th of September till the 27th of November - I had not any intelligence of them in that time - they could not have been lying about the counting-house during that time, because I had every place searched - I had the counting-house swept every morning - I was very careful in the search - others had access to the keys - they might have taken them to have gone in - I questioned them about the keys - I was not absent ten minutes - I had only gone up stairs to Mr. Sayer, who was ill- according to the best of my opinion, no one would touch them, or had touched them, besides the person who took them away.</p>
               <p>Q.You say you heard three knocks at the counting-house-door? A. Yes: they followed each other immediately, as if somebody wanted to come in; and were loud enough to be heard - the counting-house is left for the night at eight o'clock - I leave to go to dinner at four o'clock -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020071"></xptr>the clerk goes at half-past two, and is back about a quarter of an hour after I leave; so that it is left for a short time - it was known that our counting-house is open for business until eight o'clock - it is in the same building as the dwelling-house - Mr. Sayer lives there - I was engaged in making up an interest account which requires attention, that was the reason I did not answer the knocks - there was a handle to the door outside - I will swear it was a key, and not the turning of the handle that I heard, because when he turned the handle he came in - we have five persons in our employ besides Mr. Sayer - there are three porters, but they have nothing to do with the counting-house - when he put his head in at the door, I went to him, and said, "There is no Mr. Smith here" - he ran away as hard as he could - all the goods in the counting-house are Mr. Sayer's.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMMERS addressed the Court and Jury on the prisoner's behalf.</p>

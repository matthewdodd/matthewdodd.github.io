             sworn.</p>
               <p>I saw two persons whom I believe to be the prisoners, standing about two yards from me, at the time I saw them they turned suddenly from me, I suspected I had suffered some loss, and putting my hand in my pocket wherein I always have two handkerchiefs, I missed a cambrick handkerchief which I have now.</p>
               <p>(Produces the handkerchief.)</p>
               <p>Court. Was it on the right or left hand side that you saw them? - On the right hand, I am sure of that, my handkerchief was in the left hand pocket, it was a very warm morning, I did not know by what means I lost my handkerchief, but I heard a voice pretty nearly over me from a window saying, Sir! the fellow in the black coat has picked your pocket, pursue him Sir, and cry stop thief; I did so, and the prisoners were stopped, but before that they dropped the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Did you see them drop the handkerchief? - No, my Lord, in the course of the riot soldier had the handkerchief in his hand and he said the prisoner dropt it.</p>
               <p>Is that soldier here? - No.</p>
               <p>When this person gave you that alarm from the window, were these prisoners near enough to hear that alarm? - Certainly my Lord, they run away immediately.</p>
               <p>How soon before this, had you your handkerchief in your left hand pocket? - Oh! immediately, about five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Were there any people passing by? - No, not a creature.</p>
               <p>Were there any people passing by between the time that you had your handkerchief and the time you lost it? - There were.</p>
               <p>Was that handkerchief yours that you picked up? - I do not know, the soldier gave it me.</p>

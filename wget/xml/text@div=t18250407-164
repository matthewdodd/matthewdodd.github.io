On the 30th of March, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to the shop, with another man; Watts asked to look at some black silk handkerchiefs; I shewed them some: he kept saying they would not do, and asked if we had any coloured ones - I would not shew them any more; I saw the prisoner put some handkerchiefs into his hat, which he put on his head; he then asked to look at some stockings, which I shewed them - he closed a pair at 2 s.; he gave me 2 s. 6 d.; I said I had not got 6 d.: he took up the half-crown, and both ran out together, saying they would get change - I ran after them, giving an alarm; they ran down a court, and then the prisoner agreed to go back with me, as the crowd would not let him go away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you lose sight of him? A. Only while he ran up the court; he had thrown them out of his hat, but not in my sight. I found nothing about him; I had seen them both before, frequently, walking by the shop - they went by the day before.</p>

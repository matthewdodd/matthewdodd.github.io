            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 12th of February I was on duty at the theatre, Covent Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the persons of these two men - A. Yes; I have seen them in the street from the 5th to the 12th; they were walking to and fro <placeName id="t18100221-108-crimeloc637">Bow-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18100221-108-crimeloc637" type="placeName" value="Bow-street"></interp>

On the 12th, about half past ten, I saw each of them at different times, in the course of the time that I followed them, with their hands in different gentlemen's pockets; I saw Hart draw a handkerchief; White was behind; I think it was this handkerchief, I am not positive, because it was wet when I had it of him. I saw it drawed just at the end of Bow-street. When Hart drawed it from the gentleman's pocket he rolled it up in his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure it was one of those that you now produce - A. No, I cannot be sure of that, because he had gone away from me sometime before I apprehended him; I believe it was this. It is a silk handkerchief; the corner was wet, it appeared as if the name had been bit out with the teeth, that made me suppose that was the handkerchief that he had drawed out. He was a tall gentleman, leading a lady through the mob. Seeing him pick this gentleman's pocket I wanted to get as much against them as I could. I followed White, he was talking to a gentleman about the play; he took, I believe, this handkerchief. I apprehended White, and found upon him three handkerchiefs, and twenty-four duplicates of different articles; White was charged afterwards by a gentleman of picking his pocket, and when he came to see the handkerchiefs he said neither of these were his; there was a man behind that received it. I apprehended Hart nigh a quarter to twelve, he was coming about the house again; it was a few minutes after I apprehended White. I searched Hart, I found two handkerchiefs upon him. I was rather short. There was an hackney coachman went into a public house and made his brag that he had got a hatfull of handkerchiefs. The gentleman, whose pocket Hart picked, told me he would attend, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think the value of that handkerchief is that the mark is picked out - A. About one shilling and sixpence.</p>

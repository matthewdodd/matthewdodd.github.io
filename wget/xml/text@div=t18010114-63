            ; I am servant to Mr. Thomas. Sometime in the month of July I saw the prisoner twice within a fortnight at Mr. Thomas's; it was about the middle of July, about half past six in the morning; she had nothing with her when she came in; she carried out a considerable bundle; she was there between twenty minutes and half an hour; I was doing my work; I did not know what she had come for; she had a considerable large bundle wrapped up in a coloured apron, which she put under a red cloak; I had lived there but about a week: the second time that I saw her she came in between six and seven in the morning, and brought in a little bundle with her; after staying about twenty minutes, she went away with a large bundle; I am sure she is the same person; there was a piece of work in the house about things being lost, and seeing her come backwards and forwards gave me cause of suspicion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Brown, and live in George-court, St. Anne-street. Last Monday I went over to my daughter's at Lambeth—I returned at a little after eleven o'clock at night, and going down St. Anne-street, I saw a young woman run across the street—she came up to me, pulled my cloak with main force, and tried to get it from me, but could not succeed, as it was fastened across my back—I had an umbrella in my left hand—she dragged that out of my hand, ran across the street with it, and went up a court—I called a policeman, who went up the court after her, but I was afraid to go myself—the policeman pro<lb></lb>duced the umbrella—It was thrown out of a window—the prisoner is the person who took it from me—when I came into the room, I said, "She is the person, I am certain of her"—I found her in the house up the court, after the policeman came.</p>

I heard a cry of "Police"—I went to the spot in St. Anne-street—I then went to No. 2, James-court, from information, and demanded admittance at the room up-stairs, which was refused—I threatened to break the door in—while I was doing so I heard the window put up, and the door was directly afterwards opened—I went in and found the umbrella partly hanging on a line out of the window, and resting on a ledge—the prisoner and two others were in the room—they all denied having taken the umbrella—I took them all into custody—at the station-house, Murray said, in the prisoner's hearing, that she (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>) brought the umbrella into the room, and gave it to her to put up the chimney—the prisoner said, "You did not put it up the chimney, that Murray gave it to her again, and she threw it out of the window—she said she brought the umbrella up, and gave it to Murray.</p>

I was at work on board the ship Percy, on the 25th of May - I was the foreman on deck; I put my shoes in the cabin in the morning, and missed them at a quarter before four o'clock, when I was coming away - I found an old pair there, not so good as mine; the prisoner had been at work there, and left the ship a quarter before four; I went after him, and found the shoes on his feet - I had him brought back - he took my shoes off, and put on the others, which he said were his own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe your shoes fitted him very well? A. Yes; he was intoxicated - when I said "Have you got your own shoes on?" he looked down, and said "No; these are not mine;" I believe the mate had him in the cabin, and gave him some drink: he might have made a mistake.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police constable. I stopped the prisoner; he said he had been on board a vessel. and taken off his own shoes and left them on deck, but when he came up he could not find his own, and he was not going to walk away bare-foot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he not been drinking? A. He seemed as if he had been drinking strong grog - somebody might have removed his shoes and put them there again; he acknowledged these were not his.</p>

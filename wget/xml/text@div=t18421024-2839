                  </hi>. I am a ship-broker, at Queen-square, Bristol. About half-past twelve o'clock, on the 30th of September, I was in Cheapside, with a friend—I stopped to light a cigar, and my friend walked on—I saw one of the prisoners take hold of my friend's arm, and walk up Bow-church-yard—I followed him, knowing he was in liquor—when I got to the corner Hubbard took my arm—I asked her what she, wanted—she said, to speak to me—I had gone a few steps up Bow-church-yard—I disengaged myself, and walked on—she again came and stopped me—I said, "Come, don't tease me"—I then saw my handkerchief on the ground—I stooped to pick it up, and, in rising, she either bit or cut my guard-chain—I, in a passion, said, "You are a thief," and struck her—I called to my friend, and said, "Come along, or we shall be robbed"—he turned, and we walked to the corner of the street—there were two policemen—I put my hand to my pocket, and missed my watch—this now produced is it—I saw Hubbard and another woman together before this transaction, but I cannot say that one of them was Jones.</p>

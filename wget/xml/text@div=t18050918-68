               <p>RACHAEL BENNET sworn. - Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. I have seen her once; she came to my house on the day I lost my things, I cannot justly say the day; it was about one o'clock at noon; she came with an acquaintance of mine, and staid till about three or four o'clock, and we all went out together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that she had any thing with her when she went out? - A. No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you together in the same room all the time she staid with you? - A. Yes; I came home about seven o'clock, and missed my children's clothes that same evening - a gown and a frock; they were hanging on the bannisters of the stairs in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave them there when you went out? - A. No, my children had put them there when they came from school at five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out they were on your children's backs, who were at school, so that when you came home you did not know any thing more than what your children told you - Did you see this gown and frock afterwards? - A. Not till I saw them in Court.</p>

I had 60 l. I folded them up, and put them into my right-hand breeches pocket loose. I knew Howse before by sight; Bull was quite a stranger, we came away all three together in a gig, as Howse asked me to ride. I sat on the near side, Bull sat next to me, and Howse drove.

               <p>"I have lost my money and one of you must have got it," they had not got out of the gig - Howse said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Puddiford, I hope you do not think I have got it;" I said, one of them must have got it; one of them then said,</p>
               <p>"There lies your note behind you," I then took up a 20 l. note, about two yards from the gig - I said,</p>
               <p>"This is not all by a great deal, you have got 40 l. more;" the watchman stood by and said,</p>
               <p>"What is that you say, have they got your money" - I said</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I give you charge of them." Howse immediately whipped his horse and galloped away - we went after them - the watchman sprang his rattle, and hollowed,</p>
               <p>"Stop the gig;" they drove on nearly half a mile, till they came to Baker-street, then Howse was thrown out and secured; he said,</p>
               <p>"Puddiford, I hope you are not going to leave me locked up." I found a 10 l. and two 5 l. notes, about three hundred and fifty yards from Lisson Grove, between that and Baker-street. I went home, returned, and found in the same road nearer to town, some notes, but as I cannot read, I cannot tell what they are; they were trod upon and torn all to pieces. I had drank two pints of ale with another person - I was sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is not your name Pettiford - A. I don't know how it is spelt, some spell it</p>
               <p>"Ped" and some</p>
               <p>"Pud." I had a box coat on, which was buttoned up over my clothes. I sat in the corner of the gig, Bull sat nearly on my thigh - we left the house just before four o'clock. I only had two pints of ale. I do not think that the landlord refused to give me more liquor. While I was in the gig I asked them twice to stop and drink, they refused - they pulled up for me to get out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you charge one of the patrole with stealing your money - A. No; as I came out of Mary-le-bone office, I saw the dog which followed the gig, and said, that was the dog." I did not complain of any officers not taking a patrol into custody. I cannot swear the rattle did not frighten the horse.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said he whipped the horse - A. Yes, I generally feel for my money when I leave company, the note laid about two yards behind me - it was not a windy night. I did not go in the track the notes were found - they were found on the left side of the road, fifteen yards from the path.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I came up just after the prisoner got out of the gig, he was speaking to the two men, I asked how he came to loose his money, they at that moment drove off, but not very quick, for about twelve paces then turned round and came back, and said</p>
               <p>"What do you mean Puddiford, to say we have got your money," he said he had lost it and had been no where but with them in the gig, he persisted in saying they must have it, and said,</p>
               <p>"take charge of them." they immediately turned the gig, whipped the horse, and made off as fast as they could, a man had hold of the reins, they snatched them from him, I pursued calling</p>
               <p>"Stop-thief," they drove by all the watchmen, I came up with Howse who was dirty, and asking for his hat, I think he had been thrown out. I saw Puddiford pick up the 20 l. note; the road is very wide.</p>

Mr. Legrew Hesse lives in the place where the tickets are kept-it is the property of the Crown; I know the prisoners. On the 3d of July they came together to the office-the woman presented a share of a ticket which was drawn in the last lottery - She handed it across to me; I had at that time a number of whole tickets, which were arranged for entry for payment-No.3,824, was one of them; it was the uppermost of the pile.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman near enough to have taken it - A. She was. After examining her share I returned it to her. She asked a question which I did not understand-her husband said it was of no consequence, as it was a blank. Almost immediately after they left the office I missed the ticket-no other person had been there. Six days afterwards, the male prisoner came to the office to inquire the fate of a ticket, and presented me with a piece of paper, with No. 3,824 of the 2nd Lottery for 1815. I told him the examination would be attended with an office-fee. He said he knew that, for he had been there before. On looking at the number I immediately recognized as like the number I had lost. I asked him if he had the ticket of that number? he said No. I communicated it to another clerk, and he fetched the secretary, who came out, and asked the prisoner if he had a ticket of that number? he said No; he had a sixteenth of it. We sent for an officer, who took him into custody - He said he was innocent. When he was going to be searched at the office, he said, to prevent trouble, he had got the ticket, and immediately produced it from his pocket. He said his wife found it in St. Martin's-lane. His wife was sent for - She came and said she did not know how she came by it; that she found it accidentally in her pocket as a piece of waste paper-that she picked up a piece of paper in St. Martin's-lane about a fortnight ago, and supposed that was it. I produce the ticket, and am certain it is that I lost-it tallies exactly with the cheque. I refer to the Benefit Book, by which it appears that it is a prize of 10l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. They were a very short time there. The man was not near enough to take it.</p>
               <p>Q. This being the uppermost ticket it might have slipped from the pile - A. It is possible. I returned him the paper she gave me-that would not resemble a whole ticket; it is the same size, but different ink. He could have learnt the fate of the ticket at any office in town, without coming to me, and they would have paid him the money for it. I do not know whether the woman can read or not.</p>

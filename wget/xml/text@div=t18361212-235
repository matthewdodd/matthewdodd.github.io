                  </hi>. I live in Titchfield-street, Soho. On Saturday night, the 3rd of December, about one o'clock, I met the prisoner at the corner of New-street, Covent-garden—she addressed me, and after a few minutes' conversation pressed me to accompany her to a house in the neighbourhood of Long-acre, which I did—in about a minute or two after en<lb></lb>tering the room up stairs, she made an excuse to leave, saying she would re<lb></lb>turn in a few minutes—I waited about ten minutes, as she did not come I made my way out of the room, to go home, and put my hand into my pocket, and missed my watch—I had not been there a quarter of an hour altogether—I am sure she is the person—this is the watch, seals, and chain—I was sober—I mentioned it down stairs to the master and mistress who advised me to go to a public-house—I told a policeman—I did not take her till Monday.</p>

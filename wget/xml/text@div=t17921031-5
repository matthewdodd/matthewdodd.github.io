He asked me if I would not then have a drop of gin, I said I did not care; the prisoner called the landlord, Smallwood, bring a quartern of gin, it was brought, and he said to the landlord don't you know me? yes, says the landlord, I know your face very well; says he don't you know I was drunk in your house on Sunday, and I fell over your pump and cut my lip; he pulled down his lip and shewed the mark; I remarked his lip; the landlord and him were talking, and I paid for the gin two pence, and went out: the prisoner had a piece of wood about three quarters of a yard long, and three inches square every way; it appeared to be a joist for flooring, sawed off one way and broke the other; as I was going out of the house he followed me; the landlord said to him, you may as well leave that piece of wood for me to light the fire; he said he would leave it as he came back again; we went out together, I was rather before; I was going towards <placeName id="t17921031-5-crimeloc31">Bow-common</placeName>

I said yes I know you; says he, tell me where; yes, says I, I will tell you; says he, why do you not tell me; I got him out of the narrow part of the ally into Coleman-street, and laid hold of him by the collar, and I said to him you are the man that left me for dead in Stepney-fields, and robbed me; there were two draymen standing, and I charged them in the king's name to assist me; one of them collared him, and asked a boy to fetch a constable; in the course of five minutes he said, d - n you, let me go, I will go to a justice; I took him before Justice Clerk; he denied seeing me; he was committed.</p>
               <p>Court. Now, considering the distance of time ten months, and that this man's life is at stake, can you venture to swear that the prisoner is the man? - Yes, I am perfectly sure; if his head was cut off I should know it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. At the first hearing did not you set it down as an assault? - Upon my oath my first complaint was both an assault and robbery, and the second complaint was the same.</p>

Did you see a certain piece of timber of three inches broad in the hands of the prisoner? - The piece of quartering, of floor joist, he carried it away with him; I asked him to give it me to light the fire; and he said he would give it me when he came back: I never saw it again.</p>

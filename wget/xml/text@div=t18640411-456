I am a carpenter of East Stratford, Stratford New Town—I attended some pleasure grounds in a field near the Eastern Counties Railway, on Easter Monday—I was standing close by the ropes, looking at a race—my watch was in my left-hand waistcoat-pocket, and I saw the prisoner Jacobs take it out, and pass it to Adams—they were almost close together—I seized them both—I did not say anything, that I am aware of—the chain was left, and it fell out of my pocket—I have the bow of the watch, which some one picked up from the ground and gave me.</p>

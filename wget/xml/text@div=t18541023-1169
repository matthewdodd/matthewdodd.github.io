                  </hi>. I am salesman to Mrs. Pearce; she keeps a clothes shop in High-street, Deptford. On 9th Sept. a communication was made to me, in consequence of which I, went to the Lower-road, Deptford—the, prisoner was there; he had a pair of trowsers—I seized him, a scuffle ensued, a constable came up, and I gave him in charge—these trowsers are the property of my mistress; when I took them, they were just as they are, now—there is a ticket on them now, and was when I took them—I cannot say how recently I had seen them safe—I placed them where they were in the morning—this was half past 9 o'clock in the evening—I had been busy all the evening; I had not noticed them—I cannot positively say that he was tipsy; he might have been the worse for liquor—I found him about fifty yards from my mistress's shop.</p>

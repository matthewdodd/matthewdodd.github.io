                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, of 233, Oxford-street; it is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Marylebone. On 16th Oct., about twelve o'clock in the day, I was behind the counter; Rolls opened the shop-door, and said, "Will you come and tell me the price of a bracelet outside?"—he held the door in his hand—nobody else was in the shop—I went out—the tray he pointed to was at the extreme end of the window—I was outside about a minute—as I returned, the prisoner Evans, who was just by the door, asked me the price of a set of studs—he seemed to be inclining from the door, as if he had come from the shop—he was dressed in lighter clothes than he is now—I went behind the counter, and in a minute or two examined the till—nobody was in the shop—I had had about four sovereigns there; I only found three—neither of the prisoners went into the shop, that I saw—I had taken the four sovereigns four or five minutes before, and no customer had been in since—I opened a drawer, where the cash-box was, and missed fifteen out of the seventeen sovereigns from the tray—I had seen them safe about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before the prisoners came, and</p>

                  </hi>. On Tuesday, 16th, Aug., I acted as driver to an omnibus—Evans was conductor that day—we started from the Goose and Gridiron, St. Paul's-churchyard, at twenty minutes to eleven o'clock, and got to our journey's end at half-past one, and he was with me then—he did not leave before we got to Sunbury—I saw him at Hammersmith, when we changed horses at the Duke of Sussex; that was at a quarter to twelve.</p>

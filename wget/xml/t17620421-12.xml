On the 9th of last month, the prisoner came into our shop, and desired me to shew her some lawns. She told me, she came from a customer of ours, Mrs. Broomfield, that lives about five doors from us; and said she would have come herself, but was not well. As she was looking over the pieces, she said she was fearful she should not please her, and desired me to let her carry it to shew her. In about five minutes after she was gone, I missed another piece. I acquainted my master with it, and he sent me to Mrs. Broomfield. and I found she never had sent her. The next day the prisoner was taken up, and before justice Cox confessed the taking the lawn out of my master's shop. [He produced two pieces of lawn.] One she stole, and the other I let her have to carry to shew Mrs. Broomfield.</p>

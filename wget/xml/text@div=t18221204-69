The shop door, which was double locked over night, was open; no violence was used to it. The lock was forced off the till, and about 6 s. worth of copper taken; two drawers in the same room were opened, and this property taken. The prisoner lives directly opposite; and when I came down in the morning, I saw him at his bed-room window looking out, talking to the drayman. He was taken that evening.</p>

            . I am drayman to Messrs. Combe and Company. On the 16th of November I was in Middle-street with my dray, next door to Chapman's. I got there ten minutes after five o'clock, and saw the cellar grating laying across the pavement. I gave no alarm; I thought the house had been robbed. I told the landlord next door of it. I saw a short person standing in a door-way opposite. I do not know who it was. I soon after heard of the robbery. It was dark and wet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Was the short person a man or a woman - A. I cannot say, it was so dark; a boy could lift the grating.</p>

            . I lodge at Chapman's; and came home at half-past ten o'clock. I have a key of the street door; I found it latched; I opened it and made all fast. I did not observe the grating. I went to bed, got up at half-past six o'clock to go to work, and found the door still fastened, but the grating removed, and the cellar and shop doors open, which were closed when I went to bed. I called Chapman. My father came home just before me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How is the cellar door fastened - A. I saw it was latched that night. The iron grating was not fastened inside. It weighs about 1/2 a cwt.</p>

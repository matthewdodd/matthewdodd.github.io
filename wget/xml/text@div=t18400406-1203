                  </hi>. I am a camel-hair-pencil-maker, and live in King's-row, Cambridge-road, Mile-end. On Sunday afternoon the 25th of February, I was passing over the City-of-Paris-bridge in Bishop Bon<lb></lb>ner's fields, with my brother and several others—my brother and I were walking together—we met the prisoner with two other men—the prisoner had a gun in his hand, and was saying to some young men standing close by, "Stand out any of you and I will fire at you"—hearing him say that, I held up my hand, pointed to a hole in my glove, and said, "Here is a hole in my glove, fire at that"—I was about three yards from him—he had not said any thing to me—he put the gun up to fire at me—I said, "That is too near"—then be went further back, about twelve yards altogether—I did not retreat from him at all—I then turned round with my back towards him, stooped down, and told him to fire at that, meaning my——he did not fire then—I then turned round again, held up my hand, and pointing to the hole in my glove, told him to fire at it—he then put the gun up to his shoulder and fired at me—he raised it about half-a-minute, or a minute, before he fired—I stood all that time with my hand up—the shot entered my right eye, and I have lost the sight of it—I bled a great deal, and received a great many shots, in all about a hundred, in my hand and arms, and a few in my face—I cannot tell whether he saw that he had hit me—</p>

               <p>when I received the wound I did not cry out—I stood—somebody held me up, or I should have fallen—I did not hear him say any thing—he seemed to say some words exultingly, and then turned round and went from me—I went after him when I recovered a little, and said, "Why did you shoot me?"—he said, "Oh, it is only dust-shot"—the two young men, the pri<lb></lb>soner, I and my companions, then all went over the bridge together—he took off my handkerchief, and wiped the blood from under my eye, and said, "Oh, you are not hurt much, I see"—we then went on about three hun<lb></lb>dred yards—he then gave up the gun to one of the other young men who said something to him—he said, in answer, "Oh, I knew it was loaded, but it was only dust shot"—I afterwards said, "If you are any thing of a man you will come to a doctor's with me—when we got to the City-of<lb></lb>Paris public-house, the man with the gun went away—I, the prisoner, and another young man went up to the end of the pathway and the other young man then left—I and the prisoner were together with my two companions—we went to see a doctor, but he was not at home—before that I sent my brother to look for a policeman—after standing outside the doctor's about ten minutes the prisoner said he wanted to go borne, and if we wanted him we were to come to his house for him, and he would tell us where he lived—I said I could not leave him—I believe he told me where he lived, but I do not recollect where it was—we then crossed the street, and stood on the other side—we went to the Rising Sun public-house, at the corner of Globe-lane—we waited outside either ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—he then wanted to go home—several people standing round said I must not let him go—we then went up to Bethnal-green church—there the policeman and my brother came up, and I gave him in charge—we then went up to several doctor's, who were not at home—we then went to the station-house, and Dr. Storey took about forty shots from my right arm, he examined my eye, and sent me to the hospital, where I have been ever since.</p>

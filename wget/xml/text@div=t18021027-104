               <p>ATKIN PHILLIPS sworn. - I keep the Magpie and Horseshoe in Burleigh-street; the prosecutor and prisoner lodged with me, the prisoner for about six months, he is a porter: on the night of the 26th of October they were drinking together in the taproom about three hours, several others were with them in the course of the time; I wanted the prosecutor to go to bed about twelve o'clock, but he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270086"></xptr>would not, as he was in liquor; the prisoner was more sober than him; as I had got every body else to bed, I gave the prisoner a bit of candle and told him to help the prosecutor; I went to bed and left them alone; between two and three o'clock I heard a noise, and the prosecutor said he had been robbed; I know nobody was there but the prosecutor and him, and thought it was the effect of liquor, therefore I would not get up; between eight and nine in the morning the prosecutor said he was robbed, upon which I went up to the prisoner in his own room in bed, and asked him if he knew any thing of the man's money; he said he did not; I said I must be under the necessity of sending for a constable to search him; he said I might if I pleased; I fetched a constable, and his room was searched, but nothing found there; he was taken to Bow-street; he did not seem to wish to get away, but sat himself down very quiet till the office came.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prosecutor changing a note? - A. Yes, in the early part of the evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was drinking with the prosecutor and two soldiers till about half past two, and Mr. Phillips desired I would see the prosecutor to bed; before we two left the tap-room he was very much agitated, and fancied he saw his mother stand before him, and attempted to shake hands with her, but when he had lost her he went into a sort of hysterical sit for about a minute or so, and his eyes run over with water; I got him as far as the stairs and he was taken in the same manner, exclaiming, "Oh, my mother!" he said, that although he knew she was dead, he had been four hours on his knees in hopes he might see her again; then he began to pray to himself, and I begged him to go to bed, saying I would say prayers for him; I got him to bed and fetched my prayer-book, and read two or three evening prayers to him; I was going for a candle and he begged me not to leave him; I went for the candle and returned again instantly, but before I entered the door he called to me "where is my small cloaths;" I entered the room and pointed my finger to the floor, saying, there they lay; he said, give them to me; I did so; he pulled out his notes and counted them over and his cash, he then said he had been robbed of two or three guineas and two or three notes; I said I knew nothing of it; he said I must, for nobody else had been there; I wished him to search me, but he would not, only said he would take me to Bow-street next morning; he went to Phillips but he would not get up, as he did not believe him; in the morning they sent for an officer; I never attempted to get out of the house, which I might have done had I been guilty. <rs id="t18021027-104-verdict583" type="verdictDescription">

The prisoner came into my house whit another man on 20th Jan.—I think it was a little after twelve o'clock—the train was very late that night—I heard my larder door slam to and the prisoner left my house—he was brought back by the policeman, with this place of ham, which had been in the larder a few minutes before I heard the door slam.</p>

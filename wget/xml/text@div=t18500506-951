                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist. On the afternoon of 6th April, I was in Swan-street, Whitechapel. it is narrow at the end nearest to Man-sell-street; it widens for about twenty yards; then it narrows, then it is wide in the middle, then it narrows again—the narrow part is just wide enough for one cart; the wide part for two—I saw two wagons in the broad part in a line, one behind the other—it was a wagon and a cart, I think—I did not know either of the drivers—I think the wagon had three horses—I saw a truck drawn by the prisoner meeting the wagon—the prisoner could have passed those wagons as they stood still—he did not make any attempt to pass them—he refused—he stood still—the driver of the back cart spoke very civilly to him—he said, "Why don't you move your truck on, there is plenty of room"—the prisoner, addressing both the men, for both of them came up, said, "I shall not move unless you back your wagon," speaking to the deceased—the deceased said, "There is no occasion for me to back, there is plenty of room," and asked him to bring his truck forward—the prisoner said, "I shall not move at all"—the driver of the back cart went and said, "You are a silly boy; there is plenty of room to pass; if you won't move the truck, will you let me move it?"—the prisoner said, "No, you shall not put a hand on my truck; I shall not go on the pavement, the commissioners of police will not lot me"—the driver of the back cart then said, "If you won't move your truck, I will," and he and the deceased both laid their hands on it—the prisoner struck the man who had the hinder cart, and then the</p>

               <p>deceased, who had his whip in his hand, and his other hand on the truck—he could not help himself, the blow knocked him down under the wagon, and the horses, by some misadventure, moved at the time—his body he managed to get away, but left his left foot under the wheel—he got up and limped away on one foot only, and sat down at a door—a gentleman helped him into his cart, and took him to the station—the prisoner was given in charge—I saw the deceased next day at the London Hospital—I afterwards saw his body on the 18th—it was the body of Thomas Copperthwaite—I am sure that neither of the carmen struck the prisoner first—there was room for the truck to have passed on the carriage way, and eight inches to spare.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">hand<lb></lb>ing a plan to the witness</hi>). <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is not like it at all—I have not measured the street—the wagons were coming from Mansell-street—the entrance to Swan-street is wide—the street would not admit but one carriage, except at that opening—the deceased was driving a large covered wagon like an old East India wagon—his was the first wagon—he was at his horses' head—the part where his wagon was, is eighteen or nineteen feet wide—he did not go in the narrow part—the prisoner's truck was just at the junction of the wide and narrow part—the prisoner's truck was moved out of the way of the horses by the deceased and the other man—I do not believe it was placed on the pave-ment—the wagon was not driven up as far as it could go—the horses' heads were just in the narrow part, but the wagon was not—they used no expression of a more offensive nature than "silly boy"—I thought they behaved very discreetly for carmen—the men seized hold of the handle of the truck—one of the wheels of it was not on the pavement, it was close to the pavement—they did not lift it on the pavement—that street is very great nuisance—not a day passes but there are three or four fights in it—there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> this morning, and one yesterday—I have never complained about the street—I have never been in a Court of Justice before—there was not the slightest necessity that the truck should go on the pavement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman in the employ of Pickford and Co.—I was in Swan-street on 6th April—I drove one of my employers' carts—I was following Copperthwaite—I had known him nine years—my horses were close to the tail of his wagon—he had to stop, as one of the chains of his har<lb></lb>ness broke; I helped him to mend it—in the mean time the prisoner came down with his truck, and put the handle down, because he thought he could not get through—I could have brought it through—he had been cautioned at the other end of the street by the policeman, who threatened to take him to the green-yard if he took his truck on the pavement—I asked him to let me draw it through—he said he would not—several penons round said, "Let the carman take it," but he said he would not let it be touched—Cop<lb></lb>perthwaite and another man took hold of the truck, and the prisoner took hold of it—there was a struggle—the men carried it about four yards—they took it over the post, and put it on the footpath—Copperthwaite and the other man took hold of it, and were lifting it on the path—Copperthwaite was getting it round the other side of the post, and that was where the struggle was—they were getting it round on the pavement—the noise of the people and the truck made the horses move—I did not see it put down on the pave<lb></lb>ment—I did not see Copperthwaite and the prisoner scuffling together—I saw Copperthwaite lying in the road: how he came there I do not know—I ran to stop the horses, and snatched his head on one side, which was near the forewheel, and in struggling to get up, his foot got under the wheel—he did not do anything to the prisoner—the horses were standing still when the scuffle began.</p>

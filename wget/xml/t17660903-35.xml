I said, what do you ask for him? he said 20 s.

My man was going towards Mr. Jones's, I would have had him went with my man, but he would not; I secured him and the horse, and ordered my man to enquire. When he came back, he said he could hear of no such person as Reiley; I kept him all night, then I sent him in a cart to Old Ford: my man returned, and said the prisoner confessed going along, that he stole the horse, and whose it was; then I sent the prisoner and the horse to the prosecutor: (it was a blind horse.)</p>

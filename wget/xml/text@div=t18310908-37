            . I am the wife of Henry Fynes Clinton - we live in Dean's-yard; the prisoner was in my husband's employ for fifteen months. On the 4th of August I delivered him a cheque for 16l., to take to the banker's, and get it changed; this is the cheque - he went away with it; I did not see him again till he was in custody about a week after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Where was he to take this cheque? A. To Duckett's; he conducted himself well - we thought highly of him.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Abingdon-street. I have known the prisoner some time; I received this cheque from Bryan, and gave him 16l. for it - I paid it away in the course of business, and it came back to me; I have no doubt this is the cheque - here is my name on the back of it, but not in my writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then how do you know it? A. I have not the least doubt of it; there is no mark of mine on it.</p>

            . I received this cheque from the prisoner last month, but I cannot tell the day, it was about ten o'clock in the morning; he told me to get it cashed for him at Mr. Lambert's - I went there, and got cash for it; the prisoner told me to go because he was busy, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080034"></xptr>would take it as a favour - I gave him the money I got for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. A plasterer - the prisoner gave me this at the Crown, in Tufton-street.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I took the prisoner at his lodgings, in Vine-street, Westminster, on the 7th of August - he said he was very glad I had come for him, as he had come back on purpose to be taken; I found 1l. 16s. on him.</p>
               <p>DANIEL BRYAN. I gave the prisoner the money at the Crown; I think the Crown is further from the prosecutor's than Mr. Lambert's is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it in the same direction? A. No; he must have returned near Mr. Clinton's to have got to Mr. Lambert's.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

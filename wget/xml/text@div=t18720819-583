                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, of Brunswick Court, Ber<lb></lb>mondsey—about 12.30 or 12.45 on the morning of 25th July I was on Tower Hill—the prisoner and five or six other persons came up, and one of them asked me for a penny to get some tobacco—I refused, and one of them struck me and knocked me down—I got up, and was immediately knocked down again—I was knocked down three times—the third time the prisoner caught hold of me by the handkerchief, and dragged it from my neck—I was in my shirt-sleeves—in the scuffle my waistcoat was pulled off; I can't say who did it—I can swear the prisoner took the handkerchief from me, because I grasped him and looked him full in the face—I let go of him, and ran away home—I gave information to the policeman, but not that night—I had been to the Sun public-house on Tower Hill, and this occurred about forty yards from the Sun—I was perfectly sober—on the morning of 27th July I was in Billingsgate, and saw the prisoner there wearing my waist<lb></lb>coat—I said "That is my waistcoat"—he said "If it is, you had better take it"—he threw it on the ground, and I picked it up—he said he picked it up in the scuffle—when the men came up I was talking to a man; he was not a friend of mine—I could find him at Billingsgate—I have been to the market several times, but have not seen him—I had left my coat in the stable where I work—I lost 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., my hat, and silk handkerchief, besides the waistcoat</p>

               <p>—the prisoner did not say to me "What has become of my waistcoat," or that he had lost his—I believe he said it to the policeman—I have seen the prisoner in Billingsgate before—he offered me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to <hi rend="italic">square</hi> it, but I said I would do nothing of the kind.</p>

On the morning of 27th July I was on duty in Little Tower Street—about 3.30 in the afternoon Shackle-ford came up and said "I give this man in custody for stealing my waist<lb></lb>coat, neckhandkerchief, hat, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on Tower Hill last Tuesday morning," and that they had knocked him about very much—the prisoner said that he was there, and it was a drunken <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—he offered him all the money he had, and said that he had lost his own waistcoat and had picked this one up.</p>

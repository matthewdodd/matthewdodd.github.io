                  </hi>. I live at Tanner's-hill, Deptford. I have lived with the prisoner two years—we are not married. On the 12th of June he came home between eleven and twelve very drunk indeed—I never saw him so drunk—I began to <hi rend="italic">blow</hi> him up because he had spent some money—I <hi rend="italic">blowed</hi> him up very much indeed, and after I had done so some time he hit me with his fist in my face—it left no mark—I went to bed—I had no candle or fire—he was not in bed—I <hi rend="italic">blowed</hi> him up again very violently indeed, and then I felt a cut on my arm—I screamed out, and went out of the house into another person's house—the cut does not affect me at all—it is quite well now—there was a little chopper in the house—I had not seen it for a week, not having occasion to use it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live next door but one to the prisoner. On the night of the 12th of June I heard cries of "Murder," and went into his apartment—the door was open—Wright was lying on the bed—I persuaded her to come into my room—she held up her hand, and I said, "O, Mary, look at the blood"—when the policeman came into the room with a light I found her arm was cut.</p>

            . He asked me to go with them to be married to the corner of Fleet-lane. They left a box at my house, and returned again soon after. He is 17 years of age, and she is 22, as they said. They went to bed about a quarter after ten on Sunday night. There was a woman that lay on the same floor came down stairs and followed the prisoner between two and three on Monday morning, who came into my room, awaked me, and said, that the prisoner told her he had killed his wife. Before I had struck a light I heard him say so, he was at my bed's feet. I asked how he could talk so; he said he had almost cut her head off. My wife lighted a match, and I saw the blood run off his arm to his breeches; he was bloody as high as his elbow. I made my wife lock the door while I called the constable. When I came back he was sitting where I left him. We carried him to the Roundhouse. When we returned we went up into his room, and there lay his wife on her back on the floor, with her face on one side near the chimney ; her throat was cut, her head almost off, and a bloody knife was lying in the window. She was quite dead, dressed all but her bodice, cap and apron.</p>

I gave them a piece of candle. Then the constable and Undershill came back, and I went with them up two pair of stairs, where I saw a woman lying on the floor, one hand upon her breast, and her head almost cut off. The prisoner told them he had left the knife in the window, where I found it.</p>

I went and found the prisoner sitting in the house, his right arm and left knee were both covered with fresh blood. He told me he had killed his wife; that he would very willingly die for her, because he loved her. He told me the knife was in the window in the same room. After I came from the Round-house, I went up and saw her lying on her back among blood in the condition as has been mentioned.</p>

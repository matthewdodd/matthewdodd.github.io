               <p>How happens it that you appear so bruised? - By the people of the house, at the Seven Stars; I was there on the Monday; I saw the two prisoners come in; and this quarrel was because I was to come on this trial; they said for a pot of beer I would swear either way; I was very much affronted, for I would not state any thing but the truth; the landlord beat me, and said he would murder me; it was understood I was to come here in favour of the prisoners; the money was weighed before I came in; I was in coloured clothes; the prisoners came in about five minutes afterwards, they did not even sit down in the house, the prisoners asked the Turk about the petition; the Turk told him to go about his business; the prisoner told the Turk he was no Turk, that he was a beggar, at which the Turk was very much enraged; he stood up, and put his hand to his knife, for he had a knife, or something of that sort tucked into his girdle; when the Turk stood up, the prisoner said, what are you gong to stab me with your knife, and he said no, I will not stab you with my knife, but I will beat you with my stick; then the prisoner struck him several times, and he struck the prisoners, and tore all his shirt collar clean off.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the Turk spoke in plain English? - So plain that I could understand him; there was no money on the table at this time; he had a fine gold laced purse at his girdle, whether he had any money in it I cannot say; there was no-money seen at all while the prisoners were in the house, nor while I was there; after they had been fighting, that tall French woman came down, and said they are blackguards, they are thieves, they want to rob you, swear they have robbed you; one of the Turks jumped out of the window, and soon after the constable came, they were not searched; the Turks made no charge of their robbing them, only of the assault.</p>
               <p>If they had taken up any money at that time from the table, should you have seen it? - Oh, yes, but there was no money taken, nor any seen while I was there; the tall woman is frequently there.</p>
               <p>What is she? - A common prostitute in that part; there were six or seven of them beating me; the mistress of the house is an old woman, and a foreigner, and the landlord is a young man that the old woman keeps; he does not speak French; I have been quartered there three weeks unfortunately.</p>

               <p>I had been with a letter, and I met my fellow prisoner, and we went to this house, and these Turkish gentlemen were sitting there, and I asked them how they did, and they d - d me; I said you did not d - n me the other day when you came with a petition to Lord Spencer, and I suppose you are angry I would not take it in; they had a target apiece at their side; the Turk seized me, and struck my fellow prisoner with a dagger; there was no money nor scales, or any thing of the kind on the table; the constable searched me by my desire; I had only two farthings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Kelly, a labourer, and live in Sun-court, Milton-street—in March last I lived in Pump-court, Golden-lane, On the 20th of May I was confined—on the Monday following, the 25th, the pri<lb></lb>soner came to see me—I had a half-crown, a shilling, a sixpence, and the dupli<lb></lb>cate of a counterpane, on my table—the prisoner noticed them to me—I wanted to send for my mother to go to the pawnbroker's for the counterpane—the pri<lb></lb>soner said she would bring it; that she was going with her husband's dinner to the Curtain-road, and the pawnbroker's was quite handy to it—I said I would rather not trouble her—she said she would go—she took up the money and ticket, and went—she never returned with the money or counterpane, but next day she gave the ticket to my little girl in the street—I did not per<lb></lb>severe very hard against her taking it, as she was a neighbour, and thinking her an honest woman that would not take advantage of me—a fortnight after<lb></lb>wards I went to her, and asked her for the money—she said she had had the misfortune to spend it, and she had nothing to give me that Saturday night—she has never come to me with any since—I thought when she took it that she intended to take the counterpane out, but she told me she fell into some company, and spent the money.</p>

               <p>GEORGE SARGEANT. I am in partnership with William Gunston, and live at No. 84, High-street, Marylebone, and am a cheesemonger. I know the prisoner—he has been in the habit of attending my shop—on the 6th of January I saw him, and asked him if he wanted a piece of bacon—I do not know the answer he made, but I watched him, and saw him take a bit of bacon, and put it to his nose—I went into the shop, and saw him walk off with it—I followed him, and saw his putting it into his basket—I then followed him, and said I wanted in—he said, "What for?"—I said I wanted what he had got in his basket—he said he had nothing—I said, "You have a bit of bacon"—he said he had not—I said he must come back, and then he said he was coming back to pay for it—before the Magistrate he said he was going to speak to a friend across the road, who had called him—this is the bacon.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I live at No. 4, Duke's-court, Drury lane.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you first acquainted with the prisoner? - A. On the 8th of January last, I went to him at No. 6, Lovell's-court, Paternoster-row; I told him that I was informed by a person that he dealt in cards; he said he did, but he had but one pack; he let me have them; they were put up in white paper, I gave him two shillings for them; there were fifty-two in the pack, and the ace of spades I think was with them; I saw him afterwards on the 11th at the same place, and I told him I wanted a dozen packs; he took me to a house in Butcherhall-lane, where he knocked at the door; a girl answered the door, and she asked him if his name was Isaac; he said, yes; he asked for a parcel that was left for him, and she gave him the parcel without any more questions.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you know what it contained? - A. Yes, a dozen packs of cards; he then delivered them to me, and I paid him twenty-three shillings for them; I told him I was going out of town at that time, and requested his directions, which he gave me, and it is now on the directions of one of the parcels.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Look into that parcel, and see whether it is now as it was when it was delivered to you, and whether the aces of spades are not in a separate parcel to that? - A. Yes, it is; they correspond in number to them, but they are in separate parcels; I think I saw him again on the 17th in Lovell's-court; I applied to him then for two packs; I then went with him again to Butcherhall-lane; he asked for Mr. Knipe; they said he was not there; then he said he must go to the office; he took me with him to the Bull and Mouth inn; he desired me to wait in the street; he went into the inn, and brought the two packs to me, all but the aces of spades; he said he must go and get the aces of spades; then I went with him to the house of Mr. Read, in Hosier-lane, a cloth-presser; after he had been in a little time, he called to me, while I was waiting in the street; I went in and paid him there two shillings a pack for them, and there I received the aces. On the 29th I saw him again in Lovell's-court; he took me again to Butcherhall-lane, and there I saw Mr. Knipe; he asked for two packs of cards, and Mr. Knipe handed him out two parcels of cards, which he gave me. I saw him again on the 6th of February in Lovell's-court; I applied for two dozen then; these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the aces of spades made up in a separate parcel, and correspond in number to the two dozen packs - open them? - A. Yes, they are; I paid him forty-five shillings for them; I saw they were in separate parcels after I got home; I had before observed the name of Hart being on the aces; I mentioned it to him; the reason of my observation to him was, because he had told me they were French cards; he told me that was an illusion, they were French cards.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the price of a pack of cards now, or at the time you bought these? - A. Four shillings a pack.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You mean the fair price with the duty? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. In consequence of information, you went on purpose to purchase these cards? - A. Yes; I saw him again on the 16th of February, I went for two dozen; I went to the Bull and Mouth inn with him; I saw Knipe there; Maydwell said then he would get three dozen, and leave them with Mr. Knipe for me, as he was going out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. He made an appointment with you on the 3d of March? - A. He was to meet me at the house of Mr. Pocock, No. 43, Eagle-street; I had told him that was my lodgings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had not been acquainted with him prior to the month of January - it was only then that you were taken into this awkward service? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You depend upon the bounty of the Stamp-office? - A. No bounty at all; I expect to be paid for my time and trouble.</p>

               <p>Q. Are they constantly delivered in this form, twenty in a sheet? - A. Yes, never in any other way; I knew Hart very well, he ceased card-making on the 13th of November, 1797; he failed, and I was in possession of all his duty aces that were at his manufactory, and I brought them to the Office.</p>

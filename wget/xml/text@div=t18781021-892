I am a clerk in the Court of Bankruptcy—I produce the file of proceedings in the prisoner's bankruptcy—the petition was filed on 17th July, 1877—the act of bankruptcy was the failure to answer a debtors' summons, and there was an order made for substituted service dated 24th September—the names of the petitioning creditors are Edward William Brydges, William Edward Sheppard, and William A. C. P. Williams for 201<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. unpaid acceptance—there is a notice to dispute the adjudication filed on 2nd October, 1877, signed James Millward—the adjudication is dated 21st November, 1877—on 4th December, Mr. William Waddell, accountant, of 11, Queen Victoria Street, City, was appointed trustee—a statement of affairs was filed on 3rd January, in which the unsecured debts are stated at 4,168<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., altered to 3, 768<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., creditors fully secured 15, 900., the only asset is book debts 350. described as due from William Glenn, under a bill of sale of furniture at Esher—there is a registrar's order of9th February, 1878, directing a cash account for the six months preceding the adjudication—I find a copy of that account—on the paying out side there is in October, "Mr. Lywood repaid loan 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," also a payment to Pope on account of debt and interest 145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also find requisi<lb></lb>tions ordered to be made to the bankrupt, and answers to those requisitions—the date of the order to prosecute is 4th September this year.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Whateley and Co, Solicitors, of 41, Waterloo Street, Birmingham—we were solicitors to the late Charles Millward, who died in Septemberlast year—under his will the prisoner became entitled to a legacy of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 17th September, 1877,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187810210094"></xptr>
               <p>I wrote this letter to the prisoner informing him of the legacy, and about 3rd October I received instructions to forward him a cheque for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I did, and in due course received an acknowledgment from him dated the 4th—on 15th October he called at our office in Birmingham, and wanted to have his money at soon as possible paid in London to his wife to complete a purchase—he did not say a word about there being a petition in bank<lb></lb>ruptcy against him, he left this receipt for the full amount of the legacy—on the following day I wrote to him and received this reply; "27th October, 1877.—My dear Sir, Thank you for your letter, any time will suit me to meet you in town "—on 27th October he came to the office of our. London agents in Chancery Lane, and I then paid him 1, 219<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>; he asked for cash, but I mistrusted his memory, and gave him a draft on the London Joint Stock Bank dated 26th October.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Dear Millward,—It appears I am likely to be treated in a manner like every one who befriends you.

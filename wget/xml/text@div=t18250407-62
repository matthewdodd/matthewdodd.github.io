I saw the prisoner in our shop on the 5th of March, about five o'clock; I showed her a gown, but she did not buy anything - she then left the shop; I had not missed any thing, but I followed her to the door, and saw her just getting up from stooping; I went back to see if I had lost anything, and missed a piece of Irish, which I had seen safe while she was in the shop; it was close by her on the same counter. I told the young man, and he went out after her - I went out soon afterwards, and met him and the prisoner in Warwick-street, two doors from my master's shop; I went for a constable; the Irish has not been found - it cost 2 s. 2 d. a yard.</p>

            . I work for the Gas Company at Westminster. I was looking in at this shop window, and saw the prisoner come out of the shop and pass by me behind, and drop a piece of linen - it appeared to me to be about fourteen or fifteen yards - there was no one with her. I said,</p>
               <p>"My dear, you have dropped it:" she said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have;" she then picked it up and walked on; it was plain Irish linen. Gay came out to me and made some inquiries - I told him what I had seen; she was then in sight, but not in hearing. Gay returned to the shop, and another person came out and followed the prisoner, who had then turned the corner; I followed him to Warwick-street, and saw him questioning her; I did not then see any linen with her; there were several persons by, and the shopman had hold of her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. When the linen fell on the ground, was she behind you? A. Yes, I told Gay what I had seen - he followed her immediately, and brought her back. I did not see her searched - she was searched by Mr. Hawkes' sister, in the back-room; she denied knowing any thing about it.</p>

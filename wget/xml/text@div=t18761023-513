                  </hi>. I live at 50, Glenarm Road, Hackney—I am the tenant of the house, the rent is 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I have a wife and three children, the eldest is eight and the youngest two years and <hi rend="italic">two</hi> months—there are eight rooms in the house—the kitchen is on the ground floor and there are merely cellars in the basement—there are three rooms on the ground floor, kitchen, sitting-room, and parlour, without reckoning the scullery—there is a fore court facing the street—I occupy the ground floor and sleep with my family on the second floor, which is the top of the house—the first floor contains a sitting-room and two—bedrooms, all which the prisoner occupied, and used the back one as a kitchen—he had no servant, nor had I on the night in question I shut up the house myself, the front and back doors were fast and also the parlour shutters—the prisoner's wife was confined about four weeks before the fire, and she had been away from the house about a fortnight at her father's—after seeing the house securely fastened I followed my wife upstairs and we went to bed about 11.45—the children were already in bed—I heard the prisoner go up to bed about the same time, in fact we all went within two minutes—I had seen the staircase and mats before I went to bed, they were all perfectly safe and there was no paraffin oil on them—I just opened the dining-room door to see that the shutters <hi rend="italic">were</hi> closed and I smelt no oil—I went to sleep with the door open and was awoke by the prisoner calling me; he gave the alarm that the house was on fire—I took my trowsers off a chair, went to the landing, and found smoke coming up the stairs—I dropped my trowsers and went and rescued the children—I was sleeping in the first bed-room and the baby was sleeping in the same bed, the other children were in the back room, there is a door from the bed-room to the landing, and when I came from one room to the other I saw the prisoner outside the window on the top of the kitchen—he had his shirt and trowsers on, but I cannot say whether he had a coat,</p>

               <p>he had no boots-we escaped through that window—he got out first and gave assistance to us, had it not been for his assistance we could not have escaped at all-we could not get down from there, but we broke a window and got into the next house, and he fetched the fire engines—the firemen forced the back door and got in—when I got into the house there was a flickering of light out he mat by the parlour door and the stair carpets had the appearance of oil on them, the stairs were charred and the carpets also, but the wood work was not burnt through—I was shown a bowl, a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards, which smelt of paraffin oil; it did not belong to me, but I had one which was in its usual place in the wash-house—I have been insured in the London, Liverpool, and Globe for seven or eight years for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fireman belonging to the Metropolitan Brigade, stationed at Hackney—on 9th September, at 1.44 a.m, the prisoner came to the station in a very unconcerned manner and said that his house was on fire.—while we were getting the engine ready he said that his wife and children</p>

               <p>were all right, he had got them out-we started from the station three or four minutes afterwards and he wrode a on the engine—when we got to the corner of Glenarm Road I saw some firemen's lamps and said "The volun<lb></lb>teers are there, I think"—the prisoner said that he thought the house would have been burnt down by that time—I saw Dupree outside and the police—I could not discern any fire from the outside—we got in by going the next house and into the back yard and over the wall-Dupree showed us the way—the first door was locked and bolted' and the shutters also; the back door was bolted and I had to burst it in, carrying away the bolt—after going into Dupree's kitchen I began to smell paraffin and other oil which I took to be boiled oil, and the two mats were alight—on opening the back parlour door I discovered a large amount of oil strewed all over the carpet which was just alight with a flickering flame all over the top of it and open<lb></lb>ing the door blew it out—there was so much oil that I could scoop it up in a handfull—the stair carpet on the first floor was saturated and part of it was burnt through—I asked Dupree and the prisoner how they accounted for it—they both said that they did not know how it came there—after the engineer took Dupree's particulars of insurance the prisoner said that he was insured, and I was ordered upstairs by the engineer to show the pri<lb></lb>soner a light to get his receipt or policy—I went to a bedroom, and the first thing I saw was a cash-box on the drawers—the prisoner stated that there was nothing there of any consequence as his wife had got everything away with her—after some time he opened the cash-box and produced a receipt for the policy and said that he did not know where the policy was, it was mislaid, or his wife had got it—I examined the bed, there was no impression of anybody lying there, the bed clothes were just thrown, back and the pillow had a slight indenture in it—I asked the prisoner how he could account for the fire—he said that he heard a noise on the landing, a rumbling, like something being thrown downstairs, and he jumped up, dis<lb></lb>covered the fire, rushed for a jug of water and threw it down the stairs—I found a pint jug lying at the bottom of the stairs burnt both inside and out—this tin bowl (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was quite wet with paraffin and it had about half a gill left in it, it was outside the window—I asked the prisoner if he knew whose bowl it was and how he could account for it being there—he said that he did not know who it belonged to or whether it was his or not—I found a bowl in the sink which Mr. Dupree said was his, it contained two or three pocket handkerchiefs in water which looked as if they had been put in soak over night—I found a shawl outside on the slates, and this can in the prisoner's kitchen, with oil running down it, aud alongside of it a gallon can, which is not here, it was quite dry and I could not discern that anything had been it—this other tin I found in the kitchen cupboard quite empty and wet, the cork was alongside it—I asked the prisoner if they were his cans—he said "Yes," he brought them there every night—I asked him whether he used oil on the premises—he said "No," only at his place of business—he did not complain of having lost anything when I was in his bedroom, he told me he had nothing there of any consequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He had no shoes on—I did not see him help to put the horses into the engine—I left him outside the front of the house when I went in—I saw a fireman take the bowl from the slates immediately under the window from which they escaped—the house is over half a mile from the fire engine station, and under three-quarters—I should put this down as ordinary paint oil—this shawl (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was lying on the staircase.</p>

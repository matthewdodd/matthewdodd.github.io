                  </hi>. I am colonel of the 68th Regiment—on, I think, the 18th June I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> which I answered—on the 19th I went to the address given, King's Head Yard, Borough, and on going into the yard saw the prisoner, and asked him if the</p>

               <p>advertisement applied to his horses, and if it was all true, he said, yes, that he had been in charge of them fifteen months, and they were perfectly sound in all respects, that there had never been a day's sickness or any<lb></lb>thing wrong with them—I had them taken out—Turner then came in, and Rowe said that he was the owner, and would deal with me—the prisoner said that they were perfectly sound, and nothing had ever been wrong with them, that he had them from the breeder, that one had been used as a charger, and that they were perfectly quiet in harness—he asked 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—I gave him 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said I would come next day and pay him—my brother-in-law, who was with me, said, "I will pay him," and we did so at Glyn and Company's—next morning I went to Mr. Stevens, a veterinary surgeon, who immediately he saw them pronounced them both unsound—the prisoner said that he would punch his ugly <hi rend="italic">mug</hi> if he pinched his master's horses about—it took me two hours to get them examined—the prisoner became very excited and most abusive to Mr. Stevens—I asked him where the old man was who was to return the money if I did not like the horses—(he was to warrant them—when I went to the bank I pushed Turner a piece of paper, to write the warranty—the prisoner was not present)—I had made an arrangement for him to meet me at Waterloo Station half an hour before the train started, to get the warranty and have the horses examined; but I went back and told him not to send them to Waterloo, but to have Mr. Turner to meet me next morning—I got to the house about 11.30, and asked the prisoner about Turner—he said that he had gone to Brighton to see a sick child—I asked him if he had got the warranty—he said, no, but it would be all right—I saw at once that I had been done, and went to the police.</p>

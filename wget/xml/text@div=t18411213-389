                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Martin, and live in Crown-street, Greenwich. On the 10th of December I sent my little boy on an errand—I afterwards heard a loud talking below stairs, and heard a slap—I saw my child crying on the stairs, and in consequence of what be told me I went down, and asked the prisoner why she struck the child—she said she would serve me the same, and with that she struck me with the dust-shovel, which she had in her hand—this now produced is it—it was without a handle, as it is now—she struck me over the left eye, and the mark I now have is the effect of the blow—she only struck me once, it was a very hard blow, and bled a great deal—I had not raised my hand towards her—I then seized the shovel—her son came and wrenched it out of my hand, and said he would serve me the same, if I hit his mother—I had not made any attempt to strike her with it—I had it in my hand, and I told her I would show it to the Magistrate—Mrs. Webb came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. She says I struck her child; I am too fond of children to do so, and I have endeavoured to teach hers in the way it should go—she is a fortune-teller, and she teaches the child to sneak up stairs, and insult me because I am an aged woman, and a Christian—she struck me, and knocked me down. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not—it is all false—I had not the least inten<lb></lb>tion to strike you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. She has threatened me these four months—she ran down two pairs of stairs to beat me, and struck me several times—she snatched the old tin thing out of my hand, and, being drunk, she pitched on it, and cot her eye. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I was not drunk, nor did I pitch on it, or cut my ye.</p>

                  </hi>. I live down stairs in the same house with the prosecutrix, and go out to work. On the 10th of December, Mrs. Martin came down to know why the prisoner struck her child—the prisoner instantly said, if she concerned herself about that she would serve her the same—she imme<lb></lb>diately fetched her a blow with the dust-pan on the right temple—there was a great deal of blood—I washed it off as well as I could—it was a severe wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Her name is not Webb, it is Friend. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. That was my second father's name, but my own is Webb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. She told me her name was Friend at the time she was confined with a second child, and several neighbours assisted her, to see that she should not make away with the child—she swore at Green<lb></lb>wich she was a married woman—if you knew as much as I did, the house would be indicted—they have owed me a prejudice some time—I think she says the blood spirted out—if it did it must have sprinkled over me, and I have the same cap on now—they were all tipsy—I was beaten down to the ground. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Not that I saw—I saw no one strike, or attempt to strike her—I only came to speak to the truth, to tell what I saw—I have no enmity against her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in this house. On the 10th of December, I was outside the door, and saw the prisoner with a dust-pan in her hand—Mrs. Martin went to ask her what she hit her child for, and before she could hardly get the words out, the prisoner <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with the dust-pan, and cut her in the eye—the blood instantly flowed—I and Mrs. Webb wiped it off—the prisoner's son came down, took up the shovel, and went to hit Mrs. Martin, but we got before him—Mrs. Martin did not attempt to strike the prisoner, or lift her hand to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. This poor young woman was up in a front-room, so that she saw nothing of it <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I live in the front-room, but I followed Mrs. Martin down, when she went to ask the prisoner why she hit her child—the child had come up crying, and said Mrs. Fletcher had hit him—I cer<lb></lb>tainly did see the prisoner strike Mrs. Martin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Greenwich. I examined the prosecutrix's wound—it was a deeply incised wound over the left temple, about a quarter of an inch deep—I believe it penetrated to the bone, and was about an inch and a quarter, or an inch and a half in length—I think it was such a wound as this shovel would make—I think it would require considerable violence to effect such a wound with that shovel—here is blood on the corner of it, at the part which I think most likely to have made the wound—it was not an injury at all likely to be occasioned by a fall—the prosecutrix was not at all intoxicated when I saw her, which was about five o'clock in the afternoon—she was rather faint from the loss of blood.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 158.) I apprehended the prisoner on Friday, the 10th of December, about two o'clock in the afternoon—I told her she was charged with cutting and wounding Mrs. Martin, and in<lb></lb>quired for the shovel—she said, "I have no other shovel than that," point<lb></lb>ing to a small shovel under the fireplace—the prosecutrix was with me, and said, "That is not the shovel"—I said, "Then I must make a search"—I was about to do so, when the prisoner produced this shovel from the coal-hole—there were marks of blood on it, which were quite wet—she said, "I did not strike Mrs. Martin; I went down stairs to wipe some dust, and Mrs. Martin struck her head with the shovel"—both the parties were perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. You asked me for the shovel, and I showed you the shovel—this is called a pan. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. You said you had no other shovel—you appeared quite composed then, not at all agitated—I know the prosecu<lb></lb>trix and her husband very well—the other two witnesses I know to be single women.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. The prosecutrix ran violently down two pairs of stairs, and without any provocation beat me several times against a wall in the back-yard—I held up the dust-pan as a shield—she, being in liquor, snatched it from me, fell on it, and cut her head—they were all drunk, and always have in a large quantity of gin every day—I never struck her—her boy is four years old, but he is more artful than a man.</p>

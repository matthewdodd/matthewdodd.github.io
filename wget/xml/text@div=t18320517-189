            . I lost my watch at Mr. Harley's, a publican; I think it was about the middle of January -I went to his house about that time, pulled off my coat, hung it across a chair, and sat there half an hour; I took my coat, came out, and put it on; I missed my watch from the coat pocket the next morning; I had put it there to prevent its being scratched with some money which I had in my pocket - I do not know that I saw the prisoner, but she lived servant there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You had your watch in your waistcoat pocket before? A. I had it there then, and took it out and put it into my coat pocket, but I had another watch in my fob - it was not a club night; I went to see Mr. Harley - it might have fallen out.</p>

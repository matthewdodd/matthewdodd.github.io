                  </hi>. I am a clerk to Mr. John Wilson, of Great Suffolk-street, Southwark. On Friday, 17th December, the prisoner came to my office—I never remember having seen him before—he produced this paper (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "December 16, 1858—Mr. Wilson—Sir; Please pay bearer, Welsh, labourer, 3 days, 7 1/2 hours, at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I. Hobbs,"—I told the prisoner to call again in half an hour—in the mean time I made a communication to Mr. T. Hobbs, who is the foreman at the Adelphi—the prisoner came again in about half, or three-quarters of an hour—I told him I had not change, and told him to call again in a quarter of an hour—he did so, and I then gave him into custody—I asked him whether the figures 7 1/2 meant hours, and he said, "Yes."</p>

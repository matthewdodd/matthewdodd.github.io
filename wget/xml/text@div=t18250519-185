            . I am a clerk, but out of employ. I was in Doctors'-commons - Mr. Birch was ten or fifteen yards from me; I saw the prisoner follow him - he put his hand into his pocket and took the handkerchief out, which he folded up, and put into his bosom - I called out "Stop him, he has got your handkerchief!" he ran and I pursued him - he was taken on Addle-hill, in my presence - I am sure he is the person.</p>

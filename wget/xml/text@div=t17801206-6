We had information he had frequent meetings with a person on Westminster-bridge, who received tin of him, that led us to watch him. I saw him take an ingot of tin out of the yard, about a quarter after four o'clock in the morning. I sat up to watch him. That was I think on the 24th of October. We have two shops, one at Lambeth; the cart is kept there; he goes to fetch the cart. He was ordered to get up at this time of the morning.</p>
               <p>How did he get the ingot? - It lay open in the warehouse; I saw him come out of the warehouse with it under his arm and put a bag over it. I could have stopped him then, but I wanted to detect the receiver. I was up in the lost above, where he could not see me. There was another piece found in his pocket afterwards.</p>
               <p>What was the value of this piece of tin? - It is about twenty pounds weight, it is worth eight pence a pound.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Kinman. On the 9th of November I was ordered to follow the prisoner; I had followed him on the 23d of October, and the 24th. On the 24th of October he had a piece of tin which my master saw him take. On the Tuesday after the 24th of October my master saw him take a piece out of the yard.</p>
               <p>On the 24th of October your master ordered you to follow the prisoner? - Yes, on the 23d he ordered me to follow him the next morning when he went out, which I did. I observed he had something under his arm with a bag over it; I followed him into Fleet-street, down the ditch side; he seemed to be apprehensive there was some person after him; he stopped; I was obliged to stop likewise. When he came nearer to the tollhouse at Black-friars-bridge, he made a full stop, seeming determined to see if any person was after him. I crossed to the other side of the bridge, and I suppose he threw this piece over, it was found by a waterman's boy at low water mark, on the 9th of November. I followed him again; he went towards Temple-bar. I observed he had something heavy in his pocket. He stopped at Temple-bar, so that I could not avoid coming close to him. He fell into discourse with me, and immediately turned about and said, I have lost my glove, and went back; I followed him back, imagining he meant to discharge the piece he had got. I said he had got something he should not have. He said he had not. I said I must search him; I did, and found this ingot upon him (producing it).</p>

               <p>Should you have known that tin if you had seen it any where else? - I should have known my master had such tin.</p>
               <p>Any person who deals with Forbes may have the same sort? - They may.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He had got a piece of metal for a friend to make a pair of buckles.</p>
               <p>Did you charge him with it? - Yes, and I told him how long I had been after him.</p>

On the 21st of February I was at tea in my parlour, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I ran out, pursued the prisoner, and saw him drop the writing-desk, he was secured. I took him to the watch-house. I returned to my shop, and missed the writing-desk-it was never found.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. The desk was brought back to the house after the prisoner dropped it - I knew it to be my husband's property-it was taken from the window, we had only that one in the shop. After the desk was brought back, some of the crowd said I must give it them to take to the watch-house - I gave it to an old man to take there, I did not know him. When the prisoner was brought back he said he had taken it. I never saw it after.</p>

            . I heard the cry, and seized the prisoner in Dean-street. He said, "Don't stop me, I have been fighting!" The prosecutor came up, and told me to bring him back; he then said it was his first offence, and he did it as his mother was ill.</p>

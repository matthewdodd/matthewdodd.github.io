                  </hi>. I live at North-end, Hampstead. My wife is a laundress—the prisoner was in my employ nearly twelve months, as an ironer—she left my house on the 22nd of last month, on a Friday, about half-past nine o'clock—I was informed she was gone, and my wife missed a gown—I went and informed a policeman, who lives a few doors off, and he went after her—I went to Camden-town, and saw her at the Britannia public-house, in custody, about eleven o'clock—I saw my wife's gown there, and knew it—she was taken to the station-house is Albany-street, and on the way I saw the end of my trowsers sticking out of her bundle, which the policeman was carrying—I saw the bundle opened at the station-house, and there was a pair of black trowsers and a black waistcoat of mine in it, and four shirts belonging to Mr. Edgar, of Guild ford-street, who employed my wife—I did not know the prisoner was going to quit my service that day—I had not given her leave to take any of these things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went to look for the Prisoner on the 22nd of September—I overtook her in Camden-town, and said, "Young woman, you must go back with me, you have got a silk gown here"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "It belongs to Mr. Harrison"—she made no reply—I took her to the Britannia public-house with a large bundle which she had—the silk gown lay at the top of the bundle loose—I asked what she had got there—she said she had some shirts—I asked her whose they where—she said, "I don't know," and burst out crying—Harrison came up and said, "That is my wife's silk gown"—I took her</p>

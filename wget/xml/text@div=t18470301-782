                  </hi>. I live in Little Chapel-street, Westminster, and am a hardware man. I took the house from the prisoner John Hyde, about six or seven weeks before I was robbed of this money—I told him at the time I took it that I had some money coming, with which I was going to set up in business; and on one occasion I lent him a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which he repaid me the next day—on the 11th of Feb. I was in treaty for a house and shop in peter-street, from a Mr. Fisher—I told Hyde in the morning that I was in treaty for the house, and was going to buy the furniture and fixtures as it stood; and he said he would go down with me and see it—we went to Mr. Fisher's, and had half a pint of gin—I then found out I had come out without any money—I said to Hyde, "I must go home again, for I have brought no money out with me"—he said I had no cause to go home, what I wanted he would lend me—he lent me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we then had the half-pint of gin—I again said that I must go home for my money, and said it was no use my stopping</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184703010112"></xptr>
               <p>there all day without money—he said he would come down again by and by and bring me some more—he said, "You stop here, and do not you leave the place, for you have bought the furniture and fixtures as they stand; if you go, part of the things may be taken"—he went away, and returned, and brought me half a crown—that was about one o'clock—he left again, and returned again about five o'clock—he then said the same words, merely telling me to stop where I was—Mr. Fisher heard him say that—her name is now Mr. Baxter—she kept the house—when he had said so many times, "You shall not go, "she said, "Both him and you shall go, for he is not to take the place until Monday next"—I told Mr. Baxter I would pay her for it then, and take possession of it at that time—Hyde said, "You shall not go; there is 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay, and if you want it I will lend it to you"—he then went away—that was about half-past five or six o'clock—before he went, Mr. Baxter said to him, "Mr. Simister is now <hi rend="italic">far on</hi>, and if he should get anything more to drink he will not be able to settle it"—I was getting the worse for liquor—I knew perfectly well what I was about—my wife was not with me—Mr. Baxter told Hyde that Hannah (that is my wife)was lying down, and to be certain not to disturb her, for if I got more, and was not able to settle it, she would return with Mr. Baxter, her husband, at nine o'clock, to settle it—I continued in the house till I heard I was robbed, which was a little before seven o'clock—a massage was brought to me to go home—my house is about five minutes walk from Mr. Baxter's, about a quarter of a mile—when I went home I went into my bed-room, and found my notes gone—I had left them in a little drawer that goes into the inside of a bureau—I had seen them safe in the morning—there were then ten 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, nine in a roll, and one was doubled, up and dropped into a case in the same drawer—that was a note which I had sent my young man out to change a day or two before—when I went home I did not find Hyde there—I went to his own house, and saw him—he and his wife were present—I told him he had robbed me—he said he had not—that was all that passed at the time—I went again the next day—the female prisoner, who is his wife, was in the little back parlour, and he was in the shop—his wife must have heard what I said the night before—she said, "I hope you do not think now, as you did last night, that we have robbed you, for I saw your wife put the roll of notes into her bosom"—about ten minutes after I went in again, and she said it might have been paper, she never saw the notes at all—I had got the money from the bank of England.</p>

I believe—I had laid out more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in stock—I do get tipsy at times unfortunately, once a week perhaps, or once a month—when I went down to this shop I left my wife on the bed, when I went with Hyde to Mr. Baxter's—we had not both of us been in bed drunk all the day before—I had been to bed after the effects of drink, to recover from it—that was on the Wednesday—I had been drunk once in that week—unfortunately, a very little will make me drunk—the injury I have received in my head makes it easy—I was drunk on Tues<lb></lb>day and was recovering from the effects on Wednesday—I cannot say that I did not drink on Wednesday—I was not drunk on Monday—I mean to swear I was perfectly competent to look after my business—I was the worse for liquor—I was not drunk and in bed on Sunday—I was perfectly able to do anything—I had been drinking perhaps tea and coffee, and perhaps gin—I was not drunk—I did not drink ram out of the bottle's mouth that—I</p>

"—I might have said it was more money than I knew of—I told him the exact sum he had lent me—there are other parties in the house that could prove it—he said he had lent me first 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., afterwards half a crown, and then 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had borrowed money of him on one occasion before that—we had been intimate—he told me he had got money, and I told him the same—he lent me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. once—my friends and lodgers, and all the person near, knew that I had money—my lodgers could not help knowing it because I sent them out for different things—when I came home, on being sent for I found one of the lodgers at home, the old man, George white—I stated, when I got up in the morning, that I had no thought of going to the public-house, till I had mentioned it to Mr. Hyde—I mentioned that I had taken the place—he did not know it till I told him—it was not on his recommandatin that I went—mentioned it to him, and he said, "I will go down with you"—I never said his offering to go with me was the sole ceuse of my going—I told my wife I must go and look after Mr. Baxter's place, or I should lose my deposit—I said I had put the receipt for the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. I remember his leaving me on the 11th of Feb.—I saw him again in the evening, about a quarter to six o'clock, at Mr. Baxter's, in Peter-street—Mr. Hyde had told me there was a quarrel about Mr. Baxter wishing to move some of the goods—after my husband left me, about five o'clock, or very soon after that, I saw Hyde in his own house—we got into conversation—Hyde said my husband had said that he had got property in the house, and he should not be easy as long as it was there—I afterwards went into his house again—I had been down to Peter-street on account of what he told me—I left Mr. Hyde at her own house—I did not see her at my house till about a quarter to six in the evening—I had started from my own home, and came back from Peter-street—Mr. Hyde followed me in about two minutes—that was a very little after six—I took the candle, to go up stairs, as they wished to have the money to wattle for the house—Mr. Baxter had told me I bad better come home and fetch the money—I went up stairs, and sat on the side of the bed—Mr. Hyde sat on a box under the bed-room window, by the side of the bed—we got into conversation for about ten or twelve minutes, about wearing apparel, and then it began about the money—she said, "If I were you, if I had any property in the house, I should put it out of the way, for your husband is as likely to come home and take the whole, as to take 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and make use of it"—at that time no one knew where the money was—I got up, and saw the keys of the bureau lying on the mantel-piece—I was going to lock it, but could not, as a piece was broken off one of the keys—as soon as I saw the piece had fallen out where the lock went in, I took the drawer out the bureau—there was not a word spoken at the time, but she stood by and saw me deposit it at the bottom of the box—I did not take the money out—I left it in the drawer, I saw it there—I had it in my hand, and I put the drawer at the bottom of a box in which I had a cap and bonnet, and a great many letter—that box was not locked—I did that for safety, as I thought—I put the drawer under my cap, to conceal it—Mr. Hyde could see what I was doing—we then came down—as we came down stairs she said she wanted to go into the yard—the door was fastened—I</p>

               <p>unfastened it, and we went in, but did not stop above a minute or two—I did not at any time put a roll of notes or a roll of paper into my bosom—I was sober—I had had a glass of liquor in the afternoon, but I had laid down after that, and did not get up till half-past five, and then I went down to ask the man in possession of the house to help me light the gas—after I had deposited the notes in the box, I went down to Mr. Baxter's again, leaving George White at the house—I cannot say that locked the back door, but I shut it after me, I am positive—anybody could very easily get over the wall on the right-hand said of the back door, which is very low, and get in behind—they would then have to pass through the back door, and up a steep staircase, to get to the room where the money was—if any person had been in the shop they could not have seen anybody who went up, because there is a door which shuts our back parlour out from the passage—a person might go through the back door without being noticed in the shop, but when we walk across that bed-room it shakes all the house—anybody can hear distinctly a footstep going across the room—I went to Mr. Baxter's again, because she told me I had better fetch the money, and to see if I could get my husband home—I found him there—I did not get him home just at that moment, but I did a very little time after—I heard of the robbery while I was there, and then went straight home.</p>

Q.</hi> Had you been drinking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in the evening—I had a very small glass of rum about two o'clock in the afternoon, on account. of having a pain in my stomach—I went to bed and laid down about half an hour afterwards—my husband did not leave me drunk in the morning—I was not living on the bed to endeavour to recover from the drunkenness in which I was all day on Wednesday—I never had a drain on Wednesday—if I were to say that I and my husband were drunk twice a week, or twice a year, I should tell a very great falsehood—we did drink gin together in bed on Sunday, but not on the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday—I believe my husband said, before he went away in the morning, that he must go and look after Mr. Fisher's place, or else he should lose his deposit—there was an inventory mentioned, but I do not know that he said he should like to get one—that was the answer I made at the Police-court—I heard him say he feared some of the furniture would be removed—Hyde had instructed him in that kind of way—he showed me the agreement, and said he would take Hyde down with him—my husband is in the habit of getting a little drink sometimes—he is like other <hi rend="italic">gents</hi>, he likes a little sometimes—I have not said that he drinks so much that I considered his memory better when drunk than when sober—I told the Magistrate that when he was drunk he could always recollect very well, and he has told me that he could not recollect very well when sober—when we have quarreled over night, and I have charged him with it next morning, he has said he knew nothing at all about it—if I said I was drunk once or twice in the week I should tell a very great falsehood.</p>

                  </hi>. I live Simister. Two days before the robbery I went out with a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I took the number, it was 20349—I returned it to Mr. Simister.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Simister, in Little Chapel-street, West<lb></lb>minster. On the day of the robbery Mr. Simister left me in charge of the shop—I lighted the gas, to the best of my recollection, about five o'clock—Mr. Simister came in, as near as I can guess, about a quarter past six o'clock—Mr. Hyde went up stairs with her—they remained up stairs, I should say, ten minutes or more—they came down again, but previous to that the back door, that leads into the yard, was locked—I saw them go out—I did not see anybody till Mr. Simister called to the little boy who was standing in the shop, and took him out with her—he was in the back par<lb></lb>lour, which adjoins the shop—I was there as well—I then remained there alone—in a little while Mr. Hyde came, and requested me to to come out and mind his shop—I went to the side of the window and he said, "Stop here, and then you can mind my shop, and see into your own too"—I stood with my side to the shop, so that if anybody went in I should have seen it, but if anybody went in the back way I could not—after he left I got up to the threshold of the door—in about five minutes I heard something go over the ceiling—the houses adjoin each other—when Hyde went away he said he was going to his workmen—he was away full an hour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You did not know there was money in the box up stairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I knew there was money in the house, but did not know where it was, or what quantity it was—I had frequently seen them go up stairs to fetch it down—no doubt everybody in the neighbourhood suspected they had money—I never went to the bed-room to see who was there—I am positive Simester or his wife could not have come back—I suspected there was a rob<lb></lb>bery—I did not go up stairs, because I did not know where the property was—my attention was attracted to the shop as well, and I did not know what to do—I have never been in trouble—I work for Mr. Simester, selling goods on commission—I do not go round from door to door—I merely call them out for sale—I saw Mr. Simester go out that afternoon—she was not drunk—she might have had some drink, but I can say she was perfectly collected when she came home—I never saw her very drunk at Mr. Hyde'<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

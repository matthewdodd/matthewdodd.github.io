I am a leather mercer, and live at 9, Laundry-yard, Guildford-place, Bermondsey—I was there on the night in question—I heard a noise outside my house, and saw the prisoner throw a stone and hit the window—after that I saw Charles Spurling come out with the landlord—this was about 10 o'clock—they laid hold of the prisoner and kept him till the policeman came—when he was given into custody he walked a little way with the policeman; he then stopped, and said, "Are you going to take me to the station?"—the deceased then came up to help the policeman, and the prisoner struck him on the left side of the face—the blow knocked him down as if he were shot—I afterwards saw the deceased—he complained very much of his head—his face was swollen—he was not so clear in his senses as otherwise—I saw him gradually get worse—the prisoner was excited when he struck the blow—the deceased lived eight or ten days after.</p>

I am the widow of Charles Spurling—I remember the Saturday on which this took place—prior to that my husband's health was good—he had never complained of anything—I went to the Crown public-house on this night and found him putting up the shutters—he came home with me, and complained of his head; after that he could not sleep at nights, and he continued to complain up to 13th June, when he went to the hospital—he continued in the same situation up to Saturday—I was present at the hospital on the 14th when he died—he complained of the back of his head—he never slept from the time he had the blow, to when he died—we lived close to the public-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 50, Eutton Square—I was acquainted with the defendant as far back as November, 1859, when I had certain business transactions with him with regard to certain leasehold houses—he purchased some property at Sidmouth for about 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I advanced him some 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I advanced him first 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he was indebted to me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was not a charge upon this property, but ultimately it became a charge of 927 114<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was in 1860—from information I received in April, 1861, I went to Sidmouth and took proceed<lb></lb>ings in the Court of Chancery to effect a foreclosure—the defendant con<lb></lb>sented to a decree, which was obtained—I was compelled under the lease to erect two other houses on the property, and I expended altogether 3,006<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">A letter of</hi> 28 <hi rend="italic">January, from the prisoner to the prosecutor, commencing</hi> "Braham, you are getting old,"<hi rend="italic">was put in at the prisoner's request; also the following letters; From Webster and Graham to B. C. Jones: 30th January."</hi> Sir,—Mr. Lewis H. Braham has handed us your insulting effusion, with instructions to warn you against continuing any such annoyance. He states that you are per<lb></lb>fectly well aware that he has been a great loser by the transaction to which you allude, and that this is an impudent attempt to extort money. Should you, therefore, repeat it, we shall take such steps as we may deem expedient, to protect Mr. Braham from further insult."<hi rend="italic">The libel was read as follows.</hi> "Now, Loo," what is it you do? Do you think to frighten me 1 Never fear, old hullalaboo. Your threats are naught but fiddle-de-dee. I know thee well, thou brazen devil. I know that in my wealth you revel. I know you said you'd give me some, which thou knowest thou neer has done. And do you think to frighten me, Louis Henry Fiddle-de-dee. I've humbled myself to you, sir, and you have requited me by insolence and insult If you hold out more of your specious and presumptuous threats I'll write your whole life and publish it, that I will You promised me to refund me 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of my money, and again I ask you to fulfill your pro<lb></lb>mise, "&amp;c. Signed B. C. Jones.") In consequence of that communication. I took out a summons at Bow Street and the defendant appeared, and at the suggestion of Mr. Vaughan I withdrew the summons on the defendant pro<lb></lb>missing not to annoy me again—he admitted the signature to the letters and that he had sent them—ten days afterwards I received these two books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in this cover; on one of them is written" Bribed, of course, by old mutton chops," in the prisoner's writing; that referred, I suppose, to the reporters—there are some marks in the books, but nothing to show who made them—I afterwards received this document. "Extract from a novel publication shortly to be issued, and will appear if the wretch does not do his victim justice immediately. It is said that since Abraham's daughter ran off with a scavenger, and a synagogue's funds under Abraham's manipulation became small by degrees' and beautifully less, he has been seen walking of mornings alongside the bank of the Serpentine, but has never had the courage to consummate the most desired object of all who know him, &amp;c. Report says that the lady will still dress the girls as she pleases, and let them wear pink kid boots, which aggravates Abraham very much," <hi rend="italic">To which some verses were added containing the lines;</hi> "He caught the man in fiendish grasp and prigged from him his tin, And then he stung like demon-wasp and revelled in his sin." <hi rend="italic">Also"</hi> I'll show him up, the wicked Jew, and how he got the wealth." <hi rend="italic">This was interspersed with Latin and Hebrew.</hi>) I do not know whether that is the defendant's writing, I thought so at first, but I am not prepared to say so now—I think the envelope certainly is written my him, but disguised—the word "Louis" is so much like the word in the other letters I received from him, and many of the circumstances there enumerated certainly apply to me—contained in the same envelope was this document, (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "May 8, 1877.

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Webster and Graham, 17, Ely Place, solicitors for the prosecution—the defendant applied to us by his solicitor, Mr. Rawlings, as to the course to be taken with regard to the prosecution; I saw the defendant yesterday—he said nothing about having seen Mr. Rawlings, to me, nor did he allude to the interview I had had with Mr. Rawlings; I told him that Mr. Braham suggested that he should plead guilty to the indictment, and we would ask his Lordship to allow him to go out on his own recognizance, which he indignantly declined to do—nothing was said about the costs of the prosecution.</p>

This is our reply: <hi rend="italic">From Webster and Graham to B.

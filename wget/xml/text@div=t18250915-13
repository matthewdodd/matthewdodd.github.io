I saw one hen and nine chickens on the prisoner's premises the same morning, between ten and eleven o'clock; I afterwards saw the prisoner, and told him they were mine; he said, "Take them" - I said, "I will take you, I have been plundered so frequently, I will not put up with it;" he then obstructed the officer from going up stairs without a search-warrant, but one of the officers said as part of the property was found on his premises he thought the rest was there. He then got up stairs, and brought down a cock and two hens in a dirty bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did not he tell you that he bought them of a person of the name of Smith? A. He told the officer that he bought them of Smith, the dog stealer. Smith was taken into custody, but has escaped. The prisoner was discharged by the Magistrate, after a second examination. This bill was found two days before the last Session ended; I do not know why he was not tried.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At what time did the prisoner say he bought them of Smith, the dog stealer? A. After they had gone up stairs.</p>

            . On the 6th of June, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I went up to my window, and saw in the prisoner's yard a fine brood of chickens, and a hen. I had heard that Gordon had lost some fowls - I went and told him; he came to my room, and said, "They are my chickens, and my hen;" I went with him, and got an officer. The prisoner had had chickens of his own, but they were not then in his yard. I afterwards heard Gordon say to the prisoner, "Where is the hen belonging to these chickens, I saw it here when I was up in Tweedy's room;" he said, "I had no hen here:" Gordon said,</p>

            . I am a headborough. I was with Gordon at the prisoner's house, about eleven o'clock; Gordon said he had lost some fowls, and they were in that place; the chickens were running in the yard; the prisoner was then up stairs, but he came down, and either I or the prosecutor said they were his fowls - he said he had bought them that morning about ten o'clock; I then went up stairs, and when I was coming down again he met me, and said, "You had no right to go up stairs without a warrant;" I said as part of the property was found I would go. Gordon, the officer, and myself, then went up again to the dormer, and the officer found the cock in a bag: I inquired who he bought the fowls of; he said of Smith, the dog fancier, or stealer, I do not know which, I think fancier; I said, "Where does he live?" he said "In Cherry-tree-alley;" I went there with another man, and found Smith; I brought him some distance, and he begged of me to loose his hands, which I did; he then drew a knife and rushed at me; I seized him by the throat, and made him drop the knife; he then said "Go to the Benbow public-house," and about thirty persons came round me and knocked me about; he got away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner keep pigeons in his dormer? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Luke's. I was called in and saw the prisoner at his house - he said "What do you want?" I said "I am told there are some fowls;" he said</p>
               <p>"You shall come in;" I went in and saw the fowls; a young man, named Williams, said to him, "Why don't you tell Lock where you got them?" he then said he had bought them that morning of Jem Smith, but if he had known they had been stolen he should not have bought them. I took him and he was discharged after a second examination.</p>
               <p>ARTHUR GORDON re-examined. Q. When you first went did you see the hen and the chickens together? A. Yes, when I saw them from the window, but when I had got the officer the hen was gone; I asked the prisoner about the hen, and said Mrs. Pearl saw you take the hen away; he said "I have no hen belonging to this brood;" he then opened a cupboard in his room and said, "Is this your hen?" I said "No, it is not;" I afterwards saw my own hen brought down from the loft, with the wing partly plucked. I lost four fowls in all, but only three were found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There were only two fowls found.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150013"></xptr>Smith came to my house and asked me to buy some fowls, for which I gave him 5 s. 6 d.; there were two dead fowls and nine chickens. I took the hens into the loft, and laid them down on some straw; the officer came about a quarter before eleven o'clock, and I said I bought them of Smith. The prosecutor first said a fowl that was there was his, and then he said it was not.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH SIBLEY. I live in White Hart-yard, Drury-lane. On the 27th of April, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my house, and enquired for a person named Cameron, who formerly kept the house. I said I did not know her, but heard such a person had lived there. He said he did not want her, but wanted a person who formerly lodged with her. I called Jordan, my servant, down, who had lived with Cameron, and she called a person who also lodged there with Cameron; she came down, told the prisoner one was dead and other was married, and asked him to give her something to drink? he said he never gave anything away to drink, but he would toss up for half a pint - they tossed, and he lost; he then asked me to change him a 1 l. note, which he produced. I said I had no silver, he went behind the street door, and pulled out a 1 l. note. I heard paper rustle, as if he took it from others; he asked me for a pen and ink, which my servant gave him, he stood by the drawers, wrote his name on it, and gave it to my servant, she went out for change, returned in about three minutes, told him it was a bad one, and that Mr. Poore had kept it. He said he took it at Dover, in change for a 5 l. note. He went with Jordan to the public-house, I followed in about three minutes, and found him detained there. I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Your's is a house where both sexes resort - A. I understand it was so before I came, but it has not been so in my time.</p>
               <p>ERMIN JORDAN. I live with Mrs. Sibley. I remember the prisoner coming to the house a little before six o'clock in the evening on the 27th of April, he gave me a 1 l. note to pay for some gin - he wrote on the right-hand corner of it in my sight, on the drawers; when I got it from him I saw he had written</p>
               <p>"B. Meredith," on it. I went to went to fetch half a pint of gin from Poore's, the young woman said it was bad note, and took it to Mr. Poore, he came and asked me where I took it - I said of a young man. I went back and the prisoner returned with me to Poore's, who asked him where he took the note - he said in Kent, at Dover.</p>

            . I keep the Barley Mow, wine vaults, Drury-lane. I received a note from the last witness, perceived it was bad, and objected to it. The prisoner came in in a few minutes, with two women and Jordan, they said, in his presence, that he wanted to go, but they would not let him, and they brought him to the bar. I asked him where he got the note - I do not recollect what place he first mentioned - he said it was in Kent; some person said, that place is not in Kent. I then asked him what part of Kent - he said Dover; but that was not the first place he mentioned. He said he took it in change. I said I was confident it was a bad one, and could not think of letting the note go.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he said anything to you about it - A.He said he was confident he could bring proof where he got it, and wanted to get it into his possession. I said I could not let it go, and asked him if he had any other note - he said he had no other, nor any money. Two men were outside the bar, I sent one for an officer, and told the other to prevent his going out. I marked the note - (looks at one) - this is it. He said the writing on it was his.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anything said in his hearing about other notes - A. girl said, in his hearing, that he had other notes about him. This was after he had said he had no other notes or money - he made no answer to that. The officer took him into the back room, searched him, and found 5 l. 6 s. 6 d. in silver, in a bag, and other small articles, on him. About ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after he was taken, my servant,

A female called me in, and asked me to give her some gin - I said I never gave things away. We tossed for some, and I lost. I took the note, wrote B. Meredith on it, and gave it to her. She returned, and I immediately went with her to the house and was detained. I solemnly declare I knew nothing of the five notes found in the tap-room. Is it to be supposed, if I had forged notes, I would have accompanied a woman so far, and not attempt to escape. Upwards of twenty persons, of all characters, were in the house, and might not some of them have dropped them.</p>

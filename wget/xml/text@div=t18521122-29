                  </hi>. I am a boot-maker, and live in Sykes-terrace, Mile<lb></lb>end-road. I remember the prisoner coming for a pair of boots; I do not know the date—he purchased a pair of half-boots—I think 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the price—I know there was some squabbling about the price—he left the shop—my boy was to take the boots with him, and he was to pay the boy—I saw the boy leave the shop and take the boots with him—the prisoner said the boy was to take them to No. 14, Sidney-street, and he was to bring back a pair of boot-legs to be refooted—in about ten minutes after the boy and the prisoner had left, something was told me—I went out of my shop, and saw my boy in Sidney-street—I also saw the prisoner, who was coming from the boy—the boy was going one way, and the prisoner coming from him—I met the prisoner; I asked him where my boy was—he said "Your boy is up there, and I have paid him"—I went after the boy, and the prisoner ran away directly—when I came up to the boy, I found he had some money—I asked him for it, and he gave me four half crowns and five shillings—I ascertained that the four half crowns were bad, and I set them apart from other coins till they were produced at the police office—I saw the prisoner again on 29th Oct., in custody at the station—he was in one of the cells, and there was another man there—I have no doubt that the prisoner is the man—the boots he had on at the station were the boots I had sold him.</p>

I will not be certain; it was about 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I know there was 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. brought back to me, but whether there was a sixpence more I will not swear—I know there was a great deal of <hi rend="italic">haggling</hi>—the prisoner was in no haste to get away; he seemed desirous to make a good bargain—my shop is a small shop—the boots are hanging in the window in a glass case—it is not rather dark; it is a very light shop—I had never seen the prisoner before that I know of—lie was there altogether half an hour—he had neither a hat nor a cap on his head—he came to do his business with a bare head—he had a coat on—when the boy was gone I had some suspicion, and went after the boy—I saw the prisoner—I stopped and spoke to him—I said, "Where is my boy?" he said, "There he is; I have paid him"—I was then in Sidney-street—I turned, and saw the prisoner run away—he ran down towards Mile<lb></lb>end—I ran after the boy, as I knew he would not leave the boots without the money—I then came back to run after the prisoner—he was running as fast as he could—he could run faster than I could—it struck me when he was running that something was wrong—the turning that leads to Mile-end is about forty yards from where I was in Sidney-street—I had not any con<lb></lb>versation with the policeman about this case—he asked me if I knew the prisoner; I said yes—I do not know that I told him that I saw the prisoner running away—that question was not put to me before the Magistrate to my knowledge—it was not suggested to roe by the clerk of the Court to say that I wrapped up these coins in a piece of paper—the prisoner had these boots on his feet—I asked for a sight of them, and I can swear that they were mine—when I sold them they were new—the prisoner had worn them, because they had had gutta percha soles put on them—I can swear to a pair of boots that had been worn three months, and had been soled—these are the boots;</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of the last witness. I remember a person coming and buying a pair of boots in July last—the prisoner is the person—after his having bargained with my master, I took the boots to take home with the prisoner to No. 14, Sidney-street—I walked, with the boots in a bag under my arm—there is a baker's shop at the corner of Sidney-street; the prisoner told me to wait on the other side while he went in the baker's shop—he went in, and was in about ten minutes; he then came out and called me over to him—he said, "Here is your change, my boy;" I said, "Thank you, sir"—he gave me four half crowns and five shillings—I gave him the boots out of the bag—he told me to go to No. 14, Sidney-street, and fetch the boot-legs which he had ordered to be footed—I did not go there, for just as I was going to knock at the door I heard some one call me, which turned out to be my master—I do not know what came of the prisoner—when my master called me I turned round—I did not see the prisoner—I gave my master the same four half crowns and five shillings that the prisoner gave me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When he gave you the money did he give it you in a bundle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he put it into my hand—I did not see that he had any<lb></lb>thing else in his hand—I did not see him putting anything into his pocket when he came out of the shop—I will not swear it was a baker's shop—I will not swear that it was not a grocer's shop—I have not looked at the shop since—I do not know on what day this took place—no one has mentioned the number of the house to me since—I next saw the prisoner about three weeks ago, at the station, in the place where the prisoners are—the prisoner and another man were there—the prisoner was not pointed out to me by the officer—the other man had a longish coat—he was not the man that I ever would have supposed came to my master's—there was no general resemblance between them—I have not been to 14, Sidney-street, since—it never occurred to me to call to see if he lived there—when I saw him the first time he had a long coat on, and black trowsers—he had nothing on his head—I will swear that I did not see 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his hand when I went across to him—his hand was not closed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Leather-lane—the prisoner was in my ser<lb></lb>vice. On the 7th of June Mills gave me information, and I found I had lost some money—I sent for the prisoner into the parlour—I told him he was accused of robbing me, of putting the money into his mouth, and then into his side pocket—I called Mills in, and sent for the policeman—the prisoner went down on his knees, said it was the first money he took, and begged I would forgive him—I said I would not, and I gave him in charge—he said he had got a little money, and he took out eight shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shop-boy to the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner three different times take money from the till, put it into his mouth, and then into his side pocket—I told my master.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This was on the bacon side, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, on the butter and cheese side—I was outside—it is a regular market—it was middlingly busy that night—Mrs. Bateman was on the butter side looking out of the window when I saw the prisoner do this—each time I saw him do it she was turning her back to him—there was one customer on the butter side where he was, and three or four on the other side—I saw the prisoner serve the cheese—the lady paid him, and went out—he took the shilling, and put it into the till, and then took it out, put it in his mouth, and then into his side-pocket—I have lived with my master about two months, and I lived with him before—he never charged me with being dishonest or robbing the till—I was turned away on account of his suspecting me, but there was no witness to prove it—he did not discharge me—I went of my own accord—the prisoner and I are not on the most friendly terms.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185911280125"></xptr>
               <p>about two yards from the kerb, on a chair without a back, and speaking in a loud voice—he commenced about 11 o'clock; at that time, I think there were nearly one hundred persona round him, but the numbers kept increasing till he was removed—at last there were about 250—he continued to speak till he was taken in custody, about a quarter before 12—the passage of the highway was impeded—the carriage-way was completely closed—persons could pass along the footpath by edging themselves through, but the carriage-way was completely blocked up—some persons belonging to tike teetotalers were endeavouring to make a passage, and they called on me to help them—I said the only thing I could do was to request the gentleman to leave off;—he had then been speaking about twenty minutes—I desired him to leave off; he did not, but desired the people to make the foot-way clear—at length, there was such a crowd that I said, "Sir, I must really; take you in custody"—he said, "That is what I want; I will go with you."</p>

Mr. Parry is the incumbent of that parish—I have never seen him preach out of doors—I don't know who made this complaint—I have heard that Mr. Hill sent a petition against it; I have seen it—I do not know how many names were to it—these meetings had been going on for some weeks—that was the second Sunday that I was there—the high road to Deptford is altered, hot this is the high road to Rotherhithe—there was not room, if a carriage bad been passing, for the persons to have gone on to the embankment—there were persons on the embankment.</p>

                  </hi> I am a widow, and live at 13, Millpond-street—from the door of my house I could see where this meeting took place—I remember the meeting on 6th November, I noticed them for about an hour and a quarter, I was in my shop—there was plenty of room on the pavement for persons to pass I should think—there was nothing to hinder the carriages passing in the road—I am not connected with the temperance movement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cowkeeper, and live in Paradise-street, Rotherhithe—I was at the meeting when Mr. West was taken into custody—there was room for persons to pass on the foot path, and there was more room in the road than on the foot path—there were I suppose 150 or 200 persons—if any one passed, the people would have to move—I am not a teetotaller, and I do not wish to be.</p>

I am a draper and live in Millpond-row—I am connected with these meetings—I am a member of the teetotal society—I was at the meeting on 6th November—I saw them from the window—there was plenty of room on the pavement for persons to pass—there were a few persons on the kerb—there was plenty of room in the carriage way—that road is not much frequented—on a "Sunday sometimes not a cab or a vehicle passes—if two carriages were to come together there would be room—at these meetings we have persons attending to keep stragglers out of the way—if a person were to come and stand in the clear way he would be advised to go a little nearer.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, Millpond-street, and am a hatter—I was standing at my door, which is about fourteen yards from the meeting—while it was going on there was plenty of room for persons to pass on the foot path, and plenty of room in the carriage-way—the congregation standing round the speaker did not take up quite half the road—there was plenty of room.</p>

I am surveyor of pavements in the parish of Rotherhithe—I know Millpond-row, and all the parts about there—I know the embank<lb></lb>ment on the side of Millpond-row—I was instructed in January, 1857, to repair it, and then I received a letter from Mr. Banks, the solicitor, and did not—I believe it to be private property—it is about eight feet wide at the top, and we have dropping blocks put along, that persons may step on the embankment—the width of the foot-path on the other side is about eight feet—I have not measured it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Henrietta-terrace, and am secretary to the Temperance Society—I was present at the meeting on 6th November, when the proceedings were interrupted, and Mr. West was taken in custody—during the whole time the highway was not obstructed so that people could not pass—it would have required double the number of persons to have done that—any person driving could have done it without difficulty—there would have been no inconvenience in passing on the pavement.</p>

            . On Saturday evening between nine and ten o'clock on the 16th of April, I and a young women had been in the Borough, at Shoreditch church, I thought I would treat myself with a coach, I asked a coachman what he would take me to Cambridge Heath for, he asked me three shillings and six-pence, I told him I would not give three shillings and six-pence, he said are you going through a turnpike, I said no; he said what will you give, I said a shilling, he said, will not you give two, I said no, I would not; he said well then get in; the coachman came and put me into the coach, and this young woman was with me. The coachman said, I have a little business to do down the road, you will have the goodness to let me come into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100008"></xptr>coach, with that he came in, and called the prisoner into the coach, the prisoner got into the coach, and set at the side of me, the coachman went on the opposite side. The coach went on.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who drove the coach - A. No, I do not. It was a hackney coach, No. 737, the coach went through the bar; the prisoner unbuttoned his breeches, as we were going along, and I would not yield to his deceitfulness I was obligated of turning myself down upon my knees, then he struck me, he said if I did not yield to him, he would have my life. I told him I was a married woman and mother of a family, I held myself down on my knees. He struck me on the eye; and then he said if he could not have his will of me, he would have it of the young woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he then do any thing to her - A. No, he then took my shawl off, and stuffed it into his breeches. I let down the sash and cried out, a gentleman was going by, whether he opened the door, or the coachman I cannot say, the coach stopped. The woman got out, and the coachman got out, and I got out, the prisoner staid in the coach; I saw the prisoner put my shawl into his breeches by the light of the lamps; I saw his person also; that is the man there at the bar. I asked him for my shawl, he would not give it me. The prisoner jumped up in the street into the coach; as soon as I got out, of the coach, I went home immediately, and the young woman with me; I told the coachman where the prisoner had put my shawl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the gentleman the prisoner had the shawl in his breeches - A. That gentleman protected me home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he by when you told the coachman that the prisoner had got it in his breeches - A. He was by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your shawl again - A. No I have had an offer to be paid for it; an Attorney was with me yesterday, I had never seen the prisoner before nor the coachman.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after that he was taken up - A. This was on Saturday, and on Monday I went to the office, and stated the case, the same as I have done it now.</p>

             the last witness, I had been with her into the Borough to buy some tea and sugar; I got into the coach with Mrs Martin; she got in first, I afterwards, the coachman asked if he might get in, he got in and called this man the prisoner, and said he was his brother. We asked him who this man was, he said he was his brother, when he got up, I saw him, I am sure he is the man. He sat on the opposite side; I did not see him offer any undecency, it was dark, I could not see; I heard them I asked him what he was at, he told me I had better hold my tongue or I should share the same ate. I saw nothing, I heard a bustling about; I told the prisoner she was a married woman, and would do nothing of the kind; he said he would have his will of one or the other, with that in a little time she got up and screamed out of the window, the coach stopped, the door was opened; I first got out of the coach, then the coachman jumped out, and then Mrs. Martin got out; I heard her ask him for the shawl, before she got out; he took an oath that he had not got it, that is all he said. We searched the coach for the shawl and could not find it.</p>

We asked them were they were going, they said, to Cambridge Heath; they got into the coach, and the coachman and I, after them; the coachman had connexion with that young woman, and when we came near the Durham Arms, Mrs. Martin said I had robbed her of a shawl; she said she saw me stuff the shawl into my breeches.</p>

               <p>JOHN DOBSON. I am a hackney coachman, I drive the coach. No. 737. On the night in question, I was called to by the two young women, the prisoner was in company with them.

               <p>Q. Had anything happened before you had the gin - A. No, nothing at all; when we had the gin, we turned about into Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the coach stop - A. No longer than while we took the gin.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the reason of your turning about - A. The women wished to have a longer ride.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the turnpike from the Durham Arms - A. A very little way, not a quarter of a mile, we went back to Shoreditch church, and then to the Durham Arms again. At the Durham Arms, Mrs. Martin said she had lost her shawl,

                  </hi>. I live at 7, St. Peter-road, Mile-end—my brother-in-law, Michael Barry, lives at 27, Arbour-square, and is a lace agent for Messrs. Sebarras of Malta—he sent me some lace shawls to dispose of—I have known the prisoner four or five months—he represented himself to be a single man—I was to he married to him—the shawls were worth 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have been to various houses to dispose of them—the pri<lb></lb>soner sometimes went with me—on 27th June he told me he knew the prin<lb></lb>cipal lace buyer at Pawson's in St. Paul's-churchyard—I made an appoint<lb></lb>ment with him for the next day at ten o'clock at the Royal Exchange—I was to bring the remainder of the goods with me and he was to take them to Pawson's, and see if he could sell them; he then had some of the goods—I met him and we went to St. Paul's-churchyard—he told me to go into the cathedral while he went into Pawson's—he took the goods with him—I waited for him in the cathedral from twelve till six o'clock, when he came back and said he had left the goods for approbation and that he was to go on the fol<lb></lb>lowing morning—he said he had been so long because he had taken the prin<lb></lb>cipal out and treated him—I made an appointment with him for the following day, at four o'clock in the afternoon, at the Royal Exchange—I did not go because it was very wet—from that time I did not see him until he was in custody—I had a letter from him on the Thursday or Friday, stating that be would meet me on the Sunday, but on the Saturday night I received another letter—the first letter I destroyed—this is the second (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—he calls me there, "My dear Frizzlewig"—he was in the habit of calling me by that name occasionally—on 27th July I saw him in the Wal<lb></lb>worth-road—I think he saw me, I am not sure—he ran away—I should not have parted with those goods unless I had believed that he knew Pawson's buyer—I placed great confidence in him.</p>

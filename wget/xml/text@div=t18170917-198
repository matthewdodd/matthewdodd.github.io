On the 3d of August I met the prisoner in Holborn, about eleven o'clock at night. We walked down Holborn together, she took me to the Coach and Horses, in Red Lion-street, where we had some rum and water. I took my notes out to pay for it; I changed a 1l. note, and had a 5l. and two 1l. notes remaining in my left-hand breeches-pocket, when I came out. We agreed to meet there the next evening. She was fearful of her parents being angry, and we took a coach to go to her house. As we were going down the <placeName id="t18170917-198-crimeloc1019">New Road</placeName>

I caught her hand, and took two 1l. notes out of it. I told her there was a 5l. note - She said she had dropped that on the straw at the bottom of the coach. I told her I would give her in charge till she found it. I called to the coachman, and told him to drive to the next watch-box, and gave her in charge. She said it was in the coach-it was not found. She said she threw it out of the coach-window. I went to look for it, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170058"></xptr>could not find it. When I returned she told the people I had given it to her. I never took any liberties with her,</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I went before the magistrate the next day, he refused to have any thing to do with it; I went to the Bank and described the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not told that there never was such a note issued - A. No; it was No. 15,298, I made the entry of it the next day. The coachman is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did not the prisoner call out first to the coachman to assist her - A. She did not. I have the number of the coach. I received the note of Mr. Perkins, of Smithfield. I got the number of the note from him, and told him I had been robbed. The beadle and his wife searched the prisoner. I was never in a court of justice before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not concerned in the prosecution of a man named Woodward - A. I was not examined to my knowledge - I gave information against him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard somebody call out to drive to the first watch-box; the prisoner jumped out first, and the prosecutor after; he said he had lost a 5l. note, the prisoner said it must be in the coach. I asked him how he knew it was the 5l. note he missed, he said he held the two 1l. notes up to the light, and saw it was the other that was missing; the prisoner said he gave them to her for what he wanted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Nothing was found upon her.</p>

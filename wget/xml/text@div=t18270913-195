I saw two boys go by at the instant, but I cannot identify them - Roe immediately came up, and asked if I had lost any thing; he said, if I would follow him, he thought he could find the persons who had it; we went on; he turned a corner, and took Stevens - I followed him, and took hold of Stratford - I saw Stevens drop my handkerchief from his pocket - I took it up, and put it into my pocket; there were no other persons round at that time.</p>

The Prisoner came in after us, and there they kept me till it was late; and then West said he would go home with me, When we came in to Lobb's Field, he threw me down, and was at the Point of Ravishing me. He had just made an Entrance into my - my - Body; when the Prisoner came up, and seeming to be very angry with him, he went no farther at that time. Then the Prisoner offered to bear me Company; and he appearing to be the civiler Man, I was willing to let him. Will. West followed us; and when we came to a private Place, he threw me down and committed a Rape upon me; and as soon as he got off, the Prisoner came on and ravished me again. They made me in such a frightful Condition, that you would have bless'd yourself to have seen me. The Blood gush'd out of my Nose, and ran into my Mouth, as I lay upon my Back; so that I had like to have been strangled with it. I was all over bloody, from Head to Foot, both within and without - I was in such an Agony! - I struggled and strove, and did all that a Woman could do, till I was quite spent. I was just ready to die away: And at last they took me up, and went home with me to my Master's, and there they left me about Midnight. My Mistress came down in the dark and let me in; the next Morning I told her how I had been abused. The Prisoner, in his Defence, called several Witnesses, who deposed, that Sarah Tate and Will. West had been, that Evening, at several Alehouses together in and about Kensington: That she appointed to meet him in Emerson's Field: That there are Houses all the Way betwixt the Wheatsheaf (near the Church) and her Master Lockwood's House (near Kensington-Square:) So that she had no Occasion to go with a Man, a private round-about Way over the Fields, for fear of being ravished in the Publick Street. <rs id="t17250827-74-verdict312" type="verdictDescription">

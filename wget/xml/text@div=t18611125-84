                  </hi>. I am a cook on board ship—I know Jane Russel—I was in her company on 22d October, at 6, Market-street, Borough-road—there was a bit of a quarrel between us—I have every time I have been home, cohabited with her—after the quarrelling the prisoner came to the house—he came up to me between 5 and 6 o'clock, and asked me if I did not know him—I said, "No"—I had my foot on the cill of the door, and he was standing outside—he said; "You must know me"—I said, "I never saw you before; I am not acquainted with you—he got mauling about my face, just shaving my nose, and hitting me on my waistcoat pocket with his hands—I said, "Go away; you are not acquainted with me; I do not want to have anything to do with you"—he said, <hi rend="italic">Alf</hi>, you knew me well on the Downs"—I said, "What Downs? I was never ashore on the Downs; I have passed it some scores of times—I asked him if he would go away—he insisted on not leaving me, and I shoved him away—he walked back to me on to the cell of the door—I said, "You had better go away," and shoved him right off the kerb, which was not above two yards—he came back to me again, but said nothing—he then went away, and I followed him and asked him what he knew of me—he had another pal with him waiting—I had not seen anybody before that with him—this other person was not present then—I went down the street and asked him what he knew of me, and while I was speaking to him another man came up—I was still following him; holding him by his collar—the other man struck me a violent blow on the jaw, and ran away—I then struck Phillips a blow or two at least—I struck at him; I do not know whether I hit him or not, and ran after the other, but could not catch him—I came back to see if I could get hold of Phillips, but he was gone—he went into No. 13—I did not see him go in, but I found him there shortly afterwards—there was some matting before the door, which kept it from closing—I shoved it from the outside to open it, and my strength being greater than somebody's who was pushing inside, I forced it open, and saw the prisoner inside—I heard a female say, "<hi rend="italic">Chive</hi> him—the door was then thrown open upon me, and I received a knife in my left breast—I saw something glitter, but I was not aware I was stabbed—I left the door and walked away—a female said, "You are stabbed—I then put my hand to my left breast and found I was bleeding very fast, and was exhausted—I had then walked two or three yards—they took me away to the nearest doctor, and from there to the hospital—I did not see the prisoner as I was pushing the door open—I believe he was behind it—I saw the figure of a man—ho could not get behind the door because it was thrown</p>

I live at 6, Market-street, Southwark—on 22d October Ray left me for three quarters of an hour, and came back intoxicated about ten minutes past 5—he was a little the worse for liquor, but not very much—we then had a few words, and he struck me once—I said, "To save any more words, I will go out," and he stopped in—I went to Phillips's house, 13, Market-street—I afterwards went back to my house, we had a few more words, and I then went back to No. 13, and was in the same room as the prisoner's sister—the prisoner said, "What is his name, is not his name <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>?" I said, "No,"—my sister said, "You had better stop here a few minutes, perhaps he will be cooler"—I understood "him" to mean Ray—the prisoner said, "What is his name?"I said, "<hi rend="italic">Alf</hi>"—he said, "I know him, I knew him in the Downs; I will go up to him, and perhaps we shall get a glass of something to drink out of him, I will see if I can quiet him a bit"—I went out and saw the prisoner standing by the door of No. 6, pushing Ray by the shoulders—that was about three minutes to 5—after that another person stopped Ray with the prisoner, and hit Ray on the side of the head—he went away, came back with the prisoner, and asked him why he struck him, he told him to ax * *—the prisoner then went and stood at the door of his house, and the prosecutor was standing close to the door—I do not know whether Ray attempted to get into the house, but they went into the road, and had a tustle together, and the prisoner left him and re<lb></lb>turned to No. 13—Ray followed him, he stood by the door, and said if be caught him there he would lock him up—he was immediately inside the door—my sister came out and said, "If you strike him, I will strike you with the poker;" and the poker was thrown out at the window—the prisoner came out again, they had a few more words, and another tustle in the road—the prisoner then went buck to the house, to the parlour door, and I went</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of 10, Crown-street, Westminster. On 10th Dec, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was going hone, and met the prisoner Brown—she asked me to go home with her—I went with her—she showed me into a room, and I gave her a shilling—she said I was not going to have anything for that, so I asked her to give it me back—she refused and took hold of the poker, and tried to hit me with it—I stopped her from hitting me with it, and then she called out for Thompson-Mr. Thompson came up, and said it would be best for me to leave—I said I should not go till I had got my money, and then the two of them caught hold behind my neck, and another in front of me tearing away at me, Brown <hi rend="italic">paid in</hi> at one side of my head with the poker, and Forbes with a lift preserver or a stick on the other side of my head—the blood came very much—I had two half-crowns in my pocket, and when I got out and got to the top of the court I missed them—I am sure I had them safe when I was there—my cap was off at the time I received the blows—it has not been</p>

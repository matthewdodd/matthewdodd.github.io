            . I am out of place, and live in Charles-street, Westminster. On the 25th of August, about three o'clock in the morning, I was returning from Peckam, where I had been waiting. I was coming down Drury-lane with a friend, and met the prisoner, she went with me to <placeName id="t18210912-199-crimeloc1165">Church-street</placeName>

My friend was in the next room to us. I objected going with the prisoner, and offered her a shilling to go when the light came up, as she had two black eyes. I put eleven shillings in my handkerchief in my breeches pocket, and went to bed; and in three quarters of an hour I awoke, by hearing her calling to be let out. I jumped up and knocked against the wainscot to awake my friend - he came, and the prisoner came up stairs, as she could not get out. My friend fetched a watchman who came up; she strongly denied it, and took out 1 s. which I had given her, and a few halfpence; she declared it was all she had in the world, and wished her Maker might strike her dead if it was not - she stripped herself, the watchman put his hand behind her head, she screamed out, and he took the eleven shillings from among her hair, tied in a piece of a handkerchief.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was called to this house, No. 1, Church-street, St. Giles's. The man charged the prisoner with stealing his money - they were both in the room; she denied it, and said she had no money belonging to him. I at last found it in her hair, wrapped up in an old piece of handkerchief. I found a handkerchief on her which the corner matched.</p>

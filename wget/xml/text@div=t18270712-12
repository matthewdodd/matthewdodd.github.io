            . I am in Mr. Devey's employ. On the 26th of June I concealed myself at half-past six o'clock; the prisoner had been in and out at different times, and while he was down at half-past six o'clock, I took down his hat, which felt very heavy, and found in it a lump of copper, which weighed 31/2lbs., covered with a handkerchief; I hung it up, and watched, and at seven o'clock, when the bell rang, the prisoner put his hat on, and walked into the street - I called him back, and said I thought he had master's property about him. I sent for the officer, who found it in his hat.</p>

            : On the 28th of last month, I lost a muslin handkerchief; it was taken out of the clothes off the copper; I missed it that day, but it was taken before; I found it afterwards on the 31st, at Mr. Everard's, a pawn-broker, the top of Berner's-street.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130142"></xptr>Q. Where did you lose it from? - A. A basket of things collected up for the wash, on the copper in the back kitchen; the prisoner came to help a servant of a lodger in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she there the day you missed these articles? - A. Yes; she was taken up on the Wednesday night, and Henry Bates found the pawnbroker's duplicate upon her.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I belong to Mary-le-bonne watch-house: On the 30th of January, about nine or ten o'clock, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house on suspicion of a robbery; I searched her and found forty-six duplicates upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any duplicates relating to a muslin handkerchief? - A. Yes; I went with it to Mr. Everard's, in Berner's-street, and found the handkerchief; I found three keys upon her belonging to Mr. Wilson's house; I have them in the bag among the duplicates; I asked her what they belonged to, she said, one belonged to No. 2, York-street.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM NORRIS sworn.</p>
               <p>I live with Mr. Everard, pawn-broker, in Berner's-street. (The duplicate shewn to him).</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought that handkerchief to pawn? - A. I know the prisoner, she is a customer, but I cannot swear that she brought it; I took it in on the 29th of December; I delivered this ticket to the person when I took it in, it was pawned for 1s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the handkerchief? - A. It was delivered to our young man; he took two handkerchiefs to the Magistrates; I was not before the Magistrate, he is here, his name is Mann; he went to the Magistrate, and going along, he took the bills off the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are not able to say that is the handkerchief you took in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are not able to say that is the handkerchief you took in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver two handkerchiefs to the young man with the duplicates upon them? - A. They were laid by to be taken to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p> - MANN sworn.</p>
               <p>I think, on the 30th, or 31st of December, I went to Marlborough-street with two handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Whom did you have the handkerchief from? - A. One of them I took in from the prisoner Wood, the 26th of December; the one that I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she at the shop on the 26th of December? - A. Yes; she brought a cambrick handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any muslin handkerchief that was pawned by her? - A. The muslin and the cambrick handkerchiefs were taken down to the justices together.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take the duplicates off them? - A. I did a very wrong thing to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take them off, was it to render it uncertain who pawned the one, and who the other? - A. I took them off before I recollected myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How many duplicates are here now? - A. Three.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you point out the muslin handkerchief? - A. Here it is.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know about the muslin handkerchief? - A. I know nothing about this.</p>
               <p>Court. There seems to have been some contrivance in taking off these bills; the woman is in custody, they are sent to the office, and by the way, the tickets are taken off. It is impossible upon this evidence, to convict the prisoner, he has no recollection of the person or any thing about it, you must acquit her.</p>

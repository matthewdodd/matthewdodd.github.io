            , who is a scale-maker, and lives in Brill-place, Somers'-town. The prisoner and her husband lodged in my house; they had three daughters; two are married, and one worked out of the house. On Saturday, the 21st of July, about ten minutes past twelve o'clock, I remember the deceased coming home to his dinner; he appeared quite in good health; the prisoner came to me about half-past twelve o'clock, and brought a piece of pudding on a plate; she said Wittenback was very sick and bad, and she thought he was poisoned; she asked me if I thought the pudding looked as if there was anything in it. I went down stairs with something of my own, and when I came up again, I entreated her to go down to her husband; she said she could not, for she was as bad as he was: I said, "I thought you said you did not eat any of it yourself:" she said she had eaten it while I had been down stairs; she had eaten it all. I said, "What! eat it when you said your husband was poisoned?" she said I was a liar, for she never said she had poisoned him at all: nothing further passed. I asked her to take a tub down stairs with her; she said she could not then, whatever she did the next time: she then went down to vomit; she came up, and went down again with the tub; she said she had been down to vomit as she was so bad; I then saw the deceased coming up stairs; he appeared very bad, indeed; he could scarcely crawl up - she could hear what passed between him and me very plainly; she was in her room, sitting in a chair,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130014"></xptr>near the door, which is close to the landing - I was close to the door, standing on the landing; he was coming up the stairs - it is a very small straight stair-case - I am sure she could hear what passed. I said, "Oh! Mr. Wittenback, what is the matter?" he said, "Oh! Mrs. Davis, I am very bad - I think I am poisoned;" and that he thought he was done for; that is all that passed then; I saw him vomiting; directly after that, Mrs. Sanders, the landlady, put him to bed; the prisoner was then sitting in a chair in the same room, vomiting; she said she was very bad, and that they were both poisoned; she laid down on the bed; I saw the deceased afterwards, trying to get out of his room, to go down stairs, but he could not: my husband fetched Mr. Jackson's assistant, and he administered an emetic to him - he still continued very sick: I left the room, and went to him again; just before four o'clock he called out dreadfully for help; he called me and Mrs. Sanders to rub his legs, as they were in such dreadful pain; when we got near the bed, we felt timid at rubbing them; he said, "Oh, dear, Mrs. Davis and Mrs. Sanders, are you both here?" we said Yes; he said, "Never mind my legs, for I am stone blind, I cannot see." His youngest daughter, Charlotte, was present, and went for Dr. Dillon. I proposed that Mr. Walford should be fetched; the prisoner said,"Don't fetch him, he is so dear;" I said I dare say her father would pay him when he got better, but he was not fetched: two gentlemen came from Mr. Dillon; he dozed while they were gone for; I was not present when they came. I was not in the room again till about seven o'clock, when my husband gave him some pills, which he took. The prisoner and her husband did not live exactly on very good terms, from what I have heard.</p>
               <p>Q. It is understood that the deceased vomitted in the yard, do you know anything that took place afterwards in the yard? A. Mrs. Sanders' cat was afterwards very bad, and died; I did not see it partake of what had been vomitted, but I saw it in the yard: when the prisoner brought the pudding to me, she said it was a suet one - I asked where she bought the flour; she said of Mr. Smith. I heard her daughter Charlotte at home till about eleven o'clock, and she came home again after her father was bad - I saw nobody about the house except those I have named.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. She said she bought the flour at Smith's - did you know Smith? A. Yes; I know he sold flour: Mr. Jackson was first sent for about half-past one o'clock; the deceased came home to dinner about ten minutes past twelve o'clock - it was full half-past twelve when I saw the prisoner - it was a goodish bit of pudding she had in the plate - it appeared part of a suet pudding - it was about a quarter to one o'clock when I saw the deceased on the stairs; my husband was down stairs, in Mrs. Sanders' workshop, and could not hear what I said to the deceased - I am sure I have stated the very words that passed; nobody was in the house besides the deceased, the prisoner, my husband, myself, and Mrs. Sanders, who was behind, helping the deceased up stairs, when I had the conversation with him. I told her what had passed between me and the prisoner when the deceased was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not send for a medical man as soon as you heard the prisoner make the disclosure to you? A. I went down and spoke to my husband about his being bad; he went and asked him if he should fetch somebody - that was before I saw him on the stairs - the prisoner did not seem at all alarmed when she came to me with the pudding - I did not perceive any alarm at that time - it was about five minutes afterwards that she said she had eaten the rest.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the husband vomiting in the yard? A. No; but I heard him, dreadfully.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you returned up stairs, did you see any pudding left in the plate? A. No; but I did not go into her room then; I was very much confused when I heard her say she thought her husband was poisoned.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up did not she appear to be labouring under the effects of poison? A. I did not perceive that she did, any further than what she said herself; she was spitting in a tub, and complaining of sickness - I saw a little froth come out of her mouth, that was all - there are only two rooms on a floor; the stair-case parts my room from theirs; she was sitting inside her room at the time the conversation passed on the stairs, with the pot in her lap; saying she was very sick - she appeared to be labouring under the effects of what she had eaten; we put her husband to bed directly - he could not stand - and she said she was unable to make the bed; they are poor people - it would be an object to them to have a cheap medical man.</p>

            . I am the last witness's husband, and lived in the same house with the deceased. I never heard him mention his name; but his fellow-workmen always called him Jem - I was at the window and saw him retching in the yard, as I looked through Mrs. Sanders's workshop window - my wife had been down to me previously; I went out to him in about three quarters of an hour - I said to him "You are very bad, and had better have a doctor;" he did not answer immediately, but said, in a few minutes,"I am; fetch me a doctor, if you please;" I went to Mr. Jackson's shop, which is about one hundred yards off - his young man came back with me; the deceased was then lying on the bed up stairs - I returned with the young man, who gave me an emetic, which I administered - it operated considerably, and after that I went to Brompton, on business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what come from his stomach in the yard? A. Yes; and I saw the cat eat of it, it turned sick almost immediately - this was before the emetic had been administered; I afterwards buried what had come from him, in the dust-heap - this was before I went to Brompton; I returned between seven and eight o'clock, and saw the deceased on the bed - the stomach-pump was being applied; he seemed much the same as when I first left him; he was very ill indeed; the gentleman gave me a box of pills, two of which I gave him about four hours after the pump had been applied - when I asked him to take them, he said he was just the same as if he had been in liquor, for his head rolled about - I had great difficulty in getting him to take the pills; he died, at twenty minutes past three o'clock in the morning - he did not work with me, but I have heard his fellow-workmen, as they passed, call him Jem whether that was his name, I cannot say.</p>

            . I keep the house in Brill-row, Somers'-town. The prisoner and her husband lived at our house for about five months - his name was Frederick. On the 21st of July, at a quarter-past twelve o'clock, I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130015"></xptr>him come home to dinner he passed me at the door, and seemed very well indeed - he went up stairs. I saw him again at about twenty minutes before one, retching violently in the yard; I went to him, and asked what was the matter; he said he was very ill, through eating pudding for dinner; I asked if he felt ill before he came home - he said No; he never felt better in his life than he had that morning - I asked if he would have assistance - he said Yes; and Mr. Davis was sent for; the deceased went up stairs, I followed him up; he begged that his bed should be made - I asked the prisoner to make it; she said she could not, she was as had as him - I made the bed and helped him on it; I know they had pudding for dinner, because, as I was passing into the opposite room, I saw the prisoner with a saucepan in one hand; lifting the pudding into a plate - I saw it smoking. I was not in the room, but only peeping - their daughter had gone out about eleven o'clock that morning; she had been at home altering a spencer till then - the prisoner had come into my room between ten and eleven o'clock, to borrow a washing-tub, which I lent her; she was talking about where she had been at work in the week, and said her husband expected 10s. that night, but she wished he might get it, and she said the girl was at home altering a spencer, expecting to wear it to-morrow, "but" said she, "she little thinks what I have got in my head." I do not know what terms the deceased and the prisoner lived on - I never heard a word between them. I saw my cat go into the yard and eat some of the pudding which the deceased had vomited; it retched directly afterwards and crawled over the wall of the next garden - I saw it dead afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How soon after the cat went over the wall did you see it? A. In the evening; Mr. Wright and another person went over and fetched it - it ate the pudding between one and two o'clock; the workmen used to call the deceased Jem - I only know that his name was Frederick, because the girl said so when the inquest was summoned,</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How many rooms are there in your house? A. Four; I let one to the prisoner, and another to Davis; there is no kitchen for them, they only use their own room; the prisoner and her husband slept and lived in one room; Davis lives in the other room on the same floor.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon at St. Pancras workhouse. I attended the deceased on Saturday evening, the 21st of July, about half-past seven o'clock; he had been vomiting considerably, and complained of great pain and a burning at the pit of his stomach; his symptoms accorded with what he stated; he complained of a twisting round the naval - I considered he had taken something of a poisonous nature, which acted on his stomach; the prisoner was also sick, and retching violently - I used the stomach-pump to them both; the stomach was emptied of its contents - I remained with the deceased till nine o'clock, and saw him again about eleven - I could not ascertain what the poisonous matter was; I opened the stomach after his death; it was inflamed, and the inner membrane softened - I should consider that was produced by some mineral poison; they are symptons of mineral poison.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I presume you have been some years in the profession? A. Ten years. I observed accurately the state of both of them; it is possible, that if I had been there earlier, further relief might have been given - it is likely his life might have been saved; they both appeared to labour under similar symptoms - I should think, if I had not used the pump to her, she would have been a corpse.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I understand the symptoms were described to you, and you opened his stomach? A. Yes - I used two tests to the contents of the stomach, but was unable to find any traces of arsenic or any other poison; an operative chemist has had the contents of the stomach, he is not here - I could not obtain that which was buried.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Supposing death to have been occasioned by arsenic administered so late as the pudding was, and death to have followed so soon, must not the traces of arsenic be visible? A. The stomach had been so completely emptied that there were no traces - I tried two tests on what I call the scraping of the stomach, which I extracted when I opened it; the cramp in the leg, and the loss of sight, are both symptoms of the parts being affected by mineral poison; it is possible, that the stomach may be so completely washed out, as to have no traces of poison, and that more so since the use of the pump, but generally some portion adheres to the coat of the stomach - I cannot swear that he did die of poison, or that he did not; but from all the symptoms, I believe that he did die of poison.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had the man's stomach been disordered in a natural way, and a powerful emetic administered, would that have left the stomach as you describe? A. There are some emetics that would produce inflammation of the stomach, and had there been any existing inflammation at the time, it would certainly have increased it; but that would not have caused the cramp or the loss of sight. On some constitutions, three grains of tartar emetic would produce inflammation; the stomach of a hard working man, used to drink, is less liable to excitement.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the specific action of mineral poison on the stomach? A. It produces inflammation of the stomach and intestines, depression of nervous energy, heat, pain throughout the whole alimentay canal, and general debility of the whole system; there will be a partial inflammation of the coats of the stomach; very frequently there will be only patches of inflammation here and there, and that was the case here; the emetic administered is not too powerful in a case of poison; four grains of tartar emetic would be a large dose, if there were no poison.</p>

            . I am out-door surgeon of St. Pancras parish. I was called in to the prisoner, between one and two o'clock in the morning of the 22d of July; the man at that time was almost in a dying state, constantly vomiting and purging; the pupils of his eyes were dilated, and his extremities quite cold - I continued with him till half-past two o'clock; it was my opinion that the symptoms were produced by mineral poison being taken into the stomach; every symptom was conformable to that idea; I was not present when his body was opened - I found it necessary to remove the prisoner to the infirmary at two o'clock on Sunday afternoon, as her symptoms were then very similar to what his had been; her extremities were cold, the pupils of her eyes dilated: she vomited and purged: her pulse was scarcely to be felt at her wrist - I had great apprehensions for the safety of her life; she did not say how she came so - I did not think it necessary to use the pump at that time - I told her my opinion of her state; she said she would rather die than recover - I asked her if she had taken any poison, or what, that I might the more easily get at the means of relief; she denied having taken any; she would certainly have died, if strong means had not been used to save her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the stomach-pump, in your opinion, a violent means to have recourse to? A. I do not think it a violent recourse in experienced hands; the emetic was a strong dose; but it is what is very often prescribed: it might produce inflammation in some cases, but in the majority of cases it would not - I have not had much experience in the stomach-pump; it might produce inflammation if used roughly, and in an injudicious way.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Supposing a person to have been vomiting for three quarters of an hour, to have the cramp and loss of sight, would the emetic administered be too strong a dose? A. Certainly not.</p>

            . I am one of the beadles of St. Pancras. After the inquest had been held, I took the prisoner to Newgate, in a chariot, on a warrant - Ley, another beadle, was with me - I had some conversation with her - I did not lead her to suppose that it would be better or worse for her, if she said any thing, or hold out either threat or promise to her in the least - I said to her, "You are aware of the situation in which you are placed" - she said, "Yes, I am" - I said, "Do you know where you are going," - she said "Yes, to Newgate" - I then said,"Don't you think you are a wicked woman for what you have done, and are you not sorry for it" - "Yes, I am," she said - I asked her what was the stuff which she bought; she said it was a white powder - I asked where she bought it; she said on the left hand side of Islington-road, between the Angel and Islington church, at a druggists or chemists - I then asked what it was put into; she said, a brown paper, - I asked her if it was asked what purpose it was for; she said for poisoning rats - I then asked, what quantity she thought there was, if it was a tea spoonful; she said "Yes, and much more" - the conversation ended here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been a beadle? A. Five years. I have been a parish officer sixteen years; I did not tell her what she would say might be given in evidence against her; I put the questions, and she answered them - I gave her no warning; she appeared quite collected. I did not say that I knew all about it, or any thing of the sort; I have told you every word that I said, as near as I can recollect; Ley did not say that he knew all about it, or a word of the sort, nor did he warn her that it would be given in evidence against her.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did Ley join in the conversation? A. I believe he did speak one word or two, not more.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever go to the Islington-road, to make inquiry? A. Ley and I went into two or three chemists' shops on the left-hand side of the road, but we could learn nothing. I should think the distance between the Angel and the church is half a mile or better.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. Pancras. On the 24th of July I accompanied Hutchings to Newgate with the prisoner - I did not hold out either threat or promise to her; he asked how she could be the woman to commit herself in the way she had; she sighed, and said she was sorry for what she had done; he asked what it was that she had bought - she said it was white powder; he asked where she got it; she said at a druggist's or chemist's, between the Angel and Islington-church, and in the way we asked if she thought where she was going to - she said Yes, she was going to Newgate; that is all I remember: we have been to all the shops between the Angel and the church, and below the church. We inquired at about five shops, and could not learn any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the question, "how she could be the woman to commit herself in such a way?" A. Yes, something to that effect; I think I said, "It is a shocking thing you should commit yourself in the way you have;" that was after Hutchings asked how she could be the woman to commit herself in such a way; he asked if she was sorry for her situation. I have been an officer of St. Pancras some years; I did not tell her what she said would be given in evidence - I only asked how she could commit herself so; she was quite collected in her answers, but was in a weak state, being affected at her situation.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she not in a most depressed state of mind and body? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was she in such a state of mind as prevented her from understanding the questions, and answering them? A. She gave reasonable answers to my questions, and understood them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you with Hutchings all the time in the chariot? A. Yes, all the way from the workhouse to Newgate; I do not recollect any thing more that passed.</p>
               <p>MR. DILLON. Arsenic in powder is white; corrosive sublimate is also white.</p>
               <p>The prisoner handed in a written paper, which stated there was nothing to criminate her, except what she stated when deprived of reason, from having eaten of the same food as her husband, and that it was impossible she should have eaten of the pudding had she known that it contained poison.</p>

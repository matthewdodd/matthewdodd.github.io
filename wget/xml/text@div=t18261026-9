On the 2nd of October, about three o'clock in the afternoon, while I was in the parlour, the prisoner came into the shop very quietly; my wife went towards the door and alarmed me; I saw him leaning across the counter, robbing the till. I went out at the private door; he had then got out at the shop-door, and turned round into Finsbury Circus, where several bad characters were standing - he went and stood close to them, with his hands behind him - I laid hold of him, and gave him in charge, but no money was found on him - he had unlocked the till, and drawn it out; I had put 20s. into it in the morning, in different coins, besides what I had taken - I know there were five half-crowns, five shillings, and five sixpences in it. When I took him, he said he had been looking at the boys at play, and had been there a quarter of an hour - he had not been out of the shop two minutes. I particularly noticed his dress, as he lay across the counter, and am positive of him by that there was not another boy dressed like him - I did not see his face. The till was quite empty - the silver was all in a little box in it - there were 2l. or 3l. there a few minutes before.</p>

            . I am a constable, and took him in charge - he said he knew nothing about it, and had been playing with the other boys, as he had no work. After taking him to the watch-house, he said, "It was not me, though I know the boys who did take it."</p>

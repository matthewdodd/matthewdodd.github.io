                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Gallon, an engine-driver, of 37, Crescent Street, Kensington—on Sunday morning, 6th August, between 12 and 1 o'clock in the night, I was standing at my door, and saw Mr. Styles, the deceased, sitting on the step of his own street-door, one area from me, having some words with a woman named Kelly, about 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a few high words occurred, and she said that she could fight him—he got up, and said that if anybody liked to take it out of him they could do so, and a young man came across the road and <hi rend="italic">fetched</hi> him a heavy blow in the face—he fell backwards, and I think he was insensible—the same young man gave him four or five blows after he was lying on the steps—the young man had light trowsers, a dark cap, and no coat—he was in his shirt sleeve—as be pulled the man up by his arms, the deceased fell backwards on the kerb stone, a very heavy fall—I think there was a little force used in throwing him down, because he fell so heavily—he lay there about five minutes—a constable came up, and I gave him a light to go to him—the man walked away, and went into the last house on the left hand side—the prisoner lives in that house, and his wife lives there now—Styles did not strike at the man; no provocation was given, nor yet a hand lifted, and I never heard him speak after it was done—not a word was spoken by either party, as far as I heard—the man came out of his house afterwards, spoke to three women, and went back—he had a coat on then—I cannot swear to the prisoner.</p>

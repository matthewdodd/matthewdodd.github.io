                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 22nd of October, in consequence of directions from Thomas, the inspector, I followed Hastings from the Hospital-gates, to his house in Old woodwich-road. I followed him in door—he turned round and asked, what I wanted him for, and at that moment his wife appeared at the door—she appeared very ill; almost ready to faint, and I would not tell him what I wanted him for—she went into the parlour, and I went in—she said, "Hastings, for God's sake, what is the matter?"—he said, "Oh, they want me about the college job, I sup<lb></lb>pose, but I know nothing about it"—I had not said what I wanted—I said it was for a bit of a row—when I went into the house, he said, "What do you want?" not "what do you want me for?"—I was not in plain colthes be—Thomas, the inspector, came in, in about twenty mintues, or it might be half an hour—I made no search before he came—I searched a place under<lb></lb>neath the stair, a sort of very deep value, and found there, some new</p>

               <p>iron hooping, and a brass cock—and in a cupboard next the fire-place, some leaden pipe—that was the cupboard of the back-room—It is leaden window piping—I found nothing else in the cupboard—It is window lead, which they fasten small pance of glass in with—I have not got that here—we left it at the station-house, as it was not identified as belonging to the college—Thomas found a small piece of lead in the yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the Green Which police. I went on this day to the prisoner's house, and found Tozer there—I examined part of the premises—I went into the back-yard, and found a small piece of head about llb. weight—there were a great many rabbit-hutches at the corner of the yard, attached to a pig-stye—I did not examine them, while I was there—I left the Sergeant and a man, and directed them particularly to ex<lb></lb>amine the premises well in my absence—there was nothing to prevent my looking into the hutches.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Greenwich. In October, I remember Hastings being taken into custody—I did not know it till next day—I saw a rabbit-hutch carried by George and Thomas Brain—It was against Mr. George Brain's door that I saw them, which is next to mine—the pri<lb></lb>soner lives about twelve yards from Brain's—Brais's sister is Hasting's wife—the two Brain's were coming with the hutch, as if from Hastings's; but I did not se them come out of his premises—I passed them at the door, and left them—It was between five and six o'clock in the eveing—I did not consider it heavy—two of them were carrying it—I saw only one rabbit—there was no covering to the hutch—the rabbit was at the top of the hutch—I did not consider that there was anything in the hutch but the rabbit—It was not dark.</p>
               <p>

Q.</hi> Do you remember one of the Brain's seading his sister's child in his hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard the child crying—It was not deck—It was light enough—It there had been any thing else besides the rabbit in the hutch, I should have seen it—I consider there could not have been lead in it without my seeing it.</p>

             came and asked for Mr. Alsop's linen; I told her they were not done, they would be done in a couple of hours; she said that would not do, Mrs. Alsop was going out, she wanted the sheets to air them. Seeing that she was a stranger, and not the person that brought them, I said I did not know which were Mrs. Alsop's things; she said Mrs. Alsop's things has a plain petticoat, without any tucks. I looked in the bundle, and found it answered with her description; with that she stopped, and I mangled four sheets for her, and gave them to her and a towel.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that is the woman, are you - A. Yes. I went to Mrs. Alsop's house in the evening; she requested me whether I had done her things, I said not all of them, she had got the sheets; she said she had not seen the sheets nor the woman. The prisoner is the person I delivered the sheets to.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker in East Smithfield. On the 19th of August, the prisoner pledged two pair of sheets; I lent her a pound upon them; she said they were her own.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I lodged with Mrs. Roberts that washed for Mrs. Alsop; she asked me to do her a favour, she said Mrs. Alsop was going to lend her some things to pay her rent, would I pledge them for her, I said the woman would not give me the things, being a stranger; she told me there was a petticoat without tucks. I went and pledged them for this washerwoman. We were both taken up; Mrs. Roberts begged me not to mention her, they could not hurt me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

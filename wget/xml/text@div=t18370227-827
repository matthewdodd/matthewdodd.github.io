The prisoner was my servant for about three months—I missed the spoon two or three days before Christmas, and the spectacles on the 6th of February—these are my spectacles—my initials are on the spoon—I charged the prisoner with this, and in consequence of what he told me, I went to the pawnbroker's, and found the property.</p>

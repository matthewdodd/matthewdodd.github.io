                  </hi>. I live at 6, Thanet-place, Strand, and am single. On 16th September, about half-past 7 in the evening, I was returning home from my business, and the prisoner walked a short distance, and then asked if he should carry my bag—I said "No"—he walked on a little, and then said, "Have you a sister with <hi rend="italic">us</hi>?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Or a bro<lb></lb>ther?"—I said, "No"—I did not know what he meant, but was very near home, and did not feel alarmed—I turned up Thanet-place, and there found that the prisoner had followed me—he said, "Shall I go home with you?"—I said, "No, indeed you will not"—he said, "Will you give me a kiss?"—I said, "No, indeed you will not, and if you do not leave me instantly, I will call my brother"—I called three times, but he did not hear me—the prisoner suddenly snatched my bag, but I retained hold of it—he appeared rather intoxicated—I called "Police" two or three times—I struggled with him some time, and do not know how long, for I was getting very much exhausted—when I was taken up from the ground, my nose was bleeding, and I had great pain in my eyes; a medical man was sent for and I suffered from the injuries for several days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boarding-house keeper, of 2, Thanet-place. I was in my parlour on the first floor, and my wife called my attention to the prosecutrix—I saw the prisoner put his arm round her and sling her on the ground, saying, "Take that you d—d whore"—if she had gone a little farther it would have killed her, because there is a raised kerb,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185810250014"></xptr>

                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller, of 9, Thanet-place. On Thursday, 16th September, about half-past 7, I was going up to my door, and saw the prisoner with the old lady—I heard her fall on the pavement, looked round, and saw her lying on her face, and a bag was three or four feet from her—the prisoner was standing between her and the bag—he was going down the court, but I told him he could not without going back to see what was the matter with the woman, and I never lost sight of him till he was taken.</p>

On 16th September I was sent for, and saw the prosecutrix at her brother's, in Thanet-place—the left side of her face was very much swollen, particu<lb></lb>larly the upper eye-lid—there was a slight scratch on her face, a small lacerated wound on her lower lip, and a great deal of swelling about the bridge of her nose—she was in a state of great prostration and fear—she has been getting better ever since.</p>

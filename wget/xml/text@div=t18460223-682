                  </hi>. I am footman to Mr. Nicholas Westby, who lives at York<lb></lb>gate, Regent's Park; the prisoner was a friend of mine. On the 7th of Feb. he came to see me at my master's about half-past six o'clock—I did not let him in then; I told him I could not, as I was busy, and to come again in three-quarters of an hour—he said he was going to St. James-street on some business for his master—he came in three-quarters of an hour—the family had not come down—I asked him down stairs to the pantry—he staid there till dinner was over, about twenty minutes—I then asked him up stairs to the butler's pantry—we were all three there, the butler, me, and the prisoner—I left him in the pantry with the butler, to get tea ready, about eight—I then came up again with the tea—the butler did not leave the pantry till we both went up into the drawing-room with the tea—the prisoner was left in the pantry then for about four minutes by himself—when I came down he said he wanted to go—I asked where he was living—he said with Sir Robert Murray, No. 14, Thayer-street—next day we missed eight silver forks—nobody but him had been in the pantry—the plate had been counted before him before eight o'clock—I went to No. 14, Thayer-street, to inquire for him—we found no person answering the description of Sir Robert Murray, nor did I find the prisoner there—I had known him about two years and a half—he was in service when I first knew him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. I took the prisoner on the 23rd of Feb., I told him I was an inspector of police, and wanted him—he asked what for—I said, "You are charged with stealing plate from Mr. Westby's, of York-gate"—he said, "Very well, I suppose I must go with you;" and when at the station he said, "What did you say I was charged with?"—I said, "Stealing eight silver forks from Mr. Westby's, of York-place"—he said, "I know nothing about the plate, I did not steal it"—I found twenty-one duplicates on him, but not referring to the property.</p>

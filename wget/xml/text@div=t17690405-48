I seeing it a banker's bill, thought it a good one. I said, If you call in an hour's time, I will give you the money, if it is a good one. It was a note for 9 l. 16 s. 6 d.

Bank post bill, a note of 9 l. 16 s. 6 d. and a receipt for 300 l. Bank stock put in. I saw them put in the letter, and sealed up. (He takes the note for 9 l. 16 l. 6 d. in his hand.) I know it was upon Mess. Welch and Rogers. I cannot say this is it. I did not take much notice of it. I went with it to the Post office. There was nobody at the window to receive it. There were other letters lying on the window. I stayed there five minutes. I saw none of them taken up. I put the letter I carried out of the reach of any man's arm, and went away.</p>

               <p>I deal in cyder; I sold a cask of cyder in London, two years ago this spring; it was to be shipped off for France directly. The man gave mean order to go to Westminster bridge to receive an order for the money. I could not get my money of him. I never saw him after till last February. As I was coming down Oxford road, I met a man, whom I thought was him; I turned round, and asked him for my money for the cyder, and was very urgent for it. I took him to the Buffalo's head; and he there gave me the banker's note. I looked and saw the indorsement on it, and I gave him the remainder of the money. I then came down to the linen-draper's, bought a piece of cloth, and he gave me the overplus of the money. As to the other paper that I carried to Mr. Fretwell, that I took at the White-horse, Piccadilly, of a man that came from Bristol. I met him, and he asked me if I had sold my hops that I had at Bristol; adding, that he should go out of town in a litle time, and if I would meet him at the White-horse, Piccadilly, perhaps we might agree for them. I met him there, when he showed me the paper, and said it was a good note; and that his name was

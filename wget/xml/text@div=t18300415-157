On the 28th of March I had the tooth-ache, went to the doctor, and had it out, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning - I then went to a public-house, under an archway in Union-street, to get something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150080"></xptr>to drink; a woman who had been to the doctor with me was in my company - we there met the prisoner, who was a stranger; I said my husband was a German, and the prisoner said her husband was a German, and worked at Roach's; we had some gin there, then went to another house, and had some more, and to another house and had another quartern of gin - I had my tooth in my pocket; the prisoner went with me to the door of my house, and then took me to another house next door but one; I went up stairs and was sick - the prisoner was very kind to me; I was very ill - I had not drank more than two glasses of gin and peppermint - I was sitting on the stairs, and the prisoner was telling me I should be better directly; she laid hold of my hand, took my ring off as far as the knuckle, and then put her teeth to it and pulled it off - I was perfectly sensible; she did not bite my finger - I said, "Do not," and I thought she put the ring back again; but she put another ring on and took mine away - when I got to my own room I thought it was very strange for her to meddle with my ring, - I looked at my finger and found it was quite a black ring that I had on - my ring has not been found, but I believe my tooth was found in her pocket.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. She knows I had no ring on - she has been tried herself, and knows the consequences of it. Witness. She had this ring on her finger and it was very tight - I never was at a bar.</p>

            . I live in Red Lion-street, Spitalfields I sell cloths in Spitalfield's-market, and I have seen the prisoner come to look at things, but she never bought any- I always noticed that she had a brass ring on, which was very black, and I made an observation that if I was forced to wear a brass ring I would keep it bright.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I called at the public-house - the prosecutrix and another woman came in; my little girl had the tooth-ache, and the prosecutrix said she had just had a tooth out - she called for some liquor, and offered me some; I did not like to take it, having a fracture in my head - she made me take some, and took the skirt of my gown, took me to another house, and called for more gin; we then went to another house, and she well knows that she asked me to escort her home - we went and knocked at Mrs. Curtis' door, and I said, "Does this woman live here?" she said No - I said, "Will you allow her to sit down?" she said Yes, and she was very ill; I then took her and sat her on the stairs - I went to look for her husband, and hearing his character, I did not like to tell him at once what situation she was in; he then went and took her up to bed.</p>

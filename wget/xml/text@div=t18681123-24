I live at Walworth Common, and am a foreman plate<lb></lb>layer on the London and South Western Railway—on 24th December, 1867, I was in Newgatge Market, and took my watch, which had been supplied to me by the company—Isaw the prisoner Waters in the market, in the crowd?</p>

               <p>—I took particular notice of him—I was pushing against him for about ten or twelve yards—he had on a large brown coat, and had his arms underneath the skirts, so that only his hands came out—I was going to shift my watch for safety, and found it was gone, and my guard hanging down—the prisoner was standing in front of me—there was a great crowd—I did not see him again till he was in custody, last Monday—I am sure he is the man—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my watch—I know it by the number and the maker's name.</p>

On 5th November, I took Smith into custody on another charge, at 49, Underwood Street, Whitechapel—Smith was wearing this watch—I asked how he accounted for it—he said it was his—next morning he said it belonged to his wife's son, that he had given it to him in part payment of some money he owed him, and had gone to New York—I made inquiries, and found the prosecutor, and he identified the watch.</p>

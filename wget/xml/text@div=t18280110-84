            . On the 22d of November the prisoner gave me an account of what he had received: I am sure I took down every sum he mentioned - I went over the accounts with him, and ascertained the sum to be received, which was 2l. 7s. - here is no mention of a sum of 9s. received from Mr. Green, of Drummond-street; he mentioned a cask of beer going to Mr. Green, but not about any money received from him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many items were entered that day? A. About twenty-four; he said he delivered a cask of beer to Mr. Green, which came to 4s. 6d.; he has accounted for 6l. 6s. received on one day - it is not true that he never received more than 4l. or 5l. in a day - there are, on several days, a great number of items accounted for by him - he accounted when he came home, which was generally from six o'clock to eight in the evening; here is a figure of 4, which means a quarter cask.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How many of these items, on the 22d of November, have money against them? A. Three only - I think 4l. a-day is above the average of what he has received; Mr. Green had had beer without money before; if the money was paid, it would be carried into the next column.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What does the prisoner account to you from? A. He has read from a list, but generally from memory.</p>
               <p>MR. LAXTON. He has never accounted to me for this 9s - I found it out about the 19th of December.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How much might he receive a a day? A. I meant to say from 4l. to 6l. - if I said less it was not intentional; there is seldom more than ten items of money received.</p>

            . I am a green-grocer, and live in Drummond-street, Hampstead-road. I dealt with Mr. Laxton, and on the 22d of November, either I or my wife wife paid the prisoner 9s. - I have the receipt, and know it is his writing (reads) - I do not know what beer I took that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you dealt with Laxton before? A. Yes, for some time; about three years; Mr. Laxton came to me about it; the prisoner has called on me for the last eighteen months. I got the receipt off my file.</p>

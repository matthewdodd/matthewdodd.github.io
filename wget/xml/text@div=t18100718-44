Yes, I saw the boy, the fore horse trod upon him, and I believe all the others, but to the best of my knowledge neither of the wheels went over him; the boy was beat down by the first horse, I believe all the three horses went over him.</p>

            . I am a cowkeeper, Helmet-row, St. Lukes. On the 15th of June, I was in Goswell-street between eight and nine in the evening, I saw the two carts and a waggon, they were driving furiously along all the three teams were, before they were stopped; I saw them stop, and I saw the prisoner, who drove the hindmost cart, he turned his horses round the back of the cart and set off again, he passed the others, and sat off at the rate of eight or nine mile an hour, the horses continued going at that rate until they were stopped by Old-street; I was behind, I observed the boy in the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner was the person who drove - A. I cannot say particularly it was the prisoner, I ran to pick up the boys I saw the driver, I cannot say it was the prisoner, I found the boy very much hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish any thing that happened in the course of driving, whether the driver; whoever he was, had the command of his horses - A. I really believe he had, as he turned from behind the other carts he was of the near side, in passing there was a coach drawed up on the other side, and had he not had the command of his horses, he must have smashed the coach all to pieces, but he then held his horses toward and cleared it. I never saw the boy before nor since; the driver was stopped at the corner of Old-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Do you know whether these were horses that belonged to a fire engine - A. I believe they were they had the harness of a fire office.</p>

            . I live in Goswell-street. On the Friday this accident happened, I saw the carts and waggon, they stopped at my door, I went to the window to see what was the matter; before they went off again there dropped a stick out of the cart, the carman turned the horses round, went after the stick, he tied it in the cart, that was the hindmost cart; the waggoner that was before him, told him he had better keep behind, for fear he should be over some one; he took the whip struck the horses and they set off a running, and at the distance of three or four yards, the boy was knocked down and run over.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the driver was - A. No, I saw his jacket, I did not see his face; the boy was just off the curb when he fell, he fell just by the driver and was endeavouring to rise from under the horses feet.</p>

               <p>MR. PRIDDEN. I am a student in St. Bartholomew's hospital. In about a quarter of an hour after the boy was brought in, I was sent for, for upon the examination at the time, a fracture of the right thigh was discovered, and there was considerable injury done to the lower part of the body, he was not sensible; he was brought in on Friday, the 15th of June, and lived till Monday afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the body opened after his death - A. It was; the thigh was fractured, but the greatest injury was at the lower part of the body; the pelvis; the bones forming it were fractured, and the natural connection with the spine was separated, was destroyed, with a great degree of inflamation and extraversation of urine, were sufficient to account for the death of the child; I have no doubt it was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. What age might the boy be - A. About ten I should think.</p>

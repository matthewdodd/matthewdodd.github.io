                  </hi>. I reside in West-street, Hackney. The house, No. 26, Paternoster-row, belongs to me—Mr. Scriven, of Barbican, was my agent the house was let by my consent and authority to the prisoner, when he entered into this agreement, which I hold in my hand—I did not go near the premises myself till I received a letter about a fortnight ago—I then found the premises terribly broken about—the floors are cut through—the top is so open that the rain comes in—the lead is taken from the gutter, three cisterns are gone, a kitchen-range, and jack and wheel, and three steam-pans, a steam closet, a deal cistern lined with lead, a branch of lead-pipe, and brass-cock—one of the cisterns was a copper one, which supplied the boiler in the range—I suppose the range cost 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; with fitting it up—it had been there some years, but it was a useful range, and answered the purpose of a range while we lived there—the leaden cisterns were not worn out, they were quite useful—if I had continued in the house, I should not have thought it</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Barbican. I was engaged as agent for Mr. Ambler to let this house to the prisoner—I am subscribing witness to this agreement—I have a schedule of the fixtures that the house con<lb></lb>tained—amongst them there was a deal cistern lined with lead—that was outside the window—I saw it there when the premises were let—there was a branch of lead pipe and a brass cock—there was in the kitchen a Cook's patent range, and a jack, and fly-wheel, and a case—there was a cistern to supply a range in the scullery—I gave the prisoner a list of the fixtures which he was to keep good—I have been there since, and these articles are all gone which I have enumerated—there has been no new range or new cistern—none of these things have been replaced by new ones—there have been carpenters and bricklayers in the place, for the purpose of altering the premises, but he has made them much worse than they were—he has cut through two or three floors, cut away the gutter, and left it open to the sky with the exception of a skylight, which he moved from another place—I really do not think the alterations he has made would amount to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, but the premises are really not better—I have made no estimate—he has very much altered the premises—one alteration is that the rain comes in, that certainly would not improve the premises—he has placed a lot of new boards there, inclosing various rooms, but they were inclosed before in a much more efficient way than they are now—some of them are inclosed with mere canvas—I should think the value of the fixtures missing would be 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; or 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—there is certainly nothing equivalent to that value on the premises.</p>

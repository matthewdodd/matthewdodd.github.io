                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On this Sunday evening I examined Mrs. Frost's right arm—I found a wound extending through the fleshy part of the arm—it was precisely the width of the blade of the knife—it mast have been a stab, not a cut—it was not dangerous—a knife must have passed completely through the arm, which was nearly three inches think—it missed the bone—it must have been done with force—it might have been done by</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you call it a stab you mean a punctured wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it would be as well accounted for by a person running at another and receiving the knife in the arm, as by the person being the aggressor—if she had her arm up going to strike a party who had the knife in his hand it might happen.</p>

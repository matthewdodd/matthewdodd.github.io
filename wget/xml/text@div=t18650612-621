                  </hi>. The prisoner and the deceased lodged in my house, in Frederick Place, Caledonian Road, for the last three months—her name was Catherine Costello—on 9th May, about twenty minutes past 7 in the evening, the prisoner came home for his tea—the woman was not at home, and he left—she returned a few minutes afterwards in liquor—she used abusive language to me, and my husband told her to go either in or out of doors—she said that she should not, and used words which I should not like to repeat—I heard her come In a little after that, but did not see her—I</p>

               <p>heard the prisoner come in, a little after 2 o'clock, and go upstairs—I asked him to go to bed quietly, and he promised me be would—though I did not see him I heard him ask where his tea was, and heard the woman scream—I heard him strike her again, and she fell—I heard two screams of murder, and she said, "Don't, don't"—the prisoner came to my door about 6 o'clock in the morning, and said, "Mrs. Franklin, will you come and see my wife? she is either dead or dying"—I felt her hands and feet, told him she was quite dead, and sent him to fetch a doctor—he did so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Has the woman ever been out for a whole night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She stopped away for two or three nights when they had a <hi rend="italic">row,</hi> and then she came back again—I have seen her tipsy more than once before—we shut her door, and as she went down she knocked at my door, and said, "If I am Irish, I will fetch twenty more, and you shall have no sleep to-night"—she hit me an open slap on the arm—the prisoner was sober when he came home—he went quietly to his room as he promised me—he did not seem excited—he did not shut his door, till after I heard the blow and the cries of "Murder;" it was a little on the jar—I heard the blow, as soon as she got inside her room—I heard him strike her once or twice—I heard her fall as he spoke the words—I heard the blow struck—after she said, "Don't, don't," I heard him say that he would not work for her any more, while she kept the company she did—I only heard her fall once.</p>

I am a horse-keeper and live in the same house—I heard a knocking at the door—I heard the prisoner come in—he said, "Thank you," to the landlady, and asked if his wife was in—she said "No"—he said, "Well, when she does come in, I will stiffen her nose for her"—she came in shortly afterwards—she went through into the back-room first—I heard her in the prisoner's room, and heard him ask for tea—she made no answer—there was a blow, and a hustle together, and then I heard a fall; it was quiet then for about a minute or so, and then I heard another scuffle, and heard her cry, "Police" and "Murder" twice—I heard a second fall, and all was quiet again—the prisoner then said, "You b—w—I shall never work for you any more"—there was then a third set to and I heard her say, "Don't, Mike"—I then heard a fall, and then three groans—they slept over me.</p>

               <p>Wednesday morning, a few minutes after 6 o'clock—she was quite dead—I saw marks of violence on her face and head, and two marks of blood on the right side of her neck, as if from the stains of bloody fingers—there was great lividity—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination next day, and found a round abrasion on the right-temple, about the size of a sixpenny piece, and on the right cheek, over the bone, an elongated abrasion—there was a wound, about an inch long, behind the right ear, from which blood had flowed—on the left jaw there was an abrasion, about an inch deep, and half an inch broad—there were several bruises on the forehead, and a small scratch on the left eyebrow, on removing the scalp, the vessels were much con<lb></lb>gested, and there was effusion of blood on the brain, which was the immediate cause of death—that might be caused by a fall or a blow, or even compression of the vessels of the neck, preventing the return of the blood—that would be much more likely from pressure—the other organs were quite healthy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you examine the kidneys? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I think one was slightly congested—there is a good deal of sympathy between the brain and the kidneys—a weakness of the kidneys sometimes extends itself to the brain, but not necessarily—the congestion of the brain might not be caused by congestion of the kidneys—there was no disease of the kidneys at all, but the vessels were full of blood—generally, when there is extravasation of blood on the brain, most of the organs are congested—I say that the kidneys being congested could not have caused the appearances of the brain—the marks on her neck could not have been from the strings of her bonnet—there was no mark of any ligature on her neck; it was two finger-marks, impressed with blood, which were washed off when I made the examination—death could not have been caused by those finger-marks—there might have been pressure over the vessels without leaving any marks—I do not know whether it was so, but I found frothy mucus in the air passage, which is a symptom of compression—if a person fell, with the head in a bad position, there would be frothy mucus, there would still be compression—if the neck is bent, so as to press upon certain vessels, the breathing could not go on—I have never known death caused in that way, but it is not impossible, or impro<lb></lb>bable—I dare say having a bonnet on, with the strings tied, would make it more likely, but then there would be some marks from the ribbons—the marks of violence might be caused by her falling against the bed or fender—but it would require several falls.</p>

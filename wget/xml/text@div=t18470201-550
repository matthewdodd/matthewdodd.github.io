                  </hi>. I am carman in the service of Thomas Callow, a brass-founder. The prisoner was in his employment—on the 14th of Jan. I was directed by my master to watch the prisoner—I was placed under a manger in the second stall in the stable—I found some brass lying under the manger—the prisoner came in, took a candle from a candlestick, and went and re<lb></lb>moved the brass, and put it under some straw—he then went and cleaned the pony—on the same day, before that, I found my chaff-bin had been moved, and a parcel of brass concealed behind it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brass-founder, and live at Bow-common—I have no partner. On the 14th of Jan. I went to the harness-room for a head<lb></lb>stall, and could not find it—I ordered a search—Carter afterwards pointed out a quantity of brass <hi rend="italic">stove</hi> behind the chaff-bin, and I put him under the manger to watch—he gave me information the same night and I went with the policeman to the stable—the policeman made a search, and found the prisoner up in the loft—I did not see him there, but I saw the policemen bring him down—he had no business there—the brass was not kept in the loft—the harness-room comes into the stable—I told the prisoner to go and fetch the metal that was behind the chaff-bin—he said he never saw it—I said I could show him somebody who saw him put it there, or words to that effect—I pulled a truss of clover on one side, and Anthony came out—when he saw Anthony he did not say a word, but was very much confused—the brass is mine—it is not valuable of itself, but the harness bad been cut to pieces, and the brass taken out.</p>

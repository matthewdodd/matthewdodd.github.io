I am the wife of Daniel Green, and live at 12, Little Manor Street, Clapham—I am a fruit seller—a little after midnight, on the 16th April, I was washing up my room—my husband had gone to bed at 8 o'clock, and my children at 10 o'clock—I was doing my work as I had to go to market in the morning—I heard loud shouts and noises at the door—I saw the two prisoners and Mr. Smith and James Denny there—they called to my husband, using bad language, and telling him to come out—I said my husband was in bed, and they ought to be in bed—Smith used very bad language, and Skidmore took up a brick-bat and threw it at me—it hit the wall close to where I stood—I called my husband and children, and then he caught and struck and kicked me, and put me down and knelt on me—I saw Mr. McDenny, the surgeon—I was very excited and he gave me no time—he said he would have nothing to say, and told me to go in doors.</p>

             sworn. - On the 20th of November I sent the prisoner to Mr. Bussell to receive money on account; I did not see him again that evening; the next morning he said Mr. Bussell would call upon me on Monday morning; Mr. Bussell not calling on Monday or Tuesday, I called upon him on Tuesday evening, I then found Mr. Bussell had paid him 10l. 5s. 3d.; I begged he would call on me the next day about eleven o'clock, I would take care the prisoner should be alone, and desired him to ask the prisoner for a receipt for the money he had paid him; he called, and the prisoner gave him a receipt; I came in about twelve o'clock and the prisoner had put upon my desk 8l. 5s. 3d.; I waited a little and Mr. Bussell came in and produced me a receipt for 10l. 5s. 3d.; it was taken to the Mansion-house and delivered to the Lord Mayor, and I thought his Lordship had returned it to Mr. Bussell, but he does not recollect that he ever had it from his Lordship; I have not seen it since; I asked the prisoner what money that was on my desk, and he said it was from Mr. Bussell; Mr. Bussell then came in, and upon finding a deficiency of 2l. I immediately sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Bussell). Have you made any enquiries of my Lord Mayor respecting this receipt? - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Abbey). Had you sent him for 8l. 5s. 3d.? - A. No; I sent for 29l. or something on account.</p>

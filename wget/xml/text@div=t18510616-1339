                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Stone, of 20, Chancery-lane. I let the house in chambers—I missed a brooch, I believe it was on 13th March—I also missed two other brooches, and a new purse made by one of my daughters, a breast-pin of my husband's, a set of charms, and a mourning ring, with a name and date on it, they were worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—I missed them when I went to bed—I had seen them safe in the day, in a wardrobe-drawer in my bedroom, at the top of the house—there is a staircase open to all the chambers—no person coming to the chambers could get access to the staircase without ringing a bell or opening the door—I do not know the prisoner—I was told, about eight weeks after the robbery, that a person who is here, was wearing my brooch—I went to her house and saw it—the street-door of my house is kept open, but there is a second door which is not open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Daniel Duncombe—we keep a coffee-shop at 48, Dury-lane—the prisoner offered me a brooch for sale in the coffee-room—I think it was in March—he owed me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I took the brooch</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Palmer; we live in Frederick-street, Hampstead-road. On Saturday last the prisoner came to clean a room for a lodger, and I asked her to clean two rooms for me—I left her in my back kitchen, while I went up stairs—my daughter came to me, and in consequence of what she said, I went down stairs, and from a drawer in my front kitchen I missed a parcel which I had put there my. self, he night before—it contained an unmade calico chemise—I went to the prisoner, and spoke to her—she said she had not been to the drawer at all—I was standing in the back kitchen, speaking to her, and I saw a drawer there, into which I had put some linen which had come borne the night before, and it did not shut quite close—I had put a towel over it, and I ob<lb></lb>served that the towel was gone—I said, "You have opened that drawer, and taken the towel"—she said she had not, and she was willing to take her oath that she had not—there is a bed in that back kitchen—I saw the bottom of it was tumbled, and said, "You have been doing something to that bed"—she said she had not—I turned it up at the foot, and the parcel I had missed and the towel fell out on the floor—I said I did not wish to injure her, if she would own to taking the things, as she knew she had done so, she might go; but she was so very abusive, I was forced to send for an officer,</p>

                  </hi>. I am the witness' daughter. I had been in the hospital, and had come out—I was sitting in a chair, and leaning my head against a sofa-bed in the front kitchen—my eyes were shut, but I was awake I saw the prisoner come into the front kitchen, she opened the bottom drawer, and there was nothing there—she then opened the next, and took a white parcel out of the corner, and went out of the kitchen—I went and told my mother, and she came down.</p>

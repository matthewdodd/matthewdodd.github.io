               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186208180033"></xptr>
               <p>6th June, I fastened up the premises about 11 o'clock—I went round and ascertained that they were all properly secured—I slept in the butler's pantry in the basement—I was awoke about 2 o'clock by hearing a noise in the kitchen—I went to the kitchen and heard a man's voice say, "It is only me, don't lock me in;" but I did lock him in—I then went up and rang the alarum bell—on going down again to the kitchen I found a man coming through the kitchen door—the post of the door was broken where the bolt of the lock goes in; he had broken his way out by forcing the door post—I struck him in the face with my fist—he followed up and worked his way to the pantry at the end of the passage—we fought in the pantry with no weapons—he was more powerful than I and threw me on the table—after that we had a tustle and he threw me on the floor—he thea said, "If you don't give up the property I have a knife as sharp as a razor, and I will cut your throat "—he produced a knife, I saw it, and I then got a small poker in the pantry and struck him—it was in the dark, and I can't say positively where I struck him; it was on the face or head; I did my best—we got to the pantry door at the foot of the kitchen stairs, the two maidservants came down with a light—they went to give an alarm, and he followed them up stairs—I distinctly saw a clasp-knife in hand at he went up stairs—they opened the street door and called murder and police! and he took the opportunity to run out, and I lost sight of him—to the best of my recollection the servants only had one light on the stairs—I had no opportunity of seeing the man's face when the light was brought—there was a very small lamp which he lighted himself—I saw his face in the first instance, till we got fighting, but not when the maid servants had the light, his back was towards me—the lamp that he lighted is a lamp that is used in the kitchen, the man must have lighted it, it was not usually lighted at that time—that enabled me to see his face in the first instance, as he came out of the door and broke his way from the kitchen to the passage; that was the only time I had an opportunity of sating his face—I did see it by the light of that lamp, and I had a small light which I had lighted in my pantry, so that between the two lights I had a glimpse of him; I saw his face—to the best of my belief the prisoner is the man; I have no doubt; I say so from his voice—he is the same sized man, and the same voice—I heard his voice at the Marylebone police-court—the simi<lb></lb>larity of voice struck me as well as the similarity of appearance—I believe that he is the man.</p>

I would swear he was the man or was not, and I said neither—I could not swear he was not the man in the position I was in that night, I had been knocked about a good deal, and ill-used—I said I would not swear he was not the man—that was the next day after the burgulary—I did not hear Law's voice—I was wrong in say<lb></lb>ing that I did, I thought you meant this man's voice—at the time the female servants came down stairs the man and I were fighting at the foot</p>

               <p>of the stairs—I don't think I gave him any blows after he turned to follow the maids up stain—I had the poker in my hand, but I don't think I used it—I don't know which of the servants had the candle, they were together—they did not turn round immediately, they faced the man, and said "What is the matter, whatever is it"—I said, "There are thieves in the house"—and the man said, "I am not a regular burglar, but this man has insulted me, and will not let me go now "—the women then turned round, and ran up stairs screaming, taking the candle with them—I don't know whether the small light in the kitchen had been put out before the servants came down, I think it most have been—my lamp was alight on the pantry table—I did not put it out at all, it was knocked out by the man, perhaps ten minutes before the women came down—I think the man put out the lamp in the kitchen, or it might have gone out of itself; it had not been used for a week or two—I have said that had I met this man in the street, I should have hesitated to give him in custody; I should have looked at him fancying he was the man; but I might have had a scruple about giving him into custody—that was the only doubt I had.</p>

                  </hi>. I am postmaster of Bingold West, near Colchester—the prisoner's father and mother live there—I know the prisoner—he came down to his father's house in June—it was in the former part of June, the Whiteide week—I did not see him till the middle of the week—be then had a mark on his nose, and one of his eyes was black—the mark on his nose was wound, more of a braise than a cut—it had not ft Moody appearance—it was across the upper part of the nose—I think it must have been done several days—he remained there about three weeks—we had some conversa<lb></lb>tion about the marks on his face, and he told me they were done from an accident by a cab knocking him down in the street—he did not say where, but I supposed he meant in London.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you remember the Derby-day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I never to Epsom Downs, or heard of them—we have a club at our place—they meet on Whit-Tuesday to have their dinner—I cannot recollect the day I saw him; it might be the middle of the week—I cannot swear that I did not see him on the Tuesday, nor yes that I did—I can't remember the day; it was some time in that week—I believe it was after Tuesday—I did not any one of the name of Grover down there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, E</hi> 12). I took the prisoner into custody on 25th July, about 9 o'clock in the evening, at 28, Weston-street, Bermond-sey—I was in plain clothes—I told him I was a police-officer, and I should take him into custody for committing a burglary at 32, Harley-street, about the first part of June—he said, "That is near Cavendish-square"—I said, "Yes it is"—he said, "Ah, I know the b—that has put you on to me; it is quite true I am living with his wife, but you will' have to prove I am the man "—I said, "I will give you every opportunity of being identified"—be said, "Very well"—I searched him, and found this life-preserver in his left breast-coat pocket—there was a woman in the house whom I have known for some years—I had a letter in my possession which I got from Grover, the husband of that woman—this is it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am clerk at Millbank prison—I am acquainted with the prisoner's handwritings—I have seen him Write two or three times—on 2d May and on 12th May last, he wrote his name "William Atkins," nothing more—I always see them sign book for any moneys that they may receive—I have become acquainted with the character of his handwriting so far as the signature is concerned—I had to pay him money, and to take his signa<lb></lb>ture</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I was examined before the Magistrate when Law was taken into custody—I there described the struggle I had with the man—I spoke of striking the man blows; and to the best of my knowledge I said I gave him a clincher at the finish, or something of that sort—I saw that in the newspapers.</p>

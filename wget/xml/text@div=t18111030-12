I held him until the watchman came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him throw them away. - A. I heard them go down, there was no one by at the time. I never lost sight of him. I told the watchman that he had robbed me, and that he had thrown the seals down just as I laid hold of him, and if he would look with his light he would find them within a couple of yards, where he was standing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You stated at the Mansion-house what you have omitted to-night, you there said you were met by three persons that were running. - A. They were walking. I met three persons, the prisoner came first, the two others were close behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted that you had no opportunity of observing the face of any person when your watch-chain was snatched away. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that the person snatched your seals away what became of the other men. - A. I left them behind. They came up when I had hold of the prisoner, they kept walking behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you other persons taken up on suspicion. - A. I had one person taking up on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you two men taking to the watch-house. - A. Yes, the other two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you charge three men with robbing you. - A. I told the watchman this man robbed me, I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300011"></xptr>him there were three men in company.</p>
               <p>Court. You have told the story here now as if there was only one man. How came you not to mention to us about three men - A.At they were acquitted, I did not think it necessary. The prisoner was a short man, the other was tall with large whiskers. There was no pushing at all.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Cornhill ward. About eleven o'clock I was calling the hour, the prosecutor called to me to take charge of the prisoner, I took hold of him, he said he had been robbed by this person, he said</p>
               <p>"give me a light, my seals are thrown down just here." he said he heard them fall. I found them in the road, I gave them into the young man's hand, and he gave them to the constable. At the watch house he said there were two more concerned, he thought they wanted to rescue the prisoner from him, I asked him if he should know the two men that wanted to rescue him, he said he should know them, they came up to the watch-house door, I fetched them in, he swore to one, we had him before the Lord Mayor, he could not swear to the other, he accused him of attempting to rescue the prisoner from him, he said he shoved against him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This is a curious story altogether, watchman, have not you heard him a while ago swear that neither of the men offered any violence to him. - A. That is what he told me at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. He told you different at the watch-house. - A. He did so.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner was searched, did not you find some of the work that belonged to Messrs Rundle and bridge. - A. There was some work found upon him.</p>

            . I am the officer that took the charge. The prisoner was charged by the prosecutor of robbing him of the chain and seals, the other man was charged with being an imaginary accomplice, he was detained, and discharged the next day by the Lord Mayor. This is the watch-chain.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and gentlemen of the jury, with all deference to you, I unfortunately had been into the Borough on business, I was returning home through Gracechurch Street, some man run against me and shoved me against the prosecutor, having property about me, and fearful of danger, I walked faster than otherwise I should. this man accused me of taking his chain and seals, which I knew nothing of till the constable asked me my name and put it down in the book. Mr. Prior swore positively to me, the watchman went out and took two others. I know nothing of the parties, nor they of me, one of them was detained, and discharged by the Lord Mayor; Mr. Prior, through malice, or I cannot say for what swore to me. I was a peaceable subject of his Majesty passing at the time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

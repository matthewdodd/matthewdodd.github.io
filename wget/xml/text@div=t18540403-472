                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Harefield. On Saturday night 18th March, I was in the tap room at the Six Bells public house, it Ruislip, in company with George Rogers and William Brown—the prisoners were there—I knew them by sight, but did not know their names—I was not drinking with them—I pulled out my purse to pay for what I had—that was between 10 and 11 o'clock—Lavender said, "Mate, your pone seems rather heavy"—I said, "There is not much in it, besides a few half-pence"—I left the house at 11 o'clock with Rogers and William Brown, And went across the fields towards Harefield—when we got over the stile into the road Rogers left us, and went into his own house—the boy (William Brown) and I went on, and about ten minutes after Rogers had left us I heard some persons coming behind me—I slackened my pace whilst they overtook me, and Lavender and one of the other prisoners, I cannot say which, passed me—they walked along just before me, and the other behind me—as I was going on he came up opposite me, and began pushing up against me, reeling from one side of the road to the other—he came up against me five, six, or seven times, and then began sparring round me, and saying, "Will you fight?"—that was either Tobutt or Bray—I said, "I don't want any fighting, there is plenty of room for you and me along the road without pushing against me, I want to go on home about my business"—I attempted to go on again, and either Bray or Tobutt stepped behind me, put his foot against my leg as I was walking on, and I fell down on the road on my face—after I was down the three men got across me, there was not a word spokes—I said nothing to them or they to me—the hands of the one who threw me down, were in my left pocket; he did not find anything there, and he thrust his hand into my right pocket And took my purse—</p>

LOGIE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time did you go into this public house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About half past 10 o'clock—I do not know how many persons there were in the room, not above six or seven at the furthest—I am sure the three prisoners were in the public house—I had two pints of beer to drink; I had called in at a public house on Ruislip-common before—that was a mile further back—I had three pints of beer there, between me and the boy; I had, perhaps, two pints of it—the boy is thirteen years old—he was not drunk in the last public house—he had a piece of fat bacon at Ruislip, and that made him sick—he had very little of the two pints of beer, I took the lion's share of that—I had not been in any other public house that day—I had no spirits, I was perfectly sober—there was not a word spoken while the men were robbing me—I did not say anything to them, because I was underneath them; I was glad to get away from under them as soon as I could—I had not left the public house above twenty minutes when this happened—I am sure the prisoners are the three men that came up to me—I do not know which of them it was that walked behind me; there was a moon, but it was dull, it was not out bright—I am sure it was not Lavender that walked behind me, because he is the shortest of the three—I thought so then—I had known them before, by sight—they are labouring men, living on Ruislip-common—Rogers was in the public house when I got there, and he left with me—I never said I did not know the men that robbed me; I said I did not know them exactly, not to know their names, but if I were to see the three together I should know them—I should have known Lavender singly, and Bray; I did not exactly take notice of Tobutt in the public house—I was at the Six Bells on the Sunday night; I went into the tap room; I did not see any of the prisoners there then—I could not swear whether Bray was there, because I only went in and had a pint of beer, and went away again—I did not make any alarm about this till the Sunday evening; I mentioned that I was robbed, but I was not hurt, and I would have put up with the loss—I told the man I lodged with, and I mentioned it at the Six Bells next day—I was not drunk on the Saturday night, far from it; that was not the reason why I abstained from mentioning it to the policeman till the Sunday night.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Harefield. I am thirteen years old, and am a labourer; I am no relation to the prosecutor—I was with him at the Six Bells on Saturday evening, 18th March—I saw the three prisoners there in the tap room, I did not know them before; I remember the prosecutor taking his purse out to pay for the beer, and Lavender said, "Mate, your purse seems heavy"—I left the Six Bells with the prosecutor and Rogers—after Rogers, left us, as we were going home the three prisoners came up—they wanted to fight Brown—he was going to walk on, and one went behind him and threw him down, and all three fell across him, and took his money from him—I could not see what they did, I was a little way from them—I did not see the purse at all—I saw the three men run away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you been at the public house with James Brown before the one at which you saw these men? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I had some beer there, and also at the other house—I was very sick, the landlady took me</p>

               <p>out of the room; I was not tipsy—I was frightened when the men came up to Brown; I did not keep close to them—Brown fell on his face, and they held him down on his face, and then got up and ran away—I do not know which of the three came up first—I am quite sure it was one of them—I was examined before the Magistrate; I heard that there were three men—I never had any doubt about the prisoners being the men—I was first spoken to about going before the Magistrate on the Tuesday, by Clark the policeman—he showed me the three prisoners—I do not know how much beer I took that night.</p>

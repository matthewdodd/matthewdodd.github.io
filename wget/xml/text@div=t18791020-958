                  </hi>. I live at Abbey Terrace, West Ham—on 19th September I was with some other boys sitting on a gate in Blind lame, West Ham—Darby and Barnes were there—f saw some people with guns there—I saw the prisoner; he had a gun—we were not chaffing him or joking—he said he would send us home—we got off the gate, and ran, and whilst we were running he fired the gun—I did not see it fired; I heard the report; I felt something strike me in the head and legs—I was about 50 yards off, I only guess at that—the ground is level there, but it is a little higher than the fields at the aide—we were on the flat, and so was the prisoner—I was afterwards examined by Dr. Kennedy; he took a shot out of the back of my head.</p>

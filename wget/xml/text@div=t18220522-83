            , who keeps a coach and waggon office. Parcels are constantly brought there to be sent into the country. I believe the prisoner to be the man who brought me a parcel, directed to Mr. Williams, watchmaker, Kingston; he brought a printed ticket with it, as if from the Swan with Two Necks, on which was a charge of 4 s. 8 d., and desired me to take care of it; I told him no coach went that day, but a cart went in the afternoon, and it might go by that. I paid him the 4 s. 8 d. and locked it in my desk, and sent it next day by our porter. it was afterwards brought back to me, and unsealed in my presence, it contained two tiles and some paper. I saw the person at the Mansion House two days after; I am sure that was the person who brought it, but the prisoner is dressed different now.</p>

            . I am a book-keeper to Mr. Waterhouse. The ticket produced is not from our office, it would easily deceive a person. The prisoner had been in our employ about a month before. I was at the Mansion House when he was taken; he is the man Mrs. Tanner made this charge against.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS addressed the Jury on behalf of the Defendant, stating that he was instructed to say another man had sent him with the parcel.</p>

On the night of the 26th of January, about ten o'clock, Mr. Creed called on me, and stated something, in consequence of which, next morning at eight o'clock, when Seaton came to work I called him in, and asked where he went last night after he left work; he said to the Welch Harp, public-house, to get a pint of beer - I said,</p>
               <p>"Did you go anywhere else;" he said, No, and persisted in it. I put him aside, and called Hatt, who was also my porter - he said he went to the Red Lion, public-house; I said he went somewhere afterwards; he said, Yes, he helped Thomas lock up the stable, but took nothing with him. Seaton then came up, and said, if I would forgive him, he would tell me all about it; I said I certainly should punish him-he said he had stolen a can of oil, and that it was old sediments, which had been at the wharf at the water side, and was going to sell it for cart grease; I said if it was that sort, it was fit for my cart, but I went to his house, and found the can hid in his cellar, full of sperm oil. I believe it to be Hatt's only offence. Seaton had 21 s. a week.</p>

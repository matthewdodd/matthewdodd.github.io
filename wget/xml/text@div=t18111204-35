            . On the evening of the 19th of November I was going with Mr. Blackwell from Warwick-court, Holborn, to Skinners-street, Somerstown. I set out of Warwick-court rather before five, it was just dusk; Mr. Blackwell took hold of my arm.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you - A. A <rs id="t18111204-35-viclabel192" type="occupation">master bricklayer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18111204-35-victim365 t18111204-35-viclabel192"></join>. We came arm in arm together until we crossed the <placeName id="t18111204-35-crimeloc193">New-road, Judd-place, Somerstown</placeName>

I felt my watch go immediately he struck me; I said to Mr. Blackwell, one of these fellows has snatched my watch out of my pocket; Mr. Blackwell said, there they go; the other one ran away, the prisoner walked on. I went after the prisoner and catched him by the collar, he put himself in the attitude of fighting I said you have stolen my watch; he said, no, I have not got your watch; I said I do not suppose you have got it. A person came out of a door and said, is that you Mr. Smith; I said, yes. The prisoner then said I know you Mr. Smith, and you know me very well; I said, I do not know you from Adam; he told me his name was Dobbins, he lived in Chapel-path. He said he was willing to be searched; I said, I believe there is no need of searching you now, you have given your partner the watch. I let go of him. Some people said he lived in Chapel-path, I said I should find him the next day. The next morning I went to enquire if such a person did live there, I found he did reside there. I went to Hatton Garden and got two officers, and on the 21st he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch again - A. No, nor the seals.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Were you sober - A. I was as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner seems to be a strong active young man, what sort of a man was the man that ran away - A. A shorter man than him.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were sure as you have sworn to-day that the prisoner was the man who struck you on the breast and took your watch why did you let him go - A. People came forward and said he was the man that he represented himself to be, and my friend was a little terrified; he said, let him go, we shall be murdered presently, they have given up his name. That is why I gave him up. After I was struck I never lost sight of the man.</p>
               <p>Q. On the next day did not the man at the bar go to your house and ask you why you should propagate such a report - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he go to your house on the 21st in the morning to make some demand of you - A. He did; I was present.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you then ask him what time of the day you might find him at home, he replied you might find him at home all day - A. The prisoner came to my house again, I told him I would wait upon him at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040028"></xptr>his house as I knew where he lived, because the officers were not come at that time; the officers in a few minutes after came to my house; I said the young man has just been here; we went down to his house and found him at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that there is a reward of forty pounds - A. I have heard so. I do not know the fact.</p>
               <p>MR. BLACKWELL. I am a master taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 19th of November going with Mr. Smith from your house towards Somers-town - A. Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. You got to Judd-place near Somerstown, did not you - A. Yes, it was rather dark: as we began to cross the road in the sweeping path I saw these two men coming to meet us about the middle of the road, Mr. Smith rather gave way for them to pass; at the mean time that he gave way one of them struck him on the breast and snatched his watch from him. There were two of them, the tallest man was next to Mr. Smith, and it was the tallest man that gave the blow to Mr. Smith in the breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner and say whether you know him - A. It was the tallest man; I do think it was the prisoner. We never lost sight of him after he gave the blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any body else in the road except you two, and these two young men - A. Nobody else at all. Mr. Smith ran after the prisoner when he had only got about four yards off. I do not know which way the other man went.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Smith ran after the man that he supposed had struck him were there any other people in the road - A. I saw no one crossing, nor in the path, untill after we took him, there were some immediately then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Smith lay hold of the prisoner - A. Yes, I did, and the prisoner said he had not got the watch; he gave an account where he lived, and his name, and then Mr. Smith let him go. I thought we were somewhat in danger; he gave an account where he lived; some girl or woman came up and said he lived there; we then let him go. I am quite sure the prisoner is the man that Mr. Smith laid hold of and there were two men met us; I am quite sure the prisoner is one of them; I never lost sight of him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I only know that I took the prisoner in company with Cook, my brother officer. I apprehended him at his own lodgings, No. 1, Chapel-path.

Mr. Smith and the prisoner had a few words together, the prisoner said you have not got your watch, you can do nothing with me, I shall be acquitted. I searched his person in the apartment, I found nothing but his working tools.</p>

My mother came up in the room and the officer took my watch; my mother said, what is the matter Thomas; I said, I do not know, you see what these gentlemen are doing; I said, he has taken my watch, thank God he cannot hurt me because it is my own, and I have paid for it.</p>
               <p>Stanton. I took his watch, I have restored it to him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

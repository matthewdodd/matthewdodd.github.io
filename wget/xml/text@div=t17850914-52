               <p>Court. Now, Mrs. Colless, you may stand up, and with great propriety mention what you was going to mention before? - From a girl of that innocent appearance and age, I asked the pawnbroker's man how he possibly could, as to my knowledge he did, receive things from her with different marks, and at different times, without asking her how she came by them; he said I was a very impertinent woman, I said, I hoped not, but I said I knew he had more in his possession, though he basely denied it from a supposition that the girl would deny<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140078"></xptr> it also; he said I was impertinent to come and teach him his busines s, why did I not get a search warrant; the constable was present. I told him upon his peril to stir out of that shop, till I got a search warrant, he sent a little boy, who upon my honour, was not gone out of the shop half moment, I said, Sir, I will not believe that child, it is your place to search; he again abused me, and insisted he would not, I told him I would make him, he dared me to do it; I went home and was ill, I went to the girl and told her the consequence, she said, she had not pledged anything at this man's shop, I went back again, he said he would be upon his sacrament he had nothing more. he utterly denied, and swore upon his oath he had not; I was more irritated with the pawnbroker than the girl, and three nights ago, I went to the house of the pawnbroker, I cannot say I was in temper, I then said to him, Mr. Payne, I had not the happiness of seeing you before, I acquit you of ill behaviour, provided you as an honest man, and a man of feeling, and a fair man, will give up the shirts, you have in your possession four shirts; the man immediately looked at his master, and said, we have no shirts; Payne himself behaved very ill, he likewise refused one of my spoons, and swore he had but one, and in opening a pair of stockings another spoon was found.</p>
               <p>Court. You have done very right in exposing to the public the conduct of this pawnbroker, it may therefore be worth considering how far Mr. Payne may yet be the subject of prosecution himself, his man who has been examined cannot, but Mr. Payne may.</p>
               <p>Lightfoot. My Lord -</p>
               <p>Court. Sir, your own conduct is sufficient, this is not the first time in which your conduct has appeared to the Court in an improper light: if you had not been admitted to give evidence, I should have directed a prosecution against you: the Court will keep an eye both upon you and Mr. Payne, I assure you.</p>

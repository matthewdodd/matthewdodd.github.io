Plunket and Leader, in St. Paul's Churchyard—I was taken there by one of the directors—I then attended at the Mansion House on three occasions—the defendant was there under remand on those occasions—during that time I received this letter from Mr. Pryor: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Gaol of Newgate, 22nd July, 1878.

               <p>learn with great surprise that you intend to prefer a charge against me for embezzling 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Before you go further in the matter I think it right to acquaint you with the facts; you handed my 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the Building Society, and I entered it and initialled it in a pass<lb></lb>book and gave it to you, and entered your name and address on a slip of paper, intending to hand this slip of paper to the Society's clerk on his return. On looking for the paper in the course of half an hour, it could not be found anywhere. I put the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with other moneys of the Society into my desk, and told Captain crowe of the circumstances, and subsequently handed your 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over to captain Crowe, with 2, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides. He paid this 2, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the Hamp<lb></lb>shire Bank in my presence to the credit of the Society's account You called at the offices of Mr. Crowe about the 3rd July; you were told to wait until the 9th July, when there would be a board meeting, and it was hoped that captain Crowe would be well enough to attend and explain the circumstances. In the mean time Captain Crowe has not recovered, and I have been arrested. If this board meeting had been held, on Captain Crowe's statement the directors would have sanctioned the withdrawal of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at least I am informed that Captain Crowe is at the seaside suffering from a sunstroke, but if I knew his address I would write him. However, I have told you the facts. I understand I am remanded this week without bail, in conse<lb></lb>quence of this intended unfounded charge, and I shall certainly hold you personally responsible for damages if you proceed further before you verify or falsify these statements. The Bank have commenced a prosecution which they cannot sustain, and they are now seeking extraneous aid to bolster up their charges. Rest assured, madam, of the safety of your money. For nine years I have been manager of the Lombard Building Society, and never have my accounts been found wrong, and it would be singular if yours should be the only case out of the many that have passed through my hands that have been dealt with improperly. I am cruelly persecuted by the present adminis<lb></lb>trators of the Bank, and not because I have taken any of their money, if so I ought to be punished, but simply because they desire to get rid of me without giving me the moneys due to Mr. Do give these statements an investigation before you plunge yourself into false statements and me into further trouble."</p>

Assuming that was not so, there is an end of the case, and I think there is an end of the case as to the larceny with regard to the property of Miss King, because there is no evidence to show that at the time the prisoner took this money into his possession he then had it in his mind to convert it to his own use. He had authority to receive. His duty was to pay over to the cashier, but he had an authority, if he thought fit to exercise it, to lend the money to the Lombard Bank, of which he was manager. The question is whether he did lend it to the Lombard Bank or did account for it in the alternative to the cashier, or whether he appropriated it to his own use with a view personally to take the benefit of it and to conceal it</hi>.</p>

On 27th, 28th, and 29th June last, I was solicitor to the LombardBank I received a letter from Mr. Wontner, Mr. Pryor's solicitor—I wrote in reply—I have not found the letter—I was only subpoenaed his morning. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I have seen my clients on the subject of your letter of the 27th threatening to take proceedings against them for moneys alleged to be due to Mr. Pryor, and also for damage by the late prosecution taken against them. In reply there to, I have to suggest that with regard to the matters referred to in the first part of your letter, all questions of account be referred to two independent accountants.")I received the letter referred to there from Mr. Wontner—Mr. Pryor had made a claim against, the Bank that they were in his debt—I forget the extent—several matters were mentioned in the letter, some were matters of account—I believe <hi rend="italic">it</hi> was over 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wrote my letter after communication with the Board—a special meeting had been called in consequence of Messrs. Wontner's letter, and I was instructed to write the letter which has just been read—the contemplation on all sides was to refer the matter to arbitration, except the threatened execution—I know that gentleman standing there with the black moistache—his name is Mr. Bernard Bowler—no doubt he was made shareholder to the extent of five shares in order to institute these roceed<lb></lb>ings;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187810210060"></xptr>
               <p>that put an end to the arbitration—I believe Pryor was given into custody the same day I wrote that letter—I think Bowler was made a shareholder the same week, and I was at the Board and protested against him—he brought a charge first of all against Mr. Pryor for assault at the police-station—these other charges grew gradually—Mr. Pryor had knocked him down for his impudence, then he made this charge—early in the year some difference of opinion had arisen between the new directors of the Bank, and the old directors who were trustees of the Building Society—previous to these differences, money from the Building Society, or received on account of the Building Society, would, as a matter of course, go at once into the offers of the Bank—I recommended the trustees of the Building Society not to allow their money to remain at the Lombard Deposit Bank, I thought they ought to seek other investments—I advised that a banking account should be opened elsewhere—several banks were mentioned, and eventually the Hampshire Bank was agreed upon, and an account was opened in the names of two of the trustees of the Building Society, Mr. Sleeman and Captain Crowe—I cannot fix the date, but assuming the account was opened on 18th February, moneys received by Pryor ought to have gone into the Hampshire Banking Company—after my instructions in February Mr. Pryor was reducing the amount of money he held on account of the Building Society by the Bank, that was by my suggestion—it was a question of thousands at first—at the time when I suggested that they had no right to leave funds in the hands of the Lombard Bank they had 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I said as trustees they were personally liable, and the funds bought to be put into some sounder investment—the account was reduced very considerably, to a few hundreds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was not present when the account was opened—I cannot tell you when the Building Society ceased to pay money into the Deposit Bank—prior to the opening cash might have been paid into the Deposit Bank up to the 18th February, because the Bank kept the same staff of clerks as the Building Society, and all sums must have passed through their hands—I do not know whether Pryor was a salaried clerk of the Building Society—I do not think he was—he was manager—some arrangement was made that the Building Society should receive certain interest from the Bank for the business which was carried on—it was Pryor's business originally—I do not know that he was paid by the Building Society—he was paid by the Bank <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I have not compared these notes carefully—I see the name of Matthews on this one—the "S. E." looks like Pryor's handwriting; I would not like to say positively—I form no opinion upon it—if I had been asked at first whether it was Pryor's writing I should probably have said no, but I do not like to say that in the face of the other evidence—if I had not heard the other evidence I would not say so—I would not say so now—the writing of, Matthews and Keith are certainly distinct—having expressed no opinion with regard to the clear signature I should not like to express one on the other note—I could not recognise them.</p>

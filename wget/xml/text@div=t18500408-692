                  </hi>. I live at Tottenham. On 23rd March I put a sovereign, a shilling, and four halfpence in a basket, and gave it to the prisoner—it was to go to my father, at Edmonton—I told him there was money in the basket, to take care of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Pepper, a carrier. The prisoner was in his service also—I saw Mrs. Cowie give him the basket—she told him to take care of it, as there was money in it—he put it into the cart—we went on to London, and stopped at different places, and delivered parcels—while I delivered them I left the prisoner with the cart—he delivered them sometimes, and then he left me with it—the basket was in the cart till I gave it in at Mr. Barnard's, to a woman—I told her to take care of it—there was money in it—it had a lid—I did not observe that it had been opened.</p>

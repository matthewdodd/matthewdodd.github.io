                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alexander Sutherland, who is abroad; I live in Grove-street, Bethnal-green. In August last I oc<lb></lb>cupied the two parlours on the ground-floor of No. 10, Norfolk-street, Globe-road, Shoreditch, in a house kept by a Mr. Evan Hall—I went to Scotland at the latter end of June, and staid there till the 11th of August—before I left I locked up my rooms—while I was in Scotland I received a letter from my son, in consequence of which I came to London the same day—I had taken the key of the front-room with me, and padlocked the back-room, and left that key with my daughter—when I came to London I found the front-room broken open—I missed a table-cloth and a great variety of articles besides—the table-cloth and other things were in that room when I started for Scotland—sixteen locks had been broken open—the room-door had been burst open, and the padlock was opened, which I had locked when I went to Scotland—the value of the property I lost was at least 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—this is the table-cloth—it is one of the articles I missed from the room—it is worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know either of the prisoners.</p>

On Monday, the 14th of March, I went with some officers to the Rum Puncheon public-house, in Rose and Crown-court, Moorfields—Sayer kept the house—when I went in I did not find her there—I found Packer behind the bar acting as land-lord or master of the place—soon after Sayer came in—I went up stairs with them, and searched a chest of drawers in their presence, and found in it this table-cloth—I asked Sayer whether it was her property—the said it was—Packer did not say any thing—I took them into custody, and lodged them in Featherstone-street station—the next day, in the course of conversation, I almost forget what it was, Sayer said, "I can only ac<lb></lb>count for the table-cloth in this manner; it must have been brought there by Packer when I had a supper;" and in the washing up she supposed it must have got into her drawer with other things—Packer was not present when she said that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Welch, of Greenwich. The prisoner is married to my daughter, and does not live far from my house. On Monday evening, the 24th of Nov., I was at home washing, and heard a noise, and his wife screaming—I ran out through my yard and through his yard into the alley, and he was beating her as hard as he could with his fists—I came up and said, "Oh, you brute, don't kill her"—he said, "You old b—, I will <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for you"—he hit me on the face—I put up my hand, and then he hit me in the ribs, and broke three of my ribs—I staggered about, and then fell down—I do not know how long I remained there, but my husband came and lifted me up, and carried me in doors—some women followed me in, and got me to bed, and my husband went for the doctor—I was three weeks and never left my bed, and could not be moved in my bed—either two or three of my ribs were broken, and I am very bad now, and hardly able to be out of my bed—the prisoner and I had not had an angry word that day—he often beat me before, and once before he broke my ribs—that is four years ago last Aug.—I had given him shelter in my house about a month before he did this—on the Saturday before he had come and broke my back-door in, and beat me and gave me a kick—I do not know what it was for—I never said an angry word to him—I only said it was time he was in his bed—it was between twelve and one o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> On the Saturday she says I broke her back-door open, my wife took my bed and bed-clothes into her house, and when I came home at night I had nothing to lie on but the bed sacking: there is a thoroughfare from my place to theirs; I went and saw one of my children lying on the bed on the chairs, and I laid there with the child; her husband fetched in two policemen to turn me out; I told them it was my bed, and they told me to be quiet, and stop where my bed and my family was.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at home on Monday, the 24th of Nov.—I saw my wife go to the house where the prisoner lives—I saw him striking her and knocking her down—I went for a policeman but could not see one, and when I came back she was down in the alley, and he said, "I have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> her"—he called her a b----b----and a b----w----when he was striking her—I did not wait, but ran for the police—when I returned, he was going with another man and taking two little pigs away—I took my wife in and laid her on the bed—she said, "Go and fetch the doctor, I am a <hi rend="italic">donner</hi>," and I did so directly.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I was called in on the 24th of Nov. to attend Mary Welch—I found her in bed, and almost in a state of insensibility—I examined her side and found marks of recent contusions, and on a more minute examination I found fracture of the seventh and eighth ribs on the right side, immediately under the external marks of violence—the injury was such as to make her in a state of very considerable danger, in consequence of the fracture of the ribs penetrating the pleura—she was in such a state of danger that I considered it advisable to call in another medical man—I attended her about four years ago, for a similar accident caused by the prisoner.</p>

I carry on business in partnership with my son as auctioneers, at 135 and 138, Power Street, Woolwich—I conducted a sale of furniture at a private house in Shooter's Hill Road, on 25th July—Gunn attended and bid for a number of articles to the amount of 66<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I entered in the ordinary way; and he paid no deposit—he came to my office on 28th July with five cheques in his hand and presented this one to me—it is a cheque for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and asked me for the difference between</p>

I am surprised at the banker. There was only a few pounds short of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the hands, and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in on Wednesday. Of course, he had not got that when your cheque was presented. I enclose his letter. This is the first time in my life, and I hope it will be the last. Of course, I do not do any more business there.

                  </hi>. I live in High-street, Camden-town. On the 24th of December I bought two pigs of Deane and Hatton, in Rose<lb></lb>street—when they were about to be taken away, I said to the scale-man, "Who has got my pigs?"—he said, "I don't know," and he brought the prisoner—I believe the prisoner said, "I am working for George"—I said, "In that case you may go on"—he had no orders from me to take them any where, but he said he was working for my porter George, mean<lb></lb>ing George Clements—I had paid for them to Messrs. Deane and Hatton.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Deane and Hatton.

               <p>Court. What do you sell them at? - The common price of standard moss roses is 1 s. a plant; we also missed between two and three dozen of mazerions out of the nursery.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of them? - The value of them is three pence a plant, that is the usual price.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you yourself see these things? - I saw them the day before.</p>
               <p>What time of the day? - The afternoon.</p>
               <p>When you missed these mazerions and moss rose plants, did you observe whether the ground was fresh pulled up? - They plainly appeared to be pulled up by the roots, there had been rain in the fore part of the night, so that it might be seen that they had been tore up, and likewise the print of the shoe; I had seen them in the afternoon, and almost till dark, I was from time to time in this garden.</p>
               <p>Court. There was nothing missing over night? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you believe if these plants, and shrubs had been gone in the afternoon, that you must have had notice of it? - Certainly my Lord.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was it that your man told you of the print of the shoe? - As soon as it was light, about seven in the morning; after I missed these plants I rather suspected it must be somebody that had worked for me, and knew my ground; and the prisoner having worked for me twice, and hearing he had sold some plants in the neighbourhood to one Ross, I had him apprehended the same morning, I found at Mr. Ross's two dozen mazerions and half a dozen standard roses; when the prisoner was apprehended he had not the same shoes on, but he had shoes at home with nails in, which were the same print as was in the ground, my servant has the measure of them, I can swear the plants are my property.</p>

               <p>Court. Had not you a pretty good bargain in these things? - If they had been properly taken up, they might have been a good bargain.</p>
               <p>Court. What would they have been worth then? - Ten or a dozen shillings I believe at least, but they were toin and sadly used.</p>
               <p>How did these plants appear to you to have been taken up? - I could not tell, they appeared by the roots to have been pulled up.</p>
               <p>If these plants had been yours, and you had properly taken them up, should you have dug them up or dragged them up? - I should certainly have dug them up, and very carefully too.</p>
               <p>What did you think of this matter when you saw these shrubs appeared to be pulled up by the roots? - I had no good idea of it, but I had bought things of the man in the open market before, which took off the suspicion off their being stolen: - I told the Justice I could buy the mazerions for 2 d. a plant out of the nursery, and that the moss roses were worth 1 s. a plant, if they had been taken up properly.</p>

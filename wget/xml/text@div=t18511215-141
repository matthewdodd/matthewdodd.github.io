                  </hi>. I keep a baker's shop, at Bermondsey. On 11th Dec. the prisoner came there, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening—she asked for half-a-quartern of flour—she then said she meant a half-quartern loaf, not flour—I gave her the loaf, and she gave me a half-crown—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 31/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—she then asked if I had any 41/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bread—I said I had no cheaper—she said she would not have the loaf, and wanted her half-crown back, which I gave her—she gave me back 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 31/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and went away—as I was in the act of taking up the money, to put it into the till, my sister said something to me, and took the bad shilling, and went out—the bad shilling had not fallen with other money—it was at the front of the till—the other silver was at the back—my sister took it out and examined it—I am quite sure that the shillings I gave the prisoner were good, I had tried them with the trier, as I always do when I take money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Skinner; we live at Star<lb></lb>corner, Bermondsey. On 11th Dec. the prisoner came to our shop—she took up a tea pot—I told her it was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and she gave a half-crown—I went to the counter, and found I had no shilling in the till, nothing but sixpences—I went to give her the sixpences for change, and she refused them—she said, "Give me a shilling"—I called my husband, and asked him to bring me a shilling—he took one out of his pocket—the prisoner then said, "I want 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—I said, "No; your tea pot was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—she took up the shilling from the counter, and put it to her mouth—I said to my husband, "Take care of your money; she has changed that shilling; I saw her do it"—she said, what did I mean by that—my husband said, "Has she <hi rend="italic">done</hi> me already?"—Crane came in, and told us to stop the prisoner, as she had given her a bad shilling—the shilling that the prisoner put down my husband took up, and tried it immediately.</p>

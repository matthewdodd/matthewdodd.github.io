                  </hi>. I am a bird fancier of Little North-street. On a Sunday morning, about three weeks ago, between half-past 1 and 2 o'clock, I was going towards my home; and when I was in Little North-street I was knocked or pulled down—somebody got hold of my throat, and I became senseless—I had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket, and eight pawn tickets—I was very much injured in the chest, and was taken to an hospital—I was the worse for liquor—I also lost six birds and five cages—I know nothing of the prisoners—I only felt myself knocked backwards—I lost my duplicates, but they were afterwards found in Carlisle-street—my shillings were all gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a police-constable, but I have since left—I was on duty on this night, in Salisbury-street—I saw the prosecutor in Little North-street—I heard a cry of "Murder" and "Help," and I ran from the corner of the street where I was standing, into Little North street—I saw Ireland running there—I saw the prosecutor lying on his back—the prisoner Bryan knelt across his throat, he was feeling the prosecutor's body with his hands—he had got one knee across his throat—Welch was kneeling on his body—I did not see exactly what part of his body, or whether he was kneeling by the side of him; he was on his knees—the other two prisoners were feeling about his body, kneeling and stooping down, turning his pockets out—when I came up Bryan ran one way, and the other three ran the other way—Ireland went after the three—I went after Bryant—I did not succeed in taking him—I went to catch him, and he stooped down and got out of my way—I saw another officer after him so I gave it up, and went back to the prosecutor—I had known all the prisoners before—at the time I saw them I knew them to be persons I was acquainted with—I knew their names—I said who they were, and gave their names to the other constable—I went back to the prosecutor—he was in a senseless state then—he was lying on the ground on his back—I assisted in taking him to the station—the inspector desired us to take him to the dispensary—when he came back from there he could speak a little, a word now and then—the charge was entered against the prisoners, and he signed his name.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Kimpton.</hi> When the policeman took me, we met this policeman, and he said, "Oh, you have got one," and he said, "Yes"—he said, "Go up the next street and you will find a man lying there drunk, pick him up and bring him down to the station"—and when the inspector asked him at the station if he had any charge to make he said he knew nothing of us, and then they took him into a little room and wrote out a charge against us. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> When I saw you, you were being taken by the other man—you were brought back to where the man was lying down.</p>

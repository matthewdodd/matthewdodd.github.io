            . I am servant to Mr. Sowerby, of St. James's-place. On the 25th of November, about ten minutes past five o'clock, the gig stood at a door in <placeName id="t18221204-140-crimeloc724">Greek-street, Soho</placeName>

As I stood at the horse's head I heard the cry of Stop thief! I looked round and saw a number of persons looking towards the square, the prisoner was brought back. I saw a man pick up the coat which I found to be my master's.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I was going through Greek-street, and saw the gig at the door - I saw the prisoner take the coat from the gig and run towards the square. I pursued, calling Stop thief! he dropped it at the corner of Soho-square. I did not loose sight of him only while I stopped to take it up - he was secured; he asked me to forgive him, and said the coat was given to him.</p>

            . I am a painter. About a quarter past five o'clock I saw the prisoner pull the coat from the gig. I did not see Temple - I called Stop thief! and pursued, I saw him drop it, and took him without losing sight of him, he asked what we wanted with him, he said it was not him, and then that a man gave it to him.</p>

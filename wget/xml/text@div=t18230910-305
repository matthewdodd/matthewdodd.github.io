I left my situation in Hertfordshire, a week ago last Monday; and on Friday, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I was going to Smithfield market; the prisoner Wood overtook me, and asked me if I was going to the market; I said, I was; he said he was going there too, and asked which was the best market-day; I said, I rather thought Monday; he said, he was come to town on business, and thought he would stop to see Monday's market; we walked nearly through the market, he asked me to take a pint of beer; I said, with all my heart, I was going to follow him into the house, but he said, No, we will sit down outside; he went in and fetched a pint of beer, we sat down and drank it. I said, I would be a pint, but we had no more; he carried the pot in and paid for it; he then said, we would walk on further, if I had no objection, and then have another pint; we went through the market, then walked away till we came into the <placeName id="t18230910-305-crimeloc1641">New Road</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18230910-305-crimeloc1641" type="placeName" value="New Road"></interp>

                  <join result="offencePlace" targOrder="Y" targets="t18230910-305-off1638 t18230910-305-crimeloc1641"></join> - he asked me to go in there and have a pint - I said Yes, with all my heart - and so we went in. A young man was there, who was afterwards with the prisoners. Fearby came in while we sat there. They seemed all strangers to each other. Fearby said he was a countryman, and had come to settle some business of money that had been owing for sixteen months - that he had applied to a gentleman, who he mentioned, who got 550 l. for him, and 550 l. for his brother - and that his brother was very infortunate in getting into a coach, he fell down and put his instep out. Wood said there was no such a word as infortunate, and wanted to lay a wager about it - they laid a pot of beer - Fearby paid for it, and then said we all three looked like poor men, and could not shew 10 l. a-piece. I said I had not 10 l. with me, but I expected some up from home by that day's post, and could produce it in a short time. Fearby then wanted to lay 3 l. to 1 l. that we did not each produce a 10 l. note by one o'clock. Wood and the young man pulled out their 10 l. each; and the young man walked with me up to Tottenham-court-road, where my parcel was coming, but the letter had not come. We left the prisoners at the public-house. Fearby then said he would give me till two o'clock - I said I would stand to the wager. The young man said he wanted to go into Tottenham-court-road to get change for some money, and would go with me; the prisoners said they would go too; we all four of us went; and they went into an inn while I went for my letter - it was not come - I asked my friend to lend me 20 l., which he did. We then went back to the inn, and shewed Fearby our 10 l. each, all three of us; then he said he would lay another 1 l. that we could not shew another 10 l. I then shewed him another 10 l.; he then gave into the hands of 
               <persName id="t18230910-305-person2637">Wood</persName>
             a 5 l. note, as he said they then wanted to go and see the balloon go off - and so did I. They got a coach, and we all went in it; the young man looked out of the coach, and said he knew of a convenient place where we could have refreshment. Fearby had said before that he would treat us with a bottle of wine, and change the 5 l. note; so we went to the inn. Wood and the young man asked if they might go up to a private room - the landlord said we might have the parlour - and we went into the parlour. Wood called for a pot of ale and a glass of shrub and water - and the young man said he would go and order some steaks, and while they were cooking we could have a game at cards. They asked me to play - I said No. Fearby and the young man played three or four games at all-fours; the young man had four chalks out of five. Fearby dealt the last deal, and begged to be excused to go out for a moment after he had dealt his cards, and wished us not to look at them. The young man took up his hand of cards, looked at them, and said it was such a good hand, he was sure to beat. Wood said</p>
               <p>"Let us lay him a wager about the game;" so when Fearby came in, the young man said he would lay him a wager - oh, he said, he would lay him any thing - that he would beat either 10 l. or 20 l. a-piece if he liked; then Fearby said he would lay 60 l. to our 20 l. each; he got up and put his money in a hat on another table - the others put down theirs, and wished me to put down mine - so I did, into the hat with the others; they then wanted me to play the hand for him, and said play how I would I was sure to win; I said I would not, three or four times - but they very much persuaded me, saying I could not lose - and so I played and lost - then Fearby said he had won the game, and got up and took the hat. Wood beckoned me out of the door - I went; and he said he should be back in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, if I could step with him; and when I returned into the room they were all gone. I went to Hatton-garden, and they were taken up that evening.</p>

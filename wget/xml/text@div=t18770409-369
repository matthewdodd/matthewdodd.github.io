                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant M</hi>). On 20th February I went to the prisoner's house and asked him if he could account for the persons who had been poisoned—he said no, he could not, it was a mystery—I afterwards went to his employers', some keys were given me, I searched some drawers which were pointed out to me, I found no white arsenic, but some salts of lemon—I took him in custody on 9th March and charged him with attempting to destroy his own life and his wife's and four children's by putting white arsenic in the teakettle—he said "I am innocent"—when he was waiting to go before the Magistrate he volunteered a statement—nothing had been said to him before—he said "I have had a deal of trouble since I got married, my eldest daughter has been ill for some months, then my wife, my father-in-law having been in a mad-house, and now this; there is One above who saw me through those difficulties and I am sure He will see me through this," or "these"—I said to him at the station "Have you anything to give me, have you a knife?"—he said no, they keep them from me."</p>

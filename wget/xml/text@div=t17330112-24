He struck her no more after the Light came, but turned her Face up and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173301120012"></xptr> stamp'd about, and fell on his Knees, and said, my dear Betty, I fear I have killed you, but if I have I will never leave you, but will freely be hanged for you.

I found her in Convulsions, and in a manner expiring; I told them she was a dead Woman, and it was in vain to do any Thing to save her, and she died about 4 in the Afternoon. I view'd her afterwards, her Head and Body were full of Contusions all over; I never saw any one in the like Condition. There was a large Cut in her Head, and her Head was 'swell'd in Comparison as big as a Peck. I opened the Muscles that cover the Skull, and found a large Quantity of extravasated Blood lying on the Sutors, which were in a manner separated. I believe there might be a Pint, or a Pint and a half of Blood, for I took out several Handfuls. This extravasated Blood must have been caus'd by external Blows, and having such an Effect upon the Sutors must have been the Cause of her Death, and therefore I had no Occasion to open the Skull, or examine any farther.</p>

My Wife was always drunk two or three Days in a Week; and that same Night I found her with a Man that she kept Company with, and so I got her Home; and I own I did beat her, because she was drunk, but in going up Stairs she and I both fell down.

She said she had lent four shillings and sixpence upon them, and was afraid of getting into trouble. I said, I would make enquiries about it.</p>

At the corner of Great Ormond-yard he said, that out of that house he and Trubshaw had got a couple of large pictures, and said they were in the possession of this Mrs. Shaw; he asked me if I knew where to dispose of them for him? I told him I would see what I could do for him, because I lived with a picture frame maker in the Strand; when I was taken up I shewed Jealous the house they were taken out of.</p>

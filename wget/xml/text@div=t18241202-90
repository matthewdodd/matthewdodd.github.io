            , in Whitechapel, and when I got home I pulled my coat off, and gave it to my child to take up stairs - whether I shifted my pocket-book to the pocket of the coat, which I then put on, I cannot say; I did not miss the pocket-book till the next Friday. I saw the 5 l. note in possession of my wife last Sunday. I had made no mark on it, but I know it by a mark, which was on it.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife; he complained of missing his pocket-book, but did not tell me there was any money in it, as he did not wish to fret me; he said there was a 57 l. bill in it, which could be recovered. Last Sunday afternoon I looked into the prisoner's box, which was open, and found in her pocket a purse, containing a 5 l. note. I got an officer, who shewed her the note; she said it was her own - that she had had it five years, and received it from her former mistress. The officer asked her how she got it into a note - she said her former mistress gave it to her for small cash.</p>

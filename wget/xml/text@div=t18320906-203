               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long was he in your employ? A. About six weeks as porter; he gave me notice to quit on the Monday morning after I kept the note back - our porters occasionally employ journeymen carters as they pass along to take goods to the wharfs, but not by our order - that is the cheapest way, but I never saw him employ them; I believe our porters have done so, by their charging it in their books - they sometimes have a heavy load, and give a man 3d. or 6d. to assist if he is going their way; they frequently charge me for "a pitch;" they have no authority from me to employ chance carters - when I have found they had got a cart to assist, when they did not want it, I have objected to their charge, and they have said the load was too heavy.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many of these do you sign in a day? A. I may sign fifty - I enter them in a book, which I have here; I cannot say whether the prisoner is the person who paid me 1s.</p>

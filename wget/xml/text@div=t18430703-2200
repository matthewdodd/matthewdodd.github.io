                  </hi>, jun. I am the son of Thomas Machin, and live in High-street, Deptford. On the 11th of May my attention was called to an adver<lb></lb>tisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper, which I copied myself—this is it.—(<hi rend="italic">Read.</hi> "£100. A respectable and intelligent person, with the above sum at im<lb></lb>mediate command, may be introduced to the situation of librarian to a public institution, now vacant by the death of its late possessor; the salary and per<lb></lb>quisites of the office amount to upwards of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, besides a resi<lb></lb>dence, with coals and candles; the appointment is for life. Address to Liber, National Address Office, 282, Strand.")—I answered this advertisement the same day, and in reply received a note referring to F. W. Knight, 7, Great Union-street—I went on the 15th to No. 7, Great Union-street—I there saw the prisoner, F. W. Knight—he answered to the name of Mr. Knight—I told him I came respecting an advertisement in the paper, and respecting the note he sent me—I produced the note, but I do not think he read it—he said he was agent to the secretary of the institution, who had the power of appointing the librarian, and the secretary required a premium of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the appoint<lb></lb>ment—he told me the hours of attendance were irons ten till four o'clock, that it most be a member of the Established Church, and a person of good cha<lb></lb>racter, for which I must give testimonials—next day I took him two testimo<lb></lb>nials, one from a clergyman, and one from another person, and on the morning after I took him another—he said he would lay them before the secretary that evening, and he would let me know the next morning by the first post—the result was, that on the next morning, Thursday, I received this note—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "7, Great Union-street, Borough. Sir, I have laid your testimonials before the secretary, and am happy to inform you that he approves of them; so that there remains nothing now for you to do but to come up to town, take the reference from me, pay the deposit of one-half the premium to the secretary, and be appointed to the office. Please to call by half-past eleven to-morrow, Thursday, if possible, as there are several other gentlemen very anxious to immediately close the business, but whom the secretary does not consider so eligible as yourself. In haste. Yours, &amp;c. Francis William Knight."—I went the same day to Union-street—I saw the prisoner—he said the same as in the note—I had asked him for a reference, to know if he was a respect<lb></lb>able man, and he gave me this address, "James Smith, Esq., Wood-street, Lambeth-walk"—I went there and inquired—the servant said he was from home—while I was there Mrs. Smith came, who turned out to be the prisoner Sarah Knight—she asked my business—I told her, and she said she could give me every information no doubt, she knew Mr. Knight was a straightforward, honourable man, I could place any trust in him—she said Mr. Smith was from home, and showed me a piece of paper, in which was an advertisement—she said he was down at that place transacting some business, and Mr. Knight she had not seen for some time, that Mr. Smith had been away some days, and she did not know where he was residing—I then went back to Knight's, at Great Union-street—I told him I had been, and Mr. Smith was from home—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184307030076"></xptr>
               <p>he seemed surprised—I asked if he could not give any other reference—he said he was very sorry, but he had not previously told him of my coining—he gave me the names of two other persons, but I have not applied to them—he said the business must be settled that afternoon—he was so certain I should be sa<lb></lb>tisfied with my reference, that he had prepared the agreement during my ab<lb></lb>sence—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Memorandum of agreement between Thomas Machin, Esq. Jun., of 3, High-street, Deptford, and Francis William Knight, of Great Union-street, Borough. I, Francis William Knight, hare this day received from Thomas Machin, Jun. Esq., the sum of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., being the quarter part of the premium of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., agreed to be paid by the said Thomas Machin, Jun., Esq., for the situation of librarian to a certain public institution in the metropolis, the fixed salary of which is 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., per annum, with perquisites amounting to about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more; as, also, a suite of apartments, and coals and candles. It is agreed and expressly understood, that the said 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is lodged in my hands as a deposit, to insure the good faith of the said Thomas Machin, Jun. Esq., and that should I not succeed in installing and establishing him in the said situation, as above described, on or before Monday the 29th of May, I shall return the said 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the said Thomas Machin, Jun. Esq., without any charge or deduction whatever; the said Thomas Machin also, binds and obliges himself to pay the balance of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., when he shall have been *** in the office, as witness our names, this 18th day of May, 1843. Signed Thomas Machin, Jun.; Francis William Knight."—On that I gave him fifteen sovereigns and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—he said he would meet me at the Berner's Hotel, Berner's street, Oxford-street, at seven o'clock, with the secretary—I went there and waited two hours—I neither found the secre<lb></lb>tary nor Mr. Knight—I spoke to the proprietor of the hotel, and mentioned my own name—he said there was a letter left for me—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"To Thomas Machin, Jun. Esq. My dear sir, I am very sorry to inform you, that a prior engagement, which I was not aware of, prevents Mr. Mon<lb></lb>tague from seeing you to-night, at seven o'clock, as appointed, but will see you to-morrow afternoon at four o'clock, without fail, to dine with him at the Berner's Hotel. I am, my dear sir, yours, &amp;c., <hi rend="smallCaps">FRANCIS WILLIAM KNIGHT</hi>. Thursday evening."—I went on Friday and waited three hours—I did not find any dinner, nor any secretary, nor the prisoner—on Saturday the 20th, I went to 7, Great Union-street, where I had always seen the prisoner—I could not find him there, he had left on the Friday morning—on Saturday, the 10th of June, I went to 57, Clarendon-street, Clarendon-square—I found the prisoners there—they went by the name of Knowles—Sarah Knight opened the door—the officer went in first—as soon as he got in, I and another gentleman knocked at the door, and went into the parlour—the prisoner seemed very much struck, and shook to a great degree—he wished to pay something down if I would not give him in charge—I said I could not, as I had been before the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Francis Knight. Q.</hi> What other reference did I give you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Alfred Roden—I paid the money on Smith's reference; you gave me another reference to a Member of Parliament, but I could not go to it; I should have paid the money if you had not given any other reference but Smith's; I asked for an<lb></lb>other reference, because I thought I should have liked, if there had been time, to have applied to some one else.</p>

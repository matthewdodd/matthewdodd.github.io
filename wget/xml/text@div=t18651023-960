                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Douglas, a hair-dresser of South Audley-street—on 13th September, about nine in the morning, the prisoner came in and asked for a sponge for a gentleman—he said, "You have been very kind to my father and mother, and I will do you a good turn I had known him before—about three hours afterwards he came again, and produced an order for two brushes—he said he had got a situation as Colonel Guisett's valet, at 3B, Albany, and he wanted these things—he chose articles which came to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I let him have them on the faith of that order (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "3B, Albany. The sponge will suit; let the bearer have two hair brushes, one left hand, enclose bill; I will send you the money in the morning. J. C. Guisett, Lieutenant-Colonel. Mr. Douglas, South Audley-street.")—the prisoner came again on 15th, and ordered some more things, and brought this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in change—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Messrs. Glyn, Mills &amp; C. Please pay the bearer on demand 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. J. C. Guisett")—that cheque was returned, marked "no account"—when he came with the cheque he asked me to send the things down the next morning, but he called again in the evening, about six o'clock, and said that the gentleman wanted to see them that very night, and I gave them to him, and he took them away with him.</p>

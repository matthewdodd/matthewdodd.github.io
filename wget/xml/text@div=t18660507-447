On 14th April I was on duty in the Haymarket in plain clothes a little after 5 o'clock, and saw the three prisoners walking together—they went into Arundel-street, where the women sat down on the ground, and Dunn stood in front of them talking to them for a quarter of an hour—they got up, and Dunn walked six yards in front of them into Newport-market, then into Lichfield-street, where they stopped talking some considerable time—Dunn then went in front of them into Garrick-street, St. Martin's-lane, where they joined again, and went into Chandos-street—Dunn then kept nine or ten yards in front of them, and I saw him give Jones some postage stamps—she went into a public house and offered them for sale—they then went into Maiden-lane, and all walked up and down—I saw Dunn give Jones half a crown—she handed it to Downes, and they went into Mr. Collins's, a butcher's—I went in and saw Downes put down a half-crown—the woman who took it up said something, and gave it back to her<lb></lb>they collected some money between them, and afterwards got their meat, and joined Dunn, in sight of the shop—they then went into Wellington-street—I got two policemen, and went and seized Dunn at the corner of Waterloo-place—he wrenched himself away from me, and made a blow at my head, but I stooped, and then put out my foot and tripped him up—he took three half-crowns in paper from his waistcoat pocket, and kicked them into the gutter—they turned out to be bad—he was taken to the station, and a half-crown, twelve shillings, four sixpences, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. were found on him.</p>

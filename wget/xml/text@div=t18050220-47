             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker, I produce a counterpane wrapped up in a coarse apron: On the 21st of January, about half past one o'clock, the prosecutrix called at my shop, and from information I received from her I was upon my guard; in about half an hour after I received this information, the prisoner at the bar brought the counterpane to pledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of his person? - A. That is the man (pointing to him), and from the information we had previously received, we had every reason to suppose it was the counterpane that had been stolen; we took him to Marlborough-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200044"></xptr>and he was committed; the prisoner said in our shop the counterpane was his own property.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that counterpane? - A. Fifteen shillings. (The property identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am not the person that took the counterpane from the child, I was in a public-house, the corner of Duke-street; there was a young man there who had been a gentleman's servant, but was then out of place; he had yellow buttons to his coat; the little boy said at Marlborough-street I was not the same person who took it from him, so I was taken in very innocent.</p>

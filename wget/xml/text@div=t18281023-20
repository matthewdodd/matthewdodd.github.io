            . I am a watchman of St. Martin's-parish. On the morning of the 16th of October, I was alarmed by Mr. Barron's family - his house is in St. Martin's-in-the-fields; I observed the back part of his premises, leading to Kinnerston-alley - there is a high wall there; I saw Mahoney drop from the ledge of that wall, and immediately secured him - he had no shoes on; I gave him to Mosely and Watkins: I afterwards went round to the front of the premises for a light - I went through the house; I found a silver table-spoon out of the back-kitchen window, in the yard, that morning, and have kept it ever since - I afterwards searched the dust-hole of Mr. Simpson's house, which joins the prosecutor's, and found Morris in that dust-hole - this was near five o'clock in the morning; I could not observe any tract on the wall - I found three centre-bits, three skeleton-keys, a large knife and the stock of a centre-bit on his person: I saw Boucher pick up a crow-bar in Barron's yard, about four o'clock - there was a piece cut out of Barron's back-kitchen door, and I saw Mr. Barron apply the centre-bits, found on Morris, to the door, one of them fits it; I have brought the pannel here; I saw him fit the crow-bar to the kitchen-door - it corresponded; I took Morris to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You found these things before Morris was in custody? A. They were in his pocket; I found the spoon before he was taken - I have always said I saw Mahoney drop from the wall; there is a little privy in the yard - I do not know whether it belongs to Mr. Barron's premises; it is in the alley - the wall encloses none but Mr. Barron's premises - it encloses all his own yard.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you were examined before the Magistrate and said Mahoney came over the wall, did you say you heard any thing? A. Yes - I heard a rattle like a chain.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BARRON. My house is in the parish of St. Martin's-in-the-fields. On the 16th of October, about ten minutes past two o'clock in the morning, my servant alarmed me; I employed the watchman to search my back premises, and I searched myself - I found the back-kitchen window wide open - and the kitchen-door wide open: a piece of the pannel which had been cut with a centre-bit and wrenched out, was lying by the side, the hole would admit a hand to withdraw the bolt - I searched the drawer in the kitchen, and missed five tea, two table-spoons, and two forks, all silver - I applied one centre-bit to the pannel and found the end had been broken off by boring against the bolt - it corresponded with the marks on the pannel, and the crow-bar fitted some marks on the door; I afterwards saw Mahoney at the watch-house, and asked him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230016"></xptr>tell me the truth, and asked who was concerned with him; I afterwards saw Mr. Simpson's dust-hole searched, and saw Morris after he was taken out; I was looking over the wall and saw him - I did not see him in the yard before the dust-hole was searched - I saw the stock of a centre-bit, three centre-bits, three skeleton-keys, and a clasp-knife taken from his person; I saw Wells, the watch-house keeper, fit a pair of shoes on Mahoney's feet - they appeared to fit him - this is my spoon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose they would fit any man of the same size? A. They might: I have no other Christian name, nor any partner; the house is my leasehold.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Martin's-in-the-fields. I took Mahoney to the watch-house, and on the way he begged very hard for his liberty - I did not hold out either threat or promise to him; I only said"What have you done with your shoes?" he said he had lost them, and that his crime was very frivolous, for he had only been having a lark with a young woman; about fifty yards from the watch-house he made a sudden stop, and said "I cannot think of going to the watch-house, let me have my liberty;" I said I could not; he said he would reward us, or any thing - I put him into the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the morning of the 16th of October, I searched Mr. Barron's premises, and found this pair of shoes in the back part of his yard, and a dark lantern in the yard; I fitted the shoes on Mahoney's feet, they fitted exactly, and the mark on his stocking corresponded with the top of his shoe.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear Wardley say whether Mahoney came from the wall or the privy? A. Over the wall.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Barron. On the 16th of October, I was called up about three o'clock in the morning; I searched the back of the premises - about five o'clock, I heard somebody coughing in Mr. Simpson's premises - I jumped on the wall, heard a noise there, and found Morris in the dust-hole; I found this crow-bar in Barron's yard, about twenty minutes before I found Morris.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you say, at the office that you found the keys? A. The watchman and I drew them out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MAHONEY to JOHN WARDLEY. Q. On your taking me in the alley, you opened the door which parts the privy from the court, and said that is the door you came out of? A. I did not; nor did I tell the Magistrate so - I said, "I have got one without his shoes" and heard Bruckner say,"I have got the shoes here;" I did not spring my rattle, one was sprung by my order; I had hold of you at the time Moseley, Wardley, and Briggs came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MAHONEY to BRUCKNER. Q. Where is your beat? A. From St. Martin's-lane up to Long-acre; I only had to run across the road when I heard the alarm - I was let in immediately; I was in the yard about ten minutes before I found the shoes, and said I had found them when I heard the watchman say he had taken a man.</p>
               <p>MAHONEY'S Defence. It is clear I could not be ten minutes crossing the yard from the house; if the shoes are tried, it will be plain they are two inches too big; they are new - and is it likely I should buy new shoes so much too big? - on the night of the robbery I was at home; a friend called and said "Will you go and have a share of a pint of beer;" I went and spent the evening with him, till half-past twelve o'clock; I drank freely, and went out in my slippers, and getting into company with a parcel of men and girls, I quarrelled, and in the row, lost my slippers; the watchman came up, and I followed; I was taken short coming by this court, and went to the privy - and as I came out Wardley laid hold of me: I said I had only been having a lark.</p>

               <p>Prisoner MORRIS. I throw myself entirely upon the mercy of the Court.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MAHONEY to SARAH MANSELL. Q. How many times have I been in your master's house? A. I cannot say; but you were there on Twelfth Night and slept there, and for two nights before - I never left you alone in the house on Sunday morning, or at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MAHONEY. I leave it to you to say whether it was better to sleep there and rob the house, or to break it open.</p>

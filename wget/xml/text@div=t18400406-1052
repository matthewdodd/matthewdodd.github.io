                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Gray, and am a laundress, living in James-street, Lower-road, Islington. I was taking some clean linen home in my cart with my lad, at half-past nine o'clock on the 7th of March—I was going to stop at Bucklersbury, to leave a basket—I felt the cart give a sudden sway—I turned, and there were two men with my basket—I cannot say who they were—they dropped it—one ran round the Poultry, and the other round Bucklersbury—this is the basket—(<hi rend="italic">look<lb></lb>ing at it</hi>)—it contained the things stated—I picked it up immediately.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to Mrs. Gray. About half-past nine o'clock this evening, I was driving the cart—I got as far as the Poultry, and saw the prisoner and another lifting the basket out of the cart—I am sure the prisoner was one of the men—he had breeches and gaiters on—I did not see his face—I followed him—he stopped at Grocers'-hall—I said, "If I see a policeman I will give you in charge"—he hit me on my nose, ran up against a post, and hit his head, and then when he came back he knocked me down again—I pursued him—he ran up the Mansion-house—I saw a policeman, and gave him in charge—I did not lose sight of him all the way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a green-grocer, and five in Wellington-street, Waterloo-town. On Saturday morning, the 20th of August, just about one o'clock, I was coming home from Ratcliff-highway, where I had been to order some coals, at Smith and Sharp's wharf, which is about a mile from my own house—when I got to the corner of Osborne-street, Brick-lane, not a quarter of a mile from my house, the prisoner Watson came up to me and hustled me—She caught hold of me to rifle my pockets—Sheen and Ragan came round me directly, both together—they were all round me, hustling and feeling about my pockets, and a man crossed the road and knocked me down directly with his fist—I was senseless for a moment—when I came to myself, Sheen had got hold of my throat, so that I could not make any noise or get assistance—I found them with their hands in my pocket, trying to cut my pocket out—I had hold of my watch-pocket to save it, and they cut my hand—they got my watch-chain, but not my watch—they were all three round me—Watson got ray property from me—She had my pocket in her hand—I held her fast, with her hand in my pocket—I lost two sovereigns, five half-sovereigns, and from 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, my silver watch, the chain, seals, and key—as soon as they heard the policeman coming, the man ran off with Sheen and Ragan—I held Watson fast, and the policeman came up and took her—the watch, chain, seals, and silver, were found on her—Sheen and Ragan were taken next morning, at Worship-street, while Watson was being examined—I could not make any outcry because I was throttled—I called out "Police" very faintly, just as the policeman was close to me—I had seen my money just before in High-street, Whitechapel—I was feeling in my pocket, to feel if it was all right, as I knew a very bad set walk there—I never saw the prisoners before—I am certain they are the women—I did not purpose speaking to either of them—I had had a share of two pots of half-and-half with two shipmates—that was all I took after dinner—I dined about half-past one—I cannot exactly say I was sober, nor was I intoxicated—it was between eight and nine that I fell in with my ship<lb></lb>mates—I had finished drinking a little after twelve.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About one o'clock, on Satur<lb></lb>day morning, the 20th of August, as I was going along Osborne-street, I saw Watson go towards the prosecutor, and directly saw two other females come up—I saw a wrestling between them all—there was a man crossing the road—I ran up that instant, and directly I got up the prosecutor <hi rend="italic">sungout</hi> "Police"—I saw them all three down on the ground—I did not see what the man who crossed the road did—they seemed to be all confused, as if they were all wrestling down on the ground—the prosecutor was standing up—directly I ran up, the women and the man ran away—the prosecutor was down—when the man crossed I saw the prosecutor fall down, and the women were down upon him—I did not say that the prose<lb></lb>cutor was standing up—when the man crossed the road I saw them all five fall down, the prosecutor, the three females, and the other man—I had heard the prosecutor call "Police" in a very low voice just before I got up—two of the females and the man then ran away, leaving Watson be<lb></lb>hind—I asked the prosecutor if he had lost any thing—he said he was robbed of his watch—I asked where it was—he said, "Here is the watch, which she has just put into my hand"—I asked if he had lost any thing—he said he had lost a chain, but never mind that, and be gave her into custody—I took her to the station—She was searched, and she gave me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I could not tell, from their manner, whether they were tumbling all to<lb></lb>gether in fun, or whether one party was robbing the other, for it was so very quiet till I happened to come up—I thought they were fighting—the prosecutor had been drinking a little, but was collected, and knew what he was doing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Fashion-street near Osborne-street, on the morning in question—I joined Wallace, and saw the prosecutor walking behind Watson, who was in Wallace's custody, going towards the station—She had something in her hands, under the end of her shawl—Wallace said something, and dragged the shawl off her left arm, and she, then threw something down from her right hand—I saw Wal<lb></lb>lace pick it up—it was a steel chain, a metal seal, a key, and the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's pocket—I had hold of her arm at the time—the pocket was on the chain—the other two prisoners were taken next morning—when the pro<lb></lb>secutor first saw Sheen he did not know her—it was rather dark in the station at the time—there was a gas-light at the lower part of the room—I took her, and asked if he knew her—he said not—next morning he saw her by daylight, in the open street, and said that she was one of the party—he appeared to have been drinking, but was quite collected.</p>

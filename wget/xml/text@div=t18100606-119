             paid me a dollar for rent; she laid it on the counter before me; I thanked her; the prisoner came in to shew me some fish, and at that time there were no other person besides the prisoner in the shop; he reached his arm over the place where the dollar was, and shewed me the fish on a platter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that platter held over where the dollar was - A. It was. There is a ridge all round the counter, it could not have fallen off. When the prisoner was gone I missed the dollar.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner continue with you - A. About three minutes. I could not go after him and leave the shop, my husband was out; about two minutes after my husband came in; I went after him, and came up to him; I accused him of taking the dollar; he said he had not seen a dollar to day; I told him he had better come back. He came back to my shop, and while he was standing in the shop, Mr. Man, who keeps the next wine vaults, came in, he went into the back parlour, beckoned us to come and speak with him; my husband went. Mr. Man said he took a dollar of the prisoner; we were persuaded to let him go and sell his fish, and in about three hours he was taken and committed.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MAN. Q. You keep a liquor shop in Gray's-inn lane - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come into Mr. Reading's shop while they were accusing this man of stealing a dollar - A. Yes; I told them the prisoner had left a dollar with me about a quarter of an hour before I went in; he had a glass of gin and left the dollar untill he had been round with his fish, and then he would return; he frequently left money; he is in the habit of taking a good deal of copper; he brings the copper and takes the silver away.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go into Mr. Reading's shop - A. Mr. Reading came into my shop to see if he had been there.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took charge of the prisoner; Mr. Man's wife gave me the dollar in the presence of Mr. Man. When I got the prisoner down to the office his brother in law came to him, he said, you had better pay the dollar back; he began to make an oath in the Irish language.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Crossland. Was it such a dollar as that - A. I cannot speak to the dollar, it has the same appearance; it was not a very bright one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent; I know nothing about it. I went to Mr. Low's house after I left Mrs. Reading, she came there to me and asked me for the dollar; I turned my pockets out in Mr. Low's house; Mr. Low said you had better go back and have yourself examined at Mr. Reading's house; I did, and was examined, and then they sent me about my business.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am an officer of Mary-le-bone. On the 20th of December, at eight o'clock in the morning, I was at the end of Circus-street, turning into York-street, and met Pearce with this trunk on his shoulder - Hitchman, who was four or five yards behind, smiled, and said,"How do you do, Webster?" I knew them both before, and think I have seen them together, but am not positive; they were both going in one direction. As soon as Hitchman spoke to me, I seized Pearce with the trunk - Gibbs came up directly, and Hooker took charge of Hitchman - Gibbs took hold of Pearce, and I kept the trunk, which Mr. Sansom himself claimed in two or three hours; we found Miss Sansom's name on the corner of a little trunk inside, which led us to Bryanstone-square.</p>

            . I am an officer of Mary-le-bone, and was with Webster - I secured Hitchman - I saw the trunk opened; there was a box in it, with Miss Sansom's name on it; Mr. Sansom claimed the trunk and contents.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>PEARCE's Defence. My feelings will scarcely allow me to enter into a defence on a capital charge, but it is a duty I owe to my wife and sister, and to my late employer, to assert my innocence; if I should fall into any infirmity or error I hope you will not impute it to any negligence. Only a few years since I was surrounded by friends, and every necessary supply, but unfortunate West India speculations entirely brought my father and family to ruin - he lost 1500l. or 1600l., which was confided to a supercargo; he remained in the country till he became insolvent, and was then appointed master of a school at Knightsbridge; I remained with him till his death, and finding I was impoverishing him, I procured a situation at Mr. Nicholson's, in Bond-street, where I was for six months, and then removed to Mr. Stiff's of Jermyn-street; after that to Mr. Slade's of Hanover-street, and after being there two years I went to Mr. Richardson's, of High-street, Bloomsbury, and after sixteen months he recommended me to Mr. Willis, whom I was with six months, when he went to Dorchester; it is only a few months that I have been in this situation; though obliged to work hard to obtain subsistence I was comparatively comfortable, compared to this disgraceful situation. I had on this morning sold a duplicate of wearing-apparel for two half-crowns; I had for three months been unable to gain the least employ - I went to market, and bought a little butter; I went round to different customers to sell it. On the morning in question I went to search for a young man living as footman in Gloucester-street; he owed me a small sum; I was passing down Adam-street into Seymour-place, when I overtook two gentlemen, in one of whose employ I had been - the other was his brother, and in crossing Adam-street I took possession of this trunk from a person. who no doubt had taken it from Mr. Sansom's premises. I solemnly declare, as I hope for mercy here and hereafter, that I never saw it till I received it from the individual in question, who pointed out to me the road which led to my ultimate imprisonment, and made me the dupe of artifice and design; I had not got into York-street when I was apprehended; if I had been conscious of its being stolen I had plenty of opportunity to prevent my going into the midst of the officers - had they not known Hitchman, no doubt I should have passed unnoticed. I was taking the trunk to where the person who gave it me desired me - had I been guilty I would have thrown myself on your mercy, and have stated my distress which led to the commission of the deed, and should have hoped you would have afforded some asylum to an unprotected young man. I have served my different masters with satisfaction. I hope you will consider what I have said as emanating from my heart; my sufferings since my imprisonment have been acute; I am sorry my feelings should so far overcome me - I have struggled against them as long as I could. At the time this occurred I was depriving myself of every comfort - my little resources were exhausted, and I was in a state of destitution, but I have borne it with all the firmness I could, having been promised by a gentleman a situation after Christmas. I now leave my case to your serious consideration, and instead of consigning me to the horrors consequent on incarceration in the cells, and the suspense of waiting for the report, I hope you will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110012"></xptr>restore me to liberty instead of a lingering imprisonment, and probably the loss of life by my sufferings.</p>

               <p>Prisoner PEARCE. Two of the keys open a trunk left at my lodgings, No. 18, Park-street, New-road - one of the latch-keys opens that house; the other opens the door of another house in the same street; here is a letter which was found upon me, which will prove I was endeavouring to procure a situation; I called on Mr. Careless about a situation, who was obliged to refuse it on trivial grounds. I swear, so help me God, I never had the least idea whose property the trunk was, or where it came from.</p>
               <p>HITCHMAN's Defence. I was going to see my uncle, and in York-street I met Webster; I spoke to him - he left me, and ran after Pearce, and said, "We don't want you, you may go;" I could have got away, but I had no inclination, being innocent.</p>

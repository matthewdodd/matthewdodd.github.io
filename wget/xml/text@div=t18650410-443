I told him I would tell him when I was outside—I had a City-sergeant outside—I told him I should take him in custody for a robbery in Milton-street, about a week back, and also for robbing a cripple last Christmas—he said, "You will have to prove the robbery at Christmas, and the other is too long back"—I was present at the Clerkenwell Police-court when the depositions were read over in the prisoner's presence—the pro<lb></lb>secutor made a statement about the prisoner's working—he said, "That is wrong; he never worked with me," but itwas never altered by the clerk.</p>

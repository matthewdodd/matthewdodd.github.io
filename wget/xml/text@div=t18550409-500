On Wednesday, 21st Feb., I was on duty in High-street, Woolwich, about 8 o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoners there walking together—I followed them into Hare-street—I saw Motz go into a pork butcher's shop, kept by Mr. Matthews—he was served, and came out, and I immediately went in and asked the boy what he had</p>

               <p>purchased—a bad sixpence was given to me by John Pembury—I marked it, and showed it to him, and asked if he should know it again, and he said "Yes"—this is it—I came out and saw the prisoners again, walking up the same street—I lost sight of them for a short time—I saw them again under a gateway in Powis-street—they appeared to be looking at something in their hands—they came from the gateway, and I saw Motz go into Mr. Hills', a pork butcher's, in Richard-street—he was there detained by Mr. Hill—I went after Carroll round the corner, and I saw him coming from the gateway the second time—I took him into custody—I told him he was charged with being in company with another in passing a counterfeit six<lb></lb>pence—he said he had done nothing of the kind, and had not been with any one—I gave him into the custody of two persons, and I went and took Motz, who was going down the street—I told him he was charged with passing a bad sixpence—he denied it, and denied all knowledge of the other prisoner—I took them to the station—I went to the gateway, and found this leather purse, and in it six bad shillings and another bad six<lb></lb>pence—the same as those two which I had got from Mr. Matthews and Mr. Hill—on searching Carroll I found 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers in his coat pocket, and one 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece; a small portion of tea, and three pennyworths of tobacco—on Motz I found a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, a halfpenny, and a tobacco box—I have no doubt the prisoners are the persons I saw talking together—I watched them a quarter of an hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Matthews, a pork butcher. I remem<lb></lb>ber Motz coming about 8 o'clock that night for a penny saveloy—he paid me a sixpence, and I gave him fivepence change—I put the sixpence in the front part of the till—I did not mix it with any other sixpences, I am sure—Motz left the shop, and the officer came in in about two minutes; I had not shut the till—the sixpence was there—I took it out and gave it to the policeman—I am sure it was the same that I had taken from the prisoner.</p>

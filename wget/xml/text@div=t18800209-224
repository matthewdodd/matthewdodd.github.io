                  </hi>. I am house and parlour maid in the service of Mr. Tufts—I remember their going out on Saturday evening, 3rd January, about 7 o'clock—about a quarter past 8 I went upstairs into all the rooms, amongst others the attic where I sleep; everything was then secure; the window was close shut down; I cannot say whether it was fastened—I was upstairs about a quarter of an hour; I heard no noise before my master came home—I found my bedroom door locked on the inside; I got another key and opened it; when I went in I found the window open, and the looking-glass had been removed from the table to outside the window in the gutter on the roof—one of the beds had been pulled to pieces; I saw the mark of a naked foot on the floor and some marks on the table under the window; it is a small foot-mark—I gave an alarm, and Mr. Tufts came up.</p>

On the night of 3rd January, about 11 o'clock, I was called to No, 3, St. Luke's Road, three doors from Mr. Tufts'—it was an empty house—I found that the side window in the area had been forced up from the outside by means of a jemmy, the sliding shutter inside the window had been forced, and the socket of the area door which the bolt shoots into had been forced off from the inside—I went up to the top of the house into the attic—I found that window open—there is a parapet outside, about 4 feet high, running along the gutter to Mr. Tufts' house—I kept watch at No. 3 till past 12 o'clock, but saw nothing—the following morning, in consequence of information, I went to No. 9—I found the impression of a naked foot on the attic floor; it was the right foot, and a very small one—I have since examined Charles Armstrong's naked foot; that is a smaller foot, and one that would be likely to make such an impression as I saw—the impression was caused by dampness from the parapet; it was soot and water, it was almost like ink, such as would be made by a person stepping from the outside on to the boards—on the following Tuesday I went in a cab with Sergeant Melville with the male prisoner and a person named Cole, who has since been dis<lb></lb>charged—the prisoner said to Melville in the cab "It is all a fluke that you got me; you have a spite for me; if it was not for that man that bought the dresses to my house on Saturday night I should not be here now."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 2, Bath Row, Great Bath Street, Clerkenwell—I heard of the prisoners being taken into custody on 7th January—I remember the Saturday night before that, it was the 3rd—I saw the male prisoner that night between 6 and 7 o'clock going across Woodford Street driving his horse and trap—the female prisoner was with him—I asked him where he was going—he replied "I shall see you by and by; I am going for some food for the horse," and away they went—I saw him afterwards that night at the Horse Shoe and Magpie public-house at the corner of Bath Row about 8.30 o'clock—both the prisoners were there, and a child in the female's arms—I had not been there long before I asked the prisoner if he had a watch key on him, as my watch had stopped, and he took the key and wound up this very watch that I have in my pocket—it was 9 o'clock then, and I had been there some time—they were there when I went in at 8.30 o'clock—I stopped there till 12 o'clock, till the house was closed—the prisoners were there the whole of the time I was there—I did not see them outside afterwards—I bade them good night and went upstairs—my house was next door—I went to the police-court to give evidence, but was not called—I could mention the names of porsons who were there—I asked them to come, but they would not—Mr. King was there; he has not been here this week.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The Horse and Magpie is not a second's walk from Bowling Green Lane, only like across the road—I did not see the horse and cart at the Magpie—I did not see it after between 6 and 7 o'clock, nor before—I had not seen the prisoner more than about six times since he left the job where I was at work, at the New Law Courts about 2 years ago—I remember this Saturday night quite well, it was the first Saturday in the new year—I went to the police-court once; I don't know whether it was the first or second time, it was on the remand—the prisoners asked me to come and speak for them, being in their company—they sent word out by the' prisoner's brother—he asked ray name, and I told him—I went to the police-court on the Wednesday; King did not go; he had the same opportunity of seeing the prisoner that I had—I had been there half an hour when I asked the prisoner about the watch—I do not know that the prosecutor's servant has sworn that the place was safe at 8.3ft o'clock—the prisoner had never wound up my watch before.</p>

I could not swear whether the baby was with them in the cart; I could not catch sight enough—I halloed after him "Armstrong, where are you off to?"—I had nothing to do with wanting to know where he was going more than any working man does stop his mates—he was not a friend of mine—I was never in their house.</p>

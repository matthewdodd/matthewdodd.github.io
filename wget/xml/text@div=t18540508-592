                  </hi>. I am a former, of Enfield Lock. On the morning of 5th May I got up at a quarter before 6 o'clock—I was not called up—I received information that my stack was on fire, which was within one mile of my house, between Ponders-end and Enfield, in a field which opens upon the towing path, which is a public road—there is a hedge between the stack and the towing path—persons going from Enfield Highway would pass by the side of the river Lea, cross the pathway, and go into the village of Ponders-end—the road and towing path form one, between Enfield lane and Ponders-end, but no farther—when the alarm of fire was given, I went by the towing path towards London; my house opens on the towing path—I met the prisoner on the towing path, about 200 yards on this side of the stack, going in the direction of my house, away from Ponders-end and towards Enfield Lock; he was walking—I said, "My good fellow," or "Good friend, where have you come from?"—he said, "From London"—I asked him whether he walked or rode; he said he walked—I asked him what time he left London; he said, "About two hours ago"—I said he could not reach there under three hours; the distance is twelve or thirteen miles—I told him I must detain him—I took him back with me into the field where the fire was, and he was afterwards given into custody—the top of the stack and three sides of it were burnt; the side which had been cut was not burnt so much—there was an engine there, but a large quantity of hay was destroyed—when I gave the prisoner into custody the policeman searched</p>

               <p>him in my presence, and found some Lucifer matches, some gunpowder, per<lb></lb>cussion caps, and a small cord with a slip noose—he asked him where the pistol was; he said he had none—about two or three hours afterwards a pistol was shown me at my house by William Honor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper's assistant I was on a visit close by Mr. Metcalfs—on 5th May I was out about six o'clock in the morning, and saw Mr. Metcalfs brother standing on a stile; he said he thought there was a fire—I was going in the opposite direction, but I said I might as well walk one way as another, and I went towards the fire; he stopped behind—I went along the towing path and met the prisoner about twenty yards beyond the stack, going towards Ponders-end—he was walking—he returned and faced me, and then came towards the lock, which is near the stack—I said, "Halloo, here is a stack on fire;" he said, "Yes"—I said, "It is a bad job;" he said, "Yes, it was not done without hands"—he walked with me a few yards in the direction towards Enfield Lock—I returned to tell the prosecutor about his stack being on fire—there was no one there then but the prisoner and myself—as we returned we met Mr. Metcalf, who spoke to the prisoner and took him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Joseph Metcalf. About 5 o'clock in the morning, I went to the field in which the stack was, to fetch the cow—the stack was not on fire then—I drove the cow home to be milked—as I was going I met the prisoner on the towing path, about half a mile from the stack, going towards Ponder's-end; that would be towards London—I am sure the prisoner is the man I met—I afterwards saw the stack on fire, and saw the prisoner with my master, who had him till the policeman came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gunmaker at the Royal manufactory, Enfield. I went to see the stack on fire, about 20 minutes past 7 o'clock—I took my little boy with me, thirteen years of age—I saw him pick up a pistol in the field; at least I did not see him actually pick it up, but I saw him rise from the ground with it in his hand, and I took it from him—he is not here—he took it from the grass, about eight or ten yards from the stack—this produced is it—I took it to Mr. Gunner, the superintendent of the manu<lb></lb>factory, who was in the field with two or three others, and showed it to them; there was a cap on it—I unscrewed the barrel, and as soon as I be<lb></lb>gan to do so a portion of powder fell out—I then put a piece of stick in the barrel, and finding it was loaded, I put it in my pocket, and retained it till the police came—I then unloaded it in their presence; it contained two bullets, one of them fitted the barrel and one did not, and a piece of paper had been wrapped round it to make it fit.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody in the field, about a quarter before 9 o'clock; he was standing with Mr. Metcalf, near the hay stack—I searched him there, and found on him some gunpowder, and a cord with a noose to it in his hat, a box of Lucifer matches, and some more loose in his pocket, and some percussion cape, which correspond with that upon the pistol—I have ascertained that they fit the pistol—I found no bullets—I found some wool in his pocket, and this ramrod—I afterwards saw the pistol unloaded, and have the bullets that were taken from it—I had never seen the prisoner before that day—there is no one</p>

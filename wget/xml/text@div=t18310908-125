            . I am a Policeman. On the night of the 15th of August, about ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner in some ground called Shadwell ruins, about forty yards from the prosecutor's shop; he had a bundle, and on seeing me he put it into his bosom: he was going along - I called to him to stop and show me what he had got; but he ran away and I followed him five or six minutes, calling Stop thief! and kept him in sight till he was stopped - I took three pairs of trousers from his bosom and this other pair was in his hand.</p>

            . I was an officer. I stopped the prisoner, who was running as fast as he could; I asked what he had got - he said Nothing - I said I insisted on knowing; he made a blow at me, and we both fell - I got two pairs of trousers from him; he said he bought them for 7s. of a man who hawked them about - he made great resistance.</p>

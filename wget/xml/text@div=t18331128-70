            . I took the prisoner on the 26th of October, in Lambeth; I told him he was charged with stealing a cheque from his employers; he said that in an unguarded moment and tempted by a companion of his he had made use of the checque.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you undertake to say, that his words were not, that in an unguarded moment he had suffered another person to take the letter from him? A. I believe his words were, that in an unguarded moment he had done it, but he should not have done it if he had not been led away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). The circumstances of the case are as follow: - I was sent by the prosecutor to his brother for a letter; I received the letter, with its enclosure (then unknown to me) the cheque; I was accompanied by a young man named Price; when I got the letter Price prevailed on me to accompany him to a public-house, which I to my sorrow did; we went into two or three - while in one of them, I pulled my handkerchief out of my pocket, and with it the letter, which fell on the ground; Price stooped to pick up the same, and did so with the seal broken - Price said he must have trodden on the seal, as it was broken; he then opened the letter and kept it, with the cheque in it; it is here necessary for me to admit that from what I had drank, I had become intoxicated, and was not conscious of what I was doing - while I was in the public-house, Murray, the witness on my behalf, came in, and he will detail what transpired. I, together with Price and Murray, afterwards left the public-house, and we took a cabriolet and drove to Serjeant's-inn, Fleet-street - Price then said, he must go to chambers, and say he should not be there again that evening; I and Murray walked into the Temple to wait for Price - Price joined Murray and myself, and we all went to mine and Price's lodgings, in Moor-place, Lambeth, to dinner; and I have no doubt that it must have been when Price left, as he stated, to go to his chambers, that he went to the bankers in Fleet-street, and got the money for the cheque; as I have since learned that Price had not been in employment at Serjeant's-inn for several weeks before that day. The witness, Finnis will state to you, that I was quite drunk when I came home and did not in consequence eat any dinner, but went to bed, and remained there till nine o'clock - the same witness will also prove that Price was indebted to him for seven week's lodging, and was not able to pay the same and yet immediately; after this cheque was stolen by him, he was enabled to raise sufficient money to pay his passage to New York.</p>

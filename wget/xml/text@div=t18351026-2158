                  </hi>. I am clerk to James Hunter Tuck, and James Homby, coal-merchants, at Pimlico. On the 29th of September I received infor<lb></lb>mation—the prisoner had just left the wharf with a truss of straw which I had directed him to take—he was our carman—he was going to take the straw on his way home—I followed him, and saw him with something under his arm—I asked what he had got; he said nothing belonging to me—I said what had he got—he said a piece of coal—that he had taken it from the wharf—he begged pardon, and said he had a large family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He said, "Take it back, I will say nothing about it"—I was go<lb></lb>ing back with it when he met the policeman, and gave me in charge—my wages were about eighteen shillings a week, and sometimes we work from four or five in the morning till eight at night—I never told him I took it from the wharf—I told tim I had got a lump of coal.</p>

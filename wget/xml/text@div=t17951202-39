               <p>I am a watch-house keeper; The prosecutor and a watchman brought the prisoner to the watch-house, and charged her with robbing him of six guineas, that she swallowed them, and was almost choaked; he said he took one guinea out of her mouth; he said he had thirteen at first, and he took the rest out of her hand, except one guinea that he found upon the shelf afterwards; I searched her and the rooms, but could not find any gold, only 5s. 6d. in silver; which I gave her back again, when I came back from searching the room; the other watch house keeper told me he knew my labour had been in vain; for she told him she had swallowed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The prosecutor met me, and said he knew me at Liverpool; I came from Ireland, and he named several people that I knew very well at Liverpool; he asked me where I lodged, and he walked home with me, and the kitchen being dirty I asked the woman in the house for a candle, and took him up stairs; he sat down on the bed, and talked about people at Liverpool; and he wanted to behave in a very indelicate manner; he sent the poor woman for a pot of beer, and put a guinea upon the table to relieve her, being distressed; and while she was gone for the beer he used me very ill, and tore my cloaths to pieces, till I was almost naked; and I took up the guinea and said, that was the least he could give me for tearing my cloaths to pieces; and he said if I did not go to bed with him he would cut my head off.</p>

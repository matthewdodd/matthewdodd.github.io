I had been out that morning, and was returning home. I was very bad in my bowels, and went out of the path, and dropped to sleep. I am sure my watch was safe in my fob when I sat down. When I awakened, I missed it. I never saw it again until the evening, when I saw it at Marlborough-street. The prisoner was then in custody.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Mulcaster, pawnbroker, in Chandler-street, Grosvenor-square. I look at the prisoner at the bar, and know his person. He offered to pawn a silver watch with me between six and seven o'clock in the evening of the day in the indictment. I had information from Mr. Edwards, and I asked him where he had got it, and he said, he had stolen it. He appeared perfectly sober to me. I left him in the shop, and took the watch to Mr. Edwards' house; Mr. Edwards was not at home; but his wife thought it was his watch. I returned back, and got a constable, and had the prisoner taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I asked that witness if he thought I stole it. I did not say I had stolen it.</p>
               <p>Witness. I am sure he said he stole it.</p>
               <p>PETER GRIST. I am a constable, and took the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>JOHN BURRIN. I was going across the Park with a friend, and saw a person laying asleep, and the prisoner who was outting across the Park went up to him I saw the prisoner stoop, and pull out something, and I could see a blue ribbon, The prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180051"></xptr>overtook us, and told us he had enough to take him to Horncastle Fair; I knew him. He wanted to borrow eighteen pence of me. We went to a public-house together, and there I saw him with the watch. I saw him before the Justice the next day, or the day after.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BOND. Corroborated the account of the last witness.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. We were altogether going along, and I asked Mr. Burrin to lend me eighteen pence, and he gave me this watch to go and pawn, and he said he would lend it me out of the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk-man, living in the Poultry. Between four and five o'clock, on the 30th of December, a person came to my house, and asked to look at some bandannas for shipping—he said Coats and Co., of Bread-street, would pay for them—he requested that four pieces, which he selected, might be sent to Coats and Co., for their decision—I directed a young man to go with them—I cannot swear that the prisoner is the man, he is so much altered—I have one partner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Thomas Smith. I was present between four and six o'clock when the prisoner came there—I am sure he is the man—in the meantime Parker was gone with the handkerchiefs—the prisoner returned to the warehouse, and asked me to show him the best lot of bandannas that Mr. Smith had been showing him—I showed it him—he said he wanted to take a piece to show—I let him have one piece, which consisted of seven handkerchiefs—he went away with it—in about two minutes he returned and said, "I should like to take that piece of the best goods"—I showed him several, and he said, "Never mind, I won't take it"—he went away with the one piece.</p>

                  </hi>. I come from Messrs. Coats and Co.—I know the prisoner. On the 30th of December, he had no authority from me to go to Mr. Smith's—he was brought to me that evening—the porter came to me with some bandannas—I did not authorize the prisoner to go—Barker brought him between six and seven o'clock.</p>

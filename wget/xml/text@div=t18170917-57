               <p>SUSAN PITHOUSE. I live in Seacoal-lane. On the 17th of September, Mrs. Redgrave passed my window; she had a little girl, about two years and a half old, on her right hand - A dray was coming along, the horses were on a quick trot, and touched her arm-she was close to the window; the pavement is about a yard wide-the child was next the wheel; it turned the woman round. A girl brought the child in soon after, and gave it to me-it was very bloody.</p>
               <p>CHARLOTTE EDWARDS. I lived with Mr. Pithouse. I came out, hearing a scream, and found the child lying on the ground with its head against the wheel-the dray was on the pavement-before I could get it up the wheel went against her head; I got under and pulled it out by its legs-it appeared to be dead.</p>

            . I was in Seacoal-lane, opposite Mrs. Pithouse's; I heard a scream, looked over, and saw some oyster shells fall from the window, and a woman under the hind wheel, I called to the driver to stop, which he did immediately; she was between the two wheels, and called out, "let me out;" I told her to get out behind, which she did. I saw the child bleeding on Mrs. Pithouse's arm.</p>
               <p>JOHN WEBSTER. I was in Seacoal-lane, and heard the woman scream, the dray had stopped; the man held the horse by the head-if it had moved two or three inches further it would have been over the woman also. I saw the child brought out from under the dray.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH WEBSTER. I was in Mr. Woodfall's printing-office, in Seacoal-lane, and saw the dray going fast down the lane; as it came towards Mrs. Redgrave's, she pushed the child towards Newcastle-street - the child slipped out of her hand and fell-its feet were off the curb, its head was on the pavement. The wheel went over the neck of the child, and a girl picked it up.</p>

            . I was in Newcastle-street, Seacoal-lane. I heard the dray coming along very heavy down the lane, the prisoner drove it, and another man sat on the shafts. I heard a scream, and saw the girl give the child to Mrs. Pithouse-it appeared lifeless.</p>

             MITRE. I am the surgeon of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. The child was brought there on the 17th of September, between twelve and one o'clock-it was dead. It had a severe fracture on the head. I have no doubt but that was the cause of its death.</p>

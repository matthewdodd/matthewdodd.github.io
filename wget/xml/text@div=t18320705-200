               <p>FREDERICK ESTOPHY. I was in service at the time this happened. On the 13th of June I went to the <placeName id="t18320705-200-crimeloc1052">Unicorn, in Covent-garden</placeName>

            . I am a shoemaker, and was living with Mr. Morrison, at the Feathers; the prisoner came in there about nine o'clock, with some females - I served him with 6d. worth of gin; he pulled out a watch to see the time, and before he went away he asked me to take care of it for him, as he was going with one of those girls; I took it, and soon after Stace came and asked if I knew Johnson - I showed him the watch; in a few minutes afterwards the prisoner returned, and asked for the watch; I said I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050094"></xptr>heard it had been stolen - he said he had bought it of a young man, and he would go and take it; he went away, and did not return - I had known him when he was a waiter.</p>

             (Police-serjeant F12). I took the prisoner, and have the watch.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK ESTOPHY. This is my watch - I am certain it was safe in my pocket when I took hold of the dog.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you come into the house at three o'clock in the morning with some other men, and sit drinking till six in the morning? A. No, it was seven o'clock before I went there - I was sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at the house at three o'clock in the morning: the prosecutor and two other men came there - they drank brandy-and-water; the prosecutor asked me to have some and sing them a song, which I did- we then went to the Unicorn, and got very tipsy; the prosecutor then pulled out his watch - he wanted 9s., and said he would let me have 10s. for it in the evening; I took the watch to the Feathers, and left it there.</p>

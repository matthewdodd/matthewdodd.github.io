            . I live in King-street, Holborn. My manufactory is in Leather-lane. On the 25th of October I missed a brass roller; I went, in consequence of information, on the 27th of December, to Mosher, who lives at Hoxton; he produced it to me; I then went to Marlborough-street, and got two officers, who accompanied me to the factory, where Wayman was at work; I called him up, and told him I had a serious charge against him - he appeared flurried, and asked what it was; I said I had reason to suppose he had been robbing me some time; he had lived two years with me; I said, "Henry, I am sure you have taken that brass roller;" he positively denied it; he said he knew nothing of it; I said, "You have - for I have found it;" he changed colour, and he was much agitated; I said I was sorry to tell him he was in custody; I knocked for the officers, who came in; I said I was very sorry, and should have been glad to have made him a witness, but could not; I did not hold out any promise or threat to him; he then said, that he had taken it - that Flint had asked him to give him one of my embossing rollers; he said he would - and he did give him one; some other conversation took place, and the officers took him. We then went to Messrs. Smith and Summers', Tabernacle-walk, where Flint was at work; I saw him there, but said nothing to him; he was taken to Marlborough-street; Mosher was there with the roller; it had been taken from a room where I keep my machinery; nobody had access to it but my family and Wayman; - a person must go through my parlour to get to it - it is worth 5l.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Schofield to Mr. Royle's, and found Wayman there; no promise or threat was held out to him - he said that about two months ago he did take the roller, and gave it to Flint, who gave it to Mosher; we then went to Smith and Summers', and took Flint; I staid in a coach while Schofield and Royle went into the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was no promise made him? A. No; Mr. Royle said, "Now, Henry, I should like to have made you a witness, but must be led by the officer - now, you can tell me a great deal about my paper;" he at first said he could not, but afterwards stated about the roller and paper.</p>

            . I live in New Glo'ster-place, Hoxton. I am a silver-beater, and make ornamental-paper. Flint owed me 18s. in November last, for some goods of mine, which he had to sell; he brought me this roller as a sort of pledge, on a Monday; I think it was the 6th of November; I was to keep it a month, and if no one came for it, to sell it; nobody came, but I still kept it; I had shown it to a person, but had not sold it. Mr. Royle came to me on the 27th of December; I showed it to him; I took it to Marlborough-street, where he claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What had Flint had from you? A. Some silver paper ornaments; I had not asked him for the 18s. - he did not tell me to keep it a secret; he brought it in his pocket.</p>

On 26th April, about 9 o'clock in the morning, I was on London-bridge, and saw Lawrence—I followed her to Fish-street-hill, where Hill met her, and they went into the Mitre tavern together—they stayed about five minutes, and came out together—I then followed Lawrence, stopped her, and asked her what Peeke's man gave her in that public-house—she took this parcel from under her arm, and said, "Only a bit of tea"—I said, "Is that all you have; as I shall have to take you to the station, where you will be searched?"—she took from her pocket another parcel, and I said, "Is that all you have?"—she said "Yes"—I took her to the station, and she produced two other parcels, amounting altogether to more than two pounds (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then went to Messrs. Peeke's warehouse, and apprehended Hill—while Lawrence was in custody at the station, she said, "I did ask him for a bit of tea, and he gave me a bit of tea"—he said, "And a pretty mess you have got me into."</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Messrs. Peeke's employ—according to the best of my judgment and belief this tea is their property—I am experienced in it—I cannot tell the other—Hill was their porter, and had charge of the tea—I have seen Lawrence several times selling matches—we have frequently bought empty chests of her for several years past.</p>

               <p>certainty to this one sample; there are some particular circumstances with regard to it—it is very unusual for green tea to be put in the loft to which Hill had access, but there happened to be a box 'of green tea, a return package which was opened, and from that this was taken; I know that, because it identically corresponds—I should think you could get such tea anywhere in London—it is tea which we sell very little of; and the paper in which it is wrapped is the same in colour, size, and make—the twine is also the same as we use. <hi rend="largeCaps">LAWRENCE</hi>

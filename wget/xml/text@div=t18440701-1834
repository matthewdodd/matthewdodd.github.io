                  </hi>. I am an oil and colour manufacturer, and life in Millbank-street, Westminster. 1 know the prisoner—I never knew him before this transaction—he was not introduced to me at all—he said he was recommended to me by a Mr. Tranter, for me to discount a bill for him—he produced this bill to me—I have endorsed it since—with the exception of my endorsement, no alteration has taken place in the bill, except the noting of my bankers—he likewise brought me these two cards—one has D. and H. Davies on it—he said those were the names of the parties attached to the billhe said he would give me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I would discount it for him, which I did—I gave him 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it had three months to run—I cannot say exactly whether it was on the 13th of Feb. he brought it to me—it was within a day or two of that time—my bankers, the London and Westminster bank, discounted it for me, with some more—it was returned to me noted—I afterwards went to the Davies's, and saw Mr. Davies—in consequence of what be stated to me, I showed him the bill—from what he stated to me, I went to Mr. Bache's house—he was not at home, but in going from his house to Mr. Brown's to tell him of it, I met Mr. Bache suddenly, in Peckham-lane—I then went with him to the Davies's—I met a policeman, and requested him to go with me, and we all three went to Davies's—when we got there I saw the same Mr. Davies, and he said in the prisoner's presence that it was not his handwriting—I am not aware which of the Davies's it was—he said neither the drawing nor the endorsing was his handwriting, nor did he authorize anybody to use his name-Mr. Bache said, "You villain, you did it in that room"—Davies said he did not, he would have nothing to do with it, and shut the door in our faces—I then gave the prisoner into custody—there was an inquiry before Mr.</p>

Weston and Young's—I did not know Brown, the acceptor—the prisoner said that he was building some bouses—I did not find that so—I never knew anything of the kind—I inquired, and was told he was not—Davies told me so—I did not inquire of anybody else—the prisoner does not live in Peckham-lane—he lived at Milford Cottage, Commercial-road, at that time—I am not aware that he had live I in Peckham-lane, or that be bad been building there—I found him there—I found he was not to be seen at Milford Cottage—I went to Peckham-lane to find Brown—my solicitor went next morning to Mr. Brown—he is here now—Peckham-lane is in Deptford, I believe—I do not think it is in a line with the Commercial-road, but I am not much acquainted with that part—I do not know whether the prisoner said when he saw me, "Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald, is that you?"—he might have said so—I told him Davies denied the bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He had left the bill two days in your hands with Davies's card, telling you that Davies was the drawer of the bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One day, 1 cannot say what day that was—he left it one day, and was to call the next—(I affirm, I do not swear)—I will affirm that he did not leave it for two days—at the time he left it with me I was in my counting-house, in Mill bank-street—Davies lived in the Kent-road—I did not go to Davies—he begged me to inquire of Messrs. Rigby—I inquired after those that knew the drawer—I did not inquire after Davies himself, but I inquired of Messrs. Rigby, who they were doing a deal of work for—my shopman went and brought me word—I went to Messrs. Taylor, in Parliament-street, but I did not go to Rigby's myself—I do not recollect his saying when I said Davies denied the bill, "Nonsense, you must have seen Henry Davies instead of Daniel"—I cannot affirm that he did nut—he asked me if I had seen the other Davies, one Davies could not write, and the other could—he did not say he would go with me and see Daniel directly—I will affirm that—he said he would go—I had no policeman with me then—we met the policeman, after walking a little distance together to go to Davies's—he was freely going with me at that time without the control of any third person—the prisoner did not say on seeing Davies, "Why Davies, here is your bill come due, you don't mean to deny your own bill"—he never said so—he said that Davies did that bill—there were very few words transpired—Davies said, "It is not my writing, I authorised nobody to do it"—the prisoner said, "You villain, you did it in that room," and almost in an instant we were all three pushed out of the room—Davies shut the door in our faces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner say, "Why, Davies, here is your bill come due, you do not mean to deny it?" and did not Davies say," I have nothing to do with it?" and did not the prisoner then say, "Why you never mean to deny your bill, which you gave me in your own parlour at the time I gave you two others?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not recollect anything about any other bills—he said he did it in that room—I do not think any other bills were men<lb></lb>tioned—I did not hear him say, on Davies again saying "I have nothing to do with it," "Why, you villain, you don't mean to crush me, you know 1 gave you two acceptances at the time you gave me this"—I did not hear that pass—I did not hear any words about crushing, or other bills—I could un<lb></lb>dertake</p>

               <p>to affirm that did not pass—I do so—he then said to me, "You must give one of us in charge"—I did not say, "I will go to the station, and take the opinion of the inspector"—nothing of the sort—I said the prisoner must go to the station, and he went accordingly with the officer—I went before the Magistrate next morning—I caused my solicitor to give notice to Davies to attend—he did not come—the prisoner's solicitor then applied for a sum<lb></lb>mons to be issued to compel Davies to attend, as he would be able to show it was Davies's writing—the Magistrate did not take the prisoner's own re<lb></lb>cognizances for his reappearance—he took his uncle's—he appeared at the time when he was to appear, and then Davies appeared—I had never done anything of this sort before, for Davies, or with Davies's name on it—I was not allowed to be present when Davies was examined before the Magis<lb></lb>trate—I do not know a person named Andrews who keeps a beer-shop—the prisoner's wife was at Union-hall at the time he was being examined, and she asked me if I wanted anything more than my money—the prisoner did not upon that say, "If money is paid for this, I am disgraced for ever, 1 will not submit to it"—he said nothing of the sort—I had no communication with him—I did not hear him and his attorney both say so—he took his wife away, but not from me—she had left me at that time.</p>

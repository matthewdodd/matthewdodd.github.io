                  </hi>. I have been for some years employed as a senior clerk in the General Post Office—the prisoner was a letter carrier employed in the Southern district, Westminster Bridge Road—on 28th June I made up what is called a test letter, in which I enclosed two half sovereigns, fastened in slits on a card, in the ordinary way, and secured them with some adhesive paper—I addressed the letter to Miss Huggett, 70, Charlotte-terrace, Blackfriars Road—that was a real direction—there is a Miss Huggett of the age of seven years, I believe—I gave the letter to Willis Clare, one of the inspectors of letter carriers, with directions to post it, at the Southern district office—Mr. Huggett had been previously communicated with, and the letter, if posted should have arrived at that address, about 2 o'clock—in consequence of information which I received, I went to the Southern district office about half past 4, when the prisoner would return from his 4 o'clock delivery—he was brought to me in a private room, and I asked him what walk he was on—he said Stamford-street—I said, "Did you make the one o'clock delivery on that walk to-day?"—he said, "Yes, I did"—I asked him if Charlotte-terrace was in his delivery—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if he knew anything of a money letter addressed to Miss Huggett, 70 Charlotte terrace—he said, "I do not; I know Huggett's very well; they I keep a coffee shop"—I directed Bingham, a policeman who was with me, to search the prisoner, and saw Bingham take from the prisoner's pocket 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

            , came to our box, and said, will not you pay for the pot, we said no, the prisoner took hold of the woman and lugged her, and as she lay down, hit her a punch in the face so hard that any body might have heard it in the room, they were all three over the woman, I said, says I, gentlemen what do you call this, the prisoner arose up from the woman and hit me a punch of the face, I took the quart pot that was by me and I hit Tyrawley over the head, I said to myself, Lord have mercy on me, I shall do murder! the woman's feet were uppermost, and I believe she was on her back, I staid at the door some little time. Lord says she, they have killed my husband, says she, I will go in again, says I, do not, she was turned back by somebody, and the door was shut on us both.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you first hear of this robbery? - I heard of it when I saw her come out without a cloak.</p>
               <p>But when did you hear she had been robbed of her cloak? - The next day the prosecutor and his wife came to my house.</p>
               <p>And what did they say? - The woman said she was very bad, very ill used, says she, I have lost my things, and she said, she would have recompence, she would have what the law would allow her, and would punish them as far as it might be.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the account you give is that you had a quarrel about a pot of beer, and went to fighting, and that the woman lost her cloak.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, if you have any doubt in this case, I will ask the prisoner for his defence, I confess I have none, the charge is for a capital felony; for a robbery in the dwelling house.</p>

               <p>What became of this woman's cloak? - I delivered it to the man at the door, the prosecutor, and I shut the door, I put it 'under his arm.</p>
               <p>Did he take it under his arm? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never saw the cloak, nor ever had it in my life from that day to this, there is a man that is the witness, to my wife, that saw us go out together, I never had it, he said before the Alderman, he put it under my arm, and it dropped in the street.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no pretence to speak of a robbery, whatever quarrels there have been.</p>

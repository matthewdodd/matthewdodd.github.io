                  </hi>. I am an agent to a hosier in Wood-street The prisoner has been in my service four years and a half, in the situation he held at the time in question, and he was there before me—on the 4th of October I gave him a parcel to take to the Bull-and-Mouth inn, to be sent by mail to Davis and Wilson, Nottingham—it contained three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes—about three days afterwards I received intelli-gence</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183910210077"></xptr>
               <p>from Nottingham, in consequence of which I asked the prisoner who he gave the parcel to—he said he gave it to one of the clerks in the office at the Bull-and-Mouth—I told him that the parcel containing the notes I gave him on the 4th had arrived, but neither the letter or notes—I took him to the coach-office, and he pointed out the man he gave it to—they acknowledged receiving the parcel and sending it, but I could learn nothing farther—immediately after receiving the information I looked for a list of the numbers of the notes, which I had placed on a desk, with a weight on them, and I missed it—I asked the prisoner if he knew any thing of it—he said, "No"—I looked in all directions, and he did the same—we could not find it—I went to the Bank of England, and got the number of a note I took from the Bank that day, and I went to Glynn's, where I had received three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes that same day—I immediately went to the Bank of Eng<lb></lb>land, and stopped the notes, and at the same time ascertained that one of the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes had been brought in on the 5th of October—that is not here—it is at the Bank—I traced that note, and found on it the signature of "D. Newman, 14, Wood-street"—I went that evening to the Mansion-house, got a search-warrant, and Forrester went with me to the warehouse—I accused the prisoner of having stolen the notes, and said, "Here is an officer, I give you in charge for having stolen the notes inclosed in my parcel"—he said, "No, no"—I said, "You had better admit the fact, Stephen, it will be better for you"—he afterwards desired to see me in pri<lb></lb>vate—he wished me to go home to his lodging—I went with him and the officer to his lodging, and there he gave me two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and nine sove<lb></lb>reigns, and begged forgiveness.</p>

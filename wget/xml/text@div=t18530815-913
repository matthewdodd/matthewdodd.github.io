                  </hi>. I live at Clerkenwell Workhouse, and am nurse in the receiving ward. I was present at the death of the prisoner's wife, Martha Garnett, on Tuesday, 12th July, from 4 to 5 o'clock in the afternoon—I received her into the workhouse on Monday, the 11th—she had been in the workhouse ill, about three weeks before, and I then considered her in a consumption—she was in the sick ward; that was the cause of her coming into the house on both occasions; she came as a sick person—after being there for a fortnight she discharged herself; she was considerably better—I did not see her again until 11th July; that was about a fortnight or three weeks afterwards—she never made any complaint to me about any one; she made no complaint about her husband ill treating her; she said he was in the habit of stopping out late at night—she said nothing about want of food—when she came the second time I asked her why she came back again, and she said it was in consequence of the noise of the children; she thought she should be quieter; that was the only reason she gave—I asked her if her husband beat her—she said, "No;" he offered to keep a girl for her to do the work rather than she should come back to the house—next morning she became so ill that I immediately sent for the doctor—I also requested that her friends</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185308150070"></xptr>
               <p>should be sent for, and went to fetch her husband—he came to her, and they had some little conversation, but very little; I did not hear it—she died between 4 and 5 o'clock that evening—she did not say anything to me about shortness of work—she said that he earned from 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week at times—she had two children, who are with me in the house—she said nothing about food to my knowledge, and never complained of any violence.</p>

Can you remember whether she said to you that her husband was sometimes out of work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my recollection; she said he was short of work, not out of work: she said at times they were very badly off, but she never said to me that they were well off.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When she came to the workhouse, I suppose she had proper food and attendance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; every attention was paid to her that was necessary—it was impossible that she could receive the same things at home, unless the man had a very good income—he could not afford to render her the help which she had at the workhouse—that was the reason of her coming there on both occasions; on the last occasion she said the children disturbed her, and she desired to be quiet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Harris, of No. 5, New-court, Peter's-lane. The deceased was my husband's sister—I last saw her alive on Sunday night, 10th July—she was then in bed at her own house—the prisoner is a cabinet-maker and French polisher—I believe he worked for himself at home occasionally; he had no shop—he goes out to work; I never saw any wages paid him—I have seen him in the possession of sums of money; I have been once in his company to see money, he had 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that was about two years back—I have seen him in possession of money since that time; he had money on the Thursday when I visited her, to give her some steak—I saw him with a good bit of money on Thursday, 10th March, he had about ten or a dozen shillings—I have not seen him with money just before her death, I have not been at his home to see—I was there on the Sunday before her death, the 10th July, it was past ten o'clock at night; she was in bed, and in a very low state; I went to her bedside, and said, "How are you Martha?" she said she was very bad, and cried very much—the prisoner was present—she asked me if I had got a halfpenny in my pocket—I said, "Yes," and asked her what it was for—she said to get her a halfpenny candle—my husband fetched it—her sister and I asked the prisoner if he had got anything for her—he said that he had brought her in mutton, potatoes, and cabbage, on the Saturday night—I did not see any about the place—she did not contradict him, all she said was in a very low voice, "That was as he said"—I did not have the presence of mind to go to her cupboard, as I have formerly done—she said he had deserted her all day, and was going to do so that night—he heard her say that; he did not say anything to it—I said to him, "How can a man like you leave a dying woman all night, and leave nobody with her?"—he said, "It is all very fine to talk in that way"—he was not attending to his wife at that time, he was standing by the window smoking a pipe, he paid no attention to what I said—I said, "The idea of a married man to leave his wife and two children, and leave them nothing"—he said he did not understand a married life—I said, "The idea of a man, the father of two children, and so many years married, not understanding a married life, when are you going to learn?"—he made no answer to that—I did not on that occasion see any sign of a morsel of food anywhere.</p>

PLATT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had she been in health before that, according to your observation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the time she was married till about the birth of her first child, she was in very good health—I believe she first became ill on the birth of her third child, two years back; she was then attended by Mr. Gill—her health appeared to fail after that very much; and I believe, by her own words, that she would have been found dead in her bed previously from hunger, had it not been for kind assistance—I never saw anything done by her husband in the way of giving her food while she was lying ill.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever hear her ask for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; on 10th March last he brought home three quarters of a pound of steak, and desired her to cook it for him—she did so; and he ate the whole of it, and never gave her or the children a bit—the two children were standing by the table, and had a bit of bread and dripping, and she had a crust of bread and dripping, and a cup and a half of tea—that was all she had in my presence—she was ill then, but not so very low—she was about; she dined with me on that day—when the prisoner had gone out, I said to her, "What a greedy man your husband is"—it did not occur to me to say while he was there, Would not your wife take a little?"</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Crawford-passage, Ray-street, Clerkenwell. I am the landlady of the house where the prisoner and deceased lodged for four years—they occupied the first floor—I know of her having been ill for some time past; we perceived it more after the death of her third child; it was not from grief at the loss of the child—the prisoner never used to come home till after 12, 1, 2, or 3 o'clock in the morning, and sometimes later than that—I have never seen him in possession of money; I seldom went into their place—they were there two years before I went in, and then I only went in when I was sent for—when she was confined I went in and out for the first fortnight—I was in and out a good deal before she left her home to go to the workhouse—I never heard anything of their money matters; I have heard her say that she wanted money, when he was present—I could not exactly say when that was; it was somewhere about July, I think—she sent the little boy down to say she wanted to speak to me—she told the prisoner, in my presence, that he was murdering her by inches, and that he did not allow her common necessaries—he was coming up to her, and I stepped between them, and said, Don't strike her"—he said, "You have nothing to do between man and wife"—I said, "No, I did not come here to have anything to do with it; but, for goodness' sake, don't attempt to strike her"—he did not exactly attempt to strike her, but I was afraid of it—she came down to me on the Sunday week before she went into the workhouse; her husband was not present then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were examined before the Coroner's Jury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I cannot call to mind whether I then said anything about her dying by inches; I think I was not asked the question; I did not name it, it did not</p>

               <p>occur to me—I have recollected it now, for the first time—I never knew the prisoner to strike his wife, or to be in any way violent, or to ill-use her—she was a clean, respectable-looking woman, as far as her means would allow her; they were very poor—the prisoner owes me rent now—I had a great deal of difficulty in getting his rent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and live in White Lion-street, Clerkenwell; I am district surgeon of the parish. I attended to the deceased some months ago—she came to me under a parish order—I attended her frequently at intervals from that time up to the time of her death—I saw that her case required all the support she could have, and asked her if she was able to get it—she said, unfortunately it was not in her power to get sufficient food—she had a cough at that time—she was suffering from <hi rend="italic">phthysis</hi>, or consumption; it was a very clear case—after of her death I made an examination of her body—both the right and left lobe the lungs had cavities, and were in a completely decayed state—her symptoms generally were such as would have destroyed twenty persons—I should say that state was supervening for some months; the body was very much emaciated—there were no marks of external violence at all—the heart was sound, the liver slightly enlarged, and the other viscera healthy—there were tubercles in the lungs—she undoubtedly died from disease of the lungs.</p>

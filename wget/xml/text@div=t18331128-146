On the 18th of November, I was in Shoreditch at half-past nine o'clock; I met with the prisoner as I was loitering round some ballad-singers; there was a crowd there - I had a half-sovereign in my left hand pocket, wrapped up in a piece of white paper; I had put it there about six o'clock in the evening- I did not stop more than five minutes with the balladsingers; I was outside the crowd, and when I went away the prisoner and another woman came after me, and accosted me; we walked on talking about the ballads, and I turned up Bird-cage-walk, which was my nearest<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280113"></xptr>way home - the prisoner asked me where I was going; I said down that road, and through the fields. had she any inclination to walk with me; she did, and we went down <placeName id="t18331128-146-crimeloc821">Bird-cage-walk</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you tell the magistrate that the prisoner wished you to go back to her friend? A. Yes - I did not ask her to go with me; but she was going the same road, and I went across the fields in my road home - when I missed my half-sovereign, I told her if she would give me my half-sovereign, I would say no more about it - I had not been at work that day; I had been to Blackfriars - the prisoner was alone with me when I missed my money, but the woman she said was her sister was a few yards from us; the prisoner took off her pattens before I came up to her, and after she left me she went up to the other woman and gave her her pattens - it was dark; when we walked down the Bird-cage-walk; I felt something at my pocket which I did not take notice of; I had my umbrella under my arm, and the hand was withdrawn in a moment from my pocket - I had not time to put my hand to it - I don't know what she did with the half-sovereign unless she swallowed it - I had had a little rum and shrub with them before I went into the Bird-cage-walk; I did not ask them to go and have it - they asked me to treat them; I paid for that out of my waistcoat pocket - I kept my hand on the pocket where my half-sovereign was while I was at the ballad-singers; I told her it was a nasty song, and she said she never heard such an one.</p>

             (police-constable H 25). The prisoner was given into my custody; I found nothing on her; her companion came down to the station-house, but nothing was found on her.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man came up to me and my sister as we were going along, he asked us to have some rum and shrub, and then he asked me to go across the fields with him, which I refused; we went down Bird-cage-walk to get from him, but he followed me; he wanted me to go down a court, which I refused; he then said I had robbed him.</p>

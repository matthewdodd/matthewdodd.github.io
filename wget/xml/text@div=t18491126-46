                  </hi>. I am a solicitor; I occupy chambers at 4, Ray<lb></lb>mond-buildings, Gray's-inn; I dwell in my chambers. The prisoner Ring came into my service as housekeeper in May, 1848—she had the charge of all my plate—I lost a great deal of plate and linen—in consequence of some<lb></lb>thing I discovered, I gave Ring notice to quit my service on 8th Nov., and I desired her to make an inventory of the plate and other things, to give to a new servant—on Thursday morning, 8th Nov., I found on my breakfast-table this letter, which I believe is in Ring's writing—I rang the bell for her—I asked her for the duplicates, and she gave me them wrapped up in a piece of brown paper; she then fell on her knees and begged forgiveness—I spoke to her about the letter, and asked if she had made the inventory—she said she had not, she was too unwell—I directed her to commence doing so, and assisted her in doing it—on doing it, I found the plate and other things were deficient—I went with her to the pawnbroker, who refused to give up the things, and I gave her into custody—on the evening of the 8th Nov. I went with the officer to 25, Everett-street; on inquiring for Mrs. Smith, Dodd</p>

               <p>made her appearance, she said she was the person; she said she had known Ring for many years; that she had been in the habit of pawning for her in the name of Smith, and that Ring stated she brought this property to pawn for the purpose of paying bills—on my asking her whether she had received any portion of the money, or any benefit from it, she said she had not; that she handed the money always to Ring—I asked her whether she had any more of my property—she said "No," and offered to allow her drawers to be searched, and she opened one or two of them for that purpose—I did not observe anything there, and I left the place—I directed her to attend at the police-court; at least, the policeman went there for the purpose of sum<lb></lb>moning her to attend, and she did attend—this letter was in my hand when I rang the bell for Ring, and conversation ensued alluding to this note—I have not seen her write, I have seen the figures she has made in the house<lb></lb>keeping-book; there may have been a few words, but they are mostly printed—here are some figures in this note—I believe it to be her writing (<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>)—"Thursday morning. Sir; I write this in hopes of forgiveness. I am sorry to say I have made use of your plate to the amount of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. If you will be so merciful as to forgive me, I have a friend who will give 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Monday, and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. my wages: and in less than a month you shall have the remainder.

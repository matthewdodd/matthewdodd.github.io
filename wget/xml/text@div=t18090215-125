I went out and asked him what he wanted; he said their cart was coming with two hogsheads of gin; I asked him whose cart it was; he said Mr. Hodges of Bank side; I continued in the yard with the prisoner; he was talking about Mr. Hodges' servants stealing gin from him; I left him and went into Smithfield and returned back again: I said is not your cart come now; he was sitting on a hamper in the yard; I went in doors and missed him off the hamper: it was a vinegar half hogshead; I went out and saw him taking it down the yard; there were six in the yard, two of them were taken away; I thought he was gone to take them to this cart; I went in pursuit of him; in a little time I saw the prisoner coming from Smithfield; he made a way for Turnmill street; I pursued after him and he then met me; he said master I will pay you for these six casks; I said I do not think you have any right to them; he said the cart was up the street; he took me up Turnmill street; the cart was not there; I took him back to the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the man that took the hogshead out of your yard - A. Yes, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. In short no cart came to the yard - A. No; I told him I would send for an constable; he cried and said he had sold it to Mrs. Beale.</p>
               <p>MRS. BEALE. I live at No. 73, West Smithfield; I am a cooper and turner; I bought a cask at that time of the prisoner; I gave four shillings for it.</p>

               <p>Thomas Hunt. The four ducks that the prisoner had when he was apprehended were my property; I know nothing of the taking them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Hunt. No, he did not; he said he bought them at Low-layton for five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of Ducks were they?</p>
               <p>Hunt. Two of them were Muscovy, and two English, intirely white, except one, which had a little black on the tail.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it he was brought to you with them?</p>
               <p>Hunt. I think it was on the 19th of April about nine in the evening.</p>

            . The four ducks were in the pond about seven o'clock in the evening on the 19th of April; I did not miss them till a gentleman sent word he had taken a man with some ducks, and they were brought to our house with the prisoner; the two Muscovite ducks were dead, their heads were cut off, the other two were alive.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They swore they were geese.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the justice?</p>
               <p>R. Hunt. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. He appears here as disordered in his senses by his behaviour. How did he behave there?</p>
               <p>R. Hunt. Much the same as here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not speak a word there.</p>
               <p>R. Hunt. He said he loved fowl dearly, and said, he hoped I would find him a good bed and a fowl.</p>

            . I met the prisoner in my grounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That honest fellow stopped me with the ducks.</p>
               <p>Clark. He had the four ducks; I stopped him thinking they might be mine. I asked him where he got them? he made no answer, as I remember. I took him and them to my neighbour Mr. Hunt, and he owned them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is very true what he says.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I said I was going to Walthamstow, so and so. Did I not go to a public house with you?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Enough said. I bought the ducks in Wood-street at Walthamstow; I have got no witnesses but myself, although I am a poor fellow I am an honest fellow, and a coachman too.</p>
               <p>Q. Can any body give an account of this man's behaviour of late?</p>
               <p>Mr. Akerman. About a fortnight ago I went up into the gaol in order to set some little affairs to right; I found the prisoner had been beat; the other prisoners, which we call the gate-men, told me that some of the boys, who are since transported, had been using him ill, and had got him to burn his cloaths. My turnkey can give a better account of his behaviour than I can, he sees the prisoners every day. I never saw any particular acts of lunacy by him any farther than hearing what the other prisoners would say of him.</p>

            . I am a turnkey; I have seen the prisoner behave like one out of his senses, he had like to have set the gaol on fire twice; he has had some cloaths brought him by his friends, but he has made away with them all; he would be gathering rags together, and making fire of them in the night-time. We have been called up on his account sometimes at two or three o'clock in the morning, fearing he should set the gaol on fire.</p>

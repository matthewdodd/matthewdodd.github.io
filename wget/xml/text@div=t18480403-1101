                  </hi> I am a share-jobber, and live at 18, Walcot-square, Kennington—this bill for 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was drawn by me on 7th March, and handed to a Mr. Poulton, to get the acceptance of Messrs, Livermore and Trainer—he introduced the prisoner to me that same day—I said to him, "Are you acquainted with Messrs. Livermore and Trainer?"—he said, "I am acquainted with the foreman, and I can get the acceptance done through him; the business is done through him"—he made an appointment to bring it back again about four o'clock that day—the bill was then merely drawn, not accepted or endorsed—the prisoner said I was to give him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as a commission to the foreman, and I gave it him—he took the bill away with him—I saw him again in the after-part of the day, and he said the foreman was no in the way—he came again the next day, and said the parties were not in town—he said, at that time, the foreman was waiting close by—he made an appoint<lb></lb>ment for the Thursday—he came about twelve, and said that the foreman was waiting in the City, that he was going to obtain the acceptance, and would be back as soon as he could—he came back, and said he had handed the bill to Poulton, and I received it from Poulton—it then had this acceptance on it—I was not present when Poulton received the bill from the prisoner—I handed it over to Captain Yardley, to whom I had given a copy of it a week before—the prisoner was present at the time I received the bill from Poulton, at least he was afterwards—it was in this way: he came and told me he had handed the bill to Poulton, and that Poulton was outside, waiting for me—I went out and Poulton handed me the bill, and then the prisoner came up—I said, "Is this the acceptance of Messrs. Livermore and Trainer?"—he said it was—he told me they carried on business in Tottenham-court-road—(I should explain, that before the bill was drawn Poulton gave me their names and address)—to the best of my recollection, Poulton asked the prisoner if that was their correct address—that was on the first day—I never saw the foreman.</p>

                  </hi> I am a pawnbroker, in partnership with William Trainer, at 127, Tottenham-court-road. The acceptance to this bill is not mine, nor my partner's, nor any persons in our establishment—it was not authorised by me—there is no other firm of Livermore and Trainer in Tot<lb></lb>tenham-court-road—I saw the prisoner at the station on 10th March—he said that a man named Marcus procured the acceptance, and represented himself as our foreman—he said Marcus lived at 4, Eden-street, Hampstead-road—I went there with the officer, and found him—he said his name was Marcus, but I had known him before by the name of Moore—he was never our foreman—I knew him from pledging some small articles—he was not authorised to accept a bill in our name—he denied all knowledge of it.</p>

                  </hi> On Friday, 10th March, I was called by Mr. Livermore and Mr. Yardley, as they were standing at the Auction-mart, to take the prisoner into custody—I told him he must consider himself in my custody for uttering a forged bill of exchange, bearing the acceptance of Messrs. Livermore and Trainer—he said he could satisfy me and Mr. Livermore of whom he received the bill—at the station he said a person named Marcus, living in Eden-street, Hampstead-road, had given him the bill, and told him it was the genuine acceptance of Messrs. Livermore and Trainer—Marcus was at the Mansion-house—I heard no conversation between him and the prisoner—I know Mr. Poulton—I do not know where he is—he was at the</p>

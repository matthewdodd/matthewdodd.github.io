When I pursued the prisoner I was much agitated, and first laid hold of another person, but I saw my mistake, and said "That's the person," meaning the prisoner, whom an officer then had hold off; one of my seals was found in an area.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. James' Westminster. Between seven and eight o'clock on this evening I heard a noise, as I stood between Princes-street and Rupert-street; I turned the corner and saw the prisoner in Franklin's custody - I heard some person say he had dropped something down the area, which he was standing on; I went and got this seal out of the area.</p>

            . I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running; I collared him - he was then on a grating; I saw him put his hand behind him, and drop something; I told Allcock of it, and he got it; the prosecutor came up, and took hold first of a man who had got hold of the prisoner's shoulder.</p>

I ran with the rest of the crowd, and was stopped by a private individual; I asked what he arrested me for - before he had time to answer, the prosecutor and the officer came up; the prosecutor gave charge of a person standing by; he then turned, and said,"That is not the person, this is the person;" I said I was innocent, and would accompany him where he pleased.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. HOYLE. Q. Were any other persons near the grating when the seal was dropped? - A. Yes, several persons; there was a crowd about.</p>

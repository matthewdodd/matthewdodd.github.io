            . I am a surgeon, and live in Clark's-place, Islington. On Sunday, the 17th of August, I was called on to see Timothy Brien - he was then dead, but not cold - I should think he had been dead about five minutes - I opened a vein in his arm, the blood was rather thick - I squeezed out about an ounce - I examined the body next day with Mr. Bateman - I found a swelling under the right ear, and his back was rather of a livid colour, and so was the face - I removed the integuments of the head, and found the upper part of the temporal muscle had a kind of bruise, and an effusion of blood under the right eyebrow - on removing the top of the skull there was nearly half a pint of blood flowed out on the floor - I found a quantity of coagulated blood over the brain, and at the base of the brain, and down into the spinal canal - the muscles of the neck appeared to have an effusion of blood over the jugular vein, over the right ear - in my judgment his death was produced by external violence - it struck me it was by a blow - there was an abrasion of skin over the right ear - this was likely to be caused by a person fighting.</p>

She went down the court, and I went down after her - Brien was standing there - the prisoner came out at the side door, and gave him a blow on the right side of the head, and he fell - his wife took up some mud and threw it at the prisoner - I looked at Brien and said to his wife, "Go and call the police for he is a dead man" - I observed the manner in which the prisoner slipped out at the side door - the deceased could not see him till he received the blow - he was not aware of it in the least - he seemed quite intoxicated - the prisoner was sober - I left the court, and saw no more till Brien was taken home.</p>

            . I live in Parcel's-court, Islington. The deceased lived about ten yards from me - I saw him on Sunday, the 17th of August, at the Blakeney's Head public-house, at the top of the court, having a drop of beer - I went and saw the deceased and two more men at the bar, having a pot of beer together - we had not finished it when the prisoner came in, and had some beer with the deceased - the deceased said to the prisoner, that he knew some of his signs belonging to the Union - the prisoner said he did - Brien said he was a b - liar - they had some words, and wanted to fight in the public-house - I interfered, and then Brion wanted to fight with me - he was drunk and quarrelsome - I then walked into my own place, and in about five minutes Brien came to my door, knocked at it, and said, "Come out, you b - b -, and fight me" - I stopped in doors - he came, and said,"Come out, you b - rogue, and fight me" - a crowd came round the door - I came out, and took Brien home to his own door - he expressed himself again after a low manner, and tore my coat into bits, and said I should fight him; and then he and I had a row between us and fell to the ground - I struck him open-handed, and put my arms round him, and shut him in his own house - he returned to his own window, and said to me, "Mind, go to bed, and be up at six o'clock in the morning, and fight me" - I said, "Go to bed, and in the morning both of us will forget it" - the prisoner came up, and made a blow at the deceased in his own window - he walked away - the deceased came out of his own house, and followed him forty or fifty yards, down to where he lodged - I walked into my place, and saw no more, till he was carried home by a man - the deceased was not hurt in the scuffle with me - I struck him open-handed, merely to get him into his own house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did he fall from any blow he received from you? A. No; only by laying hold of his collar, and bringing him to the ground - it was not the effect of a blow; I pushed him down - it was not with violence - I put him into his own house, and shut the door - he did not give the prisoner any further provocation than calling him a liar - he wanted to strike him, but I prevented him, and got him out of the house.</p>

            . I am a sergeant of police, No. 3. I apprehended the prisoner in Black Horse-fields.</p>
               <p>EDWARD CUPPLES DILLON re-examined. I attribute the death of the deceased to the last blow he got, under the right ear - I think, from the manner that was given, and the appearance his head exhibited, and the state of intoxication he was in, that caused the death - extravasation of blood would follow more readily from the state he was in - I think the blow must have been violent, from the effusion of blood I found under the muscles.</p>

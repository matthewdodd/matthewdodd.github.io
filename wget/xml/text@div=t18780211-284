                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 40 <hi rend="italic">R</hi>). I took the charge—Langton re<lb></lb>quested me to take down this statement—Collins was present. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I, Stephen Langton, 21, Greville Street, Leather Lane, Holborn, labourer, age 63, desire to make a statement, which is to the effect that me and my fellow-prisoner, whom I only know as Jack, and a third man named Jim, who have escaped, took train from London Bridge between 4 and 5 p. m., the 5th inst., with 20 counterfeit florins, the whole of which was carried by myself. The principle upon which Jack purposed was this. The man Jim who escaped to push them off, Jack to supply him as he succeeded in passing them off, and me to supply him; Jack to have one ready to pass to Jim until they had run out, then to take the train back to London with return ticket, which me and Jack had provided ourselves with. Jim only having taken single ticket would return alone in consequence of being the most conspicuous. My fellow-prisoner pro<lb></lb>cured the counterfeit florins the night previous, about 9 p. m., somewhere in the neighbourhood of Kent Street. He said he could get any quan<lb></lb>tity of them, but they were only to be got at night. Me and Jim accom<lb></lb>panied him as far as a court leading from Kent Street to Great Dover Street, where we waited until he obtained them, I then having to carry them home to our lodgings at 21, Greville Street, all three of us lodging at the same lodgings and slept in the same room for about 12 or 14 days. This state<lb></lb>ment is made by me voluntarily and at my own request, and without any inducement from any person whatever.—Stephen Langton."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Langton's Defence</hi>. I dare say it will somewhat surprise you my making that statement, notwithstanding it is a tissue of falsehoods. The way I got the money was totally different. The four florins were given me by the man who has escaped, but I did not know they were bad. Collins knows nothing about it. I admit throwing the florins away.</p>

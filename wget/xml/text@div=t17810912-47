On Tuesday, the 14th of August, I was at an annual meeting in the neighbourhood. At near eleven o'clock at night, a person came in, and told my nephew he was wanted at home; then I was desired to step home. I went home, and found this woman (who was my house-keeper) in great distress. She said, two men had come, under a pretence of bringing a hare from my house at Snow-hill, the one a short man, the other a tall one; that they rushed in, seized her, and put a pistol to her head, while another tied her hands behind her with a garter; that then they went up stairs, and had stolen she did not know what. I ran up stairs, and missed many things. I did not at all like her account; she seemed flurried; and I thought she was a party concerned. There was a constable in the croud; I charged him with her, and sent her to the watch-house: I desired him to sit up with her, and to take particular care of her. I desired her to confess if she was a party concerned; but she denied every thing. The next morning the constable came to me, and told me he had tried if he could make any thing of her -</p>
               <p>Court. You must not tell what the constable said. Tell me what you lost? - I don't know that I can: I have not found the things she pretends I was robbed of. She told the constable, if he would go to such a place in my house, he would find some pawnbroker's duplicates; and, if he would get them out of my house, and bring them to her, he would be the best friend she ever had in her life. He came, and told me this; and we searched, and found the duplicates. We found, at different pawnbrokers, six shirts, two pair of everlasting bree ches; there were I don't know how many pair of silk stockings lost; two pair were found, four harrateen bed-curtains, the curtains of her own bed, two dimity waistcoats, a silk waistcoat, a blue coat and waistcoat, one table spoon, and a pair of tea spoons. After finding these duplicates, I found two nasty dirty rags upon the mantle-piece in the kitchen, behind the tinder-box; and they were as full of pawnbrokers duplicates as they could hold, by means of which I got a great number more of my things.</p>

I went up and down stairs, and found no person in the house but the prisoner, with her hands tied behind her with this garter. Mr. Crockett's nephew untied her. Mr. Crockett gave me charge of the prisoner. I searched her, and found this garter in her pocket, which she denied having got. I searched her pocket, and found a tin box, with a medal of Mr. Beckford gilt, and some duplicates. I went with her to the watch-house, and remained with her all night. She told me, in the course of the night, that when I went to Mr. Crockett's, I should find some things rolled up on the mantle-piece, by the side of the tinder-box; and if I would conceal them, and bring them to her, she would esteem me as a great friend. I told her I would. She said, Under the bason, on the shelf, I should find five or six sixpences, and desired me to bring them. In the morning, Mr. Crockett desired me to take up Taylor. In the night, the prisoner asked me, when I searched her room, if I found a gown. I said, No. She said, How could Mr. Crockett think she had planned the robbery, when she was robbed herself? When I took Taylor, she told me she had pawned the gown the week before: I believe it was pawned the 8th of August.</p>

               <p>To Taylor. Did you pawn a gown of her own the week before? - Yes; she sent me the week before with it.</p>

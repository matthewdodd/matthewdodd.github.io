                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Somers-town. On Saturday night, the 26th of August, about half-past nine o'clock, I was attend<lb></lb>ing outside my shop, and saw both the prisoners—the female was in the shop, and the man outside, about three or four yards from the door—the female had a piece of bacon in her hand—she asked me the price—I told her—she would not agree to it, and laid it back—near to that place was half a ham—I turned to speak to a customer, and on turning round again I missed it and the female prisoner also—I had put it there not two minutes before—she returned a se<lb></lb>cond time—I watched her, and saw her take another half ham from the same spot, which I had placed there during her absence—she took it into the shop, and put it into her basket—she then went outside the door, returned again, and took a piece of bacon, took it towards the scale, and put that also into her basket—she then walked out and crossed the road—I went after her, fetched her back, and found in her basket the second half ham and the piece of bacon—she at first denied taking the first half, but afterwards admitted it, and said she had given it to her husband—I did not see the man after the first half was taken.</p>

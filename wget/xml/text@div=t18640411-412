On 14th March, about half-past 8 in the evening, the prisoner was given into my custody for stealing a coat, and assaulting the prosecutrix, who stated in his presence that he came into her shop to be fitted with a coat; that she showed him one which he said was too small, and another which was too large; that there were two other young men with him, one of whom ran away with the prisoner, and the other remained—the prisoner denied it—he was the worse for liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 19, Exeter-street, Lisson-grove—on 14th March, a young man came in and asked for a coat—I went round to serve him—he said that it was not for him, but for a sailor outside—he went to the door and called the prisoner in, who put the coat on, and the one who asked for it said that it fitted him—the prisoner said that it did not fit—he said, "There is a sailor outside who is worth hundreds"—he came in, and the other man said that he did not approve of the coat—the prisoner asked for another—I said, "I have only one, which is too large"—the prisoner then <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his fist, and knocked me backwards—I fell, and when I arose he was gone—presently he came up to the door without the coat, and said, "I am not the man who struck you"—I said, "You are, and you took my coat"—one sailor remained behind—he spoke to me, and called some one to fetch a constable—I have never seen the coat since—the prisoner smashed all my teeth—I have no doubt he is the man—I gave him in charge five or ten minutes afterwards.</p>

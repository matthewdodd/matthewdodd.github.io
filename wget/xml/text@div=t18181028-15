               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the skin of one in the Borough - A. Yes, at Smith's, on the Monday-it was the skin of a black heifer, with a streak of white down its back, and speckled in the face; it was the skin of one which I had lost. I have not the least doubt of it, as it corresponded in size and every thing-it was a very particular one. The four heifers were worth 30l. or 40l. After this I heard the prisoners were in custody.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any conversation with Tingay - A. I saw him at the Compter - I neither threatened nor promised him. I knew him before-he lived in our parish, and went by the name of Cripps. I said I was sorry to see him there. He said he could assure me the beasts were not mine, for mine were larger than those that were in his possession, and that he received them from a man of the name of Grey, at Hoddesdon, who gave him 2s. a head for driving them.</p>

I told him he could not go from there that night. He said he could not be locked up until he had seen Mr. Curtis - He said he must produce the letter to him immediately for payment for some beasts. He took a letter from his waistcoat-pocket. Mr. Teague was present, and opened it in the prisoner's presence-the wafer was quite wet. He read it, and told the prisoners he thought it did not come from a gentleman. I locked them up.</p>

               <p>EDWARD HOLMES. I am a porter. On the 25th of September I was at the Coach and Horses, public-house, in Kingsland-road, and saw both the prisoners there. They asked a man named Stark, to write a letter for them - They spoke as if they were in company together - I believe Cripps spoke. Stark wrote the letter for them-this excited my suspicion. I followed them out of the house to the Golden Lion, public-house, in Smithfield-it was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon. Cripps sat in the middle box, and Burton sat in the next. I took them into custody at the house. I heard Stark read over part of the letter to them.</p>
               <p>AMBROSE STARK. I am a wine-cooper, and live at the Coach and Horses. I wrote the letter for the prisoners. A man named Cannon first asked me to write it. They said they both came to town with the beasts, and were to take the money back to their master - They were strangers to me. They asked me to write a letter demanding payment, and told me to sign it, "Gray." I should not have wrote it, but Cannon, who was the hostler at the inn, said he knew them, and had lived at Hoddesdon with them. I delivered it to Burton.</p>
               <p>TINGAY'S Defence. I was at Hoddesdon - A man inquired for a person to drive some bullocks, and said his name was Gray. He said he would give 2s. a head; that he would deliver them to me next day, and if I was not at Hoddesdon at eight o'clock, he would leave them at the George Inn for me. I was to bring the money to the Sun, at Waltham. I did not think they were the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>BURTON'S Defence. I met the other prisoner, whom I had not seen for four years, and went and had some porter with him. He said he had brought some beasts from Hoddesdon.</p>

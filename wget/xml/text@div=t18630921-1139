                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Charles Price and Co., of William-street, Blackfriars—on 11th June, I made a shipment of eleven pipes of oil and a hogshead of turpentine—it was to go to the General Steam Navigation Company at Deptford—it was loaded at night, to go with the tide next morning—I heard no more of the turpentine till 8th August, when I went with Jarvis and Hill, two officers, to Mr. Harrison's, at Queen<lb></lb>hithe, and the officer asked him if he had bought a cask of turpentine lately—he said, "Yes"—I asked if I could see it—he said, "Certainly," and that it was in his cellar—I asked him to show me where it was—he went down with us, and showed it to us—another cask was resting on the top of it, and I said, "Before I can identify it, I must have that cask removed"—we lifted it with the assistance of Harrison and one of the officers, and found the gross and tare of the cask the same as when it left; 4-3-26 the gross, and 1 cwt. 0 qrs. 1 lb. the net—I asked Harrison if he had any invoice to show for it—he said that he had not, but that he bought it of a man named Wilson, who sold goods on commission, whom he knew about four years ago living with Walter Hood &amp; Co. of Thames-street—the turpentine was worth 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the cask 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I am a detective City-policeman—on 8th August, in consequence of information, I went to Mr. Harrison's shop, and told him we had called with regard to some turpentine which had been stolen from a barge on the Thames, and asked if he knew anything about it—he said, "Yes; I purchased some about six weeks ago"—I said, "Have you it by you?"—he said, "Yes; it is in the cellar"—I said, "This gentleman with me, Mr. Henderson, can identify it; let us have a look at it"—he accom<lb></lb>panied me down to the cellar, with Hills, another constable, and Mr. Henderson, who pointed out a hogshead, and said, "That is the one that contains turpentine"—on the end of it stood a barrel of paraffin oil, which, at my suggestion, was removed by Hills and Mr. Henderson, who then identified the hogshead as the property of Sir Charles Price—I asked Harrison to step up stairs, as I wanted to speak to him—I said, "It is my duty, however painful it may be, to ask you of whom you purchased this, when, and how"—he said, "Well, I bought it of a man of the name of Wilson, about six weeks ago"—I said, "Where does he live; what know<lb></lb>ledge have you of him?"—he said, "Well, I knew him about four years ago; he was working for Hood and Son of Thames-street"—I said, "Well, have you any invoice or receipt for this?"—he said, "No; I have no document but my cheque-book"—I said, "What did you give for it?"—he said, "16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—on receiving the cheque-book I said, "Mr. Harrison, you know me very well; it is only 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down here"—he said, "I gave them a sovereign; they wanted cash as well"—I said, "Have you any receipt stamped at all?"—he said "No; it was a job lot, and I gave him a cheque"—I said, "Do not you know you are liable under the Stamp Act?"—he said, "Well, I bought it a job lot, and there is my cheque-book"—I—I then directed Hills to take him to the station, and I took the hogshead of turpentine to the station.</p>

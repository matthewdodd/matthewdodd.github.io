On the 23rd of June Miss Walters showed me a half-cown, which she took in my shop—I told her it was bad immediately, and marked it, and put it into a vase on the mantel piece in the bar—I put on by coat, and went after the prisoner, but did not find him—there had been a bad half-crown taken that night, and it was put amongst the silver—I did not find it till I counted the silver the next morning, but this one I am sure was marked by myself, and kept apart from other money—I gave it afterwardsto the officer—on the 30th of June the prisoner came to my shop for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of cigars—I served him—he proposed to pay with a crown-piece—I looked at it, and saw it was bad—I told him I should keep it—he wanted me to give it him back—I told him I would not—he then asked me go with him, to his master, at Highbury Barn tavern—I walked with him, and met a constable, and gave him into custody.</p>

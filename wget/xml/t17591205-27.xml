               <p>Q. What business do you follow?</p>
               <p>Wright. I am in the coal way. On the 27th of October last my house was broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you first know of it?</p>
               <p>Wright. The girl told me that a light was taken out of the window, about 6 in the morning. I went and saw the light lying on the coals. This was a window to the back kitchen belonging to my dwelling-house, even with the ground. When the light was taken out, there was room enough for the biggest man in this court to get in. I missed a hat, a peruke, and two pair of stockings, from out of another kitchen, which that kitchen goes into. I had wore my hat and wig the day before; this was on a Sunday. I had a suspicion of the prisoner, and took him on the Tuesday following he had work'd for me about 8 or 9 days, and lodged some nights in that time at my house. I took him at the Castle alehouse in Field Lane, and charged a constable with him, he having ran away with some coals sack and all. I asked him how he could serve me so; this was at my first going in. He made little or no answer, but said he should be glad if I would not be angry, and he'd be three halfpence with me. I said I was going 2 or 3 doors farther, and would be back again by the time he had got the beer drawn and a toast put in it. I went and got an officer, and when I returned, I was told the prisoner was gone to the necessary house, where I found him sumbling about his pockets. I gave the constable charge of him, on suspicion of breaking my house and robbing me; he quiver'd like an aspen leaf; we took him before justice Fielding, and the next day I had an account of my wig being found at the Castle, behind a water tub, just by the necessary house; it was delivered to me by the maid servant; the prisoner told me he had pawned the hat and stockings for want, at a pawnbroker's by St. Giles's. When I went to him in the prison, he owned he was the person that broke open the house, and took the things, between 2 and 3 in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it that you went to him to New-Prison, and he made this confession?</p>
               <p>Wright. That was on Wednesday the 30th. I had him next day before Mr. Fielding again (the perule produced in court and deposed to.)</p>

            . I went in at the Castle that Tuesday morning, and saw the prisoner at the bar with 2 or 3 women drinking in a box; he had a wig on, the colour of this, and when the prosecutor came and took him, he had a cap on.</p>
               <p>Q to prosecutor. Did you ever make any overtures to the prisoner, in order to make this matter up?</p>
               <p>Wright. No, but his father did to me; he asked me what I would take for the hat and wig.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you did not tell the father, that if he would give you 4 or 5 guineas you would drop all prosecution.</p>
               <p>Wright. No, that I did not; the father proposed it to me, and I said I would not, nor could not, without offending the law.</p>

               <p>My prosecutor came to me in New-prison on the Thursday night; we went into the alehouse, and drank together; he gave me part of two or three pots of beer, and asked me about the robbery; he knew I could neither read nor write, and every word I spoke he wrote down, and would not let any body look over his shoulder; if you enquire into his character in Spital-fields, they will tell you what sort of a person he is.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the three prisoners and another crossing the fields - Hargreaves was about fifty yards before me; I was in the road: one of the female prisoners had the glass, tied in a table-cloth - the man who has escaped held what he had got before him, that I should not see it - I took the decanter from Wood, as she came through the hedge; I gave her in charge, and ran after the two men - Frayne secreted himself in a ditch- I pulled him out, and found two wine-glasses in his pocket; his finger bled very much, and in going along the woman asked how he had cut it - he made no reply, but in going back we found some glass broken, with the name of Hinton on it; we found three doors broken at the house, and by the side-board in the coffee-room we found several spots of blood on the floor; we were just below Kilburn gate when we saw them - they were walking; they were about a mile and a half from the house, but there is a nearer way, across the fields - it was quite daylight.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

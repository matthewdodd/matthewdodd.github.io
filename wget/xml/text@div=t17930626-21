               <p>I lost my gown on Saturday the 8th of June, I saw it in the house about twelve o'clock and discovered it gone about half after twelve, I saw it was gone off the line.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body take it? - No. I saw Campbell was in the yard and his friend, and there was nobody else in the yard; I saw him run away, he walked as hard as he could, he had got a bundle under his right side; the runners went after him and took him, I saw him again at Hog-lane, some days afterward.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your gown again? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there other people in the house besides the prisoner? - Nobody but him and his friend, and me and the person that was scourering.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I met this other man and he asked me to have part of a pot of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260030"></xptr>beer, after we had the drink, he asked if we should go in and play at skittles? when I went into the ground there were four men just done playing, one of them had his coat off, I was obliged to go home to leave some victuals at home; as I was coming down Wheeler-street I met this man again, I asked him why he did not stay, he said, he was obliged to go because he was sent for; as I was walking back again I met this girl, and she asked me whether I was not in the skittle ground? I said I was going to the same skittle ground, but I did not know whose it was, particularly she asked me what was the man in the white coat? I told her where he told me he was going.</p>

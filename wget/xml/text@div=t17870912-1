               <p>How many doors have you to your house? - There is but one door to go out; there is a back door into the yard, but it is walled in; there is no getting out of the house that way.</p>

               <p>How soon after did you find the prisoner? - On the 22d of August, Mr. Ford apprehended him in Middle-row, St. Giles's; he used my house, and knew the prisoner; he sent for me, and I came and saw him at the Cock in Litchfield-street.</p>
               <p>What did he say for himself? - He said he was very sorry, and told me where he had sold the table cloths.</p>
               <p>Did you make him any promise of favour? - No, none in the least; he asked whether I could get the things back again without paying for them; I told him, may be I might; he said he had sold them to a Mrs. Harris, in Old-street-road, he sold two table cloths first for seven shillings, and one for three shillings.</p>
               <p>Did he say when he had taken them? - No, they were there the day before he went away; one of them was laid for supper the night he went away; the other things he said he could not tell any thing at all of.</p>
               <p>Did you find any of the things at Mrs. Harris's? - No, there were some duplicates found upon the prisoner, but they did not relate to any of my things, except a pair of breeches, which I believe were mine, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Who were those two of the company that went away? - One was a Mr. Dunbar, an ironmonger, next door to me, and the other a Mr. Fish.</p>

               <p>Q. In August last had you any sheep there in a field - A. Yes, from twenty to thirty sheep and lambs.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 11th of August, upon hearing something did you go to your field and count your sheep - A. We sent for them; we missed a sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any skin or entrails in the field - The skin was found in an adjoining field. I saw the skin; I believed it to be my skin. The skin was cut; there was none of my marks to be seen; my mark was cut off. It was cut across in three or four different directions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see afterwards parts of a sheep - A. I saw the head and entrails after the boy brought them out of the field; they were brought from the adjoining field. From the appearance of the sheep it appeared to have been killed by a butcher.</p>

            . I am an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 12th of August were you in Church-row, Pancras - A. I was, a little after four in the morning; I there saw Saunders, the prisoner; he was in the field opposite of Church-row, Pancras; he had a butcher's tray on his shoulder. I saw him lower it on a post; it was covered. I went round to him; I asked him what he had in the tray; he said he had got a sheep; he was going to Newgate-market with it. I uncovered it; it was quite hot; it was the hind quarters of a carcase of mutton; there was a knife and steel with it, and a gambol and hook.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner, Saunders; what is he - A. A butcher. He attempted to get away, and struggled very much with me. I asked a man to assist me in taking the mutton. I went to Mr. Hill's field; I found the sheep's head, that is all I found there. Mr. Hill's lad found the entrails, the skin was produced by Mr. Hill, and the entrails all but the heart. Bousey produced the fore quarters to these hind quarter of mutton; it tallied with the hind quarters. Whitehair produced the heart; it tallied with the rest of the entrails.</p>
               <p>- BOLSEY. Q. You are a Somers-town patrol - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Thursday morning, the 12th, did you see the prisoner, Thompson - A. Yes, at five o'clock in the morning, as I was coming off my duty; he was coming from Charlton-street, Somers-town; he had a bundle on his shoulder, tied up in a blue apron; I asked him what he had there; he said, I might feel; he put it down; I felt it was meat. I examined the bundle; it was two fore-quarters of a sheep, the pluck, and fat; it weighed forty-three pounds; the heart was not weighed in it; about a minute or two I looked behind the prisoner, there I saw a heart in a paper; I picked it up; the mutton appeared to be fresh killed, but I cannot say it was warm; I delivered the mutton and the heart into Whitehair's custody.</p>

            ; he asked me if I had lost any pigs, and I went to Mount-street watch-house, about eight o'clock, and found my pigs there; I know them by their colour; one was a brown and striped along the sides, the other was a spotted one; they were both boar pigs.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not kept them till now? - A. No, they were good for nothing; I gave them to my boy; they were of no use to me; the head was mashed to pieces.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. I believe there were many robberies of pigs committed about that time? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. All kinds of cattle you know by the face generally? - A. And by the colour of the body too.</p>
               <p>Q. Their heads were so disfigured you could not see them? - A. They had mashed the heads, but the skin was not broke.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a strange sort of mashing, without breaking the skin? - A. The brains came through the nose.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe many persons in your neighbourhood had pigs of this colour? - A. I have seen none.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, your neighbours, who kept pigs, had not brown and spotted pigs? - A. I mean to swear no such thing.</p>

In searching him, I found a large pocket sewed, not as other pockets are, in the slap, but sewed across the back part of his coat, and in that pocket, there was a great deal of blood; when I got to Marlborough-street, I looked, and that pocket was torn off, and I found it in our water-closet; it was produced before the magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old, and live with my father and mother, in Paul-street, Finsbury. On Sunday night, the 4th of June, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was walking along Holy well-lane, about two slaps before my mother, with two pairs of shoes in my hand, and a pair of boota Hi a separate parcel, lying on my arm—the prisoner came, matched the shoes off my arm, and ran away—I screamed out, ran up Holywell-lane, and down Curtain-road, following him, and crying "Stop thief "—he had an apron round his waist, which I saw fall down as he ran—I did not lose sight of him for more than a moment, in turning the corner, and caught sight of him again,</p>

I am the mother of last witness—I was coming home with her on this Sunday evening, a little behind her—I saw a man very close to her, and pass very quick—she screamed out "Stop thief"—I did not see him take the shoes—she ran, and kept pretty close to him—he got the start of her down Holy well-lane—I pursued, but could not keep up to them—I lost sight of them at the corner of Holy well-lane—I did not see the prisoner again till he was stopped—a person picked up the shoes, which I claimed—I do lot speak positively to the prisoner, I was so flurried at the time.</p>

At a quarter to one o'clock, on Sunday night, I was in the Curtain-road, and heard a cry of "Stop thief," went to the corner leading to Holywell-lane, and saw the prisoner running full butt—I tried to stop him, but could not—he said, "Don't detain me, there he goes," and ran on—I ran after him—as I was pursuing he threw his arms out—I did not see him throw anything from him—I came up to the place where he did so, at the corner of Gloucester-street, and saw a paper parcel lying, and picked it up—it was these shoes—Mrs. Per<lb></lb>kins claimed them and kept them, and gave them to the policeman when he brought the prisoner up—I saw him taken.</p>

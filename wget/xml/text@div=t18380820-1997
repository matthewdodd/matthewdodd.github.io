                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, and live in Totten-ham-coart-road. The prisoner came into my service about sixteen months since—I missed a large quantity of property, and suspected him—I watched when he came from dinner, and communicated with Thornton, an officer-in the 17th of February I was in a room above looking through a hole in the ceiling-when he returned from dinner, between one and two o'clock, I observed him come to the corner of his board—he put his hat on the board and looked at the door—he crossed the shop to where I keep my boots and shoes, looked through the boots, and selected one boot—he had some difficulty to find the other—he found it in the window—he fetched two sheets of paper, and then keeping an eye to one door through which he thought I could see him, he rolled up one and put it into his coat-pocket—he had a large frock-coat on—he then took the other, wrapped that up, tried it round with string, and put it into his pocket—he then patted his lockets, put on his apron, crossed the shop, and hung up his hat which he had before laid on the board—I then communicated with the officer—I same down and told the prisoner to go to Soho-square—he left the shop, and I afterwards saw him in custody—these are my boots—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—they were made for a customer, who, trying to get them on, burst own the back of one of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDEROAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> you had him taken to Hatton garden? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of course—the Magistrate' differed in opinion with-before I had half gone through my case, he dismissed the charge—I him again apprehended at the office door—he was running away, and officer took him—the officer said, "You have three charges; this only one; you can take him again"—we then went to Bow-street—Mr. Twyford was the Magistrate there—he did not hear all I had to say—he said, "I cannot hear all a brother Magistrate has done; etiquette compels me to discharge him"—he said that there were three charges, and he wondered how Mr. Bennett could discharge him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not admit that the prisoner had on other occasions taken boots and shoes from your shop without your knowing any thing about it, and had settled with you for them on Saturday night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I have served him twice as a customer—I stated that he had asked me for a pair of shoes for his sister, and another pair, soiled, for a servant, which I sold. him very cheap—I did not state that he took them out of the stock with-. out my knowledge, or without asking me—he said, "Can you let me have a soiled pair of shoes?" and I said, "Here are some soiled ones you can have at half-a-crown"—I said he had shoes out of my shop, and settled with me on Saturday night; and Mr. Bennett said, "He is not an honest man; he ought to have told you of these"—the prisoner had no customers of his own, to my knowledge—I had spoken to a policeman after I saw-him take first pair, before he took this pair—I had told the policeman</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183808200192"></xptr>
               <p>on Friday, and this occurred on the Saturday; but the policeman had been there the whole week—I had not had the prisoner taken up be<lb></lb>fore-no one came to me for a reference—I did not know that he was en<lb></lb>gaged by a shoemaker at Norwich—he had mentioned nothing about lear<lb></lb>ing my situation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. You said you would divide customers with me, and you knew I was going to Norwich-you said you would <hi rend="italic">serve me out</hi> for it—you know I had one pair of boots for three months when the lady was out of town. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No; you had a pair of shoes for three months, and I said he must pay on the Saturday night, if he did not return them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you previously known of his having them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes I had given him leave—I did not know who they were for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you never sworn that you never served him but twice, and then as a customer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I should say I did not say so—I said, "I let him have two pairs—I served him on two occasions—he told me he knew a friend who would be very glad to purchase them, as they were an exceedingly strong pair, and if I would allow him, he would take them to try—he kept them, saying the party was at Richmond, and he could not get them—he never had boots or shoes from me, except the three pairs I have mentioned, to my recollection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has he not had goods as many as half a dozen times, and settled with you for them on Saturday night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has not half a dozen time—I think I am quite safe in swearing it was not five times—it may have been four times—I may have been mistaken in one—I preferred the charge before the Grand Jury—the prisoner has not been committed by any Ma<lb></lb>gistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you prefer your bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the 17th of April, I believe, while the Grand Jury were sitting—I have never had him ap<lb></lb>prehended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the reason you did not take him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not find him—I waited outside his mother's house while the officer went in—I did not go to his mother's house for him after that—I told the policeman to keep a look-out—I heard he was driving a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and I kept looking at the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>—it was after the second hearing that I went to Bow-street—the week before he was taken, he returned me the pair of ladies' shoes that did not fit the customer-his mother did not appear when he was before Mr. Bennett, and bring forward a pair of shoes, that I saw—there was no pair brought forward that had been part of my stock—I swear it was not so—she did not produce a pair of boots—I did not see her within sufficient distance to produce anything—she stated no<lb></lb>thing there—I swear that without her being heard Mr. Bennett dismissed the prisoner—he was taken up ultimately on the charge of bigamy—he was remanded twice, I believe—I did not tell my story there before the Magistrate—I handed in the certificate of his being indicted.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>up Chenis-street into Gower-street—I went up to him, and asked what he had got in his pocket—he said, "Halloo, what do you want?"—he said, "My own property"—I said, "Where did you bring them from?"—he said, "I am not going to tell you"—I took one boot from one pocket, and the other from the other—I said, "Tell me where you are going to take these"—he said, "I shall not, I shall tell your superiors."</p>

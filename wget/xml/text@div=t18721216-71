I am assistant relieving officer to the Strand Union—on 14th November, about 6.45, a person named Eliza Chirgwin, with three children, applied to me for a night's lodging—I told her that the wards were closed, but that I would give her an order for another workhouse—this is the order I gave—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Strand Union, 14th November, 1872. To the Master of St. Giles's Workhouse. Admit Eliza Chirgwin and three children, Mary, William, and Charles. G. Keller, assistant relieving officer.")—It was given to the bearer at 6.45 p.m., when she was informed that if it was not presented within one hour of that time admission might be refused—it was a stormy night, and the mother and her children appeared wet—I did not think it a case to take into the house at once, but that it was a proper case for the casual ward—I acted in obedience to orders that were given for my guidance—the woman was quite sober when she applied to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I now live in Cleveland Street Workhouse—I am a single woman—on the night of 13th November I had three children, Mary, seven years of age, William, four years, and Charles, three months old—their father is named William Jerrard, and is gone to Chicago; I was going out with him, but they would not take me on board—I am a waistcoat hand,</p>

               <p>but I do anything I can—on the night of the 13th I slept at my aunt's, in Crown Street, Soho—on the following morning my cousin came home, and consequently that night I was not able to sleep there—having no means of paying for a night's lodging I went to the Cleveland Street Workhouse—it was raining very hard—I wanted to be taken in for the night only, as I intended to go back to my aunt's the next day—I asked Mr. Keller to give me a night's lodging; he replied "I would take you in if I possibly could but the wards are closed"—he then gave me an order for St. Giles's Work-house, and I went away—it was then raining very hard, and on the way I stopped at two or three doors for shelter—I got the order about 6.30, I should think, and I went direct to the St. Giles's Workhouse, Short's Gardens—I rang the bell, and the prisoner answered me—he said "You want a night's lodging?"—I answered "Yes"—he then asked whether I had been elsewhere, and I said "To Cleveland Street"—he then asked whether I had an order, and I said I had—he said "Come in"—as I went in he said "Oh! you are drunk again, are you?"—I said "No, I am not; you accused me of that the last time I was here"—he then said he would send for a constable to lock me up, adding "March over there, you drunken beast"—I gave the prisoner the order—I had drunk only half a pint of beer that day—his wife, who was standing by, with a shawl over her head, said "That's right, lock her up"—she then went away, and Mr. Cannon sent the gate<lb></lb>man to get a constable—in the meanwhile I sat down on a form, and the children began to cry because we were going to be locked up—we were then very wet—a constable came in five or ten minutes—the prisoner told him that he wanted to charge me with being drunk and abusive—the constable spoke to me, and then called Mr. Cannon on one side—I did not hear what they said to each other—subsequently Mr. Cannon ordered the constable to take me to the station, and I was taken to Bow Street—there Inspector Usher would not take the charge brought against me—I did not use any abusive language to the prisoner—the Inspector told me to sit down by the fire, and sent out for some coffee and bread and butter—the police surgeon was called in to see us, and then we were sent back to St. Giles's by another constable, because, the Inspector said, perhaps Mr. Cannon would take me in then—when we reached the workhouse Mr. Cannon was standing at the door—he spoke to Mr. Smith, the assistant surgeon, and then refused to take us in—the policeman said "Then you will not take her in?"—he replied "No"—the policeman then said "Then I must take her to Cleveland Street"—the prisoner added "Take her away then"—he also said "She is quite able to walk"—the constable then took us in a four-wheel cab to Cleveland Street, where we were taken in and put to bed, supplied with tea, and our clothes were dried—when I first reached St. Giles's I think it was about 7.30, and when we got to Cleveland Street it was 9.45—when the constable took us into custody we walked to Bow Street—it was raining then, and also when we returned to the workhouse, but not quite so much—the baby was in long clothes, and they were very wet—the baby remained with me during the night—before this day it had had a slight cough, but nothing to speak of—it had a cold about five weeks ago, but had recovered—it was a beautiful little dear, and was fat—on Friday morning, between 5 and 6 o'clock, it became very restless—it coughed, and had a kind of wheezing at its chest—I spoke to the night nurse about it—at 11 o'clock on Friday morning I showed the baby to the doctor, and he prescribed for it—medicine was given and poultices were applied—on Saturday it became</p>

When I went to St. Giles's the first time I went under the name of Eliza Gerard, and then the prisoner charged me with being drunk—he sent for two policemen on that occasion, but I was not taken to Bow Street—he threatened me that if I did not pick so much oakum the next morning he would have me locked up—he left me half-a-pound to pick, but, having bad thumbs, I could not do the work—he then said he would have it "in" for me if I came in again; he said it was through obstinacy that I did not pick the oakum—the last time I was there was about a month previous.</p>

On the evening of the 14th November, I was on duty at the Bow Street Police Station—at about 8 o'clock I saw Eliza Chirgwin in the dock, and the prisoner then charged her with being drunk and using abusive language—I told him that I could not substantiate a portion of the charge, that of drunkenness, as I believed her to be sober—the woman denied using abusive language, and said the prisoner had called her a drunken beast—the prisoner afterwards said he would charge her with giving a false name, adding that on a former occasion she gave tie name of Gerard, and that now she had come in the name of Chirgwin, which he believed to be false—the woman then said that the former name was the name of the father of her children, and that her own name was Chirgwin—I then told the prisoner that I did not consider that a false pretence, and I refused to entertain the charge—I next told him that, in my opinion, he had acted very cruelly towards the woman and her children in sending them out in the rain; and that I should send for the divisional surgeon and procure his opinion on the subject; and that if he thought fit, I would get a certificate from him and send them back to the same workhouse—he then said that if I did so he would not receive them—he did not say why—it was a tempestuous night, the rain falling incessantly—the children were very wet, and apparently very tired and worn—I directed them to sit by the fire and sent out for some refreshment for them—Dr. Mills came and saw them, and then wrote this certificate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner returned to the station in about half-an-hour with an Act of Parliament; and pointed to a clause in it, saying that under that clause I must take that charge which he had made respecting a false name—I was well aware of the clause, and I said it was of no use, as I should not take any charge against the woman that night; I also said that I con<lb></lb>sidered the charge an afterthought—the prisoner then asked for the Superintendent, but he was not in the station—he then went away, and I got another constable named Scutt to go back to the workhouse with the woman and her children telling him to show the certificate of Dr. Mills,</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant medical officer to the united parishes of St. Giles and St. George, Bloomsbury—at about 9.30 on the night of the 14th November I was at the workhouse, when the prisoner came to me, saying that he had some casuals below, whom he wished me to see—he said that they belonged to the Strand Union; that he had taken them to Bow Street, and charged them; that the Inspector had refused to take the charge; and that he had brought them back, and wished me to see them—he gave me to understand that he had brought them back, and he wished me to state my opinion as to whether they were able to go to Cleveland Street—I then went to the surgery and saw them—I read the certificate brought by the constable—the baby had a slight wheezing at the chest; but I stated that it was my opinion that they were able to pro<lb></lb>ceed to Cleveland Street—the slight wheezing indicated bronchitis—I thought they were able to walk, but I heard the constable say he would take them in a cab—the woman was quite sober—when she went out she exclaimed to me "God bless you"—I attended her at the workhouse when she was suffering from uterine hemorrhage—I attended her first as an out-patient, and subsequently she came inside—that was three months ago—the clothes of the woman and children were wet, but not wringing wet—it is no part of my duty to see casuals, but I thought the prisoner had obtained authority to come and ask my opinion—after they were taken in, if they became ill, it would have been the duty of the prisoner to send for me—I have told all that was said between us on that occasion—the prisoner did not tell me that the woman had been to the Strand Workhouse, or that they had come to be admitted to St. Giles's Workhouse—he only told me that he had taken them to Bow Street; he did not say how long they had been in wet clothes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not enquire how long they had been in wet clothes, nor as to their wanting food—I did not think it was my duty to send for the master of the workhouse; it was a casual ward case—I was never before called to say whether casuals were able to proceed to another union workhouse—it was not raining very much when I saw the woman and children at 9.30—I observed that the child looked pale, they all looked pale; still I thought them fit to proceed with safety.</p>

                  </hi>. I am master of St. Giles's Workhouse, a position I have held fifteen years—the main entrance to the workhouse is 50 yards distant from the entrance to the casual ward—the prisoner has held the office of superintendent of the ward for about three years—I was aware of the arrangement to take into our casual wards paupers belonging to the Strand Union; it began on the 11th November, and the prisoner was aware of it—such paupers had to bring with them an order signed by the relieving officer of the Strand Union—I did not know that the woman and her children had been sent away on the night in question until 12 o'clock—I ought to have been sent for—in urgent cases paupers are taken in wherever</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner had nothing to do with the reception of paupers into the workhouse; that was the night porter's duty—the prisoner had regular rules to go by—the arrangement between the two unions was to exist for three months, to see how it would act—it was the duty of the prisoner to receive the casuals from the Strand Union, or else to send to the union a communication that the wards were full—if a drunken woman with three children came, it would have been the duty of the prisoner to take in the children and send the woman to the police station—it was not his duty to ask the opinion of the assistant surgeon as to whether the woman and her children were fit to go to Cleveland Street—the opinion that they were fit to proceed to Cleveland Street was no reason why the prisoner should have refused their admission to St. Giles's—I do not know that there are any printed rules for the guidance of the Superintendent of the casual ward.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and a Licentiate of the Apothecaries Company, and medical officer to the Strand Union—on Friday morning, the 15th November, between 10 and 11 o'clock, I saw the deceased child; it was suffering from the effects of a cold—I ordered linseed poultices to be applied both to the back and the front of the child, and I prescribed medicine for it—on Saturday it had become much worse—I saw it last alive on Saturday—after its death, by direction of the Coroner, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, when I found that the child had suffered from bronchial pneumonia, which I believe was the cause of death—I believe, from the state of the child when I first saw it, that the inflamma<lb></lb>tion had not existed for more than a day—in forming my opinion, I took into account all the circumstances of the case—I found all the organs, excepting the lungs, in a healthy condition—I have been a surgeon for thirty years—the longer the exposure of a child such as that the greater the danger—if at the time it had a slight cold, exposure would be still more dangerous—to keep a child in wet clothes from 7 to half-past 8 or to a quarter to 10 would have a tendency to shorten its life—if it had been suffering from a cough, keeping it in wet clothes and exposed to damp air were calculated to produce the disease which I found on making a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination.</p>

               <p>at the Westminster County Court. I was present at the hearing of the plaint of Walstab against Allen, on 9th Dec.—after the evidence had been taken on the part of the complainant the defendant Allen was examined as a witness—I took down what he said—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a transcript in my own handwriting of what passed—I believe it to be perfectly correct—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>) "Henry Allen examined by Mr. Roberts. Did you ever give that gentleman (Mr. Green) an order for goods?—I do not know him. Please answer my question?—No, I never did. Have you ever seen him before?—I never saw him before this morning. Did you ever pay him any money?—No—(<hi rend="italic">Frederick Pitt came forward.</hi>) Now Mr. Allen, did you ever receive any firewood at any time from that man?—No, I have not received any at all. Now when you say you have not received any at all, what do you mean?—I mean this year and a half, since I disposed of the business. Have you not received any wood from anybody at all for a year and a half?—Not myself. Have you received any on behalf of anybody else, or any other person?—No, I have not. Do you know that young man's countenance at all?—No; I do not. Then you conscientiously swear you never saw him in your house before, I mean in your place in Great Wild-street?—Never, to my knowledge; I can conscientiously swear to that. Look at that signature, and tell me is that your signature?—No. You are sure?—It is not. Are you certain of that?—Quite certain of it. Are you also quite certain this man never presented his book to you?—He never pre<lb></lb>sented it to me (<hi rend="italic">Pickett called into the witness-box</hi>). Did that man deliver any goods to you?—No; I never saw him before. Is that your signature?—No; it is not. That you swear?—Yes, I will. You see that very gentle<lb></lb>man who states himself to be the plaintiff's clerk (Mr. Green), did you ever see him, and promise to pay him any sum of money?—No. Did that gentle<lb></lb>man ever call upon you in Great Wild-street?—No; not to my knowledge. Did you ever say you would look into the account, and pay it?—I never had any account at all. When did you first go to Great Wild-street to live?—About twenty-one years ago. How long did you live there, without any interruption, continuously, how many years?—Up to June, 1850. Did you dispose of the business?—I let the business. To whom?—To a person of the name of Husband. Where did you go to live?—I went next door. Did you, and do you, carry on business there still?—Yes; but only in the van and cart line. You say you opened a shed next door?—No, Sir. Do you reside in that place now?—Yes; I have resided there ever since the time I dis<lb></lb>posed of the business. And you persist in it that you never had these goods, and no one ever applied to you personally for payment of this account?—Yes, I do. When you let the business, did your name continue up?—It was up about a month or six weeks after I left. How came it to be removed?—To get a license for the beer. Yes; but that could have been done without your name. Did you at the same time you were there keep a coal-shed, and retail beer?—Yes. Did the license expire?—Yes, it did; it expired, and another license was got. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Plaintiff.</hi> Have you no idea where this Mr. Husband is?—A great many persons go there to know, but they cannot succeed in finding out. What is the Christian name?—Henry Husband. And the good-will, and stock, and fixtures, were pur<lb></lb>chased at the time, and there was no law expenses?—Only the good-will and fixtures were taken. And he only gave you 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—That is all. How long did he remain there?—About three or four months. Come, let us have it a little nearer than that, say whichever you like; do the premises belong to you?—No; I let them to him on 25th June. Did be happen to go away</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185201050003"></xptr>
               <p>before or after next quarter-day?—He went away before quarter-day. Then it was not three months?—No, it was not; I do not know what be paid for it, but he was gone too." (There was not a question preceding that, 'Did he let it to somebody else.') "Did Mr. Jerry sell it to anybody else?—Yes, What was his name?—Jackson. Where is Mr. Jackson?—He is still there, and the name, I believe, is up, but I will not be certain; I really think Jerry's name is up. By the <hi rend="smallCaps">JUDGE</hi>. Did you, Mr. Allen, assist Hus<lb></lb>band in the business?—No, I did not. Then you were not occasionally much at the house?—No, Sir, I do not suppose I have been there much at all. By the <hi rend="smallCaps">PLAINTIFF</hi>. What sort of man in appearance is Husband?—He is a stoutish man. Like you?—Yes. And what sort of a man is Mr. Jerry, is he a stoutish man too?—Yes, Sir, he is; Mr. Jackson is a little man. The <hi rend="smallCaps">JUDGE</hi>. Oh! there must be a verdict for the Plaintiff, unquestionably; all these witnesses identify him, and it seems to me I must commit him."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live at 15, Bedfordbury. I have known Mr. Allen about twenty years—I have seen his handwriting—I can<lb></lb>not say whether I should know his handwriting, without seeing it—I see the "H. Allen" written across this book—I do not believe it is his writing, I cannot positively say, but I do not believe it is—I never heard anything against his character—I have known him during the time he kept the shop up to the present time, and have done work for him.</p>

I know Allen—I have had opportunities of knowing his handwriting, and have occa<lb></lb>sionally had bills from him at different times—it appears to me as if this "H. Allen" in this book is too good a writing for his; he is a very inferior writer—I very much doubt its being his—I have known him fifteen years—he always bore an honourable character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brass-worker and gas-fitter, and live at 4, Endell-street. I have known Allen twenty two years—I always thought him an honest, truthful man—I have dealt with him up to recently—I have had opportunities of knowing his handwriting, but I have not seen it lately, perhaps not for a year and a half—this "H. Allen" is not like the writing I have seen—I have seen him write—the last time I should say was two years ago—his is a common way of writing—he would not write like a learned man that could change his hand, it would be regular and general in its appearance—I cannot charge my memory with what I last saw him write—I have seen him write his own name not a long time ago—I do not think I have seen him write his name for these two years or more—that was in his own shop—I cannot charge my memory with the occasion—I have been to his shop when goods have been delivered there—I have worked for him as a gas-fitter, not as a journeyman, but as a master—I keep a shop in Endell-street, Bloomsbury—I was not at the County Court.</p>

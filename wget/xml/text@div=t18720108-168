                  </hi>. I live at 115, Lancaster Road, Notting Hill—between 3 and 4 o'clock, on the morning of 18th December, I heard a noise, but where it proceeded from I could not say—I got up, and turned up the gas, and I heard nothing more—soon afterwards my servant came and spoke to me, and I went down to the dining-room—I found that two desks had been broken open—I lost a great coat, a rug, and a hat-brush, 250 cigars, a biscuit-dish, au opera-glass, three scarves, three pipes, two cigar-holders, a knife, a pencil-case, a pen-holder, or the silver of one—the cigars were of peculiar manufacture—one lot was a Manilla kind of cigar, as distin<lb></lb>guished</p>

I know the opera glass by the case and the name upon it—the case is worn in a peculiar manner, and it came from a distance—I have had the glasses ten or twelve years—the case is worn in a smiliar way to what mine was—I lost a screw out of the glasses, and I had another and a much larger screw put in—in this there is a much larger screw I see, than what is usually put in opera glasses—I cannot swear, however, that the screw was the one I had put in—I identify the pencil case and penholder from their peculiarities—the pencil case is also worn, and very similar to that which I had in my possession some time back—I lost more things than those I have mentioned, but I cannot remember, excepting a fusee box, what they were.</p>

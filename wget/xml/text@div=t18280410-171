On the 3d of March I was going into my cellar, I told my boy to light a candle, and go down first; he did so, and found Hannah Bass in the cellar; he told me, and I took hold of her as she came up the stairs, and said, "This is the way you do it." She said, "What?" She then went into their room, which is on the ground floor; I went in with her, and saw a sack of mine on the floor; I took it up, and saw the boards were broken, and there was a hole down into the cellar; I then looked under their bed, and saw two sacks belonging to a man whom I deal with, and a quantity of potatoes, some kidney and some other - another lodged of mine and William Bass were sitting in the room, and I said, "This is a pretty start:" the other woman said, "What?" I said, "Mrs. Bass was in my cellar" - she clapped her hands together, and said, "I dare say she went there to hang herself" - the man said he knew nothing about it - I sent them all to the watch-house.</p>

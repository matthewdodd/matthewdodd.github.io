They found no Money upon Knight; but Picken took from this Evidence a Knife, Fork, and a Pair of Scissars, all in one Sheath. He said he would keep them for Luck; and then taking some Money from him, he left him to Packer, who rifled him of the rest, the whole amounting to between 5 and 6 l.

However, he carried them to the Round-house, and from thence before Mr. Justice Ellis, where they were desir'd to shew the Receipt for the 50 l. paid to Sir John Tash. Pickers said it was in his Pocket-Book, which was in the Coat that he pluck'd off when he shifted himself at the Round-House; and that Packer's Wife had taken that Coat to her Lodgings in Parker's-lane in Drury-Lane, or else to his own Lodgings in Cross-Court, which was not far distant from the other. A Man was sent to search at both Places, and a Pocket-Book was found, but no Receipt in it. This increasing the Suspicion, the Justice order'd them to be examin'd apart. They both agreed, that they hired the Horses of Mr. French at the Pavior's-Arms by Smithfield-Bars to go to Windsor, for 4 s. and that they set out between 3 and 4, and rode to Brentford. Picken said one of the Horses was a Grizzle-grey and the other a Bay; and that it growing dark when they came to Brantford, they changed their Minds, turn'd their Horses, and rode directly back again, without once alighting, or stopping to drink either at Brentford or any other Place upon the Road. But Packer said that both the Horses were says, that they slope to drink at several Places on the Road, and at Brentford alighted, drank Ale and Brandy, and staid about half an Hour. The Prisoners were committed to New-Prison; and several Countrymen that used Smithfield Market having; been lately robb'd, the Knife and Fork that were taken from them were left at

I might have done it last Sunday; but now it's too late. - French deposed, that on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, the Prisoners hired two Horses of him, one a Grizzled-grey, and the other a Bay: At each time they came about 4 in the Afternoon, and always told him they went only to the Upper Flask at Hampstead. They commonly return'd between 10 and 11, as in particular they did that Saturday Night the Robbery was committed, and came in then very dirty and splash'd. The Prisoners said nothing in their Defence, only Picken told the Court, that he found the Knife in Smithfield.

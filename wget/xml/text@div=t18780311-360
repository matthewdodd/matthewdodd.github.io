                  </hi>. I live at Woodbridge, near Wimborne, Dorset—in September last I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Western Gazette</hi> headed "Money, money, money," in consequence of which I wrote to George Finch, of 185, New North Road, London. (Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">FITZPATRICK</hi>, <hi rend="italic">clerk to Messrs. Wontner, proved the service on the prisoners of a notice to produce the documents in the case</hi>.) I sent Finch a proposal for a loan of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at 6 per cent, for six years, in reply to which I received this document. (<hi rend="italic">This was signed</hi> "R. <hi rend="italic">Joyce</hi>, 33, <hi rend="italic">Highbury Vale, N</hi>," <hi rend="italic">asking for</hi> 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>, 6<hi rend="italic">d., which would be returned if the loan was not granted</hi>.) I then sent Finch 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in postage stamps to 33, Highbury Vale, and received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), in con<lb></lb>sequence of which I sent a post-office order for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in favour of John Palmer, payable at the Kingsland money order office, and addressed it to George Finch, 33, Highbury Vale—I then received this letter.

This inquiry was placed in my hands by the Commissioners, in consequence of complaints being made by Mr. Preston, and also by Morgan and Scott, solicitors, of Cardiff—I went first to 185, New North Road, but could not find either of the prisoners; I then went to 92, Canonbury Road, but could find neither of them—I was on those premises on the morning of 28th January, having a warrant at the office—I saw Finch in the shop—it is a little newspaper shop kept by Miss Gray—Baker was standing about ten yards from the shop in the middle of the pavement—I saw Miss Gray hand Finch these two letters and this telegram—I took them from him—the letters are addressed "R. Joyce, 92, Canonbury Road," and the telegram and one of the letters are from Mr. Noel—I took Finch in custody, told him I was an officer, brought him to the door, and saw Sergeant Lambert arrest Baker—I told them both they would be charged with obtaining money by fraud from various persons in the name of Finch and Joyce—Finch said "Where is your warrant?"—I said "I cannot show it to you now, I will show it to you when you get to the station"—I knew him by sight—I searched him at the station and found a pocket knife, a key, and a card, and on Baker a knife and this engraved copy of a promissory note. (<hi rend="italic">This was for</hi> 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">payable to R.

                  </hi>. I live at 27, Red Lion Square, and am an expert in handwriting of many years' standing—my attention has been called to the documents A B 2, 3, 4, and 5, and also to all the documents; they are all in one writing, whether signed by Finch or Joyce, except the promissory note found on Baker, which is similar to the writing of this other promis<lb></lb>sory note; they are identical.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>), I took Baker on the morning of the 28th—he wanted to know what I meant by taking him in custody—I said that it would be explained hereafter—I received this letter from Miss Gray.</p>

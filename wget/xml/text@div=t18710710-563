                  </hi>. I am servant to Lieutenant Robert Hugh Wallace, of the Royal Artillery, at Woolwich—on 18th June I missed a forage cap from my master's quarters—I saw it safe, on Saturday night the 17th, at 7 o'clock—on the Monday I missed a tobacco pouch and a red morocco cigar case—I have seen a tobacco pouch since at the Police Court—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) it is like the one I missed—when I went to my master's quarters on the Saturday night, they were in the, usual state.</p>

               <p>17th June, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—he left me, and I met him again, and again I was with him till 9 o'clock—he told me he had been home to have his tea—he came back again about 7 o'clock—it came on to rain, and we went underneath the trees for shelter—he left me there and went up the steps to go to the officers' quarters—he came back a short time afterwards with an officer's cap, a pouch, and a cigar case—I think there were some cigars in it, but I would not be positive—I asked him where he got the cap from—he said a friend of his, in the officers' quarters, had lent it to him, as it was his sister's birthday, and he was going to act a charade at home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first saw him about 5 o'clock—I met him on the common, by chance—I am a respectable girl—I went up there on a message from my sister—I went to Nightingale Street, to get a parcel for her—I was with the prisoner from 5 o'clock to 9 o'clock—it was not raining all the time; it was not raining when he went to his tea—I was going home when it came on to rain, but we stood up—I had known the prisoner for a long time—he used to come down to my house, and take me out—I thought him a very respectable young man—I suppose he was courting me—I did not see any women about when he came out with the cap—I did not see him speak to three women—there was an old lady and a young lady standing under the shelter, but he never said anything to them—he was about 50 yards from the officers' quarters when he showed me the cap—he took it from a large coat he had on—he took the things out, and showed them to me voluntarily, or I should not have seen them.</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday 17th June, someone came to my shop, 5, Artillery Place, Woolwich, about 10 o'clock, with a forage cap, with lace round it—I have a bit of the lace here—the cap is destroyed—they are no use, we only buy them for the old lace—he asked me what I would give for the cap—he looked very respectable, and I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I did not ask him where he got it—I was just in the act of closing—he was so wrapped up on the Saturday night that I could not identify him again, except by his voice.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He had the appearance of an officer—officers come and sell their old caps to me sometimes—it is not a very common thing, but it is done occasionally—I had no doubt that he was an officer—the price for a new forage cap would be 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the lace, when old, is worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is the full value, I assure you—he came alone.</p>

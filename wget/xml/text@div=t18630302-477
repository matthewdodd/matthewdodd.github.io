                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, in the employ of the General Iron Foundry Company (Limited), Upper Thames-street, City—the prisoner Martin was employed by them in the wharf department—the company sell old iron, the result of breakage—it was part of Martin's duty, in common with other men, to see the iron weighed before it is delivered—if a customer comes and purchases iron, it is Martin's duty, if he sees it weighed, to come and report to me the amount, and I then make out what is called a check-note—on 10th February Martin came to me and said, "A ticket for Cop<lb></lb>pins"</p>

H. are my initials—I gave that note into Martin's hands—it would be his duty to take it to the counting-house—the purchaser would go with him, or with the man who served him, and see the note given in and the money paid—I know Coppins as a purchaser of iron at our premises—I saw him there that day, after he had been served, between 2 and 3 o'clock, nearer 3 than 2—I gave directions to a man named Scarf to keep a lookout—I was afterwards fetched from my dinner to the lane outside—I saw the cart when loaded—there were other persons there who weighed the iron that was in it—I saw the metal re-weighed out of Coppins' cart; it weighed 7cwt. 3qrs. 16lbs.</p>

I am a warehouseman in the employ of the General Iron Foundry Company (Limited)—I was present in Gardner's lane, on 10th February—I saw Martin weigh some metal—I had been spoken to by my foreman—I was a few yards from the prisoners; they could not see me from where I was—they were together—I saw Martin, in Coppins' presence, weigh some iron—when the iron was in the scale I saw Martin proceed to the heap where the broken metal is usually kept, take from then three distinct handfuls of broken sash-weights, and put them into the cart, without having passed them through the scale—both the prisoners were then present—the cart was about fourteen feet, I should think, from the scale—when I saw that I went and spoke to my foreman, and when I came back the iron that had been left in the scale was taken away—I was standing in the lane when the iron was afterwards taken out of the cart, but I did not see it weighed—I saw the cart when it first came to the wharf; there was no iron in it then.</p>

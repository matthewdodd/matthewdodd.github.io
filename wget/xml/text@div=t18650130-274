                  </hi>. I am an assistant in the Greenwich County Court—on 16th January I was put in possession of the prisoner's house, 8, Lucas-street, Dept<lb></lb>ford, by John Bailey, the chief officer of the Court—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my warrant to levy 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the prisoner's goods due to William George Holloway—the prisoner was not there when I went; he came home at a little after 10—I was in the back kitchen—he said, "What do you do here!"—I Said, "I come for Mr. Holloway's account," and showed him the warrant—he said, "If you do not go out of the house directly I will knock you down with the poker"—I made my way to the door and asked him to let me out but he would not—he struck me on the head with the poker and knocked me back in my chair—when I came to myself I went to the front door, but could not get out—I said that I wanted to go to the doctor—I called his wife upstairs, and in a minute or two the prisoner came and let me out—my head was bleeding furiously.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he let himself in by a latch-key? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he let me out in about a minute or two, as soon as he saw me bleeding, and went with me to a doctor—I went down to the station, and he went with me—he did not offer to make me any compensation—he said something, but I cannot say what; he took hold of my arm and led me down, and was at once taken in custody.</p>

               <p>doing this"—I saw that Vine was bleeding very much from a wound about three inches long, on the right side of his head—I fetched Dr. Smith, who dressed it, and took the prisoner in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he discharged on bail? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the first time; he was the second—I did not measure the wound—the doctor cut the hair away—it was a big wound, and swelled considerably.</p>

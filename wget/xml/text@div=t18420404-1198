                  </hi>. I am gate-keeper at the Regent's dry-dock, Millwall, Poplar. On the 5th of March, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon I saw the prisoner come into the dock, and being a stranger, I watched him—I saw him go round a new steam-boat which was building, and when he left he had this saw in his hand—he put it through the fence off the premises upon the foot-path, through a gate there, which was fastened at the top and open at the bottom—he then turned round, and I met him on the saw-pit—I said, "I want you"—he said, "What for?—I said "For that saw"—he said, "There is the saw, I did not mean to steal it'—I took him and gave him in charge.</p>

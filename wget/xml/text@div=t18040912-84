             sworn. - I am a constable and beadle of St. George's in the East: I heard the cry of stop thief; I might be about thirty yards, when I heard it, from Mr. Wheatley's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he running then? - A. Yes; he made rather a slip, and I stopped him; he swore very much, he cut my eye while I was securing him, and struggled to get away from me; he d - d the country, and said that the French would come here, and that he should have a glorious slaughter; he said he had been fighting for his King and Country, and at Somerset-house they had been robbing him of his money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing in the kennel? - A. He put his hand in the kennel, and rubbed his righthand in the kennel; it is a strong dirty kennel.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before? - A. No; I understood, by the jailer, that he had been in custody before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was not in his shop at all, I was coming along the street; they cried out stop thief; I am innocent of the charge, they knocked me down, I asked them what was the matter, they said I had robbed him; they would not hearken to me, they said I was the thief; I said I was not, I was going to Deptford; I am a seafaring man, and have not a friend in the world.</p>

The Prisoner's Lady went from our House at half an Hour after two in the Morning, and he was not then to be found; on which account, when we found the House was robbed, we suspected him, and heard that he came home at five that Morning. Upon searching his Room, I found ten Silver Spoons and two Salts hid in a Cloth up the Chimney. I asked him how he got into our House the second time. He confest that he returned in half an Hour after he first went away, and past through the Kitchen into the Yard, where he waited till the Family was abed, and that then he took the Goods, opened the Street Door (and left it open) and went away between three and four in the Morning He had lived with my Mistress eight Months ago.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed - A.About ten o'clock, as near as I can guess, and I got up about six o'clock in the morning. I lost from the house a copper and the lead work round it, and a plank that the lead was nailed to, three handkerchiefs, a pair of my stockings, a window-curtain, a coffee pot, a lanthorn, and a flat iron; I saw them all there the night before in the house, and locked them up myself.</p>
               <p>Q. The circumstance, who did it you do not know of your own knowledge - A. When the information was given me I sought for Bedding, and found him in Bell-street, Paddington, the same morning, between seven and eight o'clock, I went up to him and asked him whether his name was not Bedding, he said, yes, I told him he was my prisoner, he said, for what? I said, for taking my copper away; which at that time was the principal thing that I missed; he denied being at Kensil-green for a long while before; I said your back proves that you have had the copper, for the soot was on the back of his coat. I took him to Marlborough-street and had him searched by Mr. Foy and myself, we found these handkerchiefs in his pocket, and my stockings. He declared he had not been in Kensil-green, he could not tell when.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You never saw me nigh your ground, did you - A. I found the property in your possession.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to think of me in particular - A. Because you always bore a bad character. I enquired into your character by two men that came, from your country; they said you deserved to be hanged twenty years ago.</p>

I took this man in custody at the public house near the office in Marlborough-street, about nine o'clock in the morning of the 29th of May, I searched him and found three handkerchiefs and a pair of stockings in his pocket, which the prosecutor said were his; the prosecutor charged him with having stolen a copper as well as these things; the prisoner said he had not; I said, it seems as if you had, you have got the marks on your back. His back was sooty, he appeared as if he had been carrying a copper; he said he had not done so, nor had not been near Kensil-green for some time before; I asked him how he became possessed of these, to which he gave no answer till he was before the magistrate, and then he said he had found them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked them up about five o'clock in the morning; I was all that day emptying gravel at Mr. Bowns's, I and two more; I went home that night and went up to the Brazen Head and had two pints of beer; then I went home to the Green Man and went to bed, and paid three pence for the bed before ever I went to bed.</p>

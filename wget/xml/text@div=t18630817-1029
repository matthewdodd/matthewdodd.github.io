                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Blackmore, of the Caledonian-road—on 30th July, at 11 in the morning, Bailey brought a clock to pawn—I asked him if it was his own; he said it belonged to his old grand<lb></lb>mother—I advanced him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—he afterwards brought this other clock (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and a chimney-glass—I asked him again if they were his own; he said, "Yes, and if my old woman don't alter, I will bring the house to pawn"—I advanced 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the clock, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the chimney-glass—about</p>

               <p>ten minutes afterwards he brought an old-fashioned dressing-glass, on which 1 advanced 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he then asked me if I would take in a large chimney-glass, and a pair of screens—I said, "I will, provided you will allow me to come round to the house to see the property—he said that he was doing the busi<lb></lb>ness for two young swells in the neighbourhood, and should get a trifle out of it, and would come round in the morning, and let me know—after he left I did not like the two different stories, and found on inquiry that he had given me a false address.</p>

There are some workshops to let there belonging to Mr. Cox, and on Wednesday a foreigner came to look at them. I showed them to him; he said that he was in some little difficulty, and wanted to place some furniture somewhere, and that there was not a cartload. I told him he was welcome to put it in my kitchen, and he did so. He said that he was in business, and was about going through the Insolvency Court. He after<lb></lb>wards asked me to pledge the articles, and gave me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. He gave his address, Harwood-street, Camden Town. I sent my daughter there, but she could not find it. There was a fifth man, a Frenchman, in it, with a good deal of hair. I have been in business there nine years, and should not have pledged the property in my name and neighbourhood if I knew it had been stolen. I never saw these men before.</p>

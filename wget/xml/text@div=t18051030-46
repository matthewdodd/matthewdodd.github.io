               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to him to induce him to confess all this? - A. No; he said that he staid there five years, or thereabouts, and then he got away and went on board a ship; I believe he mentioned the names of different ships that he had been on board of, but I cannot recollect; some were ships of war and some Indiamen.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he conduct himself? - A. Extremely well; indeed I never saw a man behave better in my life, and the circumstance that caused me to mark his conduct above the rest of the people was, we were without provisions almost, for about three weeks, on the north coast of New Guinea, when the rest of the crew were murmuring, and seemingly inclined to mutiny, I never heard a syllable of discontent from this man all the time.</p>

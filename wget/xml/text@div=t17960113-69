               <p>I am bailiff to Mr. Blackall; I had thirty-two and Mr. Strong's sheep at grass, I lost one of them in the 6th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it before? - A. Upon Monday the 4th; I heard on Wednesday, that there were two men taken up with a sheep, and I went and reckoned my sheep, and found one missing, and informed Mr. Strong of it; I searched the field, and found the skin in a ditch, which I sent to Mr. Strong the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the skin again? - A. I will not positively swear to it, the mark is very dim; I found it on the premises, adjoining where the sheep lay.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This is the skin of the sheep that you will not swear to, that you found in the ditch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Strong.) Q. Had the skin that was sent to you any mark? - A. Yes; it was a circle, with the letter L in the middle of it; it was not my mark, it was a mark that was upon it when I bought it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Strong.) Q. This skin and entrails were found in a ditch in the next field? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had that sheep? - A. Two or three months.</p>
               <p>Q. You had sheep of different marks? - A. No; they were all marked L.</p>
               <p>Q. That mark is not the first letter of your name? - A. No; it is the initial of the gentleman's name I bought them of, Mr. Loggan.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole belonging to Bow-street: On the 5th of January, about eight at night, as I was going the back road to Islington; about a mile or better from Stroud-green, I met the two prisoners at the bar, with each of them a bag upon their backs; I clapped my hand upon the bag, and said, my lad, what have you got here; he said he had got some meat that he had brought from Highgare; I asked him what butcher he bought it of, and he said he did not buy it of a butcher, he bought it of a countryman; I asked him if he knew the countryman, and he said, yes; I told them they should go back with me to the turnpike, which they did; when I opened it, it was a sheep cut in half, one half in one bag, and the other in the other; the sheep was quite warm; in pulling the meat out of the bags, two knives, and a little case to stick the knives in, came out with it; I asked them where they got them, and they said they had bought them also; then I took them to town; the next morning I went down to Stroud-green, from there to Crouch-end, and from there to Hornsey, and informed the farmers that had lost any sheep, that two persons were in custody; I came to town again, and searched the lodgings; the prisoners lodged together in Tenter-alley, Moornelds, and there I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130115"></xptr>found another knife marked the same as these two we found in the bag; one of them had given a man a guinea to learn to be a shoe-maker, and the other was a servant out of place, as he told us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. They went back with you to the turnpike? - A. Yes; to examine the bags.</p>
               <p>Q. They went very readily with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with you? - A. Yes; two more patroles, they told us they bought it upon the hill.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Strong.) Q. There was a mark upon this skin that you knew it by? - A. Yes.</p>

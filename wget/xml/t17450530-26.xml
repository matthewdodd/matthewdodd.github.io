            . The Prisoner came to my house, to desire me to do an errand for her, and that was to pawn a spoon for the gentlewoman at the Paul's Head [Mrs. Preston.] She said, Mrs. Preston had some words with her husband, and gave her this spoon out of her pocket apron to pawn, because she had no money to give her; and I knew she was as intimate in the house, as if she had lived there, and she pawned it for 7 s. to one Mrs. Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. to Preston. Do you believe your wife lent the spoon to the Prisoner, in order to raise money to pay her?</p>
               <p>Preston. No, I am sure not in any shape.</p>
               <p>Q. She says, your wife and you had some words; how do you know but she might?</p>
               <p>Preston. And please you my Lord, if I must speak I must. The maid was ill, and my wife desired the Prisoner to carry some broth to the maid, and gave her a silver spoon to carry to her; and in the evening after she was gone, when I came to look for the spoon, the spoon and the saucepan were both gone. I lent her 10 s. 7 d. to serve her, and she wanted to borrow a crown more. I hope, gentlemen, you'll be as favourable to her as you can.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman has been pleased to say to this hour, that he would not take 20 pounds for what he has got by me. I did not think it worth while to send for any witnesses, I left myself to the gentleman's and your honour's goodness. <rs id="t17450530-26-verdict165" type="verdictDescription">

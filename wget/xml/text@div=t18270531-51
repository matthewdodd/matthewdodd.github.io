            . I am a mariner, and was chief mate on board the Woodbridge - we sailed for Sierra Leone on the 8th of April, 1826, and returned on the 5th of November - there was a seaman named John McDonald on board - he shipped at Sierra Leone, not from this country - he died on the passage home - he had been about six weeks with us. He had fifty-seven Spanish dollars, 7s. 6d. in English money, and 81/2d. in copper, which he gave into my charge just before he died, and told me where to send it; when we arrived at Spithead Captain Lamb demanded it of me, to put with his wages, and I gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you give the captain the direction which McDonald gave you? A. Yes; there was only one McDonald on board.</p>

            , and directed it to No. 19, Fore-street, Plymoth - I made a mistake, it should have been New-street. The prisoner Driscoll applied to me at my house, No. 26, Lower-John-street, Commercial-road, a few days before Christmas, to know what wages McDonald had due to him - I told him, and that there were also fifty-seven dollars, and that he had left a verbal will, that the dollars were to be given to his daughter - he said the daughter was gone to Ireland, that she was a natural child. I had told him I had written to her at Plymouth - he said he had married a sister of McDonald's, and had a will made by McDonald before he left England - I said if he would give me the daughter's address I would write to her, and if she consented, I would give the money to him or any body else, provided she went before a Magistrate, and swore she was a natural child, but I should not pay him or any body till I heard from the daughter - he said nothing about McDonald being in debt to him - I saw no more of him till early in February, when he said he had come after the money; I said I expected he was going to give me the daughter's address, or have written to her himself - he said he should not, that he had proved the will, and had the probate; that he was left executor to all McDonald's effects, and if I had paid the daughter, he should have arrested her, as McDonald owed him near six times the sum. I saw him again on the 17th of February, at Munnings', the owner, in Little Bell-alley, in the City; he then produced the probate of the will - Munnings said he had looked it over, and believed it to be correct - Driscol said it was the probate of John McDonald's will, and that he had a right to every thing he died possessed of - Munnings said it was extracted by Clarkson and Son, and he thought I should be justified in paying him the money; this was on Saturday; I said I would leave it with Munnings on Monday, and if he would call there on Tuesday morning he would pay him. I saw Munnings on Monday, and on Tuesday, the 21st of February, I paid Driscol myself 12l. 6s. 51/2d. sterling, at Baxendon and Co.'s, King's Arms-yard, Coleman-street; I found afterwards that the direction the mate had given me, was New-street, Plymouth, instead of Fore-street - I never saw Morgan till he was at the office; I received a note, but never talked with him about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If a letter had come to you by post, signed Catherine McDonald, you would have paid Driscol the money? A. Yes, if she desired it - I have not seen any person purporting to be Catherine McDonald - McDonald came on board on the 24th of July, but he is dated a mouth back in the ship's articles - he would receive a mouth's wages more by that - the owners would have been informed of it - he shipped himself on those terms, on account of the lowness of the wages - I did not tell the owner of it on my arrival; I believe it came out by accident at the office.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You first found you had directed the letter wrong in February? A. Yes; when he said he had got a probate; he repeated that she was in Ireland, and was merely an adopted child.</p>

Morgan has lodged at our house for nine months - Driscol sometimes called on him - he first called about January, to the best of my recollection - he sometimes came twice a day, but sometimes not for three or four days; I have heard them talk about writing, and say it was all right what they had to do - I can neither read nor write; I heard them say to one another that they had been on board the Woodbridge; I do not know what for; I was minding my own business; I heard Driscol say he should get some money from a gentleman in London - he said a man had left him he will - I have seen them write together; I went to Mr. Muaning, and told him not to pay Driscol the money, for I did not think it was right; because I heard them say it was all right between them, that they should get the money - Driscol came in while I was there; Manning asked if he had brought something about the will; he said No, the captain had kept it, but he had got the money from him; this was after Christmas, but I do not know when; Munning said,"Driscol, take care what you are about; here is a woman who says it is not right." Driscol said it was all right and he would come again with the will; I then left the room; I saw Driscol afterwards, and he called me very unbecoming names; I said he should never draw it if was in my power to prevent him; he had only got part of the money then.</p>

Mrs. Hughes came to my lodgings in town, and just as she was going a way Driscol came - I told him to mind what he was about, for that woman charged him with forgery - he said, "It is all correct what I have done."</p>

             was also put as a witness - that it ended with an e, but that his own name stood first - that they had been on heard the Woodbridge, and found he had some dollars and 50s. left in a bag at his death - he said, "I was to have one half of the money" - that he had learnt from Captain Lamb, that the man who had acted with him had received the dollars and he had applied to him, but could not get his share, and if I would go with him and apprehend Driscol, I should find the money on him - I could not go then, but I went the next morning, about eight o'clock, to White-horse-court, Poplar, and apprehended Driscol - Morgan was then within a few yards of the house - I told Driscol I wanted him for forging the will of John McDonald, of the Woodbridge - he said he had nothing to do with it, and did not know the Woodbridge - I handcuffed him, and then related the whole particulars as I have here - he shook and trembled a little, and asked me what would be the worst of it, in case of conviction; I said he had better not question me, for whatever he said must be given in evidence; he pressed me, and I said convictions of this kind generally ended fatally - he wished to have some spirits as he was rather faint - I took him into a public-house, and in his pocket found the probate; I said, "Driscol, this is the thing;" he said, "Mr. Wilson, that is a true will; the person who gave me that was a lodger of mine some years ago;" he pressed me to say who had given me information; I said I could not; he said, "Wilson, you must understand this, McDonald was once a lodger of Mrs. Hughes; you must have had the information from her or her daughter; they told me he was once a lodger of theirs, and ewed them money, and asked me for part of it, but I would not give it them; they have done this out of spite;" I took him to the office, and went next day to Hughes, and found Morgan lodged there; I asked Mrs. Hughes, in Morgan's presence, if she knew any thing of this affair; she said, "I heard Driscol and Morgan talking in the parlour, and thought it was all wrong;" Morgan said, "You know all about it, Mrs. Hughes, if you will speak out; you was to have the money for my lodgings you was present when we divided the money for the last will, and I paid it over to you before I put it into my pocket;" she said, "I did not know it came in a bad way or I would not have had it; as soon as I knew this was bac I went and told Captain Munnings." Morgan went with me that day to the dock, and pointed out the ship; he came to me on the 7th of March, and said Driscol had sent for him to Clerkenwell prison; that he had been with a person named Fallen, and he went to a public-house close to the prisongates, and they offered him 5l. to go out of the way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many public-house did Morgan take you to, to show you where the will had been written? A. To two or three; he at last took me to the Bull's Head public-house, in Bread-street, and said that was it, for he knew the pot-boy, by his having sore eyes; he told me all this of his own free-will; he was at liberty from the 22d of February to the 8th of March; at the second examination he said that every word he had stated was false, that was when the book was offered to him to be sworn - I did not hear him say he had stated it all out of malice: he was then made a prisoner of, instead of a witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire him to get somebody else to help him in swearing to the will? A. No - there is a man named Barry outside, I suppose you mean him - I asked him if he knew Driscol's hand-writing, but did not ask him to swear to it, or any thing to that effect, nor that I would get him well rewarded if he did - I asked Barry if he knew Driscol's hand-writing, and he pointed out one Mahoney, whom I summoned.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What Morgan said at the office was taken down in writing? A. Yes - he was not sworn at the first examination.</p>

            . I am a mariner, and live in Red Lion-street, Poplar. I know both the prisoners - I gave Morgan 15s., by order of a man named Driscol, but not the prisoner - I did not see the prisoner Driscol on the subject.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN LAMB. McDonald did not sign the ship articles: he put his mark, and I put his name against it, as he could not write.</p>
               <p>DRISCOL'S Defence. All I have to say is, that the will is genuine.</p>
               <p>MORGAN's Defence. Driscol called on me at Mr. Hughes', and promised to pay me for the trouble of proving McDonald's will, as I had witnessed it. In consequence of a dispute I had with him, and to be revenged on him through spite and malice, I went and told him every thing that came into my head, thinking it would only get him into a little trouble - Wilson promised to get me 50l. and a free pardon, if I would prosecute, and if I would get another person to join me in evidence he would give him three or four sovereigns - I was requested to make oath of my first words, but could not, unless I perjured myself - merely to satisfy Wilson I went to show him where I said the will was made; on my saying I could not find it, he said, "Well, go and look for it, and if you don't, say any house you like;" it was made at a public-house at Poplar - Wilson always said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310036"></xptr>he would be my friend, and I should get more money than I should by two voyages to the Indies.</p>

            . Not a single sentence of this is true, as it respects any promise or hope of reward held out by me - I never had any quarrel with Driscol - I should have stated, that in Morgan's presence, I asked Hughes if McDonald ever lodged with her, Morgan replied, "No, Mrs. Hughes nor any body else never knew such a man, till the arrival of the Woodbridge."</p>

            . I know Driscol - I rented two rooms of him about two years ago - I was present when John McDonald was at Driscol's shop; he came in with another young man, and they had some conversation about some money, which McDonald owed to Driscol; he said he was unable to pay then, but said, "If I don't come back from sea, here is a will in power for you, if that will satisfy you" - Driscol threw it into his desk, and afterwards read it to me, and two or three more - I cannot identify the paper.</p>

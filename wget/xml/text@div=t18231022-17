My sister and I occupy the first floor and kitchen - we are both single, and work at tambour work. I have known the prisoner about twelve months - he visited at our lodgings. The last time he was there was on the 5th of September. I was alone in the room - he was with me about an hour. The property stated in the indictment laid on the table in a box. I took them out of the box to shew him, and afterwards went out of the room, leaving him there. I was absent about half an hour; the servant saw him going out and called me up - he said he would call again and see me on the next day or on Monday. About ten minutes after I looked into the box, and found the property gone. I went into the City next day with my sister, and met him in Cheapside, and walked with him as far as Tyburn-turnpike; he went into a house in St. George's-terrace (as he said) to dinner, and said he would be out in an hour, and if we would wait, he would come to us. We waited some time - he did not come out, and we sent two officers in, who apprehended him. I have understood since, that he only took them in a joke. I have visited him twice since he has been in custody - I saw him in Newgate three days ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. At the time he left the house, he spoke to you - A. Yes; we met him next day, and talked with him. I am not sure whether the hour had elapsed when I sent the officers into the house - it was a private house - we were on very friendly terms. I know one Marisco, a Polish gentleman, my sister was once on the point of marrying him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long were you in the prisoner's company before he went into this house - A. We walked from Cheapside, and talked about the trinkets - he said he had not taken them - he allowed us to see where he went.</p>

            . I am an officer. I did not see the prisoner till after he was taken into custody, which was on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220013"></xptr>Saturday, the 6th of September. I told him I was sorry to see a young man of his appearance charged with such an offence, and I must search him. He said it was a conspiracy to extort money from him - he was charged with stealing jewels from the prosecutrix. I searched him, and found nothing on him; he was remanded in consequence of the evidence of the two witnesses, and another who has not since appeared, and at his re-examination, I said</p>
               <p>"One of those ladies has told me you gave her a duplicate of part of the property;" he said it was not part of the property the ladies complained of. I said it was very foolish of him, if he had done so; he then said,</p>
               <p>"You will find the rest at my lodgings." I asked what he meant by the rest; he said</p>
               <p>"You will find an eye-glass and buckle between the mattress and bed." I went, but found nothing of the sort, returned, and said</p>
               <p>"I must search you again; you had better not deceive me any longer," and while searching him, I said the women would not prosecute him if they got the property back; he said,</p>
               <p>"Well, I will deceive you no longer," and produced the eye-glass, and said he really did not know where the rest was.</p>

            . I live with my sister. I have seen the prisoner before, where we lived before, but not in Princes-street - we have been there five months. I have known him about twelve months. I missed these trinkets about a quarter of an hour after he left the house, and saw him next day in Fleet-street, and walked with him to St. George's-terrace - we told him he had taken the trinkets. The eye-glass produced is mine, and was in my box on the day it was missed - it had a steel chain to it then, there is now a ribbon - I am sure it is mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not been married - A. No. I have seen one Mr. Maresco - he is now abroad. I never married him. When we met the prisoner, he did not attempt to leave us - he visited my sister on a friendly footing.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a most excellent character.</p>

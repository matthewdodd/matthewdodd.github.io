                  </hi>. I am a seafaring man, and was lately lodging at the Sailors' Home, in Wells-street—on 27th November, about 11 o'clock, I had been drinking with Margaret Hines in a public-house in Wells-street—I was going a bit of the way home when I met the prisoner—Hines pointed to him and said, "There, Robert, there is the man who has got your coat"—he had my coat on at that time—I said, "Give it up,"and he struck me on the face with his fist, and then drew out something from his left side, and stabbed me on the left side of the head and the ear—I was out—he struck me once with his fist and then with the knife, hard—I have a mark on my head still—I had a doctor for about five days—the prisoner ran away after it happened.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, North East-passage, St. George's—I was with the prosecutor on the night this happened—the account he has given is correct—I saw the prisoner pull the knife from his pocket and strike him on the head—the prosecutor only asked him for his coat, and he struck him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 220). I was on duty in Cable-street, just at the top of Wells-street, on 27th—I went up and found the prosecutor bleeding very much—two persons were taking a knife from the prisoner, and I took it out of their hands—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner attempted to run away, but I stopped him—there was a great deal of blood on the knife when I took it—it is a seaman's sheath knife—I do not know what the prisoner is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went into this public-house and a man there struck me: I pulled my coat off and threw it down, and then two more attacked me; I then picked up, as I thought, my own coat and went out. About 11 I met this man and he said, "You have got my coat on."I said, "I have not,"and he got hold of me and dragged me about and tore my shirt, and I got a good licking, and could not see; I was about half tight. As to having a knife, I don't recollect anything at all about it.</p>

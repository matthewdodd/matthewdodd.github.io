               <p>Had you any light in the room? - No light.</p>
               <p>How did you see him then? - I followed him, see him I could not, I did perceive him, but not to make any thing at all of him, we had a scuffle, he run out of doors, and I after him, and caught him at the bottom of the yard, and there we had a long scuffle, he was rather the best hand in getting over the pales, and I tore the skirt of his coat off, which is here; after the coat began to tear, he swore he would kill me, and he turned himself short about, and I perceived his features, and I knew him; he was on the other side of pales in a ditch, and he looked up at me, then I knew him perfectly well, he used to use my shop, I keep a chandler's shop; when the coat tore he got away, he was taken I believe the Sunday following; I found this pound of tea without the door, tied up in a handkerchief, and on that side of the coat which I pulled off, were between seven and eight shillings in halfpence, I found nothing else upon him, but I lost my watch, and about forty shillings in silver, the silver was in the next till to the halfpence, and my watch was in my pocket, and the key of my bureau; in my breeches pocket, which lay in a chair by my bed side; I never found my watch again.</p>
               <p>How did this man get into your house? - He got in at the window, and undid the door, he took a pane of glass out, and took off the casement; the house was all fast when I went to bed, I am always the last up, I went to bed about ten, I saw all the doors and windows fast myself.</p>
               <p>What family have you in the house? - None but a little girl fourteen years old; two quarries of glass were taken out first, but there was a shutter prevented him there, and then he came round backwards; I am sure to the man, quite thoroughly satisfied it is the man; it was not moon light, but bright star light.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to say positively that this was the man, when he was on one side of the pales, and you on the other? - I had the fuller view of him.</p>
               <p>Had you lost any halfpence? - Between seven and eight shillings worth.</p>
               <p>Did you find the silver? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the till locked? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it broke open? - He had got the key, that key was laid between two drawers upon the right hand behind.</p>

On the 18th of September, I went out to serve the customers at half-past twelve o'clock, and left my watch hanging between two posts, in the ceiling, in the bakehouse. It had a chain, two seals, and a key to it, all gold-any person could reach it; I returned at half-past one o'clock and missed it; I was in the habit of hanging it there for a year or more. The prisoner came to see my master some months before this-he was in the bakehouse at that time. My watch and appendages were worth ten guineas.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MERRYLEES. I am the son of the last witness, and live at Mr. Gardner's. On the 18th of September, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner was in the bakehouse - He said he came to see my master; before my master came home, he told me he saw a rat by the stairs, and wanted me to go and catch it - I said I would not. In about five minutes after he asked me if I was not going with the bakings, I told him I did not know whose they were - He said I could see by the book, I told him I was not going out until my master came home; my master came in and I went out, leaving the prisoner in the bakehouse with him. When I returned, I met the prisoner on the bakehouse steps, as I passed him, I said, "What are you going;" he made no answer - I went down and missed. the watch; I am certain that it was there when I went out. I went after the prisoner, but could not find him-my father came in soon afterwards.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not show me the book where the bakings were entered - A. No, it laid on the board.</p>

            . I am master of the house-it is in the parish of St. John, Hackney; the prosecutor used to hang the watch in the bakehouse. I came in at one o'clock and found the prisoner there - I knew him before; he said he came to Hackney on business, and should remain with me until three o'clock, as he had to call for some money at that hour. I sent the last witness out-the watch was then safe; the prisoner said it was five minutes after one by the watch, which made me send the boy out; I staid in the bakehouse - A person came for a dish and wanted change; I went to the shop steps to give change, while I was doing so, the prisoner followed me up; as soon as the boy came in, he gave the alarm-the prisoner had gone out; I followed him - He ran very hard, and got out of my sight - I lost him. The watch was there when I came in; the prisoner could have taken it while I went to the steps; he had been in my shop and bakehouse once before.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am a constable. I went in pursuit of the prisoner to the Mercers' Arms, at Shadwell, and found him there about five o'clock. He denied the charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I left the shop, I left several persons there-there were twelve, or more, came in for their meat; it began to rain which made me run. I did not take it.</p>
               <p>MATTHIAS GARDNER, re-examined. Nobody was in the bakehouse but the prisoner and the woman who came for change - She followed me up the steps. The prisoner was the last person that came out.</p>

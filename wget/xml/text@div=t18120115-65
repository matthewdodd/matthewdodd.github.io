On the 9th of January, between four and five in the evening, a person came in the shop and waved his hand, and said, come to the door immediately. I went to the door; he said these two women have taken some of your property. I immediately missed a piece of handkerchiefs, they were taken from the side of the door; I pursued them; they ran up Leicester fields; I called out stop thief, and at the narrow part of Featherstone buildings several gentlemen met them, they seemed to stop them.

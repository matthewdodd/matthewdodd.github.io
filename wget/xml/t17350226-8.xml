I have known the Boy four or five Years, and never heard any thing unhandsome of him; and therefore I hope the honourable Gentlemen will allow the Law to be suborned and the Blood to be bought when the whole Neighbourhood cry out shame of the Prosecutor for prosecuting the Boy in such an innocent manner - Innocent? Yes, is it not an innocent thing to take a Man's Blood for Money?</p>
               <p>Robinson. This Man came to my Room boldly, and asked me if I had been to Hicks's Hall to swear against the Prisoner. I told him I had, but that I swore nothing but the truth, and I was obliged to do that to clear my self. Then he asked me if Mr. Penson did not give me four Guineas. Upon which I bid him get out of my House - As to what Mr. Penson offer'd it was this; he said he would bear my Charges if it was three or four Guineas.</p>

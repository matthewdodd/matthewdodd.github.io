                  </hi>. I am a timber-merchant, and live in Albion-street, Rotherhithe. On the night of Saturday, the 21st of January, I met a female, who is not in custody, in Church-street, Greenwich—it was from ten minutes to half-past twelve o'clock—I went to a house in Tranter's-buildings—there were two beds in the room—I retired to rest, and placed my waistcoat and trowsers on a chest in the room—I had six half-crowns, three shillings, and one sixpence in my waistcoat pocket—I placed my stockings across them, to know if they should be meddled with—in the morning when I arose I discovered that my clothes had been removed—I examined the pocket which contained the money, and five half-crowns were gone—I sent the person belonging to the house for a policeman—he came, and told the prisoners, who were all in the other bed, if they had the money the better plan would be to give it up to me, and all proceedings would be stopped—they had come up subsequent to our going there—the other woman was remaining in the bed—the prisoners appeared asleep—I charged them with taking my money—they said they had not, and called forth many bitter oaths, which 1 did not believe—I stated to the policeman that one was a new-looking half-crown, and one was worn very much at the edges—I assisted the policeman in searching the bed the prisoners were in, and I discovered one half-crown in the pillow and three in a purse, and then we opened the pillow and found the other among the feathers—I found one worn at the edges—when the five half-crowns were found, the policeman asked them who took the money—one said, "I did not take it;" another said, "I did not;" and then they said, "We are all alike, one is as bad as the other"—I believe it was still said that—the others did not contradict it.</p>

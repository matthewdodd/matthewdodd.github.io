On Monday the 31st of January, about two o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the shop; she had been standing in the shop some time. I believe she had been asking the price of a shawl; I came and told her the price of the shawl was four shillings; she bid me two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then hear any thing - A. There was then an alarm given of the flannel being stolen. I then went into the street; I saw the flannel under the prisoner's petticoats, sticking out. I brought the prisoner back to the shop; she dropped the flannel as soon as I took hold of her. I picked the flannel up, and took the flannel and the prisoner back to the shop. I had seen the flannel in the shop before the prisoner came in. This is the flannel; there is about twenty yards of it; it is worth two shillings and sixpence a yard. The flannel has Mr. Riches own private mark upon it. I can swear to its being Mr. Riches and Foreman's property.</p>

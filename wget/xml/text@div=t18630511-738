I am inspector of risks, and assessor of values to the county Fire Office—in the end of November, or beginning of December last, in consequence of information from the office, I went to the female prisoner's premises, 68, Brewer-street, Somerstown—I saw her, and told her I had called from the County Fire Office, for the purpose of inspecting the premises, the contents of which were proposed to be insured in the office—I walked through the shop, observed the paucity of stock, and went up stairs—there was very little furniture—there were some pictures—some pictures were specially named in the instructions I had, to be insured for a large sum, therefore I inquired for them—I saw some very bad paintings, daubs, in the room—I did not suppose they could be part of them—two were pointed out to me by the female prisoner as being very valuable pictures; <hi rend="italic">one was a very bad</hi> copy of the old print of "The Enthusiast," and the other was a very bad painting; in fact, it was not worth the name of a painting—I said they could not be the pictures proposed; they must be some others—she said that her brother, I understood her to say, had been offered a large sum for them; I think she said 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said whoever had been offered such a sum was very foolish not to take it—I at once said that the County Fire Office would decline to take the risk, and left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the surveyor of claims for the Imperial Fire Office—in consequence of instructions, I went on the morning of 5th January to 68, Brewer-street, Somerstown—I observed than there had been a fire in the house—the back bedroom was burnt out; the roof was gone, and the sky was visible—the other rooms were all more or less damaged by the fire and the water from the engines—I saw the female prisoner there—I asked her the time and cause of the fire—I took a note at the time of what she said—I asked her if she was a married woman—I saw that the insurance was in the name of Eliza Stebbings—she said she was, but that her husband had gone about ten days before to sea; that he was a ship's steward—I said, "Where is he now?"—she said, "At Sunderland"—I said, "Can you give me his address?"—she said, "No, I cannot; I only heard once from him, and the letter had the post-mark of Durham"—she said he was a ship's steward, and had been to the Cape—she then said that she had separated from him (that was in reply to my question why she had made the insurance in her own name, having a husband); that he had used her very ill, and she never wished to see him again—I then asked her about the time of the fire—she said it was in, her absence, on the previous night or that morning; that she and her servant, Mary Casey, had left the house between 10 and 11 on the previous evening (Sunday), and walked to Paddington, to Mrs. Dames, 23, Berkley-street—I afterwards found it was Upper Berkley-street—she said that Mrs. Dames lodged at a Mrs. White's, and she and her servant bad slept there; that they both left the house about a quarter-past 6 in the morning, and walked to Somerstown, and then found that the fire had occurred—she said she had slept from home twice before during the last three months—she said, "When I left there was a very small bit of fire in the bedroom; I put on a shovel of slack, to last till I came back, say for two or three hours; I meant to be away that time; I did not mean to stop all night; I left my night-clothes on a chair before the fire to air"—I then went through the house, and examined particularly, and took a description of the property remaining, and what the damage was—she said that her loss exceeded the amount of her insurance, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I said I could see nothing of the sort; I did not think she had lost 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she then gave me a description of those things which she said were totally destroyed; she enumerated a number of articles of furniture, and two valuable pictures, and two others—she said they were totally destroyed—I asked if there was no particles of the frames left, or any part—she said none; they were totally destroyed—I asked her some particulars of those pictures, and she said that one was called the "Enthusiast," an old gentleman fishing in a tub, and the other was a portrait of the "Dreadnaught," and they were originals, by either Barrett or Lane—I said, "I know the subjects you speak of; they are engraved pictures"—she said, "Yet—the same subjects, I believe, are in the National Gallery"—I have the list of things here, which was taken down from her mouth—among them is a family-bible, a dressing<lb></lb>Glass,</p>

               <p>and some curtains, which she described as totally destroyed—the sum she named for the curtains was higher than I thought suitable for the place, and she said, "Oh, I can give you a bill of those; I bought them near here"—I said, "Do so," and this voucher was given to me, not by her, but by Mr. Voy, who acted for her in making out her claim—I examined the stock that remained; it consisted of bacon, hams, cheese, and what are celled <hi rend="italic">dummies</hi>—the greater part were <hi rend="italic">dummies</hi>—they are wooden imitations—none of the stock was destroyed—the total stock, had it not been injured, would have been about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it had been injured by the water—dummies are not unusual things—I subsequently settled the claim at 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and told her agent that I should not advise the office to pay any more—it was a bad case, and I could not make any change.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—my maiden name was Stebbings, and the female prisoner is my sister—I remember the fire on 4th January; before the fire some things were brought to my house—the male prisoner brought a chandelier—I should think that was a month before the fire—I cannot speak positively as to the time—he asked me to take care of it, as the steam from the cooking would spoil it, as it had been regilded—I took care of it—that chimney-class was also brought to my house by my husband—the prisoners merely asked me to take it home, and they would send a servant for it, when they wanted it—I cannot say how long that was before the fire; my sister did not bring anything herself to the house before the fire—there were some hampers brought after the fire—on the Sunday, the night of the fire, my sister and Mary Casey came to my house—I could not say what time—I think they brought a small black clock with them, but I was in bed at the time—they slept there that night, and left the next morning—they slept at my house during that week after the fire; Casey left on the Saturday after the fire—before the fire, Mary Casey and my sister slept at my house—on a Monday night—I am certain it was the Monday night, and not the Tuesday—I was in bed when they came—one of the lodgers let them in—I saw them alter they came in—my sister did not tell me why she came there—I think she said they had been to Paddington, but could not make her brother hear, so they had come to my house—I saw those two pictures at Brewer-street, or some like them—I could not swear to them—two pictures were brought to my house before the fire by my husband—I don't know whether he brought one or two, but they were both brought there—that was at the beginning of December, I think—they were packed in paper, and tied up with string, and Casey took them away again as they were brought—they were never unpacked at our house—she never brought me the ticket of the pictures—she never returned to my house—she went home to Brewer-street.</p>

On the evening of the 24th of April, I was in Chiswell-street - I saw the prisoner walking behind me- he afterwards touched my heel; I put my hand to my coat pocket, and missed my handkerchief - I turned, and saw the prisoner walking across the road, four or five yards from me; I followed him, and he was taken into custody: I saw my handkerchief found on him.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoner in Finsbury-square, about twenty minutes past seven o'clock; the prosecutor pointed him out - I found the handkerchief in his side pocket; he said he found it on the threshold of a door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw the handkerchief on the threshold of a door, next to a pastrycook's - I took it up, seeing no one about; I carried it twenty yards, and blew my nose with it - I then put it into my pocket, and went to Finsbury-square; just as I got there the officer took me - a lad came to the station-house, and said I did not take the handkerchief, but he was told to keep out of the way.</p>
               <p>MARY DONAHOUGH. I saw him use the handkerchief, and then put into his pocket - I am quite certain he is the man who took it.</p>

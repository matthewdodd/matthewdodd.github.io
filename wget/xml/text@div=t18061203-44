On the 27th of November last the prisoner asked me to write him a letter, we were at a public house in the neighbourhood; I went with him to my lodgings and there I wrote a letter for him; the prisoner proposed for me to play for a bottle of wine, I consented to play a Portuguese game of cards, I played with the prisoner and lost twelve shillings, or thereabouts, I went to my trunk and took out some more money, and left the key in the trunk; I went down stairs to give orders for the bottle of wine, I gave my landlady four shillings for the wine and two pipes of tobacco. On my returning up stairs I found the prisoner seated on a chair as I left him; we played on a short space of time, when the landlady brought up a bottle of wine, two pipes, and a candle; we drank the bottle of wine, I lost more money than I had about me, then I went to the trunk to get some more money, I perceived the twenty four guineas that I had left in my trunk were gone; I then turned to the prisoner and insisted upon his returning me the money that he had taken, he answered that he had taken no money whatever out of my trunk. I locked the room door and locked my trunk; the prisoner then told me he would make his escape out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house was this in. - A. The one pair of stairs. In a short time afterwards the landlady came up stairs with another lighted candle, I desired her to send for a watchman; a neighbour, Mr. Mosely, came up into the room, the prisoner then said that eight of the guineas were his, he had won the rest of the money at play; the prisoner shewed a parcel of money, but returned it in his pocket and said that he was willing to go into custody. Two officers came, who found a parcel of money upon the prisoner, the amount of which I do not exactly know; he then declared the second time that eight guineas was his property, and the rest he won at play, and that he had no more money whatever; the officer made a further search and found ten guineas concealed in his hat, he declared he had won that at play; one of the officers took charge of some of the money and the cards, and the other officer took charge of the other money; on these cards being produced at the office they found them to be false cards; the prisoner said they were his own cards before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner. - A. The last year.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not frequently played with the prisoner at the same game. - A. Never before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Decasto. A. I lived eleven months at his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never played at cards at the house of Decasto. - A. With captains and mates of ships.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you and the prisoner playing the greater part of the time that you were in the room, from four to eight, till the constable came. - A. Yes, but there was no person there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the prisoner's pocket came torn. - A. No.</p>

In his waistcoat pocket that was torn, we found in guineas, half guineas, seven shilling pieces, and some silver, to the amount of seventeen pounds five and sixpence; I then stripped him, but could find no more upon him; in a hat that laid on the drawers was ten guineas wrapped up very curiously in a bit of paper, which the prisoner said was the paper he had with the cards; he said the money in the hat was his own, and the other money he had won of the captain at cards; the prisoner said he had been playing with the captain from one o'clock, he had won the captain's money, and the captain caught hold of his waistcoat pocket to take the money out, and tore it, and said if he did not give him the money he would send for the watchman; the prisoner gave me the cards; I produce them, every second card is larger than the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Did you find any letter. - A. There was no letter found.</p>
               <p>- DECOSTA. I know that the sailor and the prosecutor have been playing together several times at my house, and the last time that they played at my house was a fortnight or three weeks back; I desired them not to play any more cards for money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Thursday morning about half after nine o'clock I went out of my lodgings and went to Mr. Lucas's public house, where the captain was, he had a glass of grog, he asked me to drink, he ordered two more glasses of grog and solicited me to play; I told him I had no cards, the captain sent me to buy them, I bought them at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030045"></xptr> Tower hill, and gave four shillings and sixpence for them.</p>
               <p>Court. Were these the cards that were found. - A. I do not know exactly, and the paper in which the cards were I enveloped the ten guineas, and I opened the cards in the captain's presence.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Coombes) Were the cards as dirty as they are now. - A. They were; I have had them wrapped up in a clean bit of paper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The captain solicited me to go to his lodgings as it was quiet; we went from Lucas's shorly after twelve o'clock in the day; when we got in the captain's room, he fastened the door, he told me to take the cards out. I did, and we began to play, the lowest bet was half a guinea, sometimes a guinea and a half, two guineas, and at one time four guineas upon a card. About half after two the captain lost five guineas; he sent for a bottle of wine and two pipes, the captain put the cards in his pocket, he took two letters out of his pocket for me to read, while he went down stairs, he concealed the cards that the mistress of the house might not see them. The captain opened the door of the room, called the landlady, desired her to send for the bottle of wine and two pipes, he left the room door open, and afterwards came in immediately; the landlady brought the bottle of wine and two pipes. He locked the door immediately, hung a coat over the key hole, that they might not look through; we went on playing, I won a bet of four guineas, the captain snatched the money and kept it; I got up and said, I would not play any more; the captain then told me he would give me four guineas if I would play again. I sat down again, but he did not give me the four guineas, then we betted three guineas upon a card, I won, we had a bit of a scramble for the three guineas, the captain got hold of one guinea, and two fell on the ground; I got up again and said, I would not play any more. The captain got up and said that he had lost twenty seven guineas, and desired me to give him fifteen back; I told him I would not give him one back, I told him that I had not won fifteen guineas of him, and that in a former voyage he had won more than fifteen guineas of me; the captain then took the key out of the lock, seized me and tore my waistcoat; I resisted him taking the money from me. He then insisted upon having the whole returned, he called up the landlady, and sent for the watchman.</p>

               <p>when I got home I missed my glass—I immediately sent my footman back to the theatre—I did not receive my glass, and on the following day Ijent my butler, but with no satisfactory result—the attendants at the box in the the<lb></lb>atre that evening, as far as I can recollect, were the two Arlesses—I saw them there—the prisoner was one—I went myself one or two nights after to the theatre, and I saw the prisoner—I told him of my loss, and said I must have my glasses back, they must be in the possession of somebody in the theatre—he said he knew nothing of the glasses, but I think he said, "I will go round to the pawnbroker's, and see if I can find them for you"—he said he was very sorry I had lost them, and he would endeavour to find them—I believe that was all that passed—on the 23rd of May I went to the theatre, sod saw the prisoner in Mr. Harley's private room—I said on his coming into the room, "I believe you have the care of Lady Conynghatn's glasses?"—he said, "I have"—I said, "Would you object to show them to me?"—he said, "I cannot do that, for they are gone to be repaired"—I asked him what repairs they required—he said one of the eye-glasses was loose—I then ssked him whether there was anything the matter with the screw, and whether it was a gilt screw or a steel one—he said he believed it was a gilt screw, and round—I said, "Are you sure there was a screw in it?"—he said, "I am positive there was"—he said he had given Lady Conyngham'a glasses to Wiggins—Wiggins was sent for, and I asked what orders he bad received with Lady Conyngbam's glasses—he said they were to be repaired, they wanted a new adjustment screw—I said I thought I had evidence enough to give the prisoner into custody—I recollect Mr. Callahan, who is the importer of these glasses, calling on roe on the evening of the 22nd of May—he begged me to come to him the next day, which I did, and then a parcel was pro<lb></lb>duced at his shop—Mr. Otway, Mr. Callaghan's wife, and a Mr. Waite were present—I then described my glasses—the parcel was then opened, and this pair of opera-glasses was produced, which correspond with the description: I had given—I know them by a particular mark in the ivory, like a knot in wood—here is the mark—I am perfectly positive that these glasses are mine—I have not the slightest doubt as to the identity of them—I do not know whether the prisoner was in attendance on the box on the night I lost these—I had no communication with him—I know he is in the habit of attending, but I have been there so frequently, I cannot tell.</p>

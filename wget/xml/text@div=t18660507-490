I live at 48, Hamilton-terrace, Deptford, and am secretary to the Deptford Pride, Foresters' Court, Benefit Society, which is held at the Railway Tavern, Hamilton-street, Deptford—I know the prisoner's handwriting—the signature at the end of these rules (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in his handwriting—he acted as secretary of the society—these are the rules certified by Mr. Tidd Pratt—the prisoner acted as secretary in 1865—in July last he brought an order to me as treasurer—it was my duty upon that to pay him the amount, and I did pay him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d.—Order read</hi>: "Ancient Order of Foresters, London United District, Court Deptford Pride, No. 3303, 16th July, 1805.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186605070051"></xptr>
               <p>Pay Dr. Taylor the sum of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for six mouths' medical attendance, by order of the Court. C. R.—W. J.

               <p>On the 5th of July I missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) between five and six o'clock. I had seen them in the parlour about twelve o'clock the same day. My wife came down stairs and found the parlour and street door open. My wife called up to me; I came down. There were a number of things missing. The things mentioned in the indictment were stopped at a pawnbroker's. I was informed that a woman came out of the house; I went round to the pawnbrokers and gave them information of it, and about a fortnight after she was stopped and I was sent for by Mr. Leighton, a pawnbroker, in Wardour-street; there I found the things mentioned in the indictment; the prisoner was sent to Litchfield-street office; I saw her there; she was examined, and said she knew nothing of it.</p>

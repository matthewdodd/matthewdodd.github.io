               <p>Q. Nor threatened her if she did not? - A. No; it was near twelve o'clock at night, and I took her into a cook's-shop, which was the only house open; I asked her if she knew Waterman; she said, she wished she had never known him; we got a coach immediately, and I took her to Pancras watch-house; I searched her, but found nothing that led to the property; she told me she had pawned the plate, and the counterpane, and that Waterman and she went to the Northumberland arms, the corner of Grafton-street, burnt the duplicates, and spent part of the money; she said, they had burnt two of them, and destroyed the rest; I asked her what became of the rest of the things; she told me Waterman had taken them away, and pawned them, and what he had done with the duplicates she could not tell.</p>

               <p>Q. You never gave the key to Waterman? - A. No; he was not in the house.</p>

               <p>Bush.

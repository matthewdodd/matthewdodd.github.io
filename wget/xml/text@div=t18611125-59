                  </hi>. I am a plumber and glazier, of 108, Limington-street, Pimlico—on 14th November, between 2 and 3 o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon, I was walking along Tower-hill with a friend—I stopped a minute or two to look at a man selling something at the side of the road—just as I was moving on, I felt tug at my watch chain—I looked down and saw the watch in the prisoner's hand—I seized hold of him, and held him—he struggled to get away, and he managed to pass it away to some persons in the crowd which had gathered round—I held him till a police<lb></lb>man came, and gave him in charge—some one found the bow of the watch at his feet,. and gave it to me—the value of the watch was three guineas—I am quite certain the prisoner was the man—I hate not found my watch since—he had the guard in one hand.</p>

             came and knocked at my door, my room door, I have only two rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this house let out in lodgings? - Yes; we have the first floor, the house is let out in lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you rent your rooms of? - Mrs. Donaldson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Donaldson live in the house? - No. After she had knocked at the door I came down, unlocked the door and left her in; I had left my child behind me, up stairs, on the second floor where I was at work, my child cried, I asked her to sit down; she sat down; and I went up to the child, I brought the child down, she was in the room then, she went away soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after? - I cannot rightly tell; not long: she was not gone long before I missed my husband's watch.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that watch before? - In the morning, at eight o'clock. It was hanging on a nail when she came into the room, I saw it when she came into the room, I saw it when I went down stairs to open the door for her. As soon as she was gone I missed it, and followed her immediately, she was sitting on a chair at her own door: I went to her at her own door, and called her in backward to her own room, and asked her if she took my husband's watch to frighten me? she said she had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What were her words? - She said she had not, she would not do such a thing for the World. on that she came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110009"></xptr>to my room with me, and asked me to see if I had not mislaid it or something, and she desired me to go with her to a fortune teller, and she would give him half a crown herself if he would tell where the watch was; I went with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where to? - I cannot tell She brought me to some old man, I believe it was at Salt Petre Bank; he said he could not tell any thing, it was past sun set; we came home again; I went and told Mr. Whiteway of it, the runner, and he came down, and spoke to her about it, to see if she could find it; so she said she could not; and the next day she was brought before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever search her? - No, I never did. The watch has never been seen since.</p>

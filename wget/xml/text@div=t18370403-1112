                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Pudner. I live at No. 18, Shouldham-street—the prisoner lodged in the same house that I did—I was not present at the birth of this child, but very shortly afterwards—it was a male child of which she was the mother—it was in January last—I cannot say the day—the first time I saw it, it was a fine child and healthy—I saw it perhaps two or three times a week—I saw her take care of it and act as the mother—shortly after its birth (it might be a fortnight or three weeks) it caught cold—I am not quite certain that it had recovered the cold before its death—it died on the 18th of March—it was looking much better when I saw it last—that was on Thursday the 9th, about eleven o'clock in the morning—the mother brought it in her arms to my apart ment and took it out again—the next time I saw it was on Saturday about half past twelve o'clock—it was then in bed—the mother was not with it—I had not seen her between the Thursday and Saturday—the child was then very near death, and lived about three minutes after I found it—no one lived with the prisoner—I cannot say when she had left the house—I frequently went into the room to ask after her health, and the child's also—the child was six weeks old on the day it died—I called the landlady of the house, Mary Burden—she came up with another person, who took the</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the house No. 8, Shouldham-street, and where the prisoner lodged. I was present at the birth of a male child of her a, in January last—I cannot say who nursed it—she suckled the child for a fort night—but she had a nurse as well—a soldier visited her—it was a very fine child, when born; then it took cold, and became worse, and it reduced it very much—as March came on, it got a little better—the mother then took care of it—I saw her last at our house, at eleven o'clock on the Friday morning—she then came into my apartment, and brought my iron that the had got—I do not know where she went then—I did not go into her room that day—I was called up the next day, about half-past twelve o'clock, and I saw Mrs. Pudner—the child was in bed, and it died three minutes after—when I first saw it that morning, it was very nearly dead—it died as soon as it was moved—I am a mother—I cannot tell what it died of—it did not cry, it was too weak—all the prisoner's clothes were gone—I never knew that they were gone before—I cannot say what clothes she took—the had a large box, I do not know what it contained—she went by the name of Blacklock—the man's name that visited was Walter Green—I did not see Urn there that week—I believe she was very badly off.</p>

I was sent for to see this child—I consider, it died of convulsions occasioned by a slow inflammation of the lungs, occasioned by a cold or want of food, and other things—I examined it before the Coroner, and I found the left lung inflamed, sufficient to account for convulsions, without starvation—it may have died from convulsions, from inflammation, or from starvation—the stomach having been empty so long, the gastric juice would produce it—I cannot positively say what it arose from.</p>

               <p>The case was stated by Mr. Fielding.</p>
               <p>MATTHEW BEECHER. - Mr. Knapp. You are a glazier - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. A serjeant in the guards, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you employed to do any work in the duke of York's chapel, Jeffry's buildings - A. Yes, at Tothill street, Westminster, in the year 1806.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make out any bill for that - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bill, and tell me whether that is your hand writing - A. Yes. that is my bill.</p>
               <p>A. What are the charges that are contained in that bill - A. Three sash squares; nine shillings and nine pence; twelve ditto, fifteen shillings; twenty two squares of lead, five shillings and sixpence; that is all. The sum total is 1 l. 10 s. 3 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection without looking at your book, whether that is the sum that you delivered in originally - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where consists the alteration to what it was originally - A. When I wrote the bill out it was one pound and three pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any alteration in the number of sashes - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Does there appear upon looking at it any alteration - A. Yes, the 2 is made 12.</p>
               <p>Q. It was 2 ditto, and now it appears 12 - A. Yes; it was 2 sashes, and now it appears to be 12 sashes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the other alteration - A. A 1 before the 5.</p>
               <p>Q. So that there are three alterations - A. Yes; it is now 1 l. 10 s. 3 d. whereas it was before 1 l. 0 s. 3 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir. take this book in your hand, and tell me whose book that is - A.Mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the insertion there your hand writing - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make the minute of what appears there - A. That is my wife's writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not write it -</p>
               <p>COURT. You said first of all that is your hand writing in the book - A. It is my book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The question is whether the insertion of the bill in that book is your hand writing - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. The bill in the book, or the bill out of the book - A. Both.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When did you make the entry of that bill in your book - A. I wrote it from my state, as I generally take off my work.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the entry in the book correspond with the account you have given in court - what is the entry in the book - A. One pound and three pence; - three sash squares, 9 s. 9 d.; twenty two squares in lead, 5 s. 6 d.; two sash squares, 5 s.</p>
               <p>Q. From looking at your book, and looking at that bill you have in your hand, are you certain that the alteration took place after you had been paid the money - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. How much have you been paid - A. I have not been paid.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not receive the money, but your wife did - A. Yes. I do not know that she gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the receipt was given - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. This was in the beginning of the year 1806 - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you have not any distinct memory of it without looking at the book - A. I remember the amount of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your memory is better this sessions than last sessions - A. I remember that.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have a perfect memory of all your bills - A. I have a very shallow memory except any thing that happened soon.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a very shallow memory, but you remember this distinctly - this is an exception - then from January 1806, down to the beginning of the present year, you call soon - A. I do not call it soon.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was the enquiry made - A. About fifteen months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You think you remember this - that you did not receive the money - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. It is received the 2nd of January 1806 - that is your wife's writing - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.It should be 1807 - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not by at that payment - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not recollect at all the transaction of receiving the money of your wife - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Beecher, can you venture to swear that these figures which have been inserted are not yours - A. No, they are not mine.</p>
               <p>COURT. You are sure the different 1's are not your hand writing - A. They are not.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak to three 1's, there is a 1 before the 2,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010025"></xptr>making it 12; and 1 before the 5, making it 15; and the 1 before the 0, making it 10 - these three are not your writing - A. They are not.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that bill and receipt for glazier's work - I see the sum total there is 11 s 10 s 3 d. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the receipt at the bottom your hand writing - A. I think it is the receipt - S. Beecher.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any money of the prisoner, Mr. Moore - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the sum that you received - A. One pound and three pence was the amount of the bill. I did not take the halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. You received one pound, not taking the halfpence - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember how the bill stood with respect to the 12 ditto - A. To the best of my recollection it was 2.</p>
               <p>Court. The 12 was 2 - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Richardson. The charge for that which is now 15, how was that at that time - A. I think it was 5.</p>
               <p>Q. In the sum total, which is now one pound ten shillings and three pence, I think you before said was one pound and threepence - A. Yes it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the book, that bill is your husband's hand writing - A. Yes; it is one pound and threepence.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a receipt at the bottom of that, whose hand writing is that - A. That is mine; I wrote that soon after I received the one pound; I cannot say whether it was the same day, but I am inclined to think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver the receipt when you wrote it to the bill to the prisoner - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Now, Mrs. Beecher you say you think that the figure 1 was not before the 2, and the 1 before the 5, you think that was not there, but you will not venture to swear it - A. I think it was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Because you find your bill is not that, is not that one of your reasons - A.If it had not been enquired about early, I should not have recollected any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is this - whether part of the opinion you form upon the subject does not arise upon comparing it with the book, and seeing what it ought to be - A. I cannot say to the contrary, had I not the book to look at, but it might be so.</p>
               <p>Q. You now think that these figures were not there at the time you signed it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not suppose that we put any sort of blame upon you, your belief is partly founded upon looking at the book, not knowing what it ought to be - A. I should not have recollected what is in the book without looking at the book.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not asking you with respect to the book; you do not remember, I dare say, whether or no you read the bill over line by line - A. I think I looked at the bill at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is, whether you have any recollection of reading it over article by article at the time - A. No, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Beecher, who gave you the order - A. Mr. Moore gave me the order.</p>

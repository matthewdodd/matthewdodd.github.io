I keep a lodging-house, in Shorter-street, Wellclose-square; it is in the parish of St. George-in-the-East; the pri<lb></lb>soner was in my service from 13th March till 19th April. On 18th April she had liberty to go and see her friends—she was at my house in the morning—I was not at home when she went away—on Saturday morning, 19th April, she was brought back at two o'clock, by three policemen—she was not sober—I ordered her up-stairs to bed—I hold a situation, and I left home at five that morning—I returned home to dinner at four in the afternoon, and my wife said she was lying in bed beastly intoxicated—I ordered her out of the house, but she begged me to let her stop till she got sober—my lodger interfered for her, and I finally consented for her to stop till her week was up—I returned home again that evening at a quarter before nine; she was up and was get<lb></lb>ting her tea—I then went to my cash-box and put three sovereigns into it, which made 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and a sixpence in silver, and five duplicates belonging to a lodger of mine, who is gone to sea—I had the care of them—there were references and papers in the box—the box was between the flock-bed and the palliasse, in the front parlour—I went out again about nine, and returned at a quarter before eleven—the prisoner was then gone—I did not see her any more till 24th April, at the White Horse public-house—I looked for my cash-box immediately and found it was gone and all that it contained—all that I have seen since is this dupli<lb></lb>cate that was in it—there were five duplicates, only this one is found, which is for a watch and guard—I am quite positive this was in the cash-box; I had all out, with the money on the Saturday evening, and found there was a</p>

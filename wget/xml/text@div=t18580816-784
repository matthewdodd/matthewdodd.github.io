I live at 5, Keate-street, Spitalfields, and am a labourer—about 4 o'clock on Tuesday morning, 6th July, I heard cries of murder which roused me from my sleep—I sleep on the ground-floor—it was a woman's voice—I got up and went upstairs to the second landing—I there found the prisoner kicking Eliza Simpson—I had known the prisoner by living in the neighbourhood, and also Simpson; she lived with a man named Fitzgerald in the same house with me; they occupied the garret—Simpson was lying down, and the prisoner was standing up; I saw him kick her—he wears a wooden leg—there was no candle there—it was light enough to see, it was 4 o'clock—I saw him kick her again at the back of her head; that was with the wooden leg—while he was doing it, Simpson cried "Murder"—I said to him, "You will kill the woman,"—he said, "If you come near, you black b—, I will serve you the same,"—he made another kick right on her left eye—she succeeded in getting up and came down stairs, holding him by the shirt, to give him in charge to the police—he cried, "Let go my shirt,"—she said, no, she would give him in charge of the police,—she walked down the stairs; she did not fall at all; she walked down from the second landing to the first—he threw her down the other</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep the White Swan public-house in Keate-street, Spitalfields—on Tuesday morning, 6th July, between 1 and 2, the deceased, Eliza Simpson, was in front of my bar—she had three half-pints of porter—she left when I closed the house; she was then quite well and hearty—she had the old relics of a black eye, that had happened five weeks ago: with that exception, she had not the least mark on her face—I saw the prisoner at my house that morning—he came about a quarter-past 1—he stopped until 2, when I closed the house—towards 4 o'clock that morning, I heard a cry of murder, and I saw the prisoner come out of 5, Keate-street, followed by Simpson—she said, "You vagabond, I will stick to you; I will give charge of you"—he replied, making use of a bad word, "If you don't leave off, I will pay you again"—she followed him to the end of the court, and held hold of him—he was in his shirt sleeves, for he had left his coat and boots at my house; likewise his fiddle—I looked out of a side window and said to him, "Leave off, don't injure the woman; what have you been up to?"—he went round in front of the house (it is a corner house) she still followed him, to give charge of him, continuing to lay hold of his shirt, and he said, "If you don't leave go, I will pay you again"—when they got in front of the house, he hit her—she had got hold of his hair—she fell; he was on the top of her, and he hit her twice and kicked her on the left side of the head with his wooden leg; she remained on the ground after he had kicked her, between 5 and 10 minutes, with her arm on her head, quite insensible—I went to the back window to see if I could see a policeman: I saw one in the Commercial-road, but not within call—in the meantime, the prisoner stood over at the opposite side, ap<lb></lb>parently in a very great rage: he was jumping about, and his brother went and knocked at the door for him to be let in—he lodged nearly opposite—the woman was taken in to 7, and I went in to bed—when I got up in the morning, I went to see how she was; I found her in a very bad state, dreadfully bruised and beaten—she complained dreadfully of her head—she had a bruise on her jaw and a serious black eye, and she said she could not see out of it—that was the left eye: it was the right eye that had the re<lb></lb>mains of the black on it—I saw her every day during the week, and three or four times a day—she continued to complain dreadfully of her head, and said she should go mad with it; she had it bound up, and had a lotion to foment it with.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at 2, Spital-square—on Monday morning, 12th July, very early, I was called by the police to go to 5, Keate-street, to see the body of Eliza Simpson—I found her lying on the bed undressed, and quite dead, but warm—I made a superficial examination of her head and face—there were three principal bruises over the head and face, one over the left temple and eye, that was the most severe; there was a large one on the lower jaw, on the left side, and one on the right upper lip—there were also slight bruises about the body, nothing of any importance, nor were there any broken bones—I examined the body to see, but could discover none—forty hours afterwards, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the viscera generally were perfectly healthy—I opened the head; on raising the scalp I found the flesh beneath the discolouration on the left temple, bruised down to the bone, and infiltrated with blood—I removed the skull cap in the usual way; I found it remarkably thin, I don't think I ever saw one so thin—the membranes of the brain were somewhat congested, but there was nothing remarkable about them—the substance of the brain was perfectly healthy throughout, but lying on it and compressing it, was a large coagulum of blood, corresponding to the bruised temple—the skull was not fractured anywhere—the effusion of blood on the brain might be caused by a blow or blows from a wooden leg—there was also a large quantity of fluid blood effused beneath the membranes of the brain, floating over the left side of the brain—blows from a wooden leg would produce those results and appearances—blows on other parts of the head might possibly conduce to those appearances without manifesting any external injury; but I should think that not at all likely, for this reason, that where this blood was found there is a small artery that supplies the membranes of the brain with blood, that artery enters the brain at its base, behind the eye, and runs up in a groove through the bone in such a way that it is sometimes lacerated or ruptured by the springing of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160064"></xptr>
               <p>skull, without a blow, and therefore that might take place from a blow on any part of the hemisphere—I do not expect that was the case here, I think it was the blow on the temple—the coagulum I saw corresponded with the blow on the temple, and this vessel is beneath where the coagulum was—I examined the back part very carefully, but saw no trace of any blow or any injury whatever—I certainly did not examine the scalp at the back particularly; I did not dissect it, but there was nothing there of any importance—I ascribed the death to the injury which produced the dis<lb></lb>colouration on the left temple, there was nothing else observable in any other part of the body to account for death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Seeing the external bruise and seeing the coagulum of blood inside, you conjecture that the blow inflicted externally, produced the blood, and consequently death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a head falling against a piece of wood might have produced the external injury, or falling down stairs, or falling upon any hard substance—I do not think a blow from a woman's hand in fighting would do it—it is difficult to say how long before death the injury might be inflicted, and the coagulum formed; it might be three or four, or two days, or possibly a couple of weeks.</p>

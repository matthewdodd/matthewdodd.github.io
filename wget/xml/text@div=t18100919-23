               <p>Q. Was it a gelding or a mare - A. We call it a horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go for it - A. When I took it from Mr. Boots, I think it was between ten and eleven o'clock in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the horse your's - A. No, I borrowed the horse and cart of my neighbour. I put this meat in the cart, and I got up and drove it homewards.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had you got before you saw the prisoner - A. I think it was near five hundred yards; the prisoner stopped me; he said, Mrs. Powell, you must go back, Mr. Boots wants you.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before - A. I had seen him, but I did not know his name. I told him I could not go back; he said, I must go back, I had made a mistake in my bill; I said, I could rectify that another day; he said, he was one of Mr. Boots servant's, he could mind the horse and cart the while, I must go back; I got out of the cart and went back.</p>
               <p>Q. That was all the conversation that past - A. Yes; I left the prisoner with the horse and cart, as he told me he was to mind it. I went back, and said to Mr. Boots, Sir, what do you want with me, what is the matter, he answered, nothing at all, he did not want me; upon that I went back. He had run away with my horse and cart, and the meat.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner and the horse and cart were gone - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in search of him - A. Yes. I cried out, Oh! my God! I am ruined One Gorden, went and found the cart and horse in Brick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave an alarm - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And people went in search of him - A. Yes, in all parts they could go.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Q. You said you did not know the man's name, but you knew his person - A. I did not know his name, but I have seen him many a time.</p>
               <p>Q. I am told that it was you that bid him get into the cart - A. No, that I deny.</p>

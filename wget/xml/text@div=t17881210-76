               <p>Court. When one half of the sash is pulled to, is the other half large enough for a man to get in? - I do not think a man could get in, but a boy might; there was nothing gone out of that room; I proceeded to the next room, and then to another, there I saw the drawers of the bureau were driven out, and his clothes pulled about; there was a wooden box which had been locked, was broke open, and the shirts and stocks that were in it pulled about, but nothing gone; I went into the yard and saw the ladder taken out and put against the next window to mine; it was the same sort of window; in the farm yard we found the cow-house door open, and the lock of the gardiner's tool-house was burst open, from whence the ladder was taken; I saw nobody about the house overnight, but between eleven and twelve o'clock when I went to bed the dog barked very much; the prisoner had lived in the family; when the prisoner was taken and going to the justice, he stepped aside to speak to me.</p>
               <p>Was there any promise or threatening used to him? - No, it was by the Adam and Eve, at Kensington; he said, Thomas, I hope you will not hurt me, I was drunken and foolish and did not know what I was about; I have done no harm, I have taken nothing away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's council. Explain what this place is; it is the outhouse, is it? - No, it is adjoining to the house, it is part of the mansion.</p>
               <p>How long did this man live in the family? - About seven months; he left us about February last.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner bear a good character? - But very indifferent.</p>
               <p>Not dishonest? - No.</p>
               <p>Drunken and foolish? - Yes.</p>

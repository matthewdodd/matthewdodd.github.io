On the 7th of August, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and bought a piece of Irish linen, which came to 3l. 2s. 10d., and paid me a 5l. Bury and Suffolk bank note - I did not ask his name; he gave me the name of Jones, Deptford; which I wrote on the note in his presence. This is the note he gave me (looking at it)-it was after banking hours. Next morning I presented it at Lee and Co.'s Lombard-street, for payment, and found it was forged. In consequence of which Mr. Hine, one of the clerks of the Bury bank, came to town on the Monday following, the 10th. We went together to Deptford, and were there nearly all day, searching for every person of the name of Jones, that we could find. We found four or five of that name, but not the person who gave me the note.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of information did you go into St. George's-fields - A. Yes; on the following Friday, the 14th, I went to Joiner's-place, near Westminster-road, about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning. Mr. Hine and Walton, the officer, were with me. Walton knocked at the door, a boy opened it, he asked if Gracey was within? the boy said he did not live there. We went in through a room, which was the shop, it was shut up-this led us to a bed-room, Walton said, "Good morning to you, Gracey." I did not hear him answer. I said,"Good morning, Mr. Jones." He said his name was not Jones. I told him I understood it was not, but I wished him to go with us - He dressed himself, and went with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say anything more - A.He asked what I wanted with him. I told him he was the person who purchased a piece of linen of Mr. Walmsley, in Gracechurch-street, and I had given him change for a note; he then said he did not know Mr. Walmsley, that he had not been in Gracechurch-street, nor purchased any Irish linen, nor had he given a 5l. note to any person. We took him to the watch-house. As we were going along I asked him what he had done with the cloth he bought, he said he had not had any. We went to the watch-house to him at eleven o'clock - He wished to see his mother; Walton went for her, leaving me with the prisoner. He returned with his sister.</p>
               <p>Q. While Walton was absent, had you any conversation with him - A. I told him I thought he was wrong in denying it, as I was sure he was the person who gave me the note; I said I did not wish to hurt him, I only wanted to recover my 5l. He was searched, and this pocket-book found on him; here is a memorandum, against the 7th of August (reads) "Jones, 2l." I had given him a 1l. note, and 17s. 2d. for his change. He was taken before the magistrate; I heard him make a statement there, which was taken down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Look at him again, and see if you are positive he is the man who paid you the note - A. I have not the least doubt of it; he gave me the name of Jones voluntarily.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say his name was Jones, of Deptford, or that he received it of Jones, of Deptford - A. He only said, Jones, Deptford.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he state to you how he came possessed of the note - A. I think it was at his second examination, I said nothing whatever to him - I took very short minutes of what he said - He spoke too fast for my clerk to take it down, but my minutes will enable me to state what he said; he said he would not sign any examination (reads),"I did live at No. 12, Kent-road, am a carver and gilder; I lodge now in Joiner's-place. I cannot say what is the person's name who keeps the house. I received this note when I lived in the Kent-road, about three weeks ago, for two dressing-boxes, which came to 2l. 14s., and put the man's name on the back of the note-he said he lived at Greenwich; he drove up with a horse and cart. I will not say whether he did not write the name himself. I did not take it to the banking-house. I left the shop in the Kent-road last Monday, and took my goods with me." He had seen the note; there is the name of "Howard, Stratford," on it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to St. George's-fields to seek for the prisoner - I knew him before; he came to my house on the Wednesday previous to see his brother, who I had in custody. I addressed him in the name of Gracey, and he answered to it. His mother's name is over the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. His mother is a carver and gilder; I believe she sells dressing-cases. The shop is in Crown-street, Finsbury-square.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I kept a carver and gilder's shop in the Kent-road. About the 27th of July a man drove up in a chaise, bought two boxes, and paid me the note. On the 7th of August, as I came home, I bought the linen at Walmsley's, and paid him the note, after having looked at the Directory, and saw there was such a bank. They did not ask me for my name, nor did I give any. I moved to Joiner's-place - They took me there. I did not know the note was bad.</p>

               <p>William Hay. About five or six weeks ago, I went out with Bailey and Cole, on the road leading from the Foundling Hospital to the Duke of Bolton's. We stopped a gentleman, and robbed him of his watch and umbrella, and a few shillings.</p>
               <p>Who robbed him? - I did: the others shared in it; I do not recollect any thing of a pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - Between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him? - Only asked him to deliver his property; he said, do not use me ill; I have nothing more to say.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is that your umbrella? - I believe it to be mine; the handle is rather broke, and the whalebone rather torn from the canvas; I cannot swear positively; others may be in the same state.</p>

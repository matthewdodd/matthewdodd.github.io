            . Q. I believe you are chief clerk of the police office, Hatton Garden. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the examination of the prisoner of the bar, and also of Whiston. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that occasion was the silver produced by Mr. Dobson. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Before any declaration was made by Whiston, was any warning made to Whiston. - A. Before that declaration was made the magistrate cautioned Whiston upon his making the confession, he told him that what he said would be committed to writing, therefore he was to consider whether he would say any thing or no.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What one prisoner says of the other prisoner is not evidence against the other; it may be evidence against himself, and whatever Whiston might say is not evidence against the other.</p>
               <p>Court. It is making what another says not upon oath<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170052"></xptr>evidence against the prisoner; the indictment proves the conviction of Whiston. (The conviction read.)</p>
               <p>Mr Gurney to Dobson You produced that silver on the trial of Whiston. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified</p>
               <p>COURT. Possession is not evidence of the receiver; possession is evidence of the thief. If property is recently stolen and found in possession of another person, he is the thief, and not the receiver. In this case we can have but one opinion, that is, to think that he is a very bad man; but though he is a bad man, we must try him upon the strict rule of law; - possession is not evidence of the receiver but evidence of the thief. I cannot state it to you that mere possession of property is evidence that he received it of another person, knowing it to be stolen; because to make him the receiver, there must be evidence that he knew another person stole it. It is a very fortunate circumstance to the prisoner.</p>

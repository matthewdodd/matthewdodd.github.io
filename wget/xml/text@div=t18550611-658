                  </hi>. I live in Bridge-place, Bride-street, Greenwich. 1 am sixty-nine years of age—I went with Beasor, a sheriff's officer, to execute a distress on some premises, on the 22nd of May—I saw Beasor go in at the gate, and he called me to go in at the stone yard by the side, the gate being shut—I got in, and saw the prisoner—he said if I came in, he would break my b—y neck, and shake my b—y guts out—he came to me, and took bold of me by the collar of my coat, and forced me out of the premises on to the stone premises, ran me all along the premises, and shook me violently, and threw me down with all the force he could—I could not get up again-some persons going along hallooed out what a shame it was—I was obliged to call to them to help me up—I was taken to the hospital—my arm was broken—it has been set, but I am still under the doctors—they tell me it is very likely I never may have the use of my arm again.</p>

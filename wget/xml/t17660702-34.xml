            . Our ship belongs to Mr. Grove; the rope being over the ship's side, to keep her off from the next ship, this rope which we cut was taken upon the gunnel of the other ship. I do not know who cut it; but there was a pair of shoes and buckles left in a boat, which the prisoner came for, and said were his property; the next morning then we secured him, and charged him with cutting the rope; he then confessed he did cut it in my hearing, and fell on his knees, and said he would do so no more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>They robbed me, instead of my robbing them. I belonged to a vessel; I was going to get the water out of my shoes, as it rained very hard; the dog barked, and they came up and took my buckles and shoes; I came for them the next morning, and they took me in custody. I came from Lisbon in the Dove; I was taking care of her, as all the men were paid but me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I let the captain of his vessel know what the prisoner had done, and he returned me many thanks.</p>

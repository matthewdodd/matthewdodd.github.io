            . Upon the 13th of July, the Woman came to my House to offer this Velvet, three Yards and half a Quarter in all. I never had seen the Prisoner before, but she came recommended to me by a Neighbour; she sent her Servant to tell me, I might safely take what the Woman brought; I says, I believe your Mistress is an honest Woman, but I believe 'tis stole; she desired to have 18 s. upon it; upon that the Woman began to be very abusive; I insisted to know whose Property it was. Then she equivocated, and said, she was desirous to sell it. Upon that I advertised it; the Woman that came to speak for her, had been a Servant, and work'd with Mr Bolland, but for fear they should not read it. I sent a Letter to Mr Bolland. Upon the 15th Day. the Man Prisoner came to claim the Velvet as his Property. I ask'd him if they were Husband and Wife? and he said, she was not his Wife, and he claimed the Velvet as his own. I still insisted upon knowing more; he said that his Name was Morris; the Woman offered me Half a Crown if I would let her have the Velvet.</p>

               <p>The Woman Prisoner in her Defence said, that she found it in the dark on the Stairs where she lodg'd, which was the House where the Velvet was made.</p>

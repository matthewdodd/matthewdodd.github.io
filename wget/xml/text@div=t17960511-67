               <p>Q. Were you at Guildhall upon the 15th of February? - A. Yes; I remember seeing the prisoner there; I was with Harrison during the whole of the examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Harrison and the present prisoner near together? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Harrison accuse the present prisoner of having robbed him, saying, that is the man, and I will swear to him? - A. He accused him so far as this: seeing him very intimate with the man who was convicted before, I have my doubts whether this man is not one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that was the man, and he would swear to him? - A. Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. He never positively said he was the man? - A. No; but seeing him very intimate with the prisoner, it occasioned some doubt in his mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to say, that if that had passed while you were there, as you were with him all the time, must you have heard it? - A. I think so.</p>
               <p>Court.Q. Were you with Harrison at the door? - A. No; when the prisoner made his escape out of the Hall, I believe Harrison went to the door; but I am not certain whether he was not in the Hall the whole time; the prisoner made his escape in consequence of a thought arising whether he was not one of the party; there was a pursuit after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he never said he was the man, and he would swear to him? - A. Not in my hearing; the prisoner said it was said out at the yard-door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was out of the Hall where the man made use of those expressions.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were you with Harrison before he went into Guildhall? - A.No; I met him in Guildhall-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of you were there first? - A. I cannot say; he might be there first, or I might be first, I cannot say; but I think he was there before me.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't happen to know whether the prosecutor and Davis where in company together before you went into Guildhall? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see Davis? - A. I saw being to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came in you don't know? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Were he there before you? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there as soon as Harrison, the prosecutor, was there? - A. I believe I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there as soon as Harrison was? - A. I think I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that for certain, either one way or the other? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with Harrison all the time? - A. No; not all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you either within sight or hearing of him all the time you were there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he accuse as being the person who had robbed him? - A. Millan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at any time say, that Davis was the man who had robbed him, and he would swear to him? - A. I did not hear him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he at any time have said, in a voice that was likely to be heard, that Davis was the man who robbed him, and he would swear to him, without your hearing it? - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at any time asked, whether he would swear to Davis as being the man that robbed him? - A. Yes; he said, he really believed he was one of the gang, but he would not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner.Q. Were you out of the hall at the time Harrison was? - A. No. I was in the Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course you must be out of the sight of the man? - A. I was not out of the Hall.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you believe that at the time you were there he were out of the Hall? - A. I don't believe he was; I don't say that he was not, or that he was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, being in the city about some business, an acquaintance went with me; we had an hour or two to spare; we went out of curiosity into Guildhall; I was leaning upon the place there; there were several people in the place; I knew that I had insulted a person in Holborn, and I thought it was not a fit place for me to be in; with that I walked out of the Hall; the alarm of "stop thief!" was given, and I saw several people coming towards me, and I surrendered myself; upon that Harrison said that is one of the men, and I will swear to him; we then came into the Hall; I stood by the side of the prisoner, and I was desired to step over the bar that the prosecutor might have a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110127"></xptr>full view of me: I said, if he could speak to me, being one of the men, at the distance of thirty yards, as he was when he said so, to be sure he could when he was close to me; I asked him whether I was the man? he said he believed I was one of the men: I leave it to you to judge, whether, after I had been an accomplice I should have come into this Court to fly into the face of justice.</p>
               <p>Court to Goodwin. Did the prisoner run out of the Hall? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Harrison go out? - A. I cannot say that he did; I doubt whether he was out of the hall or not; if he was, he only went to the door.</p>
               <p>Court. In this case there being nothing but the belief of a witness, it would surely be too much to convict the prisoner of perjury.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter. On Thursday afternoon, the 15th of November, the prisoner who lives at Mr. Campbell's, at the Crown, in Butcher-hall-lane, told me to go for twopenny worth of cantharides—I got it at Mr. Watkins's, and gave it to him—he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for my trouble.</p>

               <p>at half-past nine o'clock—my master and mistress, and the prisoner and his wife had had their breakfast together soon after eight o'clock-just before I had mine, I saw the prisoner go up stairs as I was coming down—he had an opportunity of getting to the coffee before I had—I afterwards drank a small portion of it, and it made me ill—I saw Mr. Hadlow the doctor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in Jury-street, Aldgate. I was called in to attend Mrs. Campbell, on the morning of the 16th of Novem<lb></lb>ber—I saw the coffee, and there was cantharides in it sufficient to produce an injurious effect to any one taking it—Mrs. Campbell was very seriously affected by it for twenty hours, and is an invalid still.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> She was an invalid before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was—I could not tell what quantity there was-twopenny worth mixed in half-a-pint of coffee would produce most serious consequences, if all taken by one person-Mary Ann Wells and Mrs. Campbell were both ill, and it was necessary to apply powerful remedies—Mrs. Campbell labours under a stomachic disease, not connected at all with the occasion of my being called in to attend her in this case, but it was aggravated by this—she is now under my care.</p>

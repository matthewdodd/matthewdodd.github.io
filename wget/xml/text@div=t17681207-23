She fell on her knees, and said, she would tell me the truth; there was nothing pawned, but my stays, and they were in Grub-Street; and that Bailey sold the two gowns and a peticoat for a guinea; my child's stays for three shillings; and my cardinal for seven shillings and six-pence. When I took Bailey up, she had my bonnet on. She said, she would go with me to the place where they were sold: she went with me to the bottom of Rag-Fair, where I found Bailey sitting by the woman's fire-side, who bought the things. When I charged her, she began to behave very impudent. I charged the watch with her and Gold; they were brought to Guild-hall. Bailey sent my bonnet, by the woman where she was in goal, on the Monday morning. The woman who bought the things is gone away, and I have not heard of her since.</p>

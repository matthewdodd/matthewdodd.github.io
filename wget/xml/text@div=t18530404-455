                  </hi>. I am an omnibus proprietor, residing in Silver-street, Edmonton. Novell was my horse-keeper—I know nothing about Smith—Newland is a <hi rend="italic">higgler</hi>, I believe they call him; he has a one-horse cart, and has a stable opposite mine, in the same yard—my house is at the opposite side of Silver-street, looking into the yard—I had ten horses on 23rd March?</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185304040019"></xptr>
               <p>—on that morning I left home about 8 o'clock, and returned about 25 minute or half-past 10 o'clock, when a communication was made to me by my wife and I went with a policeman to Newland's stable—I went in by myself and found him cutting a truss of hay up—I asked him how he got it; he said he bought it in Tottenham Court-road the night before—I told him it was my hay out of my loft, I had every reason to believe brought out that morning—I found no other hay in the place—Hack then came in, and his attention was first drawn to the corn-box, which was locked—he called out to Newland for the key, and he gave him the key down out of the loft—he unlocked it, and we discovered about a bushel or a bushel and a half of oats—we had not an opportunity of measuring them—I identified them directly as part of my property—I went over with Hack to match them with mine, and when we came back, Newland was in the act of trying to mix the chaff and oats to prevent us from taking a sample—they were the same description of oats as mine—Hack went into the stable, and I went to Miss Scott, who told me what she had seen—her house looks into the yard—I was absent five or ten minutes, or not so long—Hack then went into my stable with me, and we measured the oats—there was a little better than a bushel and a half left in the bin; there would be about two bushels and a half gone, but then I must allow for my horses being fed—they could not have eaten two bushels and a half in the time they had; perhaps they might have eaten a bushel—the ten horses were not fed from it that morning, only nine.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside with my father in Silver-street, Edmonton. On 23rd March, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was looking out of a back window which overlooks the stable-yard—I saw Smith there; he went cautiously into Mr. Hall's loft, up the outside ladder, and threw down a truss of hay and a truss of straw—he looked all round first, as if he was afraid some one was near, which made me suspect—he was coming down, but some one came into the yard, and he waited a minute or two, looking down; the person went away again, and he came down, went up to the hay, took hold of it, looked all round the yard, and then, instead of going straight across the yard, from one stable to the other, he walked round the yard into Newland's stable—Emma Cox then came into the yard, and when he saw her he shut Newland's door, and remained inside—then Mr. Hall's stable-door opened, and Novell came out, looked at the straw, and touched it with his foot; he looked up at the loft took hold of it, and put it in Mr. Hall's stable when he saw no one was there—that was the first time I saw Novell—I told my brother.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Hall. On 23rd March, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I went into the yard for a pail of water, and saw Smith with a truss of hay, which he took into Newland's stable, and shut himself in—I saw a truss of straw on the dung-heap below Mr. Hall's loft—I took the pail of water across Silver-street to the house, and then my mistress sent me with a message to Novell—I went to the yard again, and Novell and Smith had got the door shut—I knocked at the door; Novell came and asked what I I wanted—Smith was then putting the straw under the horses—I gave my message to Novell, and he called young Scott to him, and gave him a message; Scott said he would go where he wanted him, but said, "I say, Harry, didyousee that Smith take a truss of straw out of Mr. Hall's loft?" Novell said, "No; but if I had seen him, I would have given him a <hi rend="italic">clip</hi> under the ear"—Scott said that Smith took it into Mr. Newland's stable, and I said, if he did not like to believe it, I saw the boy Smith, too, with the truss of hay, and that he had taken it round by the pig-stye and by the dunghill, and when begot to the stable he threw it down and got sight of me, but did not notice me much; and I watched too, and he opened Mr. Newland's stable, went in with the truss, and shut himself in—if he had gone straight across instead of going round by the dunghill, any one might have seen him through the gate, which opens on to the street, and which stood wide open, but they would not the way he went—Novell said to me, "Don't make a bother about it"—Smith was not there at that time, but not a great time afterwards he went up into the loft, came down again, and said, "Do you think there is any gone?" Novell said, "Yes, I think there is one bundle gone"—I did not go into the loft, but I went into the stable—afterwards, about 10 minutes to 11 o'clock, I saw Newland go into his stable and shut himself in—I heard him lift up what appeared to be the lid of a corn-bin, and let it down again—I waited there, and two or three minutes afterwards I heard him begin to cut chaff—about half-past 8 o'clock that morning I saw my mistress give Novell a sack of corn—she did that every morning.</p>

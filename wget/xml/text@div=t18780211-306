I met the prisoner and a man in Wandsworth Road—one was ahead of the other—I fancied the prisoner had something under his arm—I turned back, and before I could ask him what he had got he threw something into the road, and they ran away—I followed, calling "Stop thief"—Lewis stopped the prisoner—I went back and found a dress and cloak in the road, and at the station in the breast of the prisoner's coat I found this waterproof coat, this scarf in his pocket, and a handkerchief and a box of matches, and this other scarf on his neck—he was charged with unlawful possession of the articles—next day, about 2 p. m., I went to Miss Haynes, 358, Wandsworth Road, and saw Maria Beck, who gave me some matches which corresponded with those found on the prisoner—an attempt had been made to enter the pantry window, and an entry had been made through the kitchen window, which was unfastened, and they had returned the same way.</p>

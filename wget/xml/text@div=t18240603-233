I went to bed between 12 and 1 o'clock - there was no person in the room but me, and the man who has just spoken (the prisoner.) I had a pair of trowsers, a waistcoat, a pair of boots, and some penny-pieces in the inside pocket of this waistcoat. I pulled off my clothes, and put the waistcoat between the bed and sacking - the other clothes I left quite careless about the room. I awoke about seven o'clock I believe, to the best of my knowledge - I felt about before I made any alarm, as I could not see, and did not wish to accuse any one wrongfully - I first missed my boots, and then my other things - I have got my property since - the prisoner slept in the same bed with me - I know him by his voice.</p>

            ; we live in George-yard, and take in persons to lodge for the night. I remember the poor blind man coming to lodge there on the night of the 10th of April; the prisoner came before the blind man - they both had the same bed. I recollect the prisoner left a porter's knot, because he had no money, as he stated - he was to pay 4 d. for his lodging - the blind man got up about seven o'clock next morning, and said he had been robbed of his clothes and money. The prisoner was gone - I do not know how he went; he had no money the night before, and left the knot as security, but he has never called for it from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw this person in my life - Witness. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>MARY M'GEE. I am the wife of the blind man - I did not sleep with him on this night, but I know that he slept there; he used the house. He had a pair of trowsers, a waistcoat, and some money. I saw the prisoner with them on the 15th of April, when he was in custody; he had my husband's trowsers on, but nothing else; they were my husband's trowsers - I looked at them, and knew them to be my husband's.</p>

            . I am clerk to the prosecutors. The prisoner was in their employ in February. He supplied the place of his brother, who was ill. He made out sales and bills, and, occasionly, received money. The counting-house is in Mincing-lane. On the 20th of May I applied to Mr. Banks for money, and Millner showed me the bill with the receipt and initials to it; they are the prisoner's hand-writing - it was dated the 14th of February, 1820.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. I believe his parents are very respectable - A. I believe so. He has a twin brother, who is extremely like him. His brother attended in the counting-house, but did not go out, being ill. I have mistaken one for the other myself. The writing is his, and not his brother's.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Bankes, of Little Distaff-lane. He had transactions with Messrs. Corrie. I remember a person calling for 3 l. 2 s. 1 d., which was their their account. I cannt swear it was the prisoner. He put his initials on the bill - it is since destroyed. I showed it to Mr. Storrow before it was destroyed. I paid the person three 1 l. notes and 2 s. 1 d.</p>

             re-examined. It was the prisoner's duty to bring the money to me the day he received it. He never brought this sum to me as that sum. The day after it was received, he brought me 3 l. 11 s. 6 d. as received from Mr. Fenwick. On the evening of the 20th of May I went to his lodgings - he came to me outside the door. I told him something unpleasant had occurred, that a sum or sums of money had been received, and they did not appear to be accounted for; and I meant to be candid with him, provided he was candid with me. He immediately said he received one sum only, and that was 3 l. 2 s. 1 d. from Mr. Bankes, and had applied that sum to replace 3 l. 11 s. 6 d. which he had from Fenwick, and lost out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain it was him that said so - A. Yes, it was not his brother. He said he paid me the very money he received from Bankes.</p>

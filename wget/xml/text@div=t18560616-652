                  </hi>. I am a timber merchant, at Stratford. The prisoner was in my employment for about five months as clerk—on 2nd May I sent him with this bill to Mr. Burrows to collect 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; on his return he said that Burrows was not ready to pay—I said, "I shall County Court him"—he said he was a decent fellow, and would pay in a short period of time—he did not pay me a sovereign, or any money—I discharged him on the 24th for some other reason, and discovered this afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you discover it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the Monday fol<lb></lb>lowing the day upon which I discharged him—he had been in my service about five months; I had known him previously for twenty years, I should say—I knew him to be a bad man, but I thought I was clever enough to make him a good one—I am certain he did not pay me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he came back from Burrows—I carry a <hi rend="italic">porte monnaie,</hi> and loose gold and silver in it—I cannot tell at what time he returned from Burrows's—I saw him the ensuing morning about 7 o'clock, I should imagine, as far as I can recollect—it was part of his duty to measure timber; he is a very clever fellow, and is the author of one or two works—he has been in the habit of going into the country upon business for me—I gave him money before he started on his journeys—I did not allow him to appropriate the money he received from customers if he ran short—I never recollect his paying money out of his own pocket, and my afterwards repaying him—I will swear it never occurred—I remember sending him a cheque into the country with instructions to apply to one of my customers to cash it—I do not know that he refused to cash it, I know it was cashed; I have never heard that he could not get it cashed, and had to make use of his own money until he could get it cashed—he never told me anything of the kind—at the time I discharged him, on 24th May, I owed him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for wages.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

On the night of the 21st of March, I went to get some coals, and found the prisoner in the cellar, on the coals—I ran up stairs, and shut the street-door—he ran up after me—I collared him, and asked what brought him there—he said seeing the door open, he went down to go to the water-closet, that he had not taken anything, and begged me to let him go—I said Ki should not till I saw if the place was safe—I locked the street-door, put the key into my pocket, went down with a light, and missed the water-pipe—I re<lb></lb>turned up stairs, and said, "You have taken the water-pipe"—be said he had not—I said, "Let me look at your hands"—he held them closed—I said, "I will give you in charge, you have taken the pipe"—he begged me to let him go, and he would send for his mother, and make any recom<lb></lb>mend—I sent a boy out of the window for a policeman, who came, and then the prisoner ran into the back yard—he unlocked the back door, and was getting over the pales, and as I pulled him back something fell from him—I let in the policeman, and with the light I had in my hand, I saw the pipe laying at the prisoner's feet—he raised his band to a female who I met, and then knocked the candle out of my hand—I had seen the pipe fixed to the ceiling at ten o'clock that morning.</p>

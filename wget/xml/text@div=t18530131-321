                  </hi>. I am a Russia broker, and live at Greenwich, the female prisoner was in my service about five weeks; she came about two months since—about a week before she left she said her husband was out of employ, and asked me if I could get him a situation; I took him into my employment in the City as messenger and porter—he occasionally called at my house at Greenwich, but not often—the prisoners passed as man and wife—before the female prisoner left I missed some table linen, matting, and fringe—we did not miss any books, but some were found in her box—on Monday 17th Jan., in consequence of some information I received I went to Newton-place, Greenwich, with a constable—that was a month or five weeks after the female had left my service—I saw her there in a lodging up one pair of stairs—she was standing upon some matting—I said, "Mrs. Smith you know whose that is; how came that there?"—she said, "I brought it from your house" this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—all the property mentioned in the indictment was in the room—she was asked for the key of the box; she said her husband had it—I brought her husband in, he gave the policeman four keys, and my impression is that he said "These are all the keys I have got"—the policeman tried them and said neither of them was it, and then she said that she had the key—she then took it out of her pocket, and the policeman opened the box with it, and in the box I saw more of my property, some jam and some fringe, a tea caddy, and some printed books—the male prisoner claimed the jam, he said he brought it up from Dart ford—when the box was</p>

               <p>opened the policeman asked him whose box it was; he said, "It is mine;" and claimed all in the box—the policeman asked him before the box was opened if the property there was his, and he said, "Yes"—after it was opened the policeman said, "What jam is this?"—he said, "It is mine, we made it two years ago, and I brought it up from Dart ford;" it had papers tied round it—I said, "I think that may be my jam, and if it is it will have a label on it in my daughter's writing"—here is the label on it—he said he had had as many as twenty pots of it—I knew the books to be mine directly I saw them—the female prisoner said she was fond of reading—I found a walking stick of mine in the room, which had been kept at the office in the city—I spoke to the male prisoner about it, and he said he had brought it from the city—from the explanation he gave afterwards, I thought he might have brought it to carry a parcel.</p>

I went to No. 4, Newton-place, where the female prisoner was lodging—I found her there, she took me up stairs into her room, and I told her I must search it—I saw a box and asked her for the key; she said she had not got it, her husband had it—I sent Mr. Gull, who had followed me to the house, to fetch her husband; he was brought, and I asked him whose box it was; he said it was his; I asked him for the key, he put his hand in his pocket and produced three or four keys which I tried, but they would not undo the lock—he turned round to his wife who put her hand in her pocket and gave him out a key which he gave to me, and I opened the box with it and found five pots of jam—he said he got them from Deptford, and had had them two years—I also found a tea caddy in the box next day when the prisoners were not present.</p>

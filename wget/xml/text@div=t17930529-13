               <p>Mr. Peat. You live in Soho square, No. 25; are you the master of the house? - I am steward to general Conway.</p>

               <p>Q. If you stand there till twelve o'clock at night you shall answer the question? - I will if the court order.</p>
               <p>Court. You are bound to answer that question? - I had a lady.</p>

               <p>I am coachman to Duke Colson, esq. he has a country house at Westborough Green.</p>
               <p>Court to Knowles. You did not tell me the day of the month, or the day of the week? - I cannot be positive, but I think it was the 5th of April, I think it was Thursday night; it was Friday morning I lost the watch.</p>
               <p>Taylor. The prisoner came to me on the 9th of May, Thursday, came to town to me and asked me to go to Mr. Heather to ask the value of this watch; he stopped and stayed with my horses the while; it was neither offered to be pawned nor sold.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to ask the value of it? - I went to oblige the prisoner. Mr. Heather looked at the watch and asked if I wanted to sell it; I made answer, no, and I asked him if it was worth five guineas? he looked at the watch and asked me how I came by it, and where I got it, where I stole it? and stopped me in the shop till the prisoner came in and then we were taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. It seems the prisoner held your horses while you went to enquire the value of this watch; did he direct you to sell it? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you did not on your own account offer to pawn it or sell it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. How soon was the prisoner taken up afterwards? - In about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was detained by Mr. Heather did you give any account of the prisoner? - I was detained two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you when you was detained by Mr. Heather, did you give any account to Mr. Heather that the prisoner was holding your horses - I did, and I told him I had the watch of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner taken? - He was taken in the shop; he was sent for, and we were both taken together in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you both charged with this robbery before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was discharged I suppose? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Taylor the last witness brought the watch into my shop to know the value of it; from seeing of him I asked him a good many questions how he came by it and where he got it? and I suspected from what he said that he did not know any thing about it; I sent my servant privately to Bow-street to get a constable, and when the constable came I gave him charge of him; then he said he had the watch of a man that was with his coach three or four doors off, waiting with his coach and horses; then I sent the constable and my servant to tell the man to come; the prisoner at the bar said that he gave this man the watch, for him to ask the value of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When your servant went after the prisoner, in what way did he come to your house? - He came directly with my servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass that is material to state? - He said he found it in the necessary house, on the seat; I searched them both at Bow-street, and there they were examined; the coachman was discharged to take care of his horses; the other man acknowledged that he gave it the coachman to ask the price of it at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the watch after that? - I have kept it in my custody ever since, (Produced) it is a metal watch gilt with gold.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Then it was not offered to you either to pawn or sell? - This Taylor said he was to give five guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner came willingly to your shop when you sent for him? - He did.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether he was a servant, or in what capacity he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. He was an assistant to the hostler at the Red Lyon-Inn, Kew Bridge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Heather. The prisoner had a direction where to go with the watch to get the two guineas reward, it was found when he was searched; I saw it and read it.</p>
               <p>- RUTHEN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a patrole under the direction of Mr. Addington; I was sent for to Mr. Heather's shop; this young man and the prisoner were in the shop at the time, and I was desired to take them to Bow-street; this bit of paper was found in his pocket where to take the watch to get the two guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. It is the direction I left with the landlord. (The watch deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat to Heather. Did the other man say before the prisoner that the prisoner wanted to sell it for five guineas? - No, it was before the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I meant for the gentleman to have the watch, and I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

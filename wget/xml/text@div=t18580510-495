                  </hi>. I am in the employ of my father, Henry Ash Israel, who lives and carries on business at No. 66, High Street, in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate. I locked up the house on 8th March, about 11 o'clock—Iwas the last person up—I was awakened by the police about ten minutes past 3 o'clock in the morning—I got up, and found the street door opened—thetills in the counting house were broken open; the iron safe was opened with a key which had been taken from my pocket—I found it on a stool in the counting house—two drawers in the kitchen were broken open—I missed from my clothes in my bedroom my purse, containing 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a few coppers from my pocket; I had left the door open when I went to bed—I also missed a gold watch and chain from a drawer in my room, my great coat from a peg behind the parlour door, and several other articles—the prisoner worked for my father some years ago on those premises—when the house was locked up, the key was left at the Turk's Head, for the men to come in in the morning without disturbing the family—when I have seen the key it has been generally behind the bar.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in Mr. Israel's employment. I now live with my mother—on Monday, 10th March, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the Turk's Head public house; there were several people there—Huckleis one of them—he said to the others that he had seen Henry Israel counting some money into his pocket, and that he knew the way he could get into Ash's house—that is what Mr. Israel is called—the other party said, "Ash has got a dog," and Huckle said that it would not hurt any body—Hucklealso said that he had no money, and was going to get a loan of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that night.</p>

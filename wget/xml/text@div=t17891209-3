             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 6th of November, between ten and eleven, I came up close by the prosecutrix and the thief, the corner of Ayre-street, Piccadilly; and just as I passed them, I heard a woman cry; and I immediately turned round, and saw the prisoner taking a bundle from her; I am sure it was the prisoner; I turned round, and saw him, before he got the bundle from the prosecutrix; and I ran after him; I never lost sight of him; I ran into Ayre-street, and Castle-street; at the farther end of Castle-street, he could get no farther, and he threw down the bundle; and I took him there; he had ran past the thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>Did you see him throw the bundle down? - No, I did not; I took him within two yards of the bundle; and there was nobody at the same time by, nor for three or four minutes afterwards; these are the things that were in the bundle they have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>(Deposed to by the Prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090008"></xptr>I know the gown; I cut it out, and made it; and I will swear to the baize.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys, Prisoner's Counsel, to prosecutrix. I am informed you had this bundle snatched from you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The person said nothing at all to you? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>The prisoner is an intire stranger to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never saw him before that night? - Never, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>To Drew. What sort of night was it? - Rather a moon light, but the moon was rather in a dulness; I was about five yards before the lady; the prisoner ran up Eyre-street; I am sure there were no other persons there; there were two turnings between Piccadilly and King-street; he turned first into Eyre-street, then into Castle-street; I never lost sight of him; I was within twenty yards of him.</p>
               <p>Who directed this indictment, you or the lady? - The lady put in the indictment.</p>
               <p>With respect to this being a highway robbery, you know there is a reward I suppose? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>You do not know there is a reward of forty pounds? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Who directed this indictment for a highway robbery, you or the lady? - The prosecutrix; she was then at Hicks's Hall.</p>
               <p>To Prosecutrix. Did you direct the indictment for a highway robbery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was going from my work in Charles-street, Westminster; I supposed my master would be here; he is not; I stopped in the Hay-market at half past eight, and drank part of two pots of beer; and from thence went down to Piccadilly, to a public-house there, to a friend of mine; he was not at home; I went from there up the haymarket; I went to look for the foreman of a shop in Glass-house-street, to enquire whether I should be wanted; in the next street, at the top of Eyre-street, Piccadily, seeing the lady and this man together, coming down Eyre-street; a man went up to this lady; they were there for a moment; I saw the man run; the lady screamed and run; I ran almost down to the top of Castle-street; the rim of my buckle flew off; this man came and caught hold of me; and asked me what I had done with the bundle; he said he saw no thief but me; he caught me by the collar, and I was taken down to the watch-house; my witnesses are not here; it was not ten o'clock; the watch was not set.</p>
               <p>Court to Drew. Were there two persons running before you, or only one? - Only one; I swear positively; it was rather better than half past ten.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had the person you was pursuing, a bundle under his arm? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That was my own coat? - I am sure it was the prisoner; I saw a bundle on him while I pursued him; I never lost sight of him.</p>

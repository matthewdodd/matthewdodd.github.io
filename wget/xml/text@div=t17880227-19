               <p>My husband is book-keeper to the Cambridge coach.</p>
               <p>Where is your warehouse? - Adjoining to a parlour and stair-case, and bed-rooms, in Mr. Harding's house; Holmes came to our house about half after seven o'clock, and brought a square parcel in whitish paper; I took it, and put it with the other goods.</p>
               <p>Was it sealed? - I did not take any particular notice because I knew Mr. Holmes; there was a lad came at the same time with a parcel from Mr. Stokes's; the prisoner came to me; he stood with his arms across; he had a blue coat, with a red collar, and a red waistcoat on; he said, what time do you expect the Cambridge coach? I said, I do not know; about ten minutes after, I locked the warehouse door and tried it, and went to warm me; when I returned, the lock was picked, and that parcel, and the parcel brought from Mr. Stokes's were gone; the parcel in white paper attracted my attention, I missed that immediately; I never saw the prisoner afterwards.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man? Yes, I took particular notice of his mouth and nose.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Have you always kept to this story, that you could recollect the person of the prisoner? - I do, and always did.</p>
               <p>Did you swear to him at your first examination at Bow-street? - I said, I really thought he was the person; I knew him by his mouth and nose; I said the same then as I do now.</p>
               <p>How did you find the door on your return, open or shut? - It was standing a-jar; I locked the door, and took the key with me.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body else in the yard? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the person now? - Yes; I am positive.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing to induce you to remember him better now, than when you was before the magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you any scruple before the magistrate at your first examination? - I said, I will not swear blank he is the person.</p>
               <p>Had you any doubt on your mind? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you say at first, he was the person, or like him? - I said, he was the person, or like him.</p>
               <p>Had he the same clothes on at the office, as when you saw him? - When I saw him in the yard he had a blue coat on; he had a brown one at the office.</p>
               <p>What waistcoat had he on? - A red one.</p>
               <p>Had he a red waistcoat at the office? - Yes; it might be of a brighter colour than the one he had that night.</p>
               <p>Much brighter, or a little brighter? - A little brighter.</p>
               <p>(Her examination was produced, from which it appeared, that she swore before the Justice, that the prisoner very much resembled the person who came that night to enquire what time the Cambridge coach came in.)</p>

               <p>You are now positively sure the prisoner is the person? - I really think he is the person.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270035"></xptr>Has this money ever been demanded of the proprietor of the coach? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever understand that they were liable to make good the money? - No; we took it as a common parcel.</p>
               <p>What time did the Cambridge coach come in? - Not till the next day in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Stokes, in Goldsmith-street, Cheapside; I took a parcel to the Green Dragon, on the 26th of December, about half past seven in the evening; I saw a man walking about the yard with his hands folded; I was enquiring for the book-keeper; Mr. Holmes came, and a porter with him, and said, he knew where to find the book-keeper; and went and brought out Mrs. Brickwood, and gave her his parcel, which was covered with white paper, and I gave her mine; the man put his head into the warehouse, and asked when the Cambridge coach would come in.</p>
               <p>Did you observe his dress? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You cannot swear to the man? - No; she took the parcels to the farther end of the warehouse; I came out and went away.</p>

               <p>I am a porter; I was at the Green Dragon Inn, the 26th of December, about eight o'clock in the evening; there were two men in the yard; one of them asked me, which was the Bull? I told him the next inn; one, I believe, was the prisoner; but I cannot say, being in the dark and in a hurry.</p>
               <p>You knew Coleman before? - Yes, some years.</p>
               <p>You are not certain, whether he was the man, or not? - I cannot possibly pretend to say; they followed me out; they had nothing with them; one of them had a blue coat with a red collar.</p>

               <p>I went to search Coleman's lodgings, Coleman was not there; there was a woman, Mrs. Morris, she said the house and all the things in it were her's.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was Coleman's lodgings? - He came afterwards and demanded the notes and money I took out of that house; I found two pick-lock keys under a plate in the cupboard; there was a large chest, I broke it open, and found in it a little box, like a wafer-box, with ten guineas in guineas, and half guineas, and a little book full of bank notes, to the amount of one hundred and ninety pounds; I went to Bow-street, and from there to the Bank; there was no bed in the room, there was a vice in the garret, and a number of picklock keys; I went to the warehouse and tried this key (producing it) and it opened the warehouse door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where did you see Coleman after this? - At Bow-street, he came to look for his money and notes the same day.</p>
               <p>Did he come in custody? - No.</p>

               <p>To Higgs. There were some light guineas you returned? - Yes, there might be ten or more, I do not recollect.</p>

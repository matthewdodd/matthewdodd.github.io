                  </hi>. I am a cabinet maker, of 90, City Road—on the morning of 30th July, about 12.45, I was aroused by a noise as if the front door was burst open—I listened for a few minutes and then heard a noise at the inner door as if a person was trying keys—I got out of bed, opened the door, asked who was there, but got no answer—I closed the door again, opened the bedroom window, and saw four men run out of the house—the last one had clothes like the prisoner, a black frock coat—he ran down Cowper Street, and the other three made for Old Street—I went down stairs and found the prisoner in custody—I had secured the house between 9 and 10 o'clock.</p>

On the morning of 31st July, about 12.50, I saw the prisoner and three other men come out of 90, City Road, one after the other, the prisoner was the last—the door was open—on seeing me the prisoner went down Cowper Street, and I went after him calling "Stop thief!"—he was stopped by <hi rend="italic">G</hi> 63, and said "Hulloa, old boy, you have made a mistake, I was running after the man came' out of 90, City Road"—there was no man in front of him who he was pursuing;—I had passed there a quarter of an hour before and the door was securely fastened—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

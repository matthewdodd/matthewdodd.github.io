            . I am a patrol of Bow Street, I met Mr. Powell, the assistant solicitor to the mint, at Salisbury, he delivered me these ten guineas, Mr. Powell marked them in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. After you got these guineas of Mr. Powell, and received directions of him, what did you do. - A. I went to the Devisees.</p>
               <p>Q. You went in the mail coach as far as Newbury. - A. I did. At Marlborough I paid for two glasses of brandy, one for the coachman who drove me, and one for me, I pulled out a pound note, and there the other saw the guineas, my hands were cold when I pulled out my bag, I could do no other, and there the coachman saw the guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. At Newbery, there you changed the coachman that drove the mail. - A. We did so.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen him before you got to Newbury - A. No, he drove to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he and the former coachman in conversation. - A. Not as I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you pulled the guineas out after you came in company with the defendant at Newbury. - A. I pulled the bag out to pay for something for the coachman, there the defendant saw the guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew him them afterwards. - A. I believe not until I came near Maidenhead. At Maidenhead he told me I had better give my money to the guard, that was a great place for thieving, the Gloucester Mail had been fired at, and one ball had entered the side; soon after this conversation, passed about four miles, we talked again about the guineas. He told me that they used to be sold at twenty-seven and twenty-eight shillings, they did not go for so much now. I expressed a surprise that guineas should rise and fall, I had never heard any thing about it, he told me it was according to the risk they run in leaving the kingdom, that there had been a number seized. I before this, told him that I was going to Gerrad's Hall Inn, Baising-lane, that I had never been in London before, but my brother had come to London to meet me in a one horse cart. The subject was mentioned two or three times after that, but not so particularly; when I got to Piccadilly at the Gloucester coffee-house, I got down to have something to drink, he told me I had better go with him as I was going to Gerrad's Hall Inn, he was going great part of the way; I went on the coach again afterwards to the city, he then said as I did not know London we had better go together. As we was going along we went down St. James's Street and along Pall Mall, we came by a goldsmith's shop, I asked him if it was at this shop they bought guineas, he told me no, did I want to part with them, I told him if they gave as much as had been stated by the other coachman, I had no objection three and twenty shillings and sixpence he said, no, he would give me twenty-two shillings and sixpence, and as I was going to Gerrard's Hall Inn it would be nothing out of my way to go with him to the Swan and Two Necks, upon which I went with him to the Swan and Two Necks, I got off the box first, he told me to go into the parlour while he unhitched his horses, and he would come in directly, upon that I contrived to go out of the yard and brought an officer, the officer waited in a proper place. When I came back the prisoner was looking after me, he told me if I would go into the room he would be with me immediately, he asked me where I had been, I told him to have a run, I was so cold, I went into the room, called for a pint of porter, drank part of it, he went out in the yard and returned with the nine one-pound notes, the officer has the notes, I gave them to Chamberlain the officer, I gave the defendant eight guineas for the nine one-pound notes after he gave me the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these part of the guineas that were mark'd by Mr. Powell. - A. The same guineas, then Chamberlain took him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in the coach with the prisoner. - A. I did, to the Compter, he said he thought me a friend, he did not think I would have served him so, I told him it was my duty, I was sent upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You went and left him in the yard, you gave him no change. - A. There was no change agreed upon.</p>
               <p>Q. So you tell us you did not mean to give any, you took your guineas and shook them for him to see them. - A. My hands was cold, I could not help it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you untend that he should see your guineas. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Then you need not put upon me that your hands was cold. So you set out as a country farmer, with a silk handkerchief round your neck. - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150077"></xptr>The same as I have on now.</p>

            . I am an officer of the city of London. On the 19th of September, about nine in the morning, Ruthwin desired me to go along with him; I went in a coach and waited at the corner of Lad-lane, he beckoned me and then I went to wait at the corner of the Swan and Two Necks gateway; I waited there a few minutes, Ruthwin came out of the office and said, here he is in the back office. He told me then it was for buying guineas; he desired me to take him in custody, he was my prisoner. I took him into custody and took him in a coach to the compter; Ruthwin went with me. Previous to the defendant's going in the coach Ruthwin said, I give you charge of this man for buying guineas, the defendant turned as pale as ashes and said, I thought you were my friend, you have taken me in, it is the first time I ever did such a thing in my life, and expressed a wish that it might be settled. I did not actually search him; he put his hand into his pocket at the Poultry Compter, and delivered to me eight guineas, I have had them ever since, and Ruthwin, in the presence of the prisoner gave me these nine pound notes; the prisoner acknowledged having paid the notes to Ruthwin. The defendant said he thought it very hard that he should be imposed upon in that way; Ruthwin said it was his duty, he was sent by the magistrate, and the solicitor of the Mint; he could not help it, he must do his duty.</p>

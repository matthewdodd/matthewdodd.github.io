               <p>Q. When she came back did you see your box. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your box contain - A. Notes and guineas, a 30 l. note, I know it to be the same, it was in my box when it was brought back, it was locked; I opened it with my key afterwards, in the presence of the officer. It was a new note, one that I changed for a neighbour a fortnight before, I have no recollection of the number; the box contained nineteen crown-pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they dollars or crown-pieces, they are called dollars in the indictment - A. I am positive they were crown-pieces, and a ten pound note was in the box.</p>
               <p>Q. How many two pound notes - A. I cannot particularly say, there were 27 ones, and some curious small pieces of money; the contents of the box was, as I expected to find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now how long before it was taken away had you seen it - A. The day before she went away, about five o'clock, and I saw the box underneath the head of my bed, I put it there myself when I went to bed; in the morning I am positive I left it there. There was nobody in the room but me and my sister, I was the last in the room, the money and the notes were altogether in the box.</p>

Yes, I set off about five o'clock, I overtook her by Mr. Charrington's brewhouse, in Mile-end road, I asked her to go back again, because her mistress had suspicion that she had robbed her, she said she had not got nothing belonging to her mistress, nor I should not take her back; I took her by the shoulders to the officer's house, and charged the officer with her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see the box - A. As I went down the passage in the officers house, she threw down the bundle and told me to look over it; I bid her lift the things, she did, then I observed the box with J. P. upon it, for Mrs. Pamplins husbands name; I asked her how she came by it, she said she had bought it a fortnight; I then saw J. P. for John Pamplin; I knew it to be Mrs. Pamplin's box, I gave charge of her to the officer.</p>

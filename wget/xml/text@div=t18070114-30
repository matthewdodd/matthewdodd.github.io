On Monday the 15th of December, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I heard a noise at the front door of the shop, I was in the kitchen, I went to the door, I heard a lad coming in, I asked him what he wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any more lads than one. - A. There were two outside the door; only one came in, I asked him what he wanted, he answered a halfpennyworth of tape.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the shop, or only at the door. - A. He was only at the door, I went in the shop and served him with a halfpennyworth of tape.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the others. - A. The others were out of door all the time. I went into the kitchen, and I had not been there above five minutes before I heard the door go again, I went to the door, I saw one go from the door, I went into the shop, I perceived I had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see in your shop. - A. Nobody then. I looked into my till, I missed three one pound notes, a seven shilling piece, two half crowns, and some shillings and sixpences; how many of them I cannot say. I lost about three pounds sixteen, in notes and silver.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to your shop the second time did you see the boy who come in before. - A. No, I saw one go from the door, it appeared as if he had been in the house, because I saw his hand on the door, pulling it after him; he walked very quick away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other boy then. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face. - A. I saw the side of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see sufficient of it to know it again. - A. Yes, it was Marsden, he with the blue jacket on, the tall one.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the shop to serve the boy with the tape, did you take notice of the boy when you looked out, was the other prisoner the other boy. - A. Yes, he was leaning upon the chains before the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Marsden in the blue jacket at the time that you served the tape. - A. I did not see him at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this you got somebody to run<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140038"></xptr> after the boy. - A. Yes, and I saw them both before the magistrate about four o'clock; and there was some silver found upon each of them.</p>

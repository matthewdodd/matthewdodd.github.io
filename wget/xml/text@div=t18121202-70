On the 15th of October I had been dining at the White Horse, Fetter-lane, with some friends. I had at that time taken too much wine, I certainly was intoxicated. A coach was sent for to take me home. It was a quarter past eight, within a few minutes. I asked the waiter what o'clock it was; I took hold of my watch chain, but I did not take my watch out. My intoxication was so great that I fell a sleep in the coach. When I got to my house I perfectly came to myself; almost as soon as I came into the parlour I looked for my snuff-box, I then found it was gone. About an hour and a half afterwards, I was going to bed, I found my watch was gone. The instant I left the Inn I asked the landlord for change of a one pound note; I lost twelve shillings out of that. I had in my right hand breeches pocket a gold ring; I missed that the next morning. It was a gold ring with an amethyst; it was tied with some string, it being too large for me.</p>

            Have you any recollection of the prisoner Polock being the person who drove you home - A. I have not. The coach was drawn up to the gate of the Inn, in Fetter-lane. I walked through the passage with the landlord and the porter; I think I had hold of Mr. Richards' arm. The intoxication was not so much upon me as my sleep. I was in a stupor before I went into the coach. I remember asking the waiter what o'clock it was; he said, a quarter past eight, Sir. I took hold of my watch chain, I know, but I did not take it out. The landlord handed me to the coach, and the porter likewise; whether there were any other persons there, I do not recollect.</p>

            . I was a servant to Polock. On the 16th of October I was upon the box, going out with the coach, Polock went out on the box with me; he pulled out of his pocket a watch, a snuff-box, and a ring, whether it was gold or metal, I do not know; the box was white, like a silver box, the watch was yellow; and the ring yellow; I saw a bit of thread or tape tied round the ring. He said, I lived upon the squares; he said, he would live as he could.</p>

            . I live in Charles'-square, Hoxton. The coach stopped at my door, they knocked at my door. I was called upon by a gentleman, who lived in the neighbourhood, to accompany the gentleman in the coach; I went to the corner of the square; a light was brought from the adjoining house; I saw it was Mr. Sampson, who certainly appeared then indisposed. I desired the coachman to shut the coach door, get on his box, and follow me round the square, and I could direct him to the prosecutor's house. I knocked at the door to apprize Mrs. Sampson of his coming home, that he was unwell, and, I believe, the coach door was opened there. I said to the prisoner, you had better get in and assist the gentleman out of the coach. He said, he did not choose to do that, it was more proper for the friends or relations to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the coachman again - A. Yes, the prisoner is the coachman.</p>

About four weeks ago Kilby was a waterman at Moorgate; he told me then, the wooden legged boy had made another noise; I said, about what; he said, the old affair. I said, what is the matter now. He said, he has been using me very ill, and threatened to strike me. I said, what of that. He said, I am determined to have satisfaction of him, he would go to the justice to morrow, and have him taken up. I said, what for. He said, he promised me two pound for a watch that I have seen in his hands. I said, if you had been an honest man you would have gone to the justice before. He then said, the reason that he did not go, because he lived with him; but since he had not given him the money that he had promised, he was determined to go. I said, you may depend upon it the Justice will have you both in jail, for you are as bad as he is.</p>

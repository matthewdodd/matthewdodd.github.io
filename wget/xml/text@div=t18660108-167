At 8 o'clock in the evening of 18th December, I was at Mr. Wilson's, 8, Bunhill-row—he is a cap-blocker—I got from him six dozen of "tops" (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I waited in the shop about ten minutes—I met Wagner in Bunhill-row—I told him I was an officer, and should apprehend him for stealing twenty-seven yards of velvet—he said he knew nothing about it—I then took him into Mr. Wagner's shop, and he said he bought the velvet of a lad named Higgins—Higgins was given into my custody the same evening, charged with being concerned—at the station, and in the presence of Wagner, he said that they both went through the passage of the house in Jewin-street, that they got in at the window, and that Wagner helped himself to a box off a shelf in the shop, that they went into Aldersgate-street, and that Wagner there gave him sixpence for the velvet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Gustavus Wagner, of 2, Jewin-crescent, a cap-maker—Higgins was in our employ as errand-boy for about four months—Wagner was also in our employ, for eight or nine months—he left us about six weeks prior to the robbery—we missed the box of velvet on the 16th—the last time I saw it was on the Thursday previous—there were twenty-seven yards and three-quarters, worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this velvet cap (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is made of the same sort of velvet, and, as far as I know, it is my velvet.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> As far as you know, but you cannot pretend to swear to that velvet? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say, it looks to me very much like our velvet, because we always use the same quality and colour—we use thou<lb></lb>sands of yards of it—Wagner is no relation to us—while he was in our service, we always thought he was an honest young man—we discharged him because we did not want him—since he left us I believe he has been doing a little business on his own account—he has taken some caps to one of our hands to make.</p>

I am a cap-blocker, at 97, Bunhill-row, and work for Mr. Wagner—on Saturday afternoon, 16th December, between 2 and 3 o'clock, the prisoner Wagner called at my place—he asked me how many yards of velvet it took to make half a gross of caps—I told him—afterwards he came and said he wanted nine dozen, and he asked how much it would take, I told him fourteen yards and a quarter—the next time he came, he brought the fourteen yards and a quarter—he said some new party was going to start in the line, but he should not say who it was—my charge for blocking was 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and he paid half a crown as a deposit—I told him they would be ready between 4 and 5 on Monday—later on the Saturday evening he came again, and gave me the other 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he came with the policeman on Monday evening.</p>

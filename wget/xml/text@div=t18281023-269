               <p>Q. Were you personally in the habit of receiving bills of exchange from Dickson or the prisoner? A. From the prisoner only; we received them from him for the purpose of being discounted. On the 1st of August, I saw the prisoner at our banking-house, in Lombard-street, in the City - he brought various bills of exchange with him for the purpose of being discounted.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this bill (producing one) and state whether it was among the bills produced to you on the 1st of August by the prisoner? A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any question to the prisoner on the subject of that bill? A. I had generally a great deal of conversation with him respecting various bills which he offered for discount - I even hesitated to discount them at all, and I desired him to explain the nature of the various bills which he brought to me, as they were upon persons with whom I could have no acquaintance; he replied that they were bills drawn by his house on the various parties in the country, with whom they had transactions, and if houses in London refused to discount that paper, they could not carry on their business; I called his attention to this particular bill, it being among the rest - I asked him who Mountain was - he said he was a person in business, with whom his house had transactions.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had gone through the several bills produced to you, what did you do with them? A. I took them into our discount-office and placed them in a box, which is appropriated exclusively to receive paper of that description; these bills would in the regular course of business, be carried through the various books belonging to the establishment that day; they would be first entered in the discount-book by Mr. Brackett, our clerk; the entries would all be made on that day, the 1st of August - after being entered in the discount-book they would be entered in the bill-book by Mr. Clunie, who had that department on that day; the bills are then tied together, and delivered over to the clerk who has the care of the bills of the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you discount bills, do you give the money for them, or place it to the account of the person? A. It is placed to their account.</p>

            . In August last, I was a clerk in Messrs. Curtis' house - it was my duty to enter in the discount-book bills which were discounted every day; here is the discount book (producing it) - I have entered here on the 1st of August, a bill for 162l. 9s. drawn by John Dixon and Co. - the entry was made by myself on the 1st of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this bill, and tell us if you made the entry from that? A. I did - it is the same bill; after making the entry, I put the bills on the top of my desk, under a lead, and another clerk takes the same bills away to enter them in the bill-book; this entry in my book puts the bills to the credit of the party - here is the entry; this bill of 162l.9s. entered to the credit of John Dickson and Co., the house of which the prisoner is a partner; only the amount and the date when due are entered; it was due on the 27th of October, (yesterday) - I presented it for payment myself at Messrs.

            . I am clerk to Sir William Curtis and Co. On the 1st of August, I received from Mr. Brackett's desk some bills to be entered in the bill-book, in the regular course of business - the bill produced was one of them; I entered it in the bill-book - here is the entry -(reads); John Dickson and Co. - Mountain (the acceptor) 24 - 7. (the date) three months (being the date at which it is drawn) - 27 - 10 (the date when due) I have put D against it, which means discounted; this entry is all my hand-writing; it is my habit to write on the bill the letter and folio of the book it is entered in; and I have written on this bill D 588; I made the entry on the day the bills came into our possession.</p>
               <p>JOHN DICKSON. I was in partnership with the prisoner this year - our firm was John Dickson and Co.; Joseph Hunton attended to the drawing and discounting of bills.</p>

Not any that I am aware of - not in our ware house; the body of this bill is in the prisoners handwriting, and also the name of the person on whom it is drawn; I believe it to be so - I have often seen him write.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any customer that you knew of, of the name of Henry Mountain, of Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk? A. Not that I am aware of (looking at a letter, document No. 1) - I believe this to be Joseph Hunton's hand-writing, and this also - (No. 2.)</p>

            . I am a Police-officer of Portsmouth. On the 7th of October I went on board a vessel called the Leeds, which lay at St. Helens, bound for America, New York; Forrester, a City officer, and Mr. Garnet, Mr. Gates' clerk, accompanied me; I found the prisoner in the cabin; I had taken a letter from Portsmouth which I showed to him - I did not deliver it to him; I asked him if his name was not Wilkinson, for I had a letter for him - he said it was Wilkinson; I then told him I was a Police-officer, and arrested him on a charge of forgery - there were several papers lying before him - he was in the act of writing at the time I addressed him; five or six letters were before him; I said, "Are these your letters;" he said they were; I then said, "I must take them into my possession;" I took them, put them into my pocket, and afterwards marked them (looking at document No. 2) - this is one of them; he was taken into custody and taken on shore.</p>
               <p>The document No. 2 was here read, as follows:</p>
               <p>To the Editor of the Times.</p>
               <p>Sir, - The account published in your paper of last Saturday, relative to Joseph Hunton, being incorrect in almost every particular, I beg leave to send you this statement, which, be assured, is strictly accurate. It is not true, as stated, that he was seen in London by several persons, on Saturday, the 27th of September; he left London on Friday afternoon, about four o'clock, and has not been there since. It is not true that he has a family of twelve or thirteen children - he has but ten. It is not true that he resided chiefly in the country; he regularly came to town soon after nine o'clock in the morning, and generally returned about nine o'clock in the evening. It is not true that he has forged the names of several eminent mercantile houses in the city; there is not a single one of that description. It is not true that he has committed forgeries to the amount of 12,000l. or 14,000l. - the amount is about 5,000l., and these he has paid when due with interest, till, for want of discounts, he was no longer able to do so. The whole of his property, of every description, is left for the creditors, as, excepting a very small supply of clothing absolutely needful, and his passage, he did not take away to the amount of 5s., except what was very kindly advanced him by a relative, expressly that he may not be utterly destitute in a foreign country. It is true that he might have obtained goods on credit to a much larger amount, but this was not his object; he was under engagement to supply the capital for his concerns, and being very much disappointed in the quarter from whence he depended for a supply, he had unfortunate recourse to this ruinous measure. He is a very melancholy instance of the mutability of wealth. Several years since, he was retiring from business, with an ample fortune, but unfortunately investing a considerable part of his property in the foreign funds, he lost to a very great amount, and the more he struggled to extricate himself the more he lost; and the greater his difficulties increased. Those who are acquainted with him know that his habits and personal expenditure were on the most moderate scale, and were it not for the law expences and destruction of property attendant on a Commission of Bankruptcy, there will be sufficient to pay the whole of his creditors in full. It is not intended to apologise for his late practices, but a desire that his fate may be a warning to others to avoid them, and not to engage in any concern of which they do not foresee the consequence; he expected to have been able very shortly to pay these acceptances out of the regular proceeds of his concerns, this disappointment has brought on himself, and on a most amiable family, irretrievable ruin and disgrace.</p>
               <p>The bill was then read, as sent out in the indictment.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his Defence, read as follows:</p>
               <p>My Lord, I beg permission to state respectfully to the Court, that I am wholly unprepared to take my trial now; I lately applied to the Court for the postponement of my trial untill the next Session, upon grounds which I then thought, and still venture to think, were, with reference to the justice of the case, sufficient to warrant that application: your Lordship was pleased to think that I had not established legal grounds for the postponement required, looking at the case merely in a technical point of view - of the impartiality of your Lordship's judgment I am fully satisfied - of its correctness as a mere dicision of law I entertain no doubt; but I can as little doubt, that if my prosecutors had consented to the application, the Court would have granted it; they, however, with an impetuosity of proceeding for which I can assign no adequate motive, arising from the mere consideration of public good, opposed the application: how public justice can be advanced by my being tried now, when I have not any means whatever of defence, instead of being tried at the next Session, when, by the inspection of my papers and books, I shall be better prepared for so awful a trial, I cannot see. I have only to say that, stripped as I am of all means of defence, by being denied access to my papers (which my assignees have promised to afford me, if the trial be postponed), I shall not do either myself or my counsel the injustice of attempting a defence, which must, of necessity, from the circum<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230110"></xptr>stances in which I am placed, be imperfect and illusory; I shall, therefore, attempt no defence, under such circumstances, I shall not trouble my counsel to make an useless interference; I shall cross-examine no witness, nor at all interfere in the trial, which my prosecutors may have all their own way, and conduct it as they may think fit; I can submit to become their victim, but I cannot submit to exhibit the appearance of defence, while they exclude me from the means of rendering it effectual. The prisoner then added, "I make no remarks on the extraordinary conduct of my prosecutors, in taking papers from my private desk, during my absence; they have deprived me of several of them which are material to my defence. I would further remark that several of them were not finished, nor were they intended to be sent to any body, but merely written for my own amusement, and would probably, in a few minutes, have been destroyed."</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. Would you wish to call any witnesses? Prisoner. No, I adhere to my determination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you wish to call witnesses to character? A. I beg leave respectfully to state that I adhere to my former determination.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Wellington-street, St. Luke's. On Monday morning, the 12th of December, about four o'clock, Cleaver gave me information; I went in search of some persons - I found the door of Mrs. Cale's stable open; I met a man at the door, and as I went in, another man came out - they both said they belonged to the place; the first man started off - I believe that was Dolphin. I collared the other man, and gave him to Yoxall; I believe that man was the prisoner; I found three more men in the stable; they escaped, leaving five sets of harness there.</p>

            . The stable in question belongs to me - I let it to the prisoner and Crook; he kept a pony there; they had it about four months; Crook continued to keep his horse there for four or five weeks after; I gave them the key on Sunday night, as they said they were going to market early. I went to bed at ten o'clock, and was awoke about four; I heard the cart come into the stable, and heard persons talking - I had heard the cart drive out at night, and in the morning, when the alarm was given, Shays came out of the gate with a lantern, and an old man(who has been tried) came out with him - Shays asked me what was the matter; I said that was best known to himself; he said, "Did not I take this shed of you?" the watchman came round, and Shays ran off, with the lantern in his hand. My son is in the country - he was at Watford when the other men were tried.</p>
               <p>An accomplice, named Alderton, who was admitted as evidence on the part of the Crown, was not in attendance. Several other witnesses, on being called, simply stated they could give no evidence as to the prisoner being concerned in this offence.</p>

            . I am a servant at the gas-works. - On Sunday, the 11th of September, the prisoner applied to me, and said he wanted to move a few things early in the morning, for a young man he was acquainted with, and asked me to lend him my pony and cart, which we had formerly bought together, but it was then mine - I lent it him; the cart was kept in Europa-place, and the pony in this stable; I gave him the key of the stable, and Mrs. Cale gave me the key of the outer gate - he was dressed in blue trousers, a black waistcoat, and a green coat - he lived in the same house as me, and did not come home till four or five o'clock that morning; he slept with me.</p>

On Monday morning, the 12th of December, I found my stables had been robbed - they join my dwelling-house, and open into the same yard, which is shut and locked up at night; a door leads from my house into the yard; nobody but my family have access to the yard. I missed this property from the harness-room at five o'clock - the room was not locked, but the gates were. I afterwards found the harness at Worship-street  - it was given to me; I have not got it here - it is the same I lost that night, and worth 16l.</p>

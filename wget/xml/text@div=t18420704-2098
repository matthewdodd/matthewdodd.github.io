                  </hi>. I am carman to Mr. Keeble, and live in Hind-mews, Manchester-square. I sleep in a room over the stable—last Saturday night, about a quarter before nine o'clock, I left my room locked, and went out, leaving these articles in the room—I fastened the stable-door inside, and went out at the coach-house—I went back about a quarter to eleven</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Saturday night, the 2nd of July, I was in Hind mews—the prosecutor called roe—I went up stairs into the loft with him, and found the bed-room door broken open and the staple drawn—I found his clothes box broken open, and the clasp wrenched—I found the prisoners in the loft concealed under the hay, and secured them—I bad to move five or six trusses to find them—I caught hold of Walker—he said, "I will go quietly"—Grove then came out, and said, "I have only come here to sleep"—I took them to the station, returned to the stable, and found the waistcoat lying at the horses' heels—Whale picked up the handkerchief in my presence—I searched them both, but found nothing more.</p>

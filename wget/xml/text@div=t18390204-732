I live in Little Mary-le-bone-street, and am a groom out of place—I was at the Plasterer's Arms, in Mary-le-bone-street, on the 16th of January—I left my watch in the privy there, by mistake—I went to get it, and heard something about the prisoner—I went to him in a public-house in Beaumont Mews, and asked if he had seen any thing of my watch—he said no, he had not—I told him where I had left it, and said I thought he must be the man that had got it—this is my watch—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

I live at Mr. Walter's, a pawnbroker in High-street, Mary-le-bone—this watch was pawned by the prisoner on the 16th <hi rend="italic">of</hi> January between six and seven o'clock, as near as I can say—he wanted 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I lent him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said it was his own—he gave his address John Harris, 23, Lisson-street.</p>

I took the prisoner—Clempson said, "I think you are the man that has got my watch"—the prisoner said, "I have not had your watch, nor seen it"—I told the prisoner next day, that I had found it, and he must go with me to the pawnbroker—he was very willing to do that—the pawnbroker said he was the man—the prisoner said he was a liar, and he had never been in the shop—I took him back, and then he said he had pawned it.</p>

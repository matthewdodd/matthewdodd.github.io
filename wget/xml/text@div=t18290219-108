            . I am a broker, and live on Saffron-hill. I bought these shutters, on the 27th of January, of the prisoner; I asked him how he came by them; he said his father was a dealer in marine-stores - he had these by him, and wanted to dispose of them, as he was in want of money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. A <rs id="t18290219-108-viclabel608" type="occupation">dealer in building materials</rs>

               <p>COURT. Q. The shutters were sold to you on the 27th? A. Yes, for 2s.; I had bought three small shutters of him the day before - I did not ask him then what his father was; we bought nineteen shutters in all of him - my brother bought the others; on the 3d of February he brought five more shutters, and I took him.</p>

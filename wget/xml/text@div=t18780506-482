I am a money lender, of 59, Bassett Street, Haverstock Bill—just previous to the 14th August a woman came to me—I after<lb></lb>wards went to 47, Carlton Street, Kentish Town, and there saw some furniture and rent receipts—I saw the same woman there—the furniture corresponded with the inventory which I afterwards saw—at 6 o'clock that evening the woman came to my place with the prisoner—she said "I have brought my husband, Mr. Okey"—I said "Are you Mr. Henry Lewis?"—he said "I am; I have just left my workshop at Hampstead"—I said "How much money do you require?"—he said "15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Mrs. Lewis said "I should like 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I want to go to Meeting's to procure silk with, in my husband's business as an upholsterer and French polisher"—she gave me this inventory, saying, "I have made out a correct inven<lb></lb>tory as far as lay in my power"—I asked the prisoner if it was so—he said "Yes"—I asked him to sign it and he did so—this is his signature—he also signed this bill of sale and this declaration, stating that he had full power to assign the property at 47, Carlton Street, and that his lia<lb></lb>bilities did not exceed 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in full—I believed him to be the owner of the property, or I should not have parted with the money—I gave him the money, and he handed it to the woman—on 20th November the prisoner came to me again with Henry Horne—Horne said "I have brought Mr. Lewis to be surety for</p>

"—when I parted with that money I believed that he was Henry Lewis, of 47, Carlton Street—on 21st January, 1878, he came again with Mrs. Slous and signed this promissory note.

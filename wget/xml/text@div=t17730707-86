I went on the 22d of June to see Mrs. Lake; soon after I was there, the prisoner came in; they went up stairs to see some girls that were come in and to make sun; they soon returned and had some conversation in the gallery; upon my asking who that person was she told me it was a person that came to be bail, that they had had some conversation about being bail; and that the prisoner said he would be bail for her, and would get another person to join with him in that bail; they were reading a bond together; I know it was a bond, because it was for an annuity of 60 l. a year as she was talking, he was folding it up and going to put it in his pocket; I said, Lord, madam, are not you capable of keeping your bond yourself? she said yes; and took and put it in her pocket. The prisoner afterwards appointed her to meet him at the Swan in Walbrook; I went there and the prisoner came to me; I staid till ten o'clock, and was a good deal uneasy that Mrs. Lake did not come; the prisoner went out as if he was going to the Compter and then I went away.</p>

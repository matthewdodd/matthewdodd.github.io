            . I am an officer of the Postoffice. On the 8th of August I was at a pawnbroker's in Aldersgate-street - the prisoner came in, and offered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060042"></xptr>a pocket-glass in pledge for 1s.; I asked where he got it - he said his father, who made them, sent him to pawn it, and that he lived in White's-alley, Coleman-street - I said I would go there with him; when we got out he said he had not received it from his father - that his father Was dead, but his sister gave it to him, and he had had it some time; I asked if his mother knew of it - he said Yes; he gave his right address - I asked the mother, in his presence; she said she recollected his sister giving him much such another glass - I searched, and found in his pocket this glass-bottle, covered with leather; he said he had that to carry water in when he went out - I then found this sportsman's knife and a rule- I asked where he worked: he said at Mr. Seabrook's, and afterwards admitted that they were his articles(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Q. She had not asked you the price of these goods? - A. No, nothing.</p>

               <p>Meredith. I believe this to be Mr. Jones's property; it has no mark upon it, but it corresponds with another piece that I have got.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it correspond with the quantity that you lost? - A. No; there is another piece at a pawnbroker's in Whitechapel, Burton, and Co.'s.</p>
               <p>Q. It is such as may be bought in any linen-draper's shop in London? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Lambeth-street: I went with Smith, a brother officer, to the prisoner's lodgings; she said she was very much distressed, and had taken a little fustian, but she hoped he would forgive her, and she would pay Mr. Jones for it; I asked her what she had done with it; and she said she had pawned part of it in Red-lion-street, Whitechapel; I had these duplicates from her.

               <p>Prisoner's defence. It was none of Mr. Jones's property; I was very much frightened, for the officer used me very ill, and said he would take me and my, daughter; it belonged to a young man that was pressed, and gone to sea; I told him I had two tickets, but I did not tell him they were Mr. Jones's property, for it never was.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

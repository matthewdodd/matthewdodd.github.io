               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. It is not the first time he has taken me to his chambers—he never gave me any thing, but always sent me home—I never received six-pence from him, and this was the third time—he came down to the gate with me. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. She was never at my chambers before nor since—I am not aware that I ever saw her before that night—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she de<lb></lb>sired me to see her down in case any questions, should be asked her, and I saw her to the bottom of the stairs, but I did not wish to go to the gate with her to be seen by the watchman—I brought her home about half-past ten o'clock.</p>

I did not know where she lived, she did not tell me—I did not know her name—I went to the watchmaker the following day, and got a description of the watch—I gave information to two police-officers, and next day it was discovered-a policeman called and took me to see it, and I identified it—I was not aware that she had it at all—it had been in my bed-room, where we had been together.</p>

She never said any thing about the watch—she expressed herself contented with what I gave her—there was a profession of comparative disinterestedness on her part.</p>

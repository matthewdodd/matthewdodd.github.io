             (police-constable N 79). I was on duty near the school about four o'clock in the morning of the 17th of May - I heard some person walking as it appeared without shoes - I peeped in, but could see no one - I called the master - he opened the door - I saw the things very much displaced - it appeared, that whoever had been there, had escaped by the back window - I went into George's-square, which is at the back of the school, and found the prisoner lying down behind a door in a garden - I took him, and asked what he wanted in the school - he said he was one of the scholars, and had stopped in all night - I found 4s. 2Â½d. on him, and this pincushion.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner on the top of my wash-house - I asked what he did there - he said he was a scholar at Mr. Robert's school - that he had been kept back at night, and slept in the school-room, and if I would let him through, he would be obliged to me - he said he belonged to Mr. Stone, who is a neighbour of mine, and a respectable man - I let him through, and he was taken by the policeman.</p>

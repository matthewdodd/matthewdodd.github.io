               <p>Q. Had you been drinking - A. No. I had not been in the gardens above a quarter of an hour. Cheeseman and Jefferies were making water there. The place being small I stopped to let them come out. When Jefferies past me I was undoing my breeches. He was close to me; and I suppose I lost my watch then. Before I went into this place I was confident I had my watch in my pocket. I had it out a quarter of an hour before I went into this place. Jefferies passed me close. I never felt my watch go at all. When Cheeseman passed me I was buttoning up my small clothes again. Cheeseman and Jefferies were in company together. After he passed me going out of the place he was detected with the watch in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see that - A. No. The watch is in court. I never missed the watch until I was apprized of it.</p>

            . I am a fireman, of the Sun-fire office. I was in Bagnigge Wells on this Sunday evening. I was going in a small place to make water, and as I was going in I saw Cheeseman with a watch in his hand, with a red ribbon to it: he was holden it up, as if to shew Jefferies. He said it is all right; and held it towards Jefferies. He was in company with Jefferies. On my seeing a watch in his hand, and a watch in his pocket, I had suspicion. I went into this place. I saw Martin. I said to him, have you lost a watch with a red ribbon to it; if he had, I should know the people if he would come with me. I immediately ran out of Bagnigge Wells. I turned towards Gray's Inn Lane. I overtook the prisoner. I took hold of Cheeseman's coller. I said, where is the watch. He said, what watch. I took the watch out of his hand, and gave it to the constable. When we came to the watchhouse, Jefferies said, that Cheeseman came honestly by the watch, and he could prove it. Martin after that said, I will prove the contrary, here is my name at the back of the watch. He turned the watch up, there was E. M. for

               <p>Cheeseman's Defence. I am placed here to answer a charge for which I call God to witness my innocence. I am a native of Hull, in Yorkshire, and after serving my apprenticeship to my master's satisfaction I came up to London, in hopes of improvement.

             was not suspected until he was seen following me to the watchhouse. He was not charged, nor even accused. And I call God to witness, I picked the watch off the ground and went through the gardens with the watch in my hand, to see if any body would own it. If not, I intended by the advice of Jefferies to advertize it. Jefferies would not have been taken in custody had not he stood up and said I was an honest man. I firmly hope for your acquittal that I may return to honest industry.</p>
               <p>Jefferie's Defence. I became acquainted with William Cheeseman at Hull in Yorkshire, at which place<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160009"></xptr> his character stood honourable for honesty and industry. On this Sunday he called upon me at my lodgings, and having heard of Bagnigge Wells, we took a walk there; and after walking two or three times round the garden we agreed to return home. We went to the place called the water-closet. Cheeseman stooped down and observed to me, that he was very fortunate, he had found a watch. We agreed to advertize. We walked through the gardens. Cheeseman held the watch up in his left hand. On our return out the prosecutor and witness both collared Cheese-man. When Pile took the watch out of his hand, and having maltreated him, I told them they were mistaken as to his being a thief, he had found it in the gardens. When they took him to the watch-house, Cheeseman desired me to come into the watchhouse, from a conviction of his innocence. I consented; they never accused me of being concerned with him.</p>
               <p>Cheeseman called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jefferies called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

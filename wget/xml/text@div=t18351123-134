On the 17th of November I was in his public auction-room—I heard a scuffle outside, and went to the door—the prisoner was brought in and charged with stealing—on his undoing his great-coat, I saw this coat which had been taken from the auction-room, on his back—he had it on under his great-coat—I had received this coat from Mr. Grant, of London-wall—It was under my master's care to sell—I had seen it safe the day before—It had not been sold—I did not say any thing to the prisoner, but he took the caot off—I took it from him, and he was give into custody.</p>

               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Thwaites. The prisoner came into my master's shop, on the first of August, under a pretence of buying a bit of cloth. She took hold of this and asked the price of it? I told her it was fourteen pence a yard. I suspected her. She took hold of another piece, and laid it over this, and then pulled this from under it, and let it fall on the floor; she desired me to cut her off two yards and an half of the other piece, which she paid me for, I put it in paper and delivered it to her; as soon as she received it, she let it drop on the floor where the other lay, and then took them both up together and put them into her apron and went out; I followed her outside of the door, brought her back, and took it out of her apron; it was loose in her apron.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went into the shop to buy two yards and an half of cloth. I changed an half guinea and paid for it; when I came out the gentleman stopped me and said I had got more than I had paid for. I did not know of it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There were some people attended, who said she had a good character, and they believed it was the first offence. I believe she was in liquor at the time.</p>

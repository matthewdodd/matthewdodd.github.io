                  </hi>. I am an iron-founder of 12, St. Mary's-square, Lambeth. On Saturday night, 8th November, about 12 o'clock, I was in the Kennington-road, near the Stag public-house—three men came behind me, struck me under the right ear, and knocked me senseless—they caught hold of my arms, kicked me behind, pulled me backwards, and tried to rob me—I recovered, <hi rend="italic">sang</hi> out "Police!" and they ran away—they tried to get my watch when I was on the ground, but I got it in my left hand—I was stunned by the blow for the moment—I was not long on the ground—I ran after one of them, the prisoner, for seventy or eighty yards, keeping my attention fixed upon him; and there were lights—he went into the police<lb></lb>man's hands, and I gave him in charge—the prisoner was coming towards me, from the Stag, and I was going towards the Stag—the prisoner was walking when the prisoner took him—I lost sight of the others—I can feel the kicks now.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you been drinking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I had been with some friends and relations in Stamford-street—I had had, perhaps, a pint of beer, the part of two or two or three pints—I had walked from Stamford-street to Kennington-road—the three men ran off at the same time when I cried "Police," but not in the same direction; two of them turned down a dark street to the right, and I followed the other ahead, towards the Stag—they had all three got away before I got up, but I could see them as I got up—I had recovered my senses then; and as I got up I saw them running away—they had then got about the length of this Court from me—I only saw the others turn the corner of the dark street—the prisoner had got seventy or eighty yards from me, but I could see him by the gas-light—he was about forty or fifty yards from me when I got up by the first lamp-post—I followed that man—he was very near the Stag—there was a coffee-stand by the Stag, and there were several people round.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, L</hi> 74). At half-past 12 o'clock on the Satur<lb></lb>day night I met the prisoner in the Kennington-road, running from London—he was between the Stag and the Female Orphan Asylum, the wall of which is 150 or 200 yards long—as soon as he saw me he stopped, and the prosecutor, who was close behind him, was up instantly, and said, "I give this man in charge for knocking me down with two more"—the prisoner said that it was not him that did it, and he would be d—d if he would go with me—he tried to take his coat off to get away, but I prevented him, and took him to the station—I apprehended him about four yards from the Stag—there is a little dark street close to the Stag, and near the Orphan Asylum—it was rather dark down the street, but there was a lamp at the corner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are there several streets turning off there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; only one between the Asylum wall and the Stag; that is about twenty yards from the Stag—I was twenty or thirty yards from the Stag when I saw him first—the prosecutor got up instantly—as I got to the prisoner I saw them both together—it was only a moment from the time I saw the prisoner till I took him—he stopped three or four yards from the Stag—I did not see anybody else by, only the people round the Stag—I did not go down the dark street—the people there did not call out something.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read as follows:</hi>—"I got up to the Stag, and the prosecutor called, "Police!" I was not running, I was walking. He said, 'Take him, Several gentlemen then said that I was not the man."</p>

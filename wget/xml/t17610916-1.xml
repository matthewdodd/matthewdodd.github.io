               <p>Q. Did you ever find them again?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I found the gown in Hannah Dawson's shop, she keeps a cloaths-shop in Johnson's-Change, I never saw the other things since.</p>

            . I lodge in the prosecutor's-house, Mrs. Bradley called up to me, and said, she believed she had lost all her things. I came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176109160003"></xptr> down, and we went into Rosemary-lane, to see if we could find them. We could not find any thing of them. The next day I went again, and found the gown hanging up at Mrs. Dawson's. I knew it well, and asked her the price of it; she said fifteen shillings. Then I went and told Mrs. Bradley. We went there the next day, and Mrs. Dawson said it was gone. Then we got a warrant, and searched the house, and found she had carried it upon another person's premises. Then she said, the reason she did it was, she saw me lift up my hands when I saw the gown, upon which she suspected it was stolen.</p>

            . I bought this gown of a man and woman that came to my shop to ether; the man said it was his wife's gown, and she lay in, and it had been in pawn, and the pawnbroker had advertised to sell off in fourteen days.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner at the bar the woman that came to you with the man</p>
               <p>H. Dawson. She is, she said the man was her brother they both told the same story.</p>

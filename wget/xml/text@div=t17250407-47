She said it was hard if she could not speak to a Friend. About Ten o'Clock, she persuaded me to go to Bed, for she said the Child would be frightned to lie alone; and for her part, she intended to set up all Night and wash. So about 11 o'Clock, I fastned all, the Doors and went to Bed, leaving the three Prisoners, 2 young Son of my Master's and my Daughter, (Whose Name is likewise Mary Stevens) all together.</p>

Oh! says she, as soon as she saw me. I deserve to be hang'd, for wronging such a Master. Several of the Goods were found upon 'em.

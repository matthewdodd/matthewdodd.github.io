                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Sumner, of Arlington-street, Clerkenwell. Last Tuesday week, I was leaning over our shop front, about half-past seven o'clock, and saw the prisoner jump up, and take a cap off Mr. Du Perey's shop door—he was hardly high enough to reach it, and jumped up and took it—he ran up the passage alongside of our house with it—I ran after him, calling "Stop thief," and tried to stop him—he was not out of my sight at all—there was a little corner, but I could see him—some gentleman stopped him—I came up immediately and be dropped the cap at his feet—I saw him drop it from his hand—I picked it up, and took it into Mr. Du Perey's shop—we put the prisoner into the shop, and I went and got a policeman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was out of his sight—I picked up the cap—I never took it at all—another boy took it, and I called "Stop thief," and ran after him—I took it up when he threw it down, and gave it to the witness—there were about two dozen running. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He was not out of my sight, to my recollectio n—I could see him all the while till the gentleman stopped him—I am sure I saw him take the cap—he did not call "Stop thief,"—nobody ran after him but me—there were not two dozen running—there were some at the top of the court when we got there.</p>

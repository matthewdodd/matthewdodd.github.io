               <p>Street—on 30th November, about 3.30, I went to the White Lion, Fetter Lane, and sat down on a chair in the parlour, about twelve gentle<lb></lb>men being there—the prisoner came in at about 4.15—he shook hands with two gentlemen in the room, and seated himself in a vacant chair next me, but said nothing—I was conversing with a gentleman on my left—we were examining that day's <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi>—the prisoner had been seated three or four minutes when the waiter came into the room—one gentleman ordered some grog, and I heard him order some tobacco—as the waiter left the room the prisoner rose from his chair, took his hand from his greatcoat pocket, raised it, and without my having the slightest warning stabbed me with a knife on the left eye-lid—I leant on my left to get out of his way, but it was difficult, as there was a gentleman near me—I received a second blow on the top of my head, and a third was aimed at me, but stopped by Mr. Ransom—I had said nothing to him; I had not seen him for six months—I had seen him five or six times in the same room during two years and a quarter—he has passed the compliments of the day, but he was an utter stranger—nothing unpleasant ever took place between us—I have no personal knowledge of him at all—I do not believe he even knew my name, and can form no idea, why he did this—I lost a quantity of blood and was taken to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a publisher of 10, Red Lion Court, Fleet Street—I was in the White Lion parlour—the prisoner came in and shook hands with me—I have been acquainted with him some years—he sat down beside me and ordered some tobacco—I was talking to him, and the prosecutor was talking to somebody on his left—I saw the prisoner jump up in a moment and strike the prosecutor twice—I caught his arm when he was in the act of striking a third tune—there had not been the slightest provocation—his conduct seemed very strange—he cut my finger nearly to the bone in trying to get the knife—I said, "Why have you done this, Beddall? It is a frightful affair"—he said, "I intended to kill that man; I intend to do it; he is Pizarro."</p>

I took the prisoner, told him the charge, and said, "What is the matter? what is this all about?"—he rose from his seat and said, "Yes, it is perfectly right," and gave me this knife—I said that I should have to take him to the station, and asked him if he could assign any reason, but he never replied—he told the inspector that he bought the knife at Mr. Sharp's in Gough Square—he appeared cool and calm, but very much bewildered in his mind—he said nothing but what I have repeated, but he seemed like a man waking up from a sleep, and looking at something from a distance—he was sober, I believe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the surgeon of Newgate—the prisoner has been there from 21st November—I have examined him nearly daily, and it is my belief that his mind is not sound—he believes persons are following him, and that he sees visions and hears persons conversing—his manner exhibited great suspicion and distrust; he frequently would not answer questions I put to him, and would retire from me until he got to the extreme end of the cell—I have no doubt that that was genuine and not put on.</p>

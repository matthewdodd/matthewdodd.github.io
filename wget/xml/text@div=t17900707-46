            's when the prisoner robbed me; I was one of the poor: Mr. Overton farms the poor; and I lived at his house. On the 9th of June, I was sitting by the bedside; I had just put three guineas and a half into a brown paper, in a box in my pocket; and the prisoner saw me; the prisoner was also one of the poor: Mr. Overton farms several parishes: the prisoner did not belong to the same parish; there was my bed in the room; and the prisoner sat down on the bed, and took me into her lap; I felt something in my pocket; and I put in my hand, and the prisoner's hand was there; and I missed my box directly; and I called out that she had taken my three guineas and a half, box and all; and then the prisoner thumped me on my ribs: I had a new cotton gown on the bed; and the prisoner swore bitterly that she would take that as well as the rest: the prisoner spit upon me, and called me a bitch. The constable has one tin box and one wooden box that the prisoner took out of my pocket at the same time: she took the cotton gown off the bed before my face; she said she would take it; she kept it in defiance; she did not go away; she remained in the house: the prisoner was not employed by Mr. Overton at all; she lodged in the same room with me; she kept the gown in her own custody, and dared me to touch it.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to be in possession of three guineas and a half? - I had been at Goldsmith's Hall: I am a <rs id="t17900707-46-viclabel223" type="occupation">settled widow</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17900707-46-victim421 t17900707-46-viclabel223"></join>: the parish gives me no clothes: this money supplies me with clothes.</p>
               <p>How long had you received this money, before the woman took it from you? - I believe, a day or two, not longer.</p>
               <p>Were there any other people that lodged in the same room, besides you? - Yes, a good many; seven or eight, or more.</p>
               <p>Were any of them in the room at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask them to help you? - No, Sir; she laid me down in her lap, and took my property; and then she pushed the candle out; it was the 28th of June: I go to bed between seven and eight: I am sure it was candle-light; for she pushed the candle out of my hand; and I screamed out at the instant; and I said, she has got my tin box and my money; she beat me on the hips; so I let it alone; I had no stays on; and she is a great powerful woman.</p>
               <p>So they did not help you at all? - No, Sir; they were afraid of her, she is such a masculine strong woman; I borrowed the tin box of the prisoner; and she knew what money I had.</p>
               <p>After she took this money from you, and the gown, did you tell any body else? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you went to bed, I suppose, and fell asleep? - I could not sleep.</p>
               <p>Did you tell any body the next day? - I did nothing but hear the prisoner abuse me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070036"></xptr>What did she abuse you for? - Because I said she had robbed me.</p>
               <p>When was she taken up? - I cannot say: I wanted some satisfaction for my money: the prisoner always denied that she had it: with the assistance of my friends, who assisted me with money, I did send for a constable; she used me with the best of manners, till she got the money: we lived in the same room four or five weeks.</p>
               <p>Did you tell Mr. Overton about it? - Yes, the same week; and he said he could not help it: I ought to take more care.</p>
               <p>Did she ever wear this cotton gown? - No.</p>
               <p>Where was it? - In her custody in the house; and the constable took it out of 
her apartment.</p>
               <p>Did you ever get your money again? - No, not a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Court. Now you are a great age; you will recollect you are upon your oath: have you ever heard of a reward to people who convict persons of a highway robbery? - No, not I; I am as ignorant of these affairs, as a child unborn; I never was in such an affair before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I received three guineas of a gentleman that came out of the country, three weeks before she came into my room.</p>

               <p>I believe it was the 9th or 10th of June, that this woman came up with another woman for a warrant, to the Rotation-office; and I went to execute the warrant there; I saw the prisoner, Mrs. Fell, in the room; being conducted to the room by some of the folks that belonged to the work-house, I told her I had a warrant for her, for robbing the old lady; she said, she had not robbed her at all; says I, I must look in your box and pockets; I found nothing in her pockets; in her box I found this tin box, and this wooden box; she scratched hold of them at first, and put them into her pocket, and I made her take them out again; and in the tin box there was half a guinea in gold, and three shillings and six-pence in silver; I gave her the silver by order of the magistrate, when she was committed; and the half-guinea and the boxes, I produce to you; I asked her also where she had put the old gentlewoman's gown; and she said she had taken that for some money the old woman owed her; where is it, says I; she said, she should keep it; I asked her about the boxes? she said, they were her's, she had lent them to the old gentlewoman to put her money in them: I took her before the magistrate, and the old woman said she had borrowed the boxes: I had Mr. Overton up there, and Mr. Overton said, if they would not be honest they must be punished, he knew nothing about it at all.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Did you borrow both the boxes of her, or only one? - Both the boxes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever borrow any money of her, or owe her any money in your life? - I never borrowed any money of her; but the prisoner has paid for a penny-worth of beer for me.</p>
               <p>Who was in the room at the time? - I do not know their names.</p>

               <p>I am one of the poor that lodge in the same room with this Mrs. Keen, and Mrs. Fell; and on Friday, the 29th of May, she received her money at Goldsmiths-hall; on the 30th, which was Saturday night, she lost it in the room; I was in the room; Mrs. Keen was on the bed side, and Mrs. Fell was with her, and either she fell on the bed, or was pushed upon it; I cannot say which; but it was at that time the old woman cried out, and said she had lost something; and at that time the prisoner said, she hoped she had not lost her money: it was in the dusk of the evening: and Mrs. Fell, the prisoner, fetched a candle to help the old woman to search for the tin box; but the gold was not found; none that I saw; but the wooden box, with the silver, was in the prosecutrix's pocket; Mrs. Fell, the prisoner, took that box; she had laid out some money at different times, for beer and snuff, till this woman's money came due; and after she found she had lost her gold, she took this box, with the silver, and the gown, to pay herself.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose box the tin box<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070039"></xptr>was? - It was the prisoner's; but she lent it to the old woman, to put her gold in, and the other to put her silver in.</p>
               <p>At that time you say the old woman called out, she had lost her money? - She called out, oh Lord! I have lost something.</p>
               <p>Did she at that time charge Mrs. Fell with putting her hand in her pocket? - She did some time after.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Fell was there? - Yes; and Mrs. Fell said she had not got the box.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the poor, in the same room with Mrs. Keen: on the 28th of May Mrs. Keen went to Goldsmiths-hall and received some money: I know what her money is; she has ten pounds a year; and she received five pounds of it the 28th of May; Mrs. Fell went with her, and hired a coach, and paid for the coach going and coming back: on the Saturday, about one I believe it might be, Mrs. Keen went into Mr. Overton's laundery, and there she staid till I believe it might be eight at night; then she was led in by two; she is so very feeble; she sat down on the bed; but whether she fell down or was pushed down I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was she sat on the other woman's lap? - No; she was not: Mrs. Keen cried out, O Lord! O Lord! Mrs. Fell immediately went to her bed; and I said to Mrs. Keen, why do not you go to bed? she said she had lost something; she called for a candle; I said, we go to bed by daylight, we cannot afford candles; Mrs. Fell got a candle; Mrs. Fell would have Mrs. Overton to come and search us all that night; but Mrs. Overton said, she did not care whether she had lost her money or not; she should not come in to search us till the next morning: the candle was brought, and Mrs. Keen and her bed was searched; but nothing could be found only three shillings and six-pence in the box, and five-pence three farthings in halfpence, which Mrs. Fell took in part of what she owed her; and she took her gown in part of the pay, and hung it up on her bed; Mrs. Overton came the next morning, and searched her bed, and every place in the room, but no money could be found: there had not been a creature out of the house.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Overton search your persons? - Every thing in the world; and all our pockets: Mrs. Fell had lent Mrs. Keen a tin box to put her gold in.</p>
               <p>Was Mrs. Fell searched? - Every body was searched; and in that search the tin box could not be found.</p>
               <p>If Mrs. Fell had had tin box about her it must have been found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Fell went out you say to fetch the candle? - She was not gone many minutes; nobody else went out; she went out of the gate; but she was not gone a minute.</p>
               <p>Did the old woman or not say any thing at the time, when she cried out; about the prisoner taking any thing from her? - She said, she felt the prisoner's hand in her pocket; that was just after, or much about the same time.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On May twelve-month I received ten guineas of a gentleman; and Mr. Overton knows it; this last May of all I received three guineas, and I received a crown about three weeks before this old woman came into my room; she was always at me to bring her into my room; I said, we have nobody but honest people in our room, and when there is a vacancy I will bring you in; I got her in; I bought two tin boxes: I have always been in power in Mr. Overton's house: the old woman said she wanted some gin, and some tea, and sugar; I lent her some money; five shillings and a few halfpence: I took her to the hall in a coach: the prosecutrix received five guineas, and one shilling: when she got to the coach she abused me; and a gentleman came out and said you are an abusive woman, you will lose your money: the old woman went to the ale-house for an hour; and the woman came out, and said, for God's sake fetch the old woman home, she is so drunk, and the box is always out; they brought her in so tosticated; the ale-house maid brought in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070040"></xptr>liquor, and this old woman still kept calling for gin and strong beer; the old woman called in a boy to change her a guinea: she was some time before she got the guinea out of the tin box which I had lent her: we got her to bed: in the morning I said, Mrs. Keen, says I, I will not come nigh you, you are a sad woman; says she, give me some gin; I said none could be had; but she made use of such speeches, I was frightened; I was making the fire; says she, I will go out to day; and she counted her money, silver and gold, and all; but I never saw the gold at all; she went out with the gold in one box and the silver in another; she went into the wash-house, and the woman is every thing that is bad; I went to the master of the house; Oh, says I, Mr. Overton, that old woman is in the wash-house; she will lose her money; the young gentleman went and swore at them; but she continued in this place; they had gin all the afternoon, and were so drunk that they came supporting this old woman; two or three of us handed her to her bed-side; I said I will have nothing to do with her; I went to bed to my two children, pretty creatures! I am always in power in Mr. Overton's house; and somebody fell down, and the old woman called for a candle: says an old woman, some body has tumbled down, pray go for a candle; I ran out with half my clothes on, and half off; among all the gentlemen and ladies; I said, I am frightened, here is the old woman has been drunk all day, and she is on the floor, and pray come and search about; I am afraid she is a bad woman; says Mrs. Overton, she is a bad woman, if she loses all her money I do not care; I got a candle, and I said, let us all search; there she was laying down; and the wooden box was laying by the side of her. This wooden box when she went out, had four half crowns, and twenty shillings in it; and there was then only one half-crown; I was all of a tremble, I could not speak a plain word; there was a pocket and nothing in it; we searched every where, and could find no box at all; we put her into bed: in the morning she called out for her gin again: oh! you wicked woman, says I, there is no money for you now; you have been among thieves and drunkards: how must I get to my money? You may get it as you can, madam, says she; her hands on her side, in a vulgar manner; her gown was in my possession from the 1st of April, hanging at the head of my bed; says she, I will swear a robbery against you; because I said I would stop her gown for sixteen shillings, she swore a robbery against me; they moved her out of the room, because she abused us so, they could not go on with their work; and her gown lay on the head of my bed as usual; there came a man on Sunday; says he, is this Mrs. Fell? Yes Sir, says I; says he, have not you got a gown and cloak? he said, give me the gown; I turned at him, and looked at him; I thought he looked like a thief; I said, I know nothing of you: then says he, madam, if you will not return the cloak to me, I will make you return it to-morrow: he sent the constable next day. This is what she has done all this for; there is not one word in her mouth that is true; I always had broken gentlefolks under my hands before, while I was at Mr. Overton's; and she lost her box, and all the gold in the wash-house, among thieves; and if she has gin, she will never be sober; and she will swear and unswear.</p>

            . Were you at Goldsmith's-hall on Friday when your godmother received her money? - I waited there; till they came in the coach; then I led her into the hall, till the gentlemen put the money into her hand; I always attend her there, to take care of her, and to see her safe out: she owed me seven shillings; I went home with them in the coach; I saw them safe there, and the old woman said, she wanted a bit of dinner: I let her come; I begged of Mrs. Fell to let her have her way; I let her have it, and after that she wanted to go home with me, knowing that I have a house; and I did not chuse it: I told her she should go Mr. Overton's: she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070041"></xptr>got her dinner at the Bunch of Grapes, on this side of the hospital, just by Mr. Overton's house, not 20 yards from it.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, when she left her, was she drunk or sober? - I will tell you what she had, one pint of beer, and one dram; the woman came to fetch her home.</p>
               <p>Was she drunk or sober? - No; she was far from drunk when I led her into Mrs. Fell's room: there was a bottle of gin in the room, which Mrs. Fell herself told me she had bought, and brought it in; I saw the gin in the bottle: says she, I will not send out for any; I have bought some, knowing that the old lady will have some now and then.</p>
               <p>Was it true, that the old lady did drink drams now and then? - She will drink a dram if she can get it:</p>
               <p>Then she is a drunken woman? - No, far from it.</p>
               <p>(The prosecutrix ordered out of court.)</p>
               <p>Court. Tell me honestly and fairly, whether the quantity, whatever it was, had affected her understanding, so as to make her in liquor, drunk? - I can by no means think she was; for she spoke very sensibly when I left her in Mrs. Fell's room; but Mrs. Fell said she had bought a bottle of gin; and I saw it; they all had some of it before I went away: they asked me three times over, if I would drink; but I never drink any such thing.</p>
               <p>But then, when you came into the room, Mrs. Fell drank gin, and Mrs. Keen drank gin? - They all had some.</p>
               <p>Now then, was your god-mother in liquor, or not, when you left her? - No; I cannot think she was in liquor; but I dare say she was not long after; for they were endeavouring to make her so; I perceived it, and I said I would not stay any longer.</p>
               <p>You know nothing of her going to the wash house? - No, my lord; that was after I was gone.</p>

            . Was this old woman drunk or sober? - If I speak the truth, I cannot think she was sober: she certainly is a woman that is adicted very much to liquor indeed; and that every body in Mr. Overton's house, which I suppose there is four hundred people, will say the same; and very troublesome.</p>
               <p>I want to know, whether on the Saturday night, when she made this screaming out, at that time, you can say whether she was drunk or sober? - Upon my oath, she was not sober: she was led in by two people; and before she left our room, she had three glasses of gin, and a pint of porter, indeed.</p>
               <p>Then on the Saturday night, she was drunk, when she made this noise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could she get liquor in the landry? - Yes, they can; they send out for a little gin, privately.</p>

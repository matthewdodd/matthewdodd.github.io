On the 8th of February my house was fastened up - I went to bed at eleven o'clock at night, with my family. - I got up first in the morning, at seven - it had been light for three quarters of an hour. I found the back door broken open, and missed from the shop 14 lbs of tobacco, 8 lbs. of tea, a pair of shoes, and a pillow case. The till was broken open, and about 4 s. worth of copper taken out. The value of all the property lost is 7 l. or 8 l. I cannot swear to tea or tobacco, but I have brought samples, which match with what was found. I think I have seen the prisoner about New Gravel-lane. I was present when a neighbour found a pair of laced half boots in an unoccupied house at the back of mine, and traced<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170055"></xptr>footsteps from my house through that house; they appeared fresh. The back door of the empty house comes immediately to mine. I gave the boots to Judge, the officer.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Thames Police. On the 9th of February, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, Warner stated what had happened. I had apprehended the prisoner before eight, in bed, at a bad house, in Mordan's-court. I asked how he got his living - he would give no answer, and under the bed on which he lay I found these parcels of tobacco, and in the window place of the room I found a pillow-case, with tea in it - he said he knew nothing at all about them. I saw Jeffery find behind the fire place a crow-bar, a phosphorus box, and matches. I found more tea in two canisters, and some in a mug - nobody but him was in the room. The tea things were laid for two persons. I received a pair of boots from Warner, which I put on the prisoner's feet at the office - they exactly fitted him - he had a pair of old shoes on, but the boots were very muddy, and his trowsers which he put on were very muddy. They must go over a very muddy place to get to this back door. The mud on his boots and trowsers correspond.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Thames Police. In consequence of information, I went with my brother officer, and found the prisoner in bed, and found what he has stated. I found in the cupboard a bundle of phosphorus matches, and on the mantle piece a phosphorus bottle, and what appears to me to be a skeleton key, and behind the fire place, behind some bricks, a crow-bar, the broad part of which exactly tallied with the marks on the prosecutor's door, where it was broken.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WARNER. I saw the crow-bar fitted to the marks on the door - they corresponded exactly. I lost more tea than is here, but this is of the same quality. The tobacco exactly matches with some, which I had in two days before: it was in two jars - here is only 9 lbs. I have no doubt of it being the same quality, and the tea also.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to this house, and slept there all night; a young man who lived with the woman went out at twelve o'clock. I do not know what was in the room. I was there all night.</p>

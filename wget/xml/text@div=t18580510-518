               <p>purpose of seeing the execution—I had a watch and an Albert chain—I had this great coat on—the prisoner stood on my right side; I found him with my chain in his hand, and found that my watch was no more in my pocket—I said, "Give me my watch;" he said, "I have not got it"—I said, "Give me my watch, and I will pardon you;" he said, "I have not got it," but after two minutes he said, "Here is your watch, now pardon me"—I took it, and called a policeman—this is it, it is gold—it was unhooked from the chain; he took the end of the chain, but could not cut it, it was too strong.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 64, Salisbury Street, Lisson Grove. I was at the Old Bailey on the morning of the execution, and saw the prisoner close to the captain on his right, and I was on the left in the rear of him—I saw the prisoner put his hand under the prosecutor's coat, and take his watch; he then attempted to get the chain; I saw it in his hand, but it was not unhooked from the waistcoat—the captain caught hold of him, and said, "You have <hi rend="italic">thieved</hi> my watch;" the prisoner said, "I have not," and handed it to a young woman who was standing by, she refused to take it; he then offered it to a young man, who refused; he then said to the captain, "If you will pardon me, I will give you the watch," the captain said, "Yes," and he gave it to him—a policeman was called, and he was given into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How far were you from me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not above a yard—I saw you put your hand under the captain's coat before—you unbuttoned one button of it afterwards—the captain was leaning on the rails; there was no one between you then—I never touched you, I was rather frightened to catch hold of you—I went down to the station, but did not go inside—I appeared at Guildhall at 12 o'clock—I had been out of employment nine weeks, I had got employment on Monday, but was obliged to attend here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went to see the execution, and found the gentleman on my left; he did not speak English, but held me by my collar, and at last he said, "You have got my watch," I said, "I have not seen it;" he said, "I know you have, or else that other man has," pointing to a man about three steps away; he pulled out his chain, and said, "See, my chain is broken off;" I said, "Look about, and see if it is on the ground;" he let go of me, and I walked away; he caught me again, and said, "Here is my watch, I will give you in charge," and pulled it out of his own pocket; I want to know how, when his great coat was buttoned, I could put my hand under<lb></lb>neath it and take his watch out of his pocket; and if I did take it, should I not have moved away with it; two of the witnesses are out of work, and it is only for the money they get while these trials are on that they come up here.</p>

I bought a quantity of beef, which I had in a cloth, in a basket, in my cart - I left it at the King's Head while I went to get refreshment; Bennett gave me information, and I missed my basket and beef - I followed on the road towards Egham, and heard that the prisoner was gone into the Traveller's Friend public-house - we watched the house all night, and next morning got a search warrant; we found the prisoner in the house, but could not find the meat - as we were going to the Magistrate the prisoner told us the meat was in a copper, in the adjoining house, which was empty; we went there, and found the beef in the cloth, just as I had left it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Give me the words he used? A. He said,"If you won't hurt me, if you won't prosecute me, I will tell you where the beef is;" I said it was gone too far for that, I could not do any thing in that, the law must take its course.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said I had stolen his beef, and if I would tell him where it was I should have liberty directly. Witness. No, I did not.</p>

            . I am a constable of Egham. The prosecutor did not tell the prisoner that he should not be hurt, or that he should have his liberty if he told him where the beef was; he said he would show us where it was - I said, "You are my prisoner, and I can't suffer you to go back;" he said, "You will find it tied up in a cloth, in a copper;" I got over the wall, and got it - the prosecutor said he did not care much about it; he wished to have his cloth and meat again.</p>
               <p>MR. CHEESEMAN. I did not use those words; I said I would be as light as I could, but the law must take its course.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live at Stairles. I saw the prosecutor's cart at the King's Head - I saw the prisoner try to take the basket out as I passed him; he let it go, and walked a hundred yards - he soon after went back to the cart, and passed me with the basket on his back - I returned, and gave information; we went on to the Traveller's Friend, and they would not open the door; I had lost sight of the prisoner - I have no doubt that he is the man who made the attempt, and afterwards carried this basket in the direction of Eghath - I had seen him the night before in Staines.</p>

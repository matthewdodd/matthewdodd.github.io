On the 25th of January, about two o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the tenter-ground. The tenter-ground is close to the back premises of Mr. Cohen. I saw the prisoner watching the back doors in the tenter-ground in Goodman's-fields. On the 25th of January, I saw the prisoner go in at the back door of Mr. Cohen. Then, after that, the prisoner came running out of Mr. Cohen's back door; he had got something before him. I could not discern what he had got. He kept running on until he almost got out of the tenter-ground; something dropped from him; he stooped and put it into his pocket, and ran out of the tenter-ground, across Aliffe-street into Half-moon-alley, and just before he got out of Half-moon-alley, he stooped and wrapped something up, and after he had wrapped it up, he ran into Whitechapel, into Castle-alley. When he got up Castle-alley, he ran until he got into Castle-street. He ran to the top of Castle-street, and got into some house in Castle-street, on the right hand side; then when I came up to the house it was Mr.

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and live at Cambridge-street, Old-Saint Pancras-road—on the night of 15th January, before going to bed, I secured the house in the usual way—I particularly noticed that the parlour-window was closed and fastened with the usual catch—the things in the room were in their usual order—I went to bed at half-past 10, and got up the next morning at a quarter to 6—I found the keys of the workshop removed from their usual place, and the house had been broken open—the parlour-window was wide open and the blind blowing outside—the shutten to that window were not closed the night before; a bar, or some piece of iron, had been pushed between the two meeting bars to push aside the fastening—I missed six silver tea-spoons, nine altogether, a little salt-spoon, a pair of tongs, a barometer, a case of instruments, a black overcoat, and some other things—several things were all ready to take away, but were not taken—I recognise these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as belonging to me—they were safe night before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner Jennings' brother—somewhere about 26th January, I was with him in the tap-room of the Elephant and Castle public-house, about 10 o'clock in the morning, reading a paper—about half-an-hour afterwards Evans came in, bringing this case of instruments, and put them publicly on the tap-room table, pulled them all out of the box, and me and my brother looked at them and examined them—Evans said, "I want to sell these; do you know anybody who will buy them?"—I said, "Who do they belong to?"—he said, "They are mine"—I said, "Well, I don't know who would buy such things"—he said, "I want to raise the wind," or "raise a shilling," I won't be sure which; and he said, "Would you mind pledging them for me?"—I said, "Well, if they are your own, I don't mind taking them to a pawnbroker's where I am well known, where I am in the habit of pledging myself when I am short of money"—I took them to a pawnbroker's where I was well known, and pledged them in my own name for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I brought him back 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; they stop a halfpenny for the ticket—I gave him the ticket.</p>

I am a papermaker—on the evening of 22d January, I saw both the prisoners at the Elephant and Castle—Jennings came and asked me if I would purchase a ticket for a box of instruments—I saw him eighteenpence for it—the instruments were in pledge at Tomlinson's Collins-street, Camden-town—I fetched them out on 24th—this is the box.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Henry Pantlin—he keeps a coffee-shop in Hatton-wall. I went into my yard on the 24th of Janu<lb></lb>ary, and found the prisoner there—the street door was open at the time—I asked her what she wanted—she made an excuse and went out—I followed her and caught hold of her—she said, "It was not me that took the things," but I found my property on her—these are the things.</p>

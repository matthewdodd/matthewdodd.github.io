We took in this ring to repair on the 5th of September, between two and three o'clock; the prisoner and another boy came in to buy a half-penny worth of damsons; I got up to serve them, and felt the prisoner's hand behind me; I did not know but he was going to put the damsons into the measure himself; the ring was then lying on the board, close to the damsons - as soon as I had served him, he ran out of the shop; my husband came to the board and said, "Good God! he has got the ring."</p>

            . I am a watch-maker, and live at the foot of Westminster-bridge. Two boys came to my shop and said they found this ring on the bridge - they asked if it was gold; I said it was jewellers' gold, and the full value of it was 6d., which I gave them for it - I saw the prisoner at Queen-square, but I cannot say he was one who came into my shop - I believe him to be one; the other was taller.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, and live in Cross-street, Hatton-garden. About a quarter past twelve o'clock in the evening of the 7th of January, I was going up the street—the prisoner said, "It is a cold night, will you give me any thing to drink?"—I said, "I don't mind"—I said "I don't like to go in this house"—we went to another—she said, "Stop, there is a policeman"—I went in—we had a glass of gin and some rum—when we came out I said, "I suppose you know what you have taken from me"—she said, "What?"—I said, "My pin, which I had in my handkerchief when I was speaking to you, and I have not got it now. I don't wish to hurt you; if you will give it up I will let you go"—I was coming along further—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed some money—I said, "You have got some money as well"—she denied it—when we got near to Fleet-street I saw the officer coming—I said, "If you will give me what you have, I will not give you in charge"—she said she had not got any thing—the officer said, "What is the matter "—I said, "This woman has taken some things from me, and won't give them up"—he took her—we went to the station, and did not find any thing on her for a long time, and we were coming away—the inspector said, "Stop"—he opened her mouth, and found one pin, and the chain, and some money in her mouth—I had some half-crowns and shillings among my silver.</p>

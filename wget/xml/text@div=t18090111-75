            , she must go to the proctor's and take out the letter of administration; she then said she did not know any proctor. I therefore wrote a direction to Mr. Ward, and as Mr. Ward had made out letters of administration for some other persons who had defrauded<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110054"></xptr>the hospital before, and which persons had been convicted. I wrote at the bottom of the paper -</p>
               <p>"This is one of the fatal Eurus." - in order that he might be more particular. The woman went away then. I think on the 13th of October I received this letter and administration by the post; this is the letter of administration, and this the letter in which they were enclosed; the letter is directed to me at my house, by the post. On the 14th of October the prisoner came again. When she came again I told her that I had got the letter of administration, but still I could not pay her until I had got an answer from Dumfries, where I had written to enquire whether her statement was true; she then went away, and came again the 26th of October. Still I had received no letter. I told her so. She came again the 19th of November. I told her when she was down on the 26th of October I would write again, and I did write again. On the 19th of November I had not received any letter; she pleaded very strongly to be paid the money, as she was in great distress, and as I still told her I had not heard from Dumfries, she produced this letter, which she said she had received from her sister at Dumfries; the letter is dated the 2nd of November 1808, from Dumfries. Upon my looking at the letter I told her it appeared to have the twopenny post mark, not the general post; she said to save postage a person had brought it up and put it in the post at London. I told her the production of this letter, so far from inducing me to pay, confirmed me that she was an impostor; I told her from the circumstance of the letter coming this suspicious way, by the twopenny post; she protested that she was innocent. I told her that if she was, she might come again the middle of next week, and if she was not sure that she was the person that she had stated, she had better not come again. On the Monday following, which was the 19th of November - I must have made a mistake with respect to the date of her last coming, it was the 19th that I received the letter - she came on the Saturday the preceding, that it must be the 17th that she applied, and then it was that she produced the letter.</p>
               <p>COURT. You said she came on the 19th - A. It was the 17th. On Monday the 19th of November I received this letter from the reverend Mr. Scot, one of the ministers of Dumfries.</p>
               <p>COURT. That we cannot read - A. On the 25th of November she came again. I then told her that I had now proof of her being an impostor. My lord, if you would permit me, I was correct that she came on the 19th. On the 25th she came again; I told her I was confident that she was an impostor. I sent for Mr. Marter, the solicitor of the hospital, and after asking her several questions, Mr. Marter said we must send for an officer, which was done. She said she had three children, she said the youngest was six years old; I asked her how that could be, when she stated her husband had been dead nine years; she said, to tell the truth, she had been married again, about six years ago, to one Grimes, she was married at Dumfries by a

After this she was taken to Bow street; she was there committed for farther examination that night. On the 25th I think she was brought up again; she then sent a message to me that she wished to speak to me before she went to the magistrate. I received the message from Adkins the officer. I went to her where the was, in the office, in the outer room, or the passage leading to it; she then stated to me that she was never married to Rotton, she asked me to forgive her; I told her it was perfectly out of my power, it was in the hands of the magistrate.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this perfectly voluntary - A. It was perfectly voluntary. I never asked her any questions; she said she was never married to Rotton, she was not born in Dumfries, nor never had been there; on the contrary, that she was born in the north of Ireland, but that her mother was born at Dumfries, and that it was from her she had learned what she knew of Dumfries. I then asked her how she could take upon herself to endeavour to defraud the hospital; she said she had been led into it by two men named Vaughan and and Knight; I then told her they could not have led her into it at this time, as the former had been hanged and the latter had been transported nearly two years ago; she said it was on account of owing her landlady some money, who pressed very hard for payment, and she took this means for obtaining money to pay her.</p>

After some conversation I told her it was necessary she should have a bondsman, and that if she would attend at the office to-morrow morning by ten o'clock, accompanied by a bondsman, I would prepare the necessary instrument ready for it; she told me that she had no money to pay for the administration, but if I would send it to Mr. Smith he would deduct the charges. On the next morning, at the appointed time, or nearly so, she came, accompanied by her bondsman; I then stated to her the purport of the oath that she was to take, and accompanied her to Dr. Coote's chambers, and there administered to her the usual oath taken by widows to obtain letters of administration of their husbands in the presence of Dr. Coote; the purport of the oath is -</p>

               <p>COURT to Ward. In stating the letter which was produced to you, you have not stated what was the date of that letter - A. I think to the best of my recollection it was 1795 or 1796; it was a letter of an old date.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not stated in what terms it was written - A. It was written as from husband to wife; she was described as his wife in the letter.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the words in the letter he calling her his wife, you cannot state that - A. No. It was a letter as from the husband to the wife, it appeared to me to be a letter that came from a sea port town; I think it was ship letter upon it, there was some post upon it; I had no idea at the time of being called upon.</p>
               <p>Q. The administration, and the warrant for administration, stated that he died in the West Indies in year 1797 - A. She stated that her legal husband died about a twelvemonth after the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Which letter you recollect to be dated in the year 1795 or 96; you have put it down died in the West Indies, 1797 - A. Yes; that was from the information I received from her. (The administration read.)</p>

Mr. Ward and Mr. Smith, read this letter; it was as loving a letter as ever a man could send to his wife and children. After he was at sea a few months he died, when, I cannot say; I believe, to the best of my knowledge, it is twelve years ago since he died; I cannot say exactly to the time. A letter was sent to let me know of his death; I did not receive it. A man of the name of Kelly, who was in the same company with my husband, he wrote home to his own friends for them to let me know that my husband died such a time in the West Indies; the exact time I cannot recollect, it being so long ago. Upon which, after some time, two or three years, I married a man of the name of Grimes, and after that, it was my misfortune he died; I was left a widow; misfortunes have been against me every way, and after I came to London, I may say to my misfortune, about two years and a half ago, not knowing any money was due to me until such time I came here, I, one day, shortly after I came here, met with a man belonging to the same regiment as my husband did; his name was

He told me all about it, where it was to be paid and at what office; he put the question to me if I had got my marriage certificate; I told him I had not, I had had it, but I had the misfortune to lose it. This Knight told me that he knew a man that had been some kind of an attorney; he would get me to this man and he would put me in the way to get the money; I told him if he would I should be very much obliged to him.

I will tell the truth before God, and all the people that are looking on me here. So accordingly he wrote out this certificate; I was ignorant and simple, I knew nothing of the consequence of it, and I do own, through distress, I applied for the money, I thought it was my property by right. That I had the papers that is laid to my charge, the papers that were found in my pocket book, I am as innocent of them papers as a child unborn.

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at West-street, Soho—on 5th February, about half past 12 at night, I was going down Castle-street, Long-acre, and at the corner of King-street, I saw a female, who said she wanted a penny to make up her lodging—I was immediately seized by two females, one put her hand in my pocket, the other put her arm round my waist—I rushed across the road, and into a dark passage, intending to wait for a policeman—I waited there several minutes—I was in the shade—I heard the two females call the prisoner, and the gas-light was reflected on his face clearly at the door of the passage—one of them said, "The old b----has gone in there, go and see what he is made of"—the prisoner came into the passage, and I retired a little "back, he caught hold of me, and said, "Halloa, what do you want with this woman?"he put his hand in my pocket, and extracted the whole of the contents, amounting to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I seized him directly, and went out of the passage—he struck me on the right ear—I did not go willingly, we were struggling, and he was trying to escape—I kept hold of him till a policeman came.</p>

At ten minutes to 1 on this morning, I was on duty in King-street, Long-acre, and heard cries of "Police!"—I went in the direction, and at the corner of Queen-street, Seven Dials, I met the prisoner and stopped him—the last witness was close behind him—the prisoner was walking when I stopped him, but was making off—the prosecutor said, "Stop him! he has robbed me of about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a passage in Great Earl-street"—I seized him, he said, "Wait till the women come up"—I took him to the station, and found 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and a duplicate—there were two sixpences, two shillings, and a florin.</p>

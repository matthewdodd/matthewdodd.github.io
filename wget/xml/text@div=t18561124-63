                  </hi>. I live at No. 11, Chapel-street, Oxford-street. I am a porter at a milliner's, at No. 257, Regent-street, in the Circus—I am twenty-three years of age—on the night of 20th, Oct, I was passing along Parliament-street, on my business; I was going in a direction from West-minster-bridge towards Charing-cross, going through Parliament-street, on the same side as Mr. Berry's shop—it was about half past 9 o'clock—as I was passing Mr. Berry's shop my attention was attracted by hearing a groaning from the interior of the shop; it was a groan that you would hear from a man that had been struck down, as if from a person suffering—I looked towards the shop, and saw three men outside the shop; they were close to the door, apparently looking into the shop—the door of the shop was open about an inch, on one side—one side was fastened, and one side was open about an inch—that was the right hand side as I looked in, the side next to Westminster-bridge—that would enable a person looking through that opening to see the counter—the door opens inside—the men were looking through that aperture; the shutters were up of both windows, and also the shutters to the door—I did not at first look in at the opening—I spoke to the men, and said, "What is that?"—they answered that it was a man and his wife quarrelling, and I walked on a little distance, about six yards; I had not got so far as the mews belonging to the houses in Richmond-terrace—I then returned, not feeling satisfied with the answer I had received from the men—I went up to the door—the three men were still there, outside the door—the door was still ajar; I went and pushed it open wider—I then saw Robert Marley.</p>

               <p>his hand, and was striking with it—I could see who it was be struck—he was striking a man who I believe was named Richard Cope; he way crouched down behind the counter—I could see what part of his person he struck, on the left side of his head; he had no hat, or any covering on his head—I saw him strike three or four times—I then turned round and asked the persons that were passing by for assistance—I mean the persons passing to and fro.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What had then become of the three persons that were looking in at the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I turned round to ask for assistance, they were gone from the shop door; I called to the ordinary passengers that were going by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Q.</hi> When you spoke to the men outside, was not the answer given, "I suppose it is only a man beating his wife?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he said it was only a man beating his wife—there was only one of the doors open; the one nearest Westminster-bridge; it was open about an inch—I could distinctly see the counter through the aperture, the counter on the left hand side of the shop; not the first time: I could not see anything that was going on inside the shop until I went back—I did not look in the first time, I only stopped—the parcel that the man had, I should say, was about a foot long, and about three quarters of a foot wide, according to the way he carried it—I cannot state the colour of it; it was not a very bulky par<lb></lb>cel, it appeared to be about three or four inches thick, not more—I did not notice other persons pursuing until I began to halloo; there were several persons walking behind me—the man had got about six or eight yards from the shop when I began to follow him; before he got to Gannon-row the dis<lb></lb>tance between us had increased a little—he walked faster than I did—at the time he turned the corner of Derby-street, I did not notice other per<lb></lb>sons joining in the pursuit; Derby-street is a very narrow street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the man got round the corner of Derby-street, into Cannon-row, at the time you got into Derby-street yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not sufficiently for me to lose sight of him—I kept sight of him all the time—I was half way down Derby-street before he turned into Cannon-row—several persons followed in pursuit in Cannon-row; no person got in advance of me, I did not see any one—I was crying out, "Stop him!" as I crossed Bridge-street—persons from Bridge-street then joined in the pursuit behind me—they followed me; I was first—before getting into Palace-yard I lost sight of the man, but not more than a minute—when I got into Palace-yard, he had been stopped by Allen; I found him secured—there were no other per<lb></lb>sons with Allen assisting him in detaining the prisoner, he was the only party that had got hold of the prisoner; but several men from the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> came round him, and a crowd followed me in the pursuit—when I came up, I said, "For God's sake secure him, for I think he has murdered a man"—I did not hear the prisoner say anything on that—I did not hear him say, "It could not be me, I have not done anything"—I believe he spoke to Allen when he kid hold of him by the throat, and said that the proper place to lay hold of a man was by the cuff; but I did not hear it—he said at the station that I had made a mistake, it could not be he—I did not hear him say at the time he was seized, "I have done nothing wrong, hold me by the arm, if you want to take me; it is not I;" or anything to that purport—when I and Allen took him back to Mr. Berry's shop I did not see the witness Jinkling there—I did not notice that any of the persons who were assisting the deceased out of the shop laid hold of the prisoner, or in any way assisted in conveying him to the station—the deceased was being brought out of the shop at that moment, he was half way out and half way in—the prisoner was taken close to the deceased; they were carrying him to place him in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and the prisoner stood there while he was being conveyed to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I did not come in contact with the deceased, or touch him—my hands did not get any blood upon them in any way.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>street—I was not above three yards from him then, but he increased the distance, he walked faster—the only time that I lost sight of him was when he turned to the right at the corner of the passage, and not above a minute after I found him in custody of Allen—I did not see anybody between me and him.</p>

On the night of 20th Oct, I was passing along Parliament-street, about twenty-five minutes past 9 o'clock, I was coming towards Charing-cross from Westminster-bridge, on the same side as Mr. Berry's shop—as I passed the shop, my attention was attracted by several persons standing outside, there might be five or six, or there might be more, I did not count them—the door of the shop was about three or four inches open, the side nearest the bridge—I did not hear any noise—I did not go up to the door—I stood on the pavement, and saw a man inside, in the act of striking—I could see that from the pavement—he was standing against the counter, he appeared to be striking in a direction just at the end of the counter—he had his arm lifted up, and was striking over the counter—I did not see what he was striking at—I remained standing in the same position, on the pavement—I then saw the man take up a parcel and put a cigar in his mouth, and come out—he took the parcel from the floor, from the front of the counter—I could not see the face of the man so as to recognise him again—when he came but, he pulled the door to after him, and walked away towards Derby-street—I followed him—I did not look into the shop before I followed him—the door went open again—I then saw a man lying on the floor, bleeding from the head—I then went in pursuit of the man that had come out of the shop—he had not then turned the corner of Derby-street—I saw him turn down Derby-street—I followed him down the street—I was from fifteen to twenty yards behind him as he was going down Derby-street—he was carrying a parcel in his hand—I had seen him bring a parcel out of the shop—he was walking when he went down Derby-street—he turned to the right, into Cannon-row—I followed him—as soon as he found that he was pursued he started running—I did not observe him look round—I ran after him—he crossed Bridge-street, and through a court into Palace-yard—I followed him until he was stopped by the waterman in Palace-yard—I was about ten yards behind him when he was stopped—I had only lost sight of him in turning the corner into Palace-yard.</p>

               <p>black leather bag or a parcel done up in black leather—it was not very large, not more than a foot long, it did not appear very bulky—he was carrying it in his right hand when he came out of the shop—he had not it in his hand when he went over Bridge-street, at least I did not observe it then—so long as I did observe it, it was in his right hand—I saw it in hie hand when he was running—I saw the witness Lerigo—I had seen some one standing near to me at the shop door, with a box on his back—I did not know him at the time, I now know that it was Lerigo—I could not say positively which started first in pursuit of the man that came out of the shop, I or Lerigo, but I believe Lerigo started first; we both started almost at the same moment—I saw some men standing outside the door before I looked in—I could not see what was going on in the shop further than one man striking at something—the aperture of the door was not large enough for me to see into the other portion of the shop.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The aperture looked towards the counter, did it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was that part of the door which opened on the right side—it opens inward—that would enable a person looking through it to see the left side of the shop—it was only open about two or three inches—I could just observe the counter, and the man in the act of striking—I believe there were two or three gas lights in the shop—it appeared to be very light.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were four yards from the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, quite—perhaps it might not be so much—I did not hear what passed between Lerigo and the prisoner when he was stopped by Allen—I went away directly.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Wokingham, in Berkshire—I am out of a situation now—I have been endeavouring to procure one—I was going past Mr. Berry's shop in Parliament-street on the night this happened—my attention was attracted by a faint cry of "Murder!" from inside the shop—it was about half-past 9 o'clock—there were some persons about the door at that time—it was partly open, so that I could see into the shop—I could not see the counter—I was coming towards the House of Lords from Charing-cross—I stopped and looked in at the opening of the door—I had just got opposite to the door—I remained on the level pavement—I turned round and looked into the shop—one of the doors was partially open—I think it was the left-hand door—it opened towards the inside—I was rather past the door—I saw into the shop, and saw the prisoner—he was striking some one—I caught a glimpse of the other person—he was stand<lb></lb>ing either at the end of the counter or behind it, I think at the end, where the flap is—I did not notice whether that was the person whom the prisoner was striking—the prisoner had something in his hand that he was striking with—I could not see what it was—he had something.</p>

               <p>I told him to lead on, and I would follow him with the prisoner—I took him with Lerigo to the place in question, in Parliament-street—I saw the deceased, Richard Cope, in the hands of two policemen—he was bleeding; he was outside the shop; the shop was shut up, and the door was shut, and that was what took my attention, the deceased being my own brother-in-law—I married his sister.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the Westminster Hospital. I saw the deceased on the night of 20th Oct, when he was brought to the hospital—on that night he was attended more especially by Mr. Legge—I made myself thoroughly acquainted with the case immediately after he was admitted—he had a depressed compound fracture of the skull on the left side—there were two other small contused wounds of the scalp, and paralysis of the right side—that would arise from the depressed compound fracture, it comes on the opposite side to the wound—he appeared perfectly conscious when he was brought in—he was not able to speak—he had not recovered his speech on the following day—on the afternoon, of that day I sent for Mr. Holt, the senior surgeon—I was present when Mr. Holt operated on the deceased—the operation consisted in, first of all, removing a small portion of the skull, so that he might by that means be able to get an elevator between the depressed portion, and then raise it from the brain—that afforded immediate relief to the deceased, by his own affirmation, by means of a nod—that was done to relieve the paralysis—I continued to attend the deceased from that time until bis death, on 9th Nov., under the superintendence of the senior surgeon, Mr. Holt—on 6th Nov. an unfavour<lb></lb>able change took place in the state of the deceased; it was a fit of shivering—he gradually sunk from that time—after his death a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exami<lb></lb>nation was performed by myself, under the supervision of Mr. Holt—on removing the scalp, the bone was extensively denuded of its covering, the peritoneum—the peritoneum is a thin, fibrous membrane which covers the bone, and conveys the vessels to it; it is under the scalp, but on the outside of the skull it is so intimately connected with the bone in health, that you would almost call it a part of it; it is the outer part of the bone—there were two fractures found, one being the elevated portion that I have men<lb></lb>tioned, and another corresponding with one of those scalp wounds which I have mentioned—the man died of deposition of matter in the lungs; that was the immediate cause of death—I attribute that deposition of matter in the lungs to the injury to the head—the shivering fit would be symptomatic of a deposition of matter—that was on the 6th, as he died on the 9th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there a considerable deposition of pus in the lungs) <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were three or four small patches, small circumscribed abscesses, about the size of half a hen's egg—I say that was decidedly pro<lb></lb>duced by the injury to the head; undoubtedly—that is a common cause of such things—it is not equally usual as the result of phthisis, not under these peculiar circumstances—there were no tubercles in the lungs; there were abscesses on the lunge, and in the tissue of the lungs—the idea sug<lb></lb>gested itself to me, and I searched for tubercles, but there were none in the lungs—I had never seen the man previous to his being brought to the hospital that I am aware of—my attention was directed to the injury of the head—that injury was progressing favourably until 6th Nov., with one very important exception, that on 1st Nov. he had a shivering of very much the same character as he had afterwards, on the 6th—I believe it was on the 1st (<hi rend="italic">referring to his notes</hi>) these are notes that I made every day as I left his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185611240066"></xptr>
               <p>bedside—on 1st Nov. he had the first shivering, and I saw it—my note is, "Shivering strongly"—that passed off, and he went on as before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing you had made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of a body on the head of which there had been no injury, and had discovered these deposi<lb></lb>tions of pus and abscesses in the lungs, would that have satisfactorily accounted to you for the man's death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was the immediate cause of death, but I should have been disposed to think that unless the patient had been previously debilitated by some other influence, that alone would not have caused his death—I did not subject the chest of the deceased to any particular examination at the time of his admission—I did on the night of the 5th, at midnight; I was sitting up with him, and he had been complaining of a cough—I then examined his chest minutely all over, and there were no secondary symptoms of disease, that is to say, it is clear these things were not there on the 5th—I used a stethoscope—certainly none of these abscesses were there then—I consider that quite a reliable test unmistakable—from some considerable experience, I am not likely to be mistaken on such a point as that—the abscesses were in a state of suppura<lb></lb>tion—suppuration is the result of inflammation—there can be no suppura<lb></lb>tion without antecedent inflammation—on the evening of the 5th, I examined the man's chest carefully, and there was not any indication of disease in the chest then—he died at 2 o'clock in the afternoon of the 9th—I can say that there was no inflammation existing on the 5th—I do say so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then am I to understand you to say, as a surgeon, that inflammation and suppuration supervening upon it, and abscesses, will all take place within the period included between the night of the 5th and 2 o'clock of the 9th Nov.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> it evidently did—I should say that is consistent with my experience, without any antecedent disease existing—there was no indi<lb></lb>cation of any disease of the lungs on the 5th; I wish to qualify one of my answers, the stethoscope would not indicate a form of inflammation in the centre of the lungs; there would be so much healthy texture between the centre of the lungs and the extremity of the stethoscope, that that disease would not be indicated, so that had he suffered from a form of <hi rend="italic">pneumonia</hi>, called <hi rend="italic">lobular pneumonia</hi>, which is very rare, I should not have been able to detect it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On examination after death, did that appear to have existed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It did not—these formations were on the surface of the lungs—I give my opinion as a surgeon, that the wound in the head might cause the inflam<lb></lb>mation of the lungs, by an affection called <hi rend="italic">pyœmia</hi>, that is by no means of uncommon occurrence—it is not uncommon that violent blows to the head may produce inflammation of the lungs such as I found—inflammation of the lungs, commonly so called, would produce quite a different appearance to that presented by the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> here, and these circumscribed abscesses—the cause of this peculiar formation of pus, is a <hi rend="italic">questio vexata</hi> among the most learned pathologists of the day—they are known to be the result of blows on the head; but the <hi rend="italic">modus operandi</hi> is a matter much in question—blows on the head may he said to be a common cause of this sort of deposi<lb></lb>tion—if I had heard of a person dying with these symptoms, he having previously received such blows on the head as I saw, I should not have been at all doubtful as to the one being the cause of the other; I should have had no doubt at all about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not the deposition of pus found in more organs of the body than one, in cases of injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes it is, sometimes it is not; in this case it was found in the spleen—I cannot tell whether the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185611240067"></xptr>
               <p>spleen was in a diseased state before the injury to the head, I never saw the man before—I never examined the spleen—the spleen and kidneys were in a diseased state—I should say that was a diseased state of short stending; that would be my opinion—it is not at all probable, according to ordinary surgical knowledge, that the disease in the kidneys and spleen may have existed antecedently to the infliction of the injuries.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am senior surgeon of the Westminster Hos<lb></lb>pital. I had charge of this oate I performed an operation on the skull, by raising up the depressed part, which gave relief to the patient—I attended the case to its termination; I also attended the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—in my judgment the cause of death was the deposits in the lungs, in the covering of the lungs, and in the spleen—I attribute those deposits to the injury of the head—I have no doubt on thai point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then from that injury to the head, carefhlly treated, as no doubt it was, proceeded the cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It did; I believe he would not have died had be not received the injuries on the head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Supposing that no injury had been inflicted on the head, would the appearances in the lungs independently, account for the man's death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not, without there had been some previous in<lb></lb>flammation of some of the veins of the body—if he had been perfectly well up to the time of his death, those deposits would not have been found—he could not have been, to all outward appearance, well, and yet these things be there—I believe that the depositions that were found in the kings were the result of inflammation which probably arose at the time of the first shivering attack on the 1st.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have heard Mr. Marshall state, that inflammation, none having previously existed, may commence on the night of the 5th, and result in suppuration, such as he has described on the 9th; do you, as a professional man of long standing and experience, endorse that opinion, and coincide with it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can only say that suppuration varies with the intensity of the inflammation; it is possible that inflammation will remit in suppura<lb></lb>tion, the whole process being between the night of the 5th, and 2 o'clock on the 9th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you examine him with a stethoscope as all seeing that he had received only blows on the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because he had a very slight cough; that began some few days after his admission; it was found that there was a little rough bronchial breathing at that time; it was</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I have heard what has been stated as to the injuries that the deceased sustained, and the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> appearances—in my judgment the death is to be ascribed to disorder of the brain produced by the violence inflicted on the head, aggravated by fracture, and depression of the skull—the immediate effect of such injury is to produce disorder and disturbance of the seat of the brain; the affection of the lungs is a subsequent affair; it is not merely injuries of the head, but injuries of other parts of the body, are frequently the cause of what we call secondary inflammation, either in the lungs, liver, or other internal parts—it is not unfrequent from injuries to the brain—the secondary affection is not the peculiar result of injuries of the head—injuries to other parts of the body may produce just the same consequences—I should rather say they produce secondary disease, than inflammation, because the question of inflammation is rather a doubtful one—my opinion is, that the injury to the head was in itself fatal, and that death would have ensued in this case, even if the secondary disturbance had not taken place in the internal organs.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You think he would have died even without those secondary symptoms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am firmly of opinion that he would.</p>

Q.</hi> Although you have heard that he was progressing favourably until the 1st, and afterwards till the 5th Nov.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The expres<lb></lb>sion "progressing favourably" is very general, and rather equivocal—I do not collect from the history of the case, as far as it has been detailed, that there were any circumstances to lead me to believe that, after a compound fracture of the skull, with depression, and the removal of a circular piece of bone by surgical operation, the patient would have recovered; it would have been quite contrary to my experience if he had recovered.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand you, that persons having suffered injuries as vio<lb></lb>lent, have not recovered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I speak of a case where the skull has been seriously injured, and where a portion of the bone has been taken out in order to admit of a depressed piece being raised to its proper level; those I consider the circumstances of the present case—I understood from Mr. Marshall's evidence that a circular portion was removed in order to admit of the bone being raised to its proper level; I did not understand him to speak of the external laminæ only.</p>

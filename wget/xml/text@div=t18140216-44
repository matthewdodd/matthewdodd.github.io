            . I am shopman to Mr. Griffiths Foulkes. On the 14th of February, the prisoner and another woman came in to look at some shawls; they bought as much as came to seven shillings and four-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they buy - A. Shawls. I suspected as she was going out of the shop that she had got something else about her, she looked so bulky. After she had got about a yard from the shop I laid hold of her, asked her what she had got; I put my hand under her shawl, and found this shawl and a yard and half of linen-cloth. She said that she picked it up coming in I took her up stairs, and sent for an officer. He searched her; I did not find no more upon her than the shawl and the yard and a half of linen-cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that - A. Just upon her breast; it is my master's shawl; it has the shop mark. It was on the counter; the prisoner was near it; the value of the shawl is eleven shillings and sixpence, and one shilling and sixpence the linen, prime cost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into this shop to buy some neck handkerchiefs, coming out of the shop I trod on this parcel, who it belonged to I did not know. The young man came after me, he asked me what I had got; I went back into the shop. He said the shawl and piece of cloth belonged to his master; who it belonged to I did not know when I picked it up in the shop.</p>

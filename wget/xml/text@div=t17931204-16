               <p>Prisoner. I want to ask the prosecutor whether I stole the jacket, or whether I had the jacket given me by one of the young fellows? - It was not given by me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prisoner. How did you come by that jacket? - I and two more came on shore, and wanted to buy us some jackets, and we went into two or three shops, and we could not get a jacket to suit, and then we went into this man's house, and we tried on two or three jackets, and this young man that bought this jacket gave this jacket to me and told me to go on with it, and he would over, take me; with that I went on to Tower-hill, to make haste to my ship.</p>

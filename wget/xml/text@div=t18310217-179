               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Where were you? A. At the head of the counter - I do not remember what customer it was; I can swear they bought butter, and I believe it was about 2 lbs.; he only said he did not know there was any thing in his boot - he did not say that if there was it must have got through a hole in his trousers - he said so after his examination - I did not observe whether his trousers came over his boots, but they were laced boots, and came up three or four inches.</p>

            . On the night stated Mr. Cox called me in: I went into the parlour behind the shop, and found the prisoner - I searched him, and found three half-crowns in a pocket on the side of his waistcoat - he said, "They are my own; I did not take them, Mr. Cox;" I took him to the office, and in the back room I said to him, "Have you any more about you?" he said No; I said, "Pull off your boots" - he pulled off one very gently, and said, "You see there is nothing there;" I took it, and found another half-crown in the toe of it - he then said they had fallen from the till.</p>

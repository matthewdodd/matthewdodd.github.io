            . On the 21st of July I was warehouse-man to Mr. Lloyd, stationer, No. 116, Fore-street. The prisoners came to the shop together between four and six<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160008"></xptr>o'clock, and brought some wrappers, which were put on the floor - I do not know who carried them; I asked if they were for sale; Farrow said, Yes if we would buy them - Griffiths was close by him: I did not hear him say anything. I said we were in the habit of buying such things. Mr. Lloyd came to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"Be cautious what you are doing, and take the men's address" - I think they must have heard that. I asked their address; Farrow came to the counter, and said,</p>
               <p>"No. 1, Castle-court, Lawrence-lane." Mr. Lloyd sent me down to enquire after the address; I think they were gone then, but am not certain. Lloyd paid 15 s. 4 d. to one of them - he is not here. I did not see him pay it, but heard him say,</p>

               <p>"Here is 15 s. 4 d. in part payment." He desired me to go and give information to the prosecutors, which I did. I delivered the wrappers to Harrison.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you leave 
               <persName id="t18240916-14-person195">Lloyd</persName>
             the day after this occured - A. A few days after. He buys rags by the pound, or by the lot. I saw him to day at his own house, and told him he ought to come here - he made no answer. I only heard part of his conversation with the prisoners. Lloyd has been in trouble several times himself, which is the reason that he told me to be cautious.</p>

I went to Lloyd's warehouse, and examined a quantity of wrappers, which I know to be ours - the prisoners had access to them, and were not allowed to take them as perquisites.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long has Farrow been in your employ - A. Above ten years; I had a good opinion of him once. (Looking at the wrappers;) they are ours - here are thirty-seven of them; they come to us with goods, and are charged to us if we do not return them; I know them by the numbers which the manufacturers put on them. Some of these we have paid for; I know one in particular. I believe Lloyd was bound over to come here. Griffiths was about nine months with us.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You was fetched to Lloyd's - A. Yes, and found the wrappers.</p>

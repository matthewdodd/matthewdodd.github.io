On the 18th of January the day the Queen's birth day is kept, my son went to the other end of the town, and consequently the counting house was left without any body in it; as I was coming home about four o'clock in the afternoon, coming down Martin's lane, I saw a very suspicious ill looking woman stand talking to somebody at my counting house window; when I came a little further it appeared as if the foot boy was in close conversation with her; he was cleaning the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100116"></xptr>windows, when I came nearer there was nobody there but him and her; in the course of that day we had that silver plated tea pot and it was his particular orders always to carry it into the kitchen closet, instead of which that day he left it in his own closet a place that is not so secure; we dined by candle light and he left his candle at this closet door instead of bringing it in to the side board; the tea pot was missed about an hour or an hour and a half after that, the tea pot was lost in that day; when we went to tea the tea pot was gone, and the callico was gone which laid in the drawing room very near it; neither the tea pot nor cotton furniture is found; this led me to think worse of him than I had done before; I went into his room on the 8th of March, and the first thing I took up was his coat, and I found it rather heavy, and I found a sample of sugar in it; I then went to his box, it appeared as a locked box, and when I came to his box there I found both of my razors with the initials of my name on them, one of them I had missed about nine months and had talked of that loss often in the house, and I believe before him; they have never been out of my possession since. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. How long before this was it that you missed the razors that you discharged? - I found them on the 8th of March, I think on Friday, and I discharged him the Thursday following; I did not know so bad of him as afterwards; I turned him away on Thursday and I believe the Wednesday following I took him up.</p>
               <p>Mr Steel. Where did you hire this boy? - My wife hired him at Bath.</p>
               <p>Q. His friends live at Bath I believe? - I believe at Axminster.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you have many servants? - I have no other in his capacity? I have men work in the sugar house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other servant go away on the day that he was discharged? - A maid servant did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other besides the maid servant and this boy? - We had a girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and the boy live on very good terms? - When I found things missing I could not but be uneasy and find fault.</p>
               <p>Q Did this misunderstanding go to any length? in fact did you ever beat him? - I believe I have; sometime after the tea pot was missing my wife ordered him to do something in the house and he was extremely impertinent.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this he gave you warning I believe? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. At the end of the time that warning was up did he stay behind that? - I did not take account of his warning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy remind you? - I don't know that he did.</p>
               <p>Q Now on the subject of this in your information before the Lord Mayor the commencement of it says, "That this informant hired the boy and finding the character not right you was determined to get rid of him." Is it not singular you never mentioned that warning before the Lord Mayor? - I thought nothing about it, nor did he I believe.</p>
               <p>Q On the subject of this plated tea pot, did you retain any thing out of his wages? - Not for the tea pot; he is in my debt.</p>
               <p>Q. For what did you retain the guinea out of his wages? - He had always been told that if the tea pot went out of that closet he should pay for it; at the settlement with him my wife says to him Charles, your master has been at a guinea expence or more in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100117"></xptr>attempting to find this tea pot, are you willing to pay for it? he said, he was; and there was 13 s. 4 d. kept back, but he has had that back since.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to have it back? - About two days before he was apprehended he took out a summons, that is, the summons is dated two days before, but it came to me the day after he was apprehended, therefore I knew nothing of the summons being taken out at the time he was apprehended; on summoning of me I called upon him to know what he had summoned me for; he said, for what I stopped for the tea pot; I then put my hand in my pocket and gave him a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that this box had all the appearance of a locked box; in fact you might as well have told us it was open, for you opened it by going to it. Where these razors never about the house? - One of these razors was taken out of my travelling shaving case.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your travelling case locked? - The closet door is locked in which the travelling case is kept.</p>
               <p>Q. You found no duplicates in the box? - I did not look for any.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked into this box on purpose to find what you could of your's; so far as you did look into the box you did not find any pawnbrokers dupplicates there? - I did not find any there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the impression of your mind at this instant is that there was no duplicates? - It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think they were duplicates? - I have no impression one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave the razors in his box? - I did, and said nothing about them. The night I discharged him I asked him about the razors, after I had discharged the maid servant I discharged him; I asked him about the razors; he said they were up stairs in his room.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you do with the razors when you found them? - I put them where I found them in his box.</p>
               <p>Mr. Steel. You said nothing to him about them when you found them; when did you charge him with taking them? - The night I discharged him.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke to him about them, and he said they were up in his room? - He had come down and wanted to have his livery; I sent him to the drawing room to change his clothes, and in almost a moment I found Charles was gone; I immediately ran up into his room and there I found him without waistcoat or shoes; he had not changed his breeches, and then he had the razors in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you they were up in the room, and when you followed him they were in his hand. Did he appear to be secreting them or bringing them to you? - It struck me that he went up there to get them down in the best manner he could.</p>
               <p>Q. What are your reasons? - As soon as my back was turned he immediately ran up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a lump of sugar put into the indictment; you are a sugar baker? - I am, and have a good many men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy never remind you that the time of his warning was up, and that he wished to quit your service? - I believe he did a day or two before.</p>
               <p>Q I believe that you had a side board that this boy had access to? - If he had chosen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not he access to silver plates which he might have taken away? - They would have been missed in five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he not have conveyed them away if he pleased? - He might.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100118"></xptr>Court. Did you miss any silver plate? - None.</p>
               <p>Mr. Steel. He was brought up before my Lord Mayor on the 26th of March. How long did he remain in custody before he was examined the second time? - I cannot tell; I don't know; I don't think quite so much as a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not thirteen days? - I don't know; that is nothing to me.</p>
               <p>Q. I am asking in point of fact? - I don't know in point of fact; the Lord Mayor would have sent him to sea, but the boy refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not threatened to be sent to Bridewell if he would not go to sea? - Not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know it was said so? - I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about his going to sea on his first examination? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he refused to go to sea, he would rather take his trial? - I never heard him say that he would rather take his trial.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing of any thing that is laid to my charge.</p>

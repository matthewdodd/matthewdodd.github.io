                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Kennington. On, Friday night, 30th Nov., I was in Lambeth-walk about 6 o'clock in the evening—it was dark—I noticed a Hansom <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> coming along, driven by the prisoner—it was going towards Lambeth workhouse—I saw the person who way run over—he was about two yards off the kerb, on the left side of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he was going to cross the road—when I first noticed the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, it was ten or twelve yards from him—I heard the driver call out "Hoy!"—I do not think the man who is dead heard it—I have been, to some extent, accustomed to horses—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was going from eight to nine or ten miles an hour—after the driver called out "Hoy!" he did not pull up or slacken his pace till after he got over the man—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> went on, and the pole struck him on the eye, and knocked him down—he fell with his feet toward the road, and his head towards the path—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> went over him, and it went about three yards after that, before it stopped—I picked the man up, and he was taken to Guy's Hospital—the driver might have pulled up when he called "Hoy!"—he pulled up in three yards after he ran ever the man—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185512170130"></xptr>
               <p>but when a wheel comes against anything it soon stops after that—I saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at twelve yards off—I should think I could have seen it at twice that distance.</p>

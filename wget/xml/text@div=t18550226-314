                  </hi>. I live at No. 15, Patriot-row, Cambridge-road, Bethnal-green. I am foreman to Messrs. Rock, wholesale manufac<lb></lb>turing stationers in Walbrook—Mr. Henry Rock is one of the partners, the prisoners were in their employ—Hyland was an apprentice, in the leather<lb></lb>case making branch—Withers, I should term a labourer; it was his duty to work at a cutting machine, and other odd work—on Friday night, 26th Jan., two sample books containing valentines were given into my possession by Mr. Henry Rock; I took them into the shop on the top floor at half past 7 o'clock, and laid them on a bench at which Hyland was at work—there were about thirty or forty specimens in each book—on the Saturday morning at half past 11 o'clock, I gave those books to Mr. Gordon, the managing man down stairs in the warehouse; he instantly missed five of the valentines, and pointed it out to me; I was with him at the time, they</p>

               <p>were worth at a rough guess, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; they were a superior kind of valentine—I made some inquiries and spoke to Mr. Rock, who came into the shop, and called all hands together employed on the top floor; the two prisoners were among them—Mr. Rock then addressed the whole of us; holding the books in his hand, he stated that five valentines were stolen from these books, that they had been removed since the previous evening; he then said there was a thief among us, and would we assist him in finding it out—we all answered him, "Yes"—he then asked us to allow ourselves to be searched, which we agreed to—there were about thirty of us, some were boys—Mr. Rock directed me to examine the clothes of the boys, and while I was doing so, the witness Caroline Cray accused Hyland of having taken the valentines—I heard Mr. Rock say, "Come, Miss Cray, if you know who it is that has taken the valentines out of the books, tell me;" that was said in the prisoner's presence—she then came forward and said, "Hyland, took them out, Sir"—Mr. Rock turned round to Hyland, who was standing close by his side, and said, "Hyland, I thought you always an honest youth"—Hyland said, "Yes, Sir; I have taken one of them; I took it home last evening, this is the only time I have taken anything"—Mr. Rock then desired me and Hyland to follow him down stairs, into the counting-house—Hyland then said, "Withers has taken them out, as well as me"—Withers was not present then, he was sent for directly afterwards, and came to the counting-house—Mr. Rock said to him, "I hear, Withers, that you are concerned also in stealing these valentines"—Withers replied, "I was looking at the books and accidentally tore one of them, not with the intention of removing it to steal it, and I throw the parts of it in a waste shavings bin"—that is where the shavings are put from the cutting machine, where Withers was at work—an officer arrived that Mr. Rock had sent for, and the prisoners were both given into custody—after they were taken to the station, I accompanied Wardle the officer, to No. 5, Mape-street, Bethnal-green, the address given by Hyland at the station house; and the mother of Hyland gave us three valentines, those were three of the five that had been removed from the books—the address that Withers gave was No. 14, Griffin-street, York-road, Lambeth—I found that he had left there a fortnight—we ascertained his right address from the lady keeping that house, and went to No. 3, Boss-court, Thames-street—the key of a bed-room door was taken from Withers by the officer—that key opened a bed-room on the second floor of the house, No. 3, Boss-court, which was shown to us by the landlady as Withers' room—we there found a number of prints, I think about 100—I did not find any valentines.</p>

                  </hi>. I was apprentice to Mr. Rock. On Friday, 26th Jan., I was in the top shop—I saw the two Valentine books there—I saw Withers tear a valentine from one of the books, and throw it into a shaving bin behind him—it was done so quickly that I could not see the whole of it—he was working near the book—Hyland was standing at his side at the time—he could see what he did; he was near enough to see—Withers was working near the book; so was I—at the same time I saw Hyland cut a valentine from the book with the scissors—he did not leave the shop after cutting it out; he remained there—I do not know what he did with the valentine—I mentioned it to Miss Cray.</p>

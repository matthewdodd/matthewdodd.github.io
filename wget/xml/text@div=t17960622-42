Bank Note in it, four guineas in gold, 5s. in silver, and upwards, I cannot tell how much, I believe there were six or seven guineas in all; it was a green silk purse; when I accused her of it, she denied it strongly; she went across the road to the corner of shepherd-street; I was going to strip her, but I thought it was not decent in the street, and I gave charge of her to two watchmen, one was a private watchman, the other a parish watchman; the private watchman gave up the charge to the parish watchman, and they let her go; I did not see her again till she was taken this week; I went to the watch-house, in the first place, and complained against the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see her again? - A. At Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your purse or your effects again? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she is the person? - A. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in her company? - A. Not two minutes before she committed the robbery; it was not half an hour altogether; I am sure she is the woman.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there more women than her? - A. Yes, in the office, but not very near.</p>
               <p>Q. In the same room? - A. Yes; and she was fully committed that night.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman, I stopped at the corner of Union-street, after calling the hour, soon after two; I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner, in a door way, the corner of shepherd's-street, and I thought they were doing something; I was ashamed to look at them, and I turned back from them, and when I saw that they were doing no harm, I came back into my own beat, into Union-street, and I heard a noise the corner of Shepherd-street, of this man crying for the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the parish watchman? - A. No, the private watchman; employed by the inhabitants of Bond-street; I went down where he was, and he told me that she had robbed him of his purse and money, and he told me to take charge of her, and to take her to the parish watchman, and she told him and me to strip her in the street, that she had not a farthing about her; then this gentleman said, he would not wish to strip her in the street, and the other watchman came up, the parish watchman; I told him he would take charge of her, that it was too far out of my beat, and I could not stay any longer, and the parish watchman said, he would take charge of her; I knew no more of it from that hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Jones that night? - A. Yes; while he was along with that woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether he was sober or not? - A. I took him to be sober.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Jones.) Were you sober? - A. I had been home all the evening, till half past one, and then I went out, I had not been out half an hour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never saw the man before in my life, that I know of; the watchman left me, and that gentleman stripped me in the street, even to my cap and all down my bosom, naked in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Jones). Did you strip her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Duggin). Did you strip her? - A. No; she offered to strip, and pulled off her cap, and opened her bosom, that is all that I know of it.</p>

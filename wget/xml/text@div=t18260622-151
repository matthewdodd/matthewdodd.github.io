            . I am shopman to Richard Hodge and Henry Loman, of Regent-street. On the 19th of June the prisoner came and asked to look at some lace, and after she had left the shop I missed a piece; I followed her, and said she had a piece of lace that did not belong to her; she said immediately she had, and it was found in her basket; there is about twenty yards of it - she had laid out about 2s. 10d. for lace.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Where was this lace? A. It was laying by the box, on the counter; I did not observe that her basket was open - I think it was in her lap all the time; I am confident the lace could not fall into the basket; she opened the basket directly, and said she had it; I cannot say it did not get in by accident.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where was the lace she bought found? - A. In the basket - there was a yard and a half of that.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The piece dropped into the basket, by his moving the boxes on the counter.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 29.</p>

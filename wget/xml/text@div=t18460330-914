                  </hi>. I keep a cheesemonger's shop in Exmouth-street—the prisoner was in my service nearly four months. On the 9th of March I sent for inspector Penny—he asked the prisoner if she had any objection to her box being searched—she said, "None"—I, and my wife, and the in<lb></lb>spector, went to her room—she unlocked her large box, and took out a sheet—Mr. Penny asked her whose it was—she said, "That belongs to my mis<lb></lb>tress"—she then brought up some more sheets, and said, "They belong to my mistress"—she owned to all the things, and there were marks on them—I told her I was very sorry for it, that I felt more than she did—she begged for mercy—I told her it was no use—I have men-servants.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the G division of police. I was called by Mr. Gunston—the prisoner offered no objection to have her boxes searched—when I went up into her bed-room there was one box unlocked—she pulled the articles out of there, and then pulled the keys out of her pocket, and un<lb></lb>locked the other box—she took out this sheet, and said it was Mr. Gunston's and then another, till she came to a fourth sheet, and said, "That is yours"—she then came to a brown holland apron—Mrs. Gunston said, "Whose is this?"—she said, "This is yours, Ma'am"—it was quite clean and folded—I</p>

On the 29th of September, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I turned him out of the stable into the field, and left it safe in the field; there was a gate to the field, and left it safe in the field; there was a gate to the field, which I closed, but did not lock. Next day Chandler, the groom, went to the field, and it was missing. On Sunday Toothill brought it back. I saw the field next day, but did not examine the gate.</p>

            , SEN. I am a collar-maker and knacker, and live at Paddington. I know the prisoner - he brought me this horse for sale on the 29th of September, about nine o'clock in the evening; I took it over to the Red Lion public-house with him, intending to pay him; I was to give him 2l. for it; we called for a pint of beer: I wished to be correct, and asked his name - he gave me the name of Hyams; Barrett, who was there, knew Mr. Hyams better than I did, and thoug he had dealt with him he did not know the prisoner to be his servant - I would not pay him till he referred me to somebody who did know him; it was agreed that I should go to his master at Covent-garden, at six O'clock in the morning, to pay him; I kept it at the Red Lion - I sent my son to Covent-garden, and when he returned I brought the horse to the door, thinking it might be owned; a person said he knew the owner - I found out who it was, and sent my son to Mrs. Medley; the horse was afterwards fetched by her servant; I gave him the same horse the prisoner had bargained with me for.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) On Friday evening, the 29th of September, I left home at half-past seven o'clock, and went into the field, which is about a quarter of a mile from Hariesdon-green, to mind the cows, it being my turn to watch them; I found them all right - from the field I went to Harlesdon-green, on foot, which is about four miles and a half from Tyburn-turupike, and called at the Crown public-house, at Harlesdon-green, for refreshment, remained there about ten minutes, and from thence returned to the field, where I remained till the milking time, two o'clock in the morning. Mr. Hedges' son came to us in the morning, to see if any of the servants was the person who had been the evening before at his father's house - he did not at that time six on any one; he came again, with his father, on the next day(Sunday), to me, at the Green Man public-house, Harlesdon-green - he then told his father that he thought I was the man; we all went to my mistress's house - after staying there about two hours I was taken to the watch-house on this charge. Mr. Hedges' house is four miles from Harlesdon-green; I was not at his house on that evening, and am entirely innocent of the robbery in question.</p>

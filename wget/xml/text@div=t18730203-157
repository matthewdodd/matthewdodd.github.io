                  </hi>. I am a publisher at 173, Fleet Street—on 14th January I had occasion to send some things wrapped up in wrappers by the post—one was addressed to J. A. Matthews, King's Hospital, Dublin, and contained a panorama of the Thames—there was also one addressed to Mr. S. Hathaway, Mr. C. Savage's, Watson's Buildings, Soot Hill, Batley, York, that contained a printed journal, called "Poor Ray"—there was one addressed, Mr. C. J. White, The Nursery, High Street, West Bromwich, containing, a boy's pantomime, "The Giant of the Black Mountain," and another to Master J. Guest, Springfield Villa, Sandwell Road, West Bromwich, which contained a boy's play, called "Rolland, the Pirate"—they were all stamped with the usual adhesive stamps—I tied them up with a quantity of parcels, and sent them to the post by my boy—each paper was wrapped round, and securely fastened—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the four things which were enclosed, and which I have mentioned.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the clerk in charge of the Temple Bar Post Office—the prisoner was employed in that office as a lance-corporal of the telegraph boys—there was a bag kept in the office where packets were placed, and when the bag was full they were placed near it—it was the duty of the letter-collector to take them up when he came at 9 o'clock—they should remain there till he came—it was the prisoner's duty to deliver the bag to the collector—on the evening of 14th January I left the office about 8. 10, leaving the prisoner there in charge—he let me out—I returned at 8. 50—the bag would be made up at 9 o'clock—directly I returned I sent the prisoner away and examined the contents of the bag, and, in cones<lb></lb>quence of what I saw there, I called him down again—I said "Corporal, I find there are some stamps missing from this packet, just turn out your pockets"—he did so—he had these five addressed wrappers in his pocket; he pulled them out—I asked him how he came by them—he said his father gave them to him to procure books and enclose them—I asked him if his father would endorse that statement, and he said "Yes"—I then took him down to the General Post Office, and explained it to the overseer, whom I saw there, and left the prisoner in his charge—I returned to the branch office—there are lockers in the office—I had one of the lockers opened by a boy whom I called from the room up stairs, and the next morning I saw a key fitted to that locker, which it opened—there was also a key which opened a tin box inside the locker—I saw portions of the wrappers in the grate partly burnt—there was a fire in the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable attached to the Post Office—on 14th January I was sent for to the Post Office, about 12.30 at night—I saw the prisoner there and took him in charge—I saw these wrappers there—I asked him where he got them from—he said they were given to him by his father to enclose some works which he was to get and send to customers in the country—he afterwards asked for a pen and ink, and wrote down the this statement—"Sir, I beg to state that all I have said concerning the way</p>

               <p>these papers came into my possession is false. The following is the whole truth of the matter: these papers containing sundry books, &amp; c, were lying on the office floor. I took them up to examine the contents, and tore the the wrappers in doing so; I had no intention at the time of keeping them, but, having torn the corners, I was debating how to replace them, when the C. in C. [clerk in charge] rang the door-bell, and I crammed the covers in my pocket to escape oberservation. However she asked me whether I had any objection to turn out my pockets; I complied with her request, and the result was she found them on me. The contents are in my looker, in the office just as I tore the papers off. Father has nothing at all to do with the matter. This is the first time I ever stole any thing, and I am extremely sorry that it should happen now.—I remain, yours obediently, Henry Wells."—I found a pencil and a bunch of keys on him—he said they belonged to his locker at the office—I opened the locker and the tin box which was inside with those keys the next morning.</p>

I was attracted by a picture in the inside which I wished to look at. I carried them down into the kitchen to endeavour to refasten them, but before I had time to do so, there was a ring at the bell. I went up stairs, putting the wrappers in my pocket the same time, and found Miss Shapland was at the door. I remained in the office in case she should wish me to get anything, when she said 'You can go up stairs as I have a letter to write. I went up stairs, but was summoned down the next moment by a ring at the door, which I opened, and as I was about going up stairs again, Miss Shapland called me to her and showed me the two packets from which the stamps had been removed, asking me at the same time if I had any objection to turn my pockets out. I complied with her request, and produced the five parcel wrappers. Upon Miss Shapland en<lb></lb>quiring where I obtained these, I replied that my father gave them to me with instructions to procure books, and send to their addresses. I have nothing further to say except what I said in my former statement."</p>

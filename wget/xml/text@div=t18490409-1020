                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Glasbury, a butcher, of the Terrace, Kensington. On Friday night, 12th Jan., I saw the prisoner out<lb></lb>side the door, about ten o'clock, with five men—I had seen them about a quarter of an hour before—I saw the men potting some lead into a van before Mr. Tonkin's door—it came from under Mr. Tonkin's window—I saw the prisoner lifting up the tail of the lead into the van—another of the men said to the prisoner, "He has treated us very well, shall we have another pot?"—the prisoner said, "No, we won't have any more"—that man then walked off—the other four men then ran away, and the prisoner was left alone with the van—he got up into it and drove the horse off towards London—Fisk went in the same direction.</p>

I received information from Cox, and overtook the van near Hyde-park-corner—the prisoner was driving—I desired him to stop—he drew up—I found in the van the piece of lead taken from Mr. Tonkin—there was another man in the van, who jumped out and ran away—I took the prisoner—the horse was warm, as if it had been run<lb></lb>ning—the prisoner said he had been hired by a man to go to Kensington to fetch some goods, but he did not go further than the Adam and Eve.</p>

I am the wife of Edmund Magee, of 2, Skinner-street—on 17th April last, I was going to the Commercial Hotel, Commercial-street, about 9 o'clock—I was passing the second door—the prisoner was standing on the step of the door—he put his hand down my face, and the prisoner and another man struck me several times—I missed my brooch and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not know whether they took it—my dress was torn off my back—my cloak was fastened with my brooch—I had my money in my hand—I fell in the scuffle—Mrs. Cremer, my friend at the Commercial Hotel, sent for the inspector to come—I was not with the policeman when the prisoner was taken—I am quite sure he was the man—I gave a description to the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you attacked by two men? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—one of these men was named Murphy—he was taken the same night—after the 17th, the first time I saw the prisoner was on the 18th, as I came from the Worship-street police-court, where I had been against Murphy—I saw him again on 10th May, at the police-station—I knew him, but I didn't say he was the man till after he had gone, because I was threatened by his tribe—I saw him at the police-station with 4 or 5 men—the policeman sent for me to go to the police-station—I said he might go, but before I left the police-station I said he was the man—he was not let go because I could not identify him—I did not say that I could not identify him, but that he might go—I did not say he was the man until he had gone, but I said it before I left the police-station—I saw him again on 27th May—I went again to the police-station—I have no attorney—I do not know whether the houses in Commercial-street are more warehouses than shops—I do not know the street well—I am a stranger in the locality—business calls me to that part of the town sometimes.</p>
               <p>MR. <hi rend="smallCaps">HARRIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did not you say he was the man when you saw him at the station? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had to sing a solo on Ascension Day, and when I saw the prisoner he was with some more men and about 50 women, and a woman, who called herself his mother, came up to me and said, "Are you going to swear away my child's life?"—that was the reason I did not say he was the man—I had not any doubt that he was—I have no attorney.</p>

            . My husband missed his jacket; I went into a pawnbroker's in Old-street, I asked them whether any body had been to pawn a jacket; he said is that the jacket; I said yes, I will swear to it; the prisoner turned off; I went to him and said he should not go, by God, until I got an officer; however he broke my hold and got from me; every man that tried to stop him, he knocked them one way or the other; a lamplighter stopped him and brought him back to the pawnbrokers; I am very confident he is the man that I saw at the pawnbroker's shop.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH - . I am a pawnbroker. On the 13th June, about ten minutes past four, the prisoner came into my shop and offered to pledge a velveteen jacket, he asked seven shillings upon it; I agreed to lend him the money, and began to write the duplicate, in came the prosecutrix, she asked me whether I had taken in a velveteen jacket; I told her that I had now taken one in.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the man - A. Yes.</p>

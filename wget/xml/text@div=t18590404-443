On the night of 17th March, about 12 o'clock, I was in the parlour of my house—the shop was closed—a female knocked at the door, and asked for coffee—I told her I had none—I then heard my window smashed, and the female went away—I went into my parlour, and saw two men retreat out of my yard—I went out, fastened the back-gate, returned back to my house, and in about 10 minutes, a body of men returned—about thirty, I should say—they pushed the water-tub through the back-window, and after that, in came the stone sink—I saw no more, for I got into the cupboard, out of their way—I remained in the cupboard fall 20 minutes—I do not know the faces of either of these marines; I never saw one of them—while I was in the cupboard, I heard different expressions about smashing and other things—when I came out, I found all my things smashed—the dial and the works of the clock were taken away—nothing was left but the case—the back-door was smashed to atoms—all the glasses were broken, nine squares of the bedroom were broken—the counter was entirely gone, and the</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Wellington-row, St. Matthew Bethnal-green—it my dwelling-house. The prisoner has been in my employ—on Tues<lb></lb>day, the 17th of Feb., at five minutes to nine o'clock, I saw him in Barnet<lb></lb>grove, about thirty or forty yards from my house—he asked if I was going to chapel—I said, "Yes"—he asked who was at home—I said they were all at work backward, meaning in a little shed adjoining the house—he bid me good night, and left—he said he was going to Pritchard's-place—I was fetched from chapel by two apprentices, and went home—I found things of no value strewed about my front room floor, and missed the articles stated in the in<lb></lb>dictment—all the articles produced are mine, and were safe in my room—the quilt was on the bed, this coat in the drawer in the front room, and this silk dress was on the bed—I found them at the station about ten o'clock that night—I found a lucifer-match in the middle drawer.</p>

                  </hi>. I work for the prosecutor. On Tuesday, the 17th of Feb., about twenty minutes to nine o'clock, I was at work in the back shop, near the front room—there was a knock at the door, which I opened—it was the prisoner—he said nothing to me, but walked through the passage, and went on to the back shop—he spoke to Mrs. Poole there—he said he had come for his mother's eye-water bottle—lie took it off the shelf, put it into his pocket, bid us good night, and left the workshop—I cannot say whether he left the house—I did not hear the street door shut—I left off work at five minutes to nine, went into the passage, and found the street door wide open—I called Mrs. Poole—I got a light, went into the parlour, and found a parcel of old things about the floor, not of much value—the drawers were wide open, and quite empty—not a soul had come to the house but the prisoner—I had not heard anybody but him.</p>

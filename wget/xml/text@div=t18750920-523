                  </hi>. I am an outfitter at 14, East Smithfield—on 11th August, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop with this sea<lb></lb>man's advance note for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and asked if I would cash it—he said he wanted 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash and the rest in clothing—I said I would give him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the rest in clothes—he said "Very well"—I said "There is the name written twice on the back of this note, how is that?"—he said "That is the way I have done it before"—I said "If you bring security to-morrow morning for the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I will do it"—he said "Give me something to take me home"—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—something occurred to me after he went and I looked at the note again and then I went up to Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey &amp; Sewell—the fol<lb></lb>lowing morning the prisoner was sitting in the shop when I came in—I said "Where did you get this?"—he was rather impudent and said the captain gave it him—I gave him in charge—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the name of George Fry is at the back, written twice.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I will not be positive that I said before the Magistrate anything about the prisoner saying that was the way he did it before—my evidence was not read over to me and I was rather surprised—the Magistrate asked me if I saw him sign the no to and I said "No," but I called his atten<lb></lb>tion to it, being written twice, and he said what I tell you—I agreed to give him the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before I asked for the security.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bill discounter, at 8, St. Benet's-place, City—I first knew the prisoner some six months before this transaction—about 24th March he called at my office; we were on pretty friendly terms at that time, and he said, "Brown, here is a bill that I think you may take; it is an order which Mr. Preece, the acceptor of the bill, has received from some steam-boat company for bottled beer; I can't carry it out, not having the money, unless I get the bill discounted; there is about 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. profit on it to me; if you will take 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it, write me out the cheque"—in answer to that I said, not knowing the acceptor, and having one or two little things, running with him at that time, I would not take it without some further knowledge—he then said, "Well, Mr. Preece, the acceptor, is a young man, and not long established in business, but he has a brother, Mr. W. Preece, at Southampton, a civil engineer, a highly respectable man; he keeps an account at the Hampshire Banking Company, and if I get his endorsement on the bill, will you then take it?"—I then said, "Believing what you say, to be true, I will take it"—at that time he showed me this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it had the acceptor's name, G. Preece, on it as it is now; it was endorsed by the prisoner at that time—the name, W. D. Preece, was not on it then—about two days afterwards the prisoner came to me, and said he had sent the bill to Southampton, and had received it back that morning—he produced it to me, with the endorsement, W. D. Preece, on it—I then drew this cheque for 183<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave it to the prisoner—the bill became due, it was pre<lb></lb>sented in the ordinary way, and it has never been paid—I have not been able to find the endorser—I afterwards received these two letters from the pri<lb></lb>soner—there are no dates to any of his letters—there is one letter here which would be written about a fortnight after the date of the bill—I saw the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186509180004"></xptr>
               <p>prisoner several times after the bill became due; he wrote to me, and I afterwards saw him personally, and he told me that Mr. W. D. Preece was dead, and I need not trouble myself about it, but he would go down to South-ampton, and see the executors, and I should be recouped the money—I can't say in whose handwriting the W. D. Preece is—(<hi rend="italic">Two letters from the prisoner to Mr. Brown were put in and read, the first stating that Mr. W. D. Preece had died on the day the bill became due, and the second, asking him to send a copy of the bill of Preece's to him at the Railway Hotel, Southamton, and that Mr. Preece, the acceptor, had had</hi> 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">out of the bill</hi>)—(<hi rend="italic">Bill read</hi>:) "March 24th, 1865. Bill for 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., drawn by Henry Wilshin, Accepted by G. Preece, endorsed by Henry Wilshin. W. D. Preece" the cheque I gave to the prisoner was returned paid through my bankers—the prisoner endorsed it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a letter I wrote in answer to the second letter he wrote to me—it was returned to me through the dead-letter office.</p>

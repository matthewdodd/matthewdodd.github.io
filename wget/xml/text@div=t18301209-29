            . I went with Mr. Knight to the lady, to show the jewellery - he brought away the articles in his side coat pocket; we met with the prisoners near the bridge in the Kingsland-road - I went away, and left him with the prisoners; I believe this chain to be part of the property - he was sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you dined with him? A. No - I consider him sober; the prisoners were at the door, and accosted us - we had had three separate glasses of brandy and water at three different houses - I had had something more in the course of the day, and I believe we had a small quantity of spirits at the lady's house; I drank but a very small quantity of the ale - there was a pot of ale ordered and half a pint of gin; I was perfectly sober - the prosecutor did not go out; I cannot tell the distance he had got before he missed his property - it might be a mile.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I fell in with the two prisoners a little after eight o'clock on Saturday, the 6th of November, in Kingsland-road; and in consequence of what I had heard from a brother officer, I stopped them - I saw a gold chain on Miller's neck; I asked where she got it - she said a gentleman gave it to her; my brother officer took hold of the chain, and it came off:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090023"></xptr>Miller then said, "George Bayley hawks them about at 1s. 3d. a piece;" Watts was gone at this time - my brother officer went to a pawnbroker, to ask if the chain was gold- he returned, and said it was fine gold; while he was gone Miller said, "I have a brooch in my bosom - perhaps you would like to look at that;" I said Yes - she put her hand in her bosom, and took it out; I looked at it, and thought it was not gold, but I took her into a public-house; I found nothing else on her - I took Watts on the Sunday evening; she said she had not been with Miller -I said she had, and had been drinking with her in Kingsland-road - she said she had not, but afterwards said she was with her, and had drank with her, but she was not the party who had robbed the gentleman, and what Miller had done she could not help; I then took her to the publican, who identified her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then Miller produced the brooch of her own accord? A. Yes - it was about a quarter of a mile from the place where the robbery is supposed to have been committed; she did not say she had kicked against the parcel, and foolishly put the chain about her neck, instead of inquiring for the owner - she said she had found it - the publican is not here.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there a button to the side pocket of your coat? A. Yes, but it was not buttoned; I had a guinea in that pocket - I had not gone out of the house before the prisoners came to me; I am certain I could not drop this parcel, which contained - lb. of gold, without missing it, but I did not miss it till I got to Bunhill-row; I had no handkerchief in that pocket - I do not recollect stopping in going home; I have no partner.</p>

               <p>Watts. He never mentioned about a guinea before; he went out, and left me in care of his umbrella. Witness. That is not true - I had no umbrella, and did not go out.</p>

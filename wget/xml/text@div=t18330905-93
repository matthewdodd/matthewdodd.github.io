            . I am foreman to the prosecutor. On the 4th of September, I went into the work-shop - when I had been there two or three minutes, seven or eight men rose up, and said, there was a thief in the shop stealing cuttings, they said, "Seize him, seize him," and two or three men laid hold of the prisoner, and said, he had been stealing cuttings, and melting them - I said if he had been stealing anything he must give it up to me - he said, he had none about him - I walked up, and said, "I shall search you, if you don't give it up to me" - he at last with reluctance put his hand into his left-hand pocket, and took out a small piece of gold, and gave it me - I took it to Mr. King.</p>

            . I work in the shop - I was watching the prisoner - in the course of that evening a call came from the counting-house, to take the cuttings down - the prisoner said he supposed he must take his cuttings down and he took down one box, but left another box of cuttings at his place - I looked at it - when he came up again, he took those cuttings and melted them at the lamp - and I saw him put the lump into one of his pockets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many were in the place? A. Perhaps half-a-dozen - some of them might have their backs to the lamp - some of them might be looking at the prisoner at the time - the lamp is in a conspicuous part of the room - I had no quarrel with the prisoner - I have sometimes joked with him, but had no disagreement - we sometimes call one another names out of fun.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Plummer, a linen-draper of Harwood-street, Kentish-town—on 12th September, the prisoner came to my shop for a pair of socks—she gave me in payment a good sovereign—I sent my daughter for change;—she brought back the change, a half-sovereign and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave the prisoner the half-sovereign and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and a farthing—she drew the change towards her and appeared to be counting it—I was about to give her a penny and she mid, "I will have a stay-hook for a penny"—my attention was drawn from the change to get a stay-hook—after I gave her the stay-hook it was laid on the counter—I got a piece of paper from under the counter, and wrapped it in paper, and that made her change right—when she gave me the sovereign, knowing that I had not change I said, "Can you accommodate me with smaller coin?"—she said, no she could not; but when she gave me the sovereign I saw there was some smaller coin in the purse which was wrapped in paper which fell on the counter—after I had given her the stay-hook she pushed the half-sovereign towards me and said would I oblige her with change; she said, "I should like silver for this"—I said I could not give her change, I should have to send out for change and trouble my neighbours again—while she had been waiting for change she had looked at some dresses, but did not decide on buying one—she still persisted in asking for change—I said, "If you will take the dress you have been looking at, I can give you change"—she said she could not take it that day but she would take it another day, and she said she wanted the silver as she wanted to buy some other little things—I then gave my little girl the half-sovereign—she went out and Mr. Kitchen came back with her and with the half-sovereign—Mr. Kitchen spoke to the prisoner, he said, "You have a great deal of impudence to come here after coining to my shop so recently; now I hat caught you"—she denied that Mr. Kitchen knew her; she said, "You don't know me"—he said, "Yes, I do, and two other persons know you as well as I do," and he sent for them—after that Mr. Kitchen put the half-sovereign to me; lie threw it down on the counter—the prisoner made a rush at it and got it from off the counter—Mr. Kitchen laid hold of her to prevent her keeping it; she struggled with him till he got her down—I saw her get her hand to her mouth, and after that she was quiet—she left off struggling and dropped a good half-sovereign in her lap—I never saw the half-sovereign that Mr. Kitchen brought back after that—the policeman picked up a bit of tissue paper on the floor and he found the half-sovereign and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on her.</p>

               <p>—on 12th September, the little girl came to my shop for change for a bad half-sovereign—I went with her to Mrs. Plummer's, and on entering the shop I saw the prisoner—I recognised her directly and said, "Have you the impudence to come here, having so recently come in my shop?"—she said, "You don't know me"—I said, "I do, and you shan't get away this time"—I put the half-sovereign down on the counter and she seized it—I said, "She wants to swallow it;" and I seized her, for she was very violent, and I thought she would break the glass—I put her down; she struggled violently and put her mouth to her hand, and I heard something rattle against her teeth—she then ceased struggling and dropped a good half<lb></lb>sovereign in her lap—I said, "I don't want that, that is a good one; you have swallowed the other"—she said, "I must have a large swallow then"—she had come to my shop, I think, about five weeks before and had a bottle of capers—she tendered me a sovereign—I had to send out for change—when the boy came back with the change handed her the half-sovereign and the change—I had occasion to turn my back for a short time to unpack a case and she said, "Let me look at the sardines again"—she put the silver in her purse and put a half-sovereign to me and said, "Give me silver, I don't like this small money, I am afraid of losing it"—I took the half-sovereign to give her change and I felt it was light and a bad one—I said, "This is bad"—she said, "It is the one given to me"—I sent the boy back to Mr. Sherriff as she kept talking so much—Mr. Sherriff came and said it was a bad half-sovereign—the prisoner took the piece, and she said, "Give me a half-sovereign or I will go for a policeman;" she went out and never returned—I sent for Mr. Sherriff, and for another neighbour, Mr. Suter; they came to Mrs. Plummer's shop and saw the prisoner—I found a bit of tissue paper on the floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Member of Parliament for the county of Meath—I have lived in London for four years past, and practise as a barrister at the English bar—I was formely the proprietor of several newspapers in Dublin, among others the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Weekly News</hi>—I edited the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>—I was proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Weekly News</hi>, not the editor—in 1875 I practically ceased to have any connection with journalism; but absolutely and legally I entirely severed my connection with journalism in 1876, and I have had nothing to do with it from that day to this—that was the year when I was called to the Irish bar, and it was because of that I thought it right to cease to have anything to do with political journalism—I first became a member of the British Parliament in March, 1874—I was then elected for the county of Louth, in Ireland—Mr. Philip Callan, the defendant, was on that occasion elected as my col<lb></lb>league—he had at the same election been elected for Dundalk, the capital town of that county—he elected to sit for Dundalk, and I had another colleague elected, Mr. George Harley Kirk, and we sat together as mem<lb></lb>bers for the county of Louth during the remainder of that Parliament—I was called to the English bar in 1877, to the Irish bar in 1876—from the time when I was called to the English bar I have resided in Lon<lb></lb>don, and practised as an English barrister—when Parliament was dissolved in the spring of the present year I was made aware of the fact</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230117"></xptr>
               <p>that a resolution was come to by the Home Rule Executive Committee as to the course they should adopt in the elections—I am not a member of that Committee—after the dissolution of Parliament was announced, I received a very strong request from the Executive Committee that I should give all the influence which they thought I could exercise to assist them in certain places in organising the Irish voters—in reply to that request I undertook to do so, expressly in certain places which were named, and which I think I made a pencil note of at the time, and added that upon actual application from other places I would see what I could do, but would not bind myself—Devonport was not one of the places mentioned, either to me or by me on that occasion—I had never heard of Devonport all my life in connection with Irish politics—the borough of Devonport was never mentioned to me during the election, in fact I heard nothing about it until alter these proceedings commenced—at the general election last March I was a candidate for my old constituency of Louth with my colleague Mr. Kirk, we agreed to stand or fall together—my opponent at the last moment was Mr. Callan—he had been canvassing for a year before, but he publicly announced his candidature on Easter Sunday evening; that was before he was defeated for Dundalk, before any election had taken place—after Mr. Callan had become a candidate in opposition to myself and Mr. Kirk I made a public declaration with reference to what I would do if Mr. Callan were returned; I stated that I would not sit if Mr. Kirk were sacrificed, under the circumstances I then named—I am quite ready to explain my reasons for that declaration if I am asked—on 9th April I was elected member for Louth with Mr. Callan as my colleague, Mr. Callan being at the head of the poll by about sixty or seventy votes, and Mr. Kirk some hundreds of votes below, at the bottom—the moment the result reached me (I had crossed over to London while the counting of the votes was going on) I immediately placed my application for the Chiltern Hundreds in the hands of my com<lb></lb>mittee in Louth, in fulfilment of my word; that application was sent in by my committee I think towards the end of May—that was after I had become a candidate for Meath—after the general election was over one of the seats at Meath became vacant; I was publicly invited to accept the seat, and after some interchange of views I consented, and I was elected without opposition—it was while I was a candidate for the representation of Meath that I saw the article in the <hi rend="italic">Irishman</hi> on Saturday evening, 8th May—at that time I had been publicly announced as a candidate for Meath; a committee had been formed in the county, and were prosecuting the matter there—this is the article, beginning "Who is the culprit?" (<hi rend="italic">The alleged libel was put in and read; in substance it stated that Mr. Sullivan had received pecuniary assistance from a Conservative member of the Carlton in order to secure is election for Louth</hi>,) I read that article on the very day that it was nominally published—I was then in London, at my residence at Clapham—as soon as I read it I instantly telegraphed to Dublin to my brother to state that there was not a shadow of foundation for this, and that by post I would send instructions to commence a criminal prosecution—Mr. Richard Piggott, the proprietor and publisher of the <hi rend="italic">Irishman</hi>, was the gentleman against whom the proceedings were to be taken—criminal proceedings were taken against him on my motion, and he ultimately appeared on 27th May at the Police-court, Dublin, to answer my summons—those proceedings</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230118"></xptr>
               <p>were published in all the Irish papers, and in most of the London papers—Mr. Piggott on that occasion made an ample apology and paid my costs—I told my counsel that I insisted on presenting myself for cross-examination in the witness-box in order that the whole matter might be "tilted; I went into the box and offered myself for cross-examination, and denied on oath that there was a shadow of foundation for the statement Which had been made—in consequence of what took place on that occa<lb></lb>sion Mr. Piggott handed me the original telegram from which his article had been concocted, what we call the post-office flimsy—this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—this was handed to me as the MS. from which the article had been printed—this flimsy does not disclose the name of the author—I applied to the Post-office in London for a sight of the original message sent by the author of the telegram, and I was granted it, on receiving an authorisation from Mr. Piggott—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I am perfectly familiar with the handwriting of this telegram—I recognised it imme<lb></lb>diately, without looking at the back—the whole of it is in the defendant's handwriting—on the back are two signatures in the defendant's hand<lb></lb>writing, "M. Brennan, 12, Claverton Street, St. George's Street, London"—that is rubbed out and over it is Mr. Philip Callan's signa<lb></lb>ture in his own handwriting—it was on 9th june that I saw this tele<lb></lb>gram, and on that same day I applied for a summons—it was not granted then, the Magistrate required the production of the telegram, and on 16th June he granted the summons—up to the 9th June which I saw the telegram at the Post-office I did not know who was the author of the libel—the case was ultimately heard at Bow Street on 2nd July—on that occasion Mr. Callan said that he was anxious and eager to justify what he had said; he said he longed for the hour—his Counsel said it certainly, and I rather think lie said it himself, but I am not sure; I beg pardon, Ms solicitor said that—he himself undertook to admit that he sent the telegram, so as to save the necessity of proving it, and he made some observation, I really should not like positively to say what, but the impression on my mind was that he said something corroborating what his solicitor said—I have through my wife a connection with New Orleans, in America; in 1879 I had a large sum of money lying to my credit in a bank at New Orleans in the hands of our agent there, stated By himself to have been collected by him and held for us, quite private property—I am acquainted in the House of Commons with Mr. Puleston, the member for Devonport—I am happy to say that persons on the opposite sides of the House have personal friendships, and I hope it will be always so—Mr. Puleston is a Conservative, but a private friend—I made an application to Mr. Puleston with reference to this money of mine at New Orleans, because I was informed that the banking house of Puleston, Brown, and Co., which is an American banking house, had a branch in New Orleans, and I thought that what I required to have done could only be effectually done through a house having an actual branch there—Mr. Puleston has resided for a considerable part of his life in America, and has been a banker there; he is the head of the firm—my application to him was that I wanted to draw on this money; I wanted to lodge an order of ten or twenty days after sight, I forget which, on my agent, who is a member of our family—perhaps it is desirable that I should state that at New Orleans we had joint securities, in which the agent's share was charged to us for any indebtedness to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230119"></xptr>
               <p>estate—the ultimate arrangement was this,. Mr. Puleston said, "You are under a mistake, our house has no branch there, but if you do not want a large sum we may manage it for you here readily; how much do you want?"—I said "200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said "Oh, pooh, pooh, never mind your sight order, or your securities; send us up, or "send me up, your own note of hand for what you want; our manager shall put it to your credit;, if you get the money when, it cornea due well and good; if it is inconvenient let me know"—that, was how he put it, and that was how it was done—this conversation, took place at, the end of May, 1878—about eight or ten days after I did as, Mr. Puleston said; I sent him my note—I have it here; he put it to my credit in his banking house, and it was paid immediately at maturity at my own private bank on 10th October, 1879—250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the amount of the bill—owing to a circumstance which I believe I can, explain there was only a sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. put to my credit—Mr. Puleston put the sum to my credit less the discount en 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a purely business transaction on my part, and I believe on his—we never exchanged a word about the Irish vote in Devonport in any shape or form, except that since these proceedings commenced he chaffed me, and told me he believed that there were not more than a dozen Irishmen there—I am perfectly ready to give any explanation on the various matters alleged in the plea—there is not a shadow of truth in the insinuation in the libel that there was any kind of understanding between myself and Mr. Puleston respect<lb></lb>ing the Devonport election; and until after these proceedings had com<lb></lb>menced, and I heard Mr. Puleston named at the police-court, I was-not even able to imagine who the Conservative member could be who was alluded to in the libel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not had similar business transactions with, other Conservative members—there may be other Conservative members, connected with the bank, I really do not recollect; I am certain. I had not last spring—I really cannot recollect that I ever had another bill transaction with a Conservative member; when I read in the libel that a Conservative member had supplied the money which carried my election in Louth on a corrupt understanding, I could not imagine to whom it referred, for there was no such person in existence—I have not said that I never had any other bill transaction with a Con<lb></lb>servative member, but I have said, and I say it now, that I really do not remember; I may have had, but I am very certain that I had none last spring—when I was asked at the police-court if there was any transaction to which I could possibly imagine this referred, I answered "No"—the thing was finished and done with on 10th October 12 months, and I was not iron that date to the present, nor ever before, under an obligation, of a penny or a penny's worth to Mr. Puleeton, consequently I could not imagine to whom it referred—I was in business in Dublin for two years since my election in 1874, and unless there was some Conservative con<lb></lb>nected with a banking house. I have not been under any pecuniary obligation to any Conservative M.P., or any Liberal-Conservative; of course, I have had bill transactions, with banking houses; not with any Liberal-Conservative in his private and individual capacity since 1874; I really cannot, recollect—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>) I have not had a bill transac<lb></lb>tion with this gentleman; I think the gentleman's name should be men<lb></lb>tioned, Sir Joseph McKenna—I did not recognise him as a Conservative or a Tory—I practically ceased any connection with journalism in 1876—since</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230120"></xptr>
               <p>that time I have not been connected with the Press Association—I have performed for Mr. Saunders, of the Central News, a personal friend of mine of many years' standing, certain duties from time to time, not altogether literary—I did not send any despatches in connection with the Louth election, or the Cork election, to the <hi rend="italic">Freeman's Journal</hi> in any shape or form—I began my connection with journalism in 1853; I was connected with the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> in 1854 as a contributor, and in 1855 up to 1876 as either part or whole proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> and several other publications, the <hi rend="italic">Weekly News</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Morning News</hi>—those are said to be National papers in Ireland—before I became connected with the press I was engaged as an artist on illustrated newspapers—while engaged on the Great Exhibition of 1853 in Dublin as artist for the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated Expo<lb></lb>sitor.</hi> I made the acquaintance of some gentlemen, men of fortune, who knew my father when he was better off than he was then; they took me by the hand, and they told me if an opening ever occurred whereby capital could advance me, not to hesitate, and they would assist me, and they did; a share in the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> newspaper became vacant soon after; I had, meantime, been contributing to some London journals, one directed by the late Charles Dickens, and others; and assisted by that capital, those friends have ever since been my best and dearest friends—in 1862 a company was unfortunately got up in connection with the <hi rend="italic">Morning News</hi>—I don't recollect that I wrote a letter inviting Mr. Callan to join; it is likely I did—this letter is my writing (<hi rend="italic">This was a request to Mr. Callan to have his name put on the directors' list</hi>)—that company was wound up, I think, two or three years afterwards; they never succeeded in raising enough capital—I did not obtain pecuniary assistance from Mr. Callan soon after that—this letter is my writing. (<hi rend="italic">This stated</hi>: "Might I ask you to put my acceptance through your bank for personal convenience and obligation to myself, which I will acknowledge as cash?") This is a matter which I am bound to explain; that application related to this transaction; the registration of the company occupied some time, the secretary informed me that Mr. Callan had undertaken to take some shares to a certain amount, and to forward the money at once; I wrote to him that owing to the legal delays which had supervened would he on the part of the proprietors let me send him my acceptance for the amount which he undertook to take in shares, and it would be allowed to him as cash in the formation of the company—Mr. Callan became member for Dundalk in 1868—I believe his father died a year or two before and left him some property in Louth county—I believe his family had been connected with Louth a long time—this letter is my writing (<hi rend="italic">This was marked "Private," and merely dated Thursday, and referred to a meeting to arrange matters, and to a temporary advame of</hi> 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on lodging the writer's acceptance in his</hi> (<hi rend="italic">defendant's</hi>) <hi rend="italic">bank</hi>)—at this time my news<lb></lb>papers circulated pretty extensively in Louth County and in Dundalk—most people think that the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Weekly News</hi> have considerable influence on the electoral body—the Government occasionally honour those papers by a little looking after; it is bound to do so—up to 1874 I did all I possibly could for Mr. Callan in every way—I spoke in public, and I believed it implicitly, in commendation of his manly and patriotic course in Parliamentary affairs. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In 1870 you induced Mr. Callan, did you not, to guarantee you in the National Bank for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is the transaction referred to in</p>

               <p>the last letter, and which I took in the shape of a guarantee from him; I required some capital for a new business enterprise which we were then entering into; that guarantee I required for two or three years, but thought it better to have it renewable within shorter periods, and it was so renewed by Mr. Callan for shorter periods; in 1874 it was current, and circumstances having come to my knowledge which caused me to alter my opinion of Mr. Callan, I felt it would be unworthy of me to allow the guarantee to remain in force; I accordingly went to the bank and stated that I would pay it up, and I paid off the guarantee, tore it up, and threw it into my waste-paper basket—I think it had been renewed two or three times, once every 12 months, I thought it was oftener, he all the while being member for Dundalk; I believe he had great influence there, and in the county of Louth in 1873—he did not introduce me to the county; he was very anxious that I should stand for the county—I do not come from that county, but I do not need an introduction to any one of the 32 counties in Ireland—I went there in 1874 to oppose Mr. Chichester Fortescue, a Government official—I do not produce the letters from Mr. Callan to me in reference to the 1874 election—I have not brought any<lb></lb>thing but what I thought was germain to this inquiry—I never quarrelled with Mr. Callan until quite recently—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing; I state in this, "If any Government official seeks election in Louth, if I see no better man to be found I will enter the field"—Mr. Chichester Fortescue was then sitting for the county, and was about to contest it again—I never asked Mr. Callan to obtain a Government berth for a friend of mine from Mr. Fortescue—this is my telegram. <hi rend="italic">Produced and read</hi>; "Sept. 15, 1870. Vacant by death of Gerald Gray; I am working my best for Gallagher, of the <hi rend="italic">Freeman</hi>; will you, like a good fellow, help him, all you can? in the gift of Chi.") "Chi" is Chichester Fortescue—I will explain this; I was a member of the Corporation at the time; the district auctioneers in Dublin are quasi-municipal officers; the Cor<lb></lb>poration appoint some, they think they ought to appoint all, but the Government, or rather the Chief Secretary, has something to do with the appointment of one, independent of what the Corporation might have done; the Corporation were very anxious that Mr. Gallagher should get it, and accordingly that telegram was sent; I had quite forgotten it; that is my explanation of it; it only shows that when a man tries to be good-natured he had better have a good memory—the value of the office was about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I cannot recollect authorizing a letter to be sent that same day asking that influence should be used for another person; I am sure I did not—in 1874 Mr. Callan contested Dundalk with Mr. Charles Russell; in 1880 be again contested Dundalk with Mr. Charles Russell—Mr. Cullan lrmt his election on the last occasion; it took place on 2nd April—before 1874 I had urged Mr. Callan to give up the corrupt borough of Dundalk, inasmuch as he had told me he had nearly beggared himself in. bribing the voters to get into Parliament; I urged him to go to his native county; that was before the election of 1874, and I said I would help him all I could—having been beaten for Dundalk in 1880 he immediately started for his native county; I then stated, "I declare before Heaven I will not sit with him if Mr. Kirk is sacrificed under these circumstances"—a good deal had happened before I said that, in the course of the election, and I am ready to state why I said it—I accused Mr. Callan publicly of treachery under these circumstances</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230122"></xptr>
               <p>and with this explanation; I made certain statements, and selected the most fair and straightforward and responsible mode I could invent for saying so, so that he should hold me accountable for wrong, and so that I might make the <hi rend="italic">amender</hi> to him if he denied them and if I was mistaken—what I said in the heat of an election meeting in defending my seat I can't say—subsequent to the election I wrote this letter to my committee, placing my application for the Chiltern Hundreds in their hands. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "If the high honor of a seat in Parliament were an object of great anxiety to me the result might well call for the expression of thanks and gratification on my part; nor would it be otherwise if the gentleman offered to me as a colleague, whatever his politics were, was a reputable public character. In the present case, however, by putting such a man as Mr. George Harley Kirk at the foot of the poll, and such a man at Mr. Philip Callan at the head of it, a section of the constituency has succeeded in bringing black disgrace on your gallant county. Before 24 hours a shout of shame will resound all over Ireland. Throughout the recent contest I flung aside all considerations for my own seat, and my every effort was directed to averting the foul and unmanly blow leveled at Mr. Kirk.") I wrote that letter, and I felt that the statement I had to make was one not to be lightly made, and that I ought to put it forward in such a way as would compel him to take notice of it if there were not grounds for it, and that I ought to sign my name like a man to the letter, and take the consequences—a petition was lodged against Mr. Callan's return for the county, not at my instigation—I assisted in the petition, and would have done anything to enable my friend, Mr. Kirk, to recover his seat—there were grounds for my doing so, which I am ready to state at any time—during the fortnight or three weeks, that elapsed after the election, a correspondence went on in the public press in which I took part, with Sir Joseph McKenna, in reference to a statement I had made—it is likely that I wrote on 3rd May accusing Mr. Cellan of "a guilty and secret intrigue to stab another Home Ruler in the back, if the Goverment would provide the funds," and for this reason, a fact having been brought to my knowledge which I felt it to be my duty to put candidly before Mr. Callan; I stated that he had ap<lb></lb>plied to a member of the Government secretly to give him the means of thrusting me out of Louth, and I characterised it then, as I do now, as a secret and guilty intrigue—I thought the honest way was to put it for<lb></lb>ward publicly in print in the <hi rend="italic">Freeman's Journal</hi> with my name to it, think<lb></lb>ing that Mr. Callan would deny it if it were not true—that appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Freeman</hi> of 4th May—the libel of which I complain appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Irishman</hi> on 8th May, anonymously—rumours of a dissolution began imme<lb></lb>diately the Ministry was formed, there had been rumours of it for three or four years; nobody seemed to attach great weight to them—I have not sees Mr. Puleston to-day, I should think he is about the Court, for I heard he was to be subpœnaed; I had intended to subpoena him myself—I told Mr. Waddy that Mr. Puleston was a friend of mine, I have not dined at his house—I met him at dinner at a mutual friend's house—I had not a slight acquaintance with him in 1879—if it was merely a friendship matter I should not have called on him, but being a business matter I did—I am proud to say that some of my dearest friends are Conservatives—this is the first I have heard of Mr. Puleston acting with the support of the Conservative party—we will not call that a purely business transaction—it</p>

               <p>was not impurely—it was in the House of Commons that I first named this loan matter to Mr. Puleston, I asked him to look at the securities and put two of them in his hands, they were titled certificates—they had not been mortgaged—he never said he would not touch them, he returned them to me, saying, "Pooh, pooh, send me your note of hand"—they were titled certificates of real estates in America, with joint names of the agents which was stated on the face of them—that was one of the interests, and he said the estate was charged for the indebtedness, and he had an in<lb></lb>terest in those estates, they were charged to us to cover any advance of money—he came to me a day after and said, "You are under a mistake; if it is not much you want I can manage it"—I knew the name of Mr. Puleston's firm Puleston and Brown—I knew after the bill was paid that the name on the back of it was not that of Mr. Puleston's firm, but not before—I never dreamt that when I accepted the bill—there was no signa<lb></lb>ture, I accepted it first and sent it to him—the name of the firm was not then on it, nor any other name; I put it in an envelope, addressed it, and sent it to him—I understood Puleston, Brown, and Co. to be bankers—it was a blank acceptance—I saw the name on the book some time after the bill was paid—I said I would lodge it with the agent in New Orleans for him to pay 10 or 12 days after sight if he would immediately put the amount to my credit here, I being responsible to him in the interval—that was a bill at four months—I discovered some time afterwards that that was not discounted by the firm—the bankers are the South-Western Banking Company, and were then—I did not see the bill for a good while afterwards—I saw Mr. Lever's name on the bill with astonishment—it seems that it was paid away to Mr. Lever and paid by him to Ham<lb></lb>mond and Co., and finally it seems to Tuttle, Banbury, and Co., but it was a perfect surprise to me—all the transactions were settled in October; there was a balance of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to my credit, and I drew it on 3rd or 4th January this year—as to any balance of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to my credit I thought I had drawn it all out—in the beginning of this year I asked Mr. Puleston for accommodation, but not of that kind, I asked him to do what he said he would do at a future time—I never applied to him in the House of Commons—either the last week in December or the first week in January I called his attention to an error on his part in the fact that the bill was drawn for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and only 197<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was placed by his manager to my credit—I wrote to him to say "There is that error, so you ought to have something to my credit at the end of the year. I may require a hundred or two more"—Mr. Puleston answered that from America, and said "All right, I will be at home at Christmas"—at the end of the year I wrote to remind him of what I had said, and by that time, in looking up my bank vouchers and bills, I found this bill, and, to my astonishment, on the back of it the names, which showed me that it had not been paid, as the manager's letter had led me to believe, to my credit, but it had been paid away to others—I wrote to Mr. Puleston, and he said that he should be soon home from America, he could not do it then, but at a future time he would; I connected that with the fact that my bill had been paid away to others, and then I determined that I never would apply again or avail myself of his kind offer, and I never did—I wrote to him in January, asking him for accommodation in the sense that I have now narrated—I wrote to tell him that he had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of mine owing to this misapprehension.

I did not know that the old bill had been done by Mr. Lever; it was paid away by the gentleman himself to Mr. Lever—I do not know that he went to Mr. Lever to discount it, or to get a second bill done, I never had a shadow of suspicion of it—I gave up my connection with the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Weekly News</hi> practically in 1875 or 1876; they are in my brothers' hands—one brother is proprietor and the other has an office of responsibility in the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Weekly News</hi>—those papers circulate among Irish electors in England—I have brought an action for libel before; I laid my damages at 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and got sixpence—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) must be a leaf or a couple of leaves taken out of the volume of the newspaper of 1858.

In the afternoon of the 30th of November, I was in Hackney-road, and saw the prisoner and another behind the prosecutor—the prisoner took the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket—I had some pots in my hand belonging to the public-house—I went in and put them down, and when I came out I saw the prisoner in custody.</p>

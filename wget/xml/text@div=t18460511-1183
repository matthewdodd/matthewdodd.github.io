                  </hi>. I am master of the schooner Maria, which laid at Horsley-down. The prisoner was an apprentice on board—on the 23rd of March Bolger, the mate came into the cabin, with blood running down his side—he had a eut about an inch long, which might have been done with a knife—the pri<lb></lb>soner always behaved very well indeed—I never knew him do anything wrong before—he had been four years with me, and bore a very good cha<lb></lb>racter.</p>

                  </hi>. I belong to the Maria. I was present on this morning, and heard the mate call to the prisoner to go for a strap—he said he would not go, and told the other boy to go—the mate said he would make him go—he took a rope and gave him three cuts with it—the mate ran and took hold of the collar of his waistcoat—I cannot say whether he stabbed him de<lb></lb>signedly or not—I saw a knife in his hand, and saw blood come from the mate, who was wounded—I did not see him stabbed, but saw the wound in his side after he and the prisoner had closed—I did not see the wound given—I signed this deposition.</p>

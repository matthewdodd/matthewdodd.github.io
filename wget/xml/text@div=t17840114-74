               <p>I am a pawnbroker; the prisoner came to my house and asked me to buy some goods, about six weeks ago, on a Monday morning; I asked her what goods, she said some goods she had put in pawn through distress; I asked her whether they were her own property, she said, yes; I asked her where they were, at what pawnbroker's; she said, in Drury-lane, and I went with her to the pawnbroker's, and we took them out of pawn; they were two pillows, five blankets, two tea-kettles, a patchwork counterpane, and rugg.</p>
               <p>Any sheets? - No; I bought these things of her; they were afterwards sold, all but the pillows. (The pillows produced.) I delivered them to the constable.</p>
               <p>Were those pillows that you delivered to the constable, the same that you bought of the prisoner? - I cannot positively say, to the best of my knowledge they were.</p>
               <p>Had you any other of the kind? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason to doubt of their being the same? - I have no reason to doubt it, but I cannot positively swear that they were the same, because there were a great many of the same kind in my house, and they were mixed one among another, they appeared like the same to me, to the best of my knowledge, they are the same.</p>

               <p>The broker said at Guildhall that he never bought any things of me but four blankets, one counterpane, and two pillows; and the next day he took his oath, that he bought the pillows in a twenty shilling lot, but I never sold him any such thing, he bought trifling things of me twice.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I am a student, there was a question proposed by the prisoner, whether Mrs. Ward at the time she apprehended her, did not tell her, she would not hurt a hair of her head.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 432). On 14th July, about 10 o'clock at night, I was on duty in New Gravel Lane—I there took into custody a man named Foley, for an assault—I was taking him to the station—I saw the prisoner there—I had known him before—there is a passe in New Gravel. Lane, called Boarded Entry—when we got near there, seven or eight men rushed out and shoved us down the passage—the prisoner was the man who attacked me first—he got hold of me by the oollar—I was thrown down as soon as I got into the passage—when I was on the ground I was kicked several times—I was pulled up by the prisoner and the rest of them, and knocked down again—I still kept hold of the prisoner Foley—I am quite sure the prisoner was one of the men who assaulted me—I was kicked on the track of the head, in the chest and ribs, and the groin—I cried for help, and someone came running up—I succeeded in taking Foley to the station, with assistance—the men all ran away up the passage—I was laid up before I resumed duty, and the first night I went on I had to go sick again—I was off duty about six weeks altogether—I feel the effects of it now—I was under medical care.</p>

               <p>to Inspector Taylor—I was very ill and unfit to do anything after I was assaulted—I had fits—I do not know whether I was fetched from my bed or not—I know what Taylor says; I don't say it is incorrect, but I have no recollection of it at all—I am certain in my own mind that the prisoner was one of the men—I did not see him afterwards until he was taken into the Thames Police Station—I identified him then—that was seven days before Christmas—he gave a false name at the station—as soon as I saw him I identified him and told him his name—I knew him by sight and by name—he seized me first by the collar and tried to rescue my prisoner from me—when I gave information I named the person.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 483). On the 15th July, I received directions from Caunt and other persons to look for the prisoner—Gaunt described him to me, and mentioned his name—I knew him two years pre<lb></lb>viously by sight and by name—I knew where he lived—I could not find him—I received information afterwards and apprehended him as he was coming out of the House of Correction—I had been on duty in Wapping from the time of the assault till he was apprehended, on and off—I did not see him during that time—I apprehended him on Boxing<lb></lb>day—I went to the House of Correction.</p>

Q.</hi> You went to identify him on behalf of Caunt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; I did not identify another man first—my attention was called to another man, who was going across the prison yard, answering nearly the same description as Caunt gave me—Sergeant Blake said he thought he was the man—I said I did not believe it was, and I stopped him to satisfy myself—Caunt said that the man was five feet six or seven inches, and that he wore a dark coat and a round felt hat—that was the description he gave me.</p>

I am divisional surgeon of Police—Caunt was under my care in July last—on the night of the 14th, I found him in a very ex<lb></lb>hausted state, and he appeared to be in great pain, especially about the front part of the chest—there was a swelling at the lower and back part of the head, from a blow—a bruise on the back, and he complained of great pain in the right groin—kicks would produce such injuries—he was under my care for about three weeks before he resumed his duty, and then he had several fits of a paralytic character, and he was on the sick list again for some time—his health was injured very much while the fits were on him—at the time the fits were on they would impair his memory, and for some short time after.</p>

               <p>Court. Is his warehouse the place where his goods are usually exposed to sale? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does he sell by retail? - No, by commission.</p>
               <p>Was you in his warehouse any time the first of December last? - Yes, on the first of December, between eleven and twelve in the morning, I saw the prisoner with this piece of cloth on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>What quantity? - About thirty-four yards, or thereabouts, I cannot say to half a yard.</p>
               <p>How far might that be from your warehouse? - Just outside the door.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him in your shop before? - Upon seeing him with the cloth, I supposed he had taken it out of our shop, he was going off with it in Basinghall-street, and I followed him, at the corner of Basinghall-street, he looked to see if any body pursued him, he attempted to run away from me when I collared him, he pitched down the cloth when he saw come up, I asked him where he was going with it, he said a man sent him for it, I asked him what man, I told him it was Mr. Shepherd's cloth, and took him back to Mr. Shepherd's.</p>
               <p>Court. In this warehouse your master sells goods by commission? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They are never exposed to sale in this warehouse? - Not till a person asks for them, we sell none by retail, it is for home trade or exportation.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not know at all how the cloth was taken out of your warehouse? - No.</p>
               <p>How near the water side was your warehouse? - It is in Basinghall-street, just by Guildhall, I saw the cloth about half an hour before, it stood upon its head.</p>

               <p>You never expose any of your goods on the outside of your shop? - No; I was from home, the cloth is my property, consigned by a clothier in the country upon commission.</p>
               <p>Court to Blades. Is that the piece of cloth you took from the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you examined that piece of cloth before you delivered it to the other person? - When I pursued the prisoner up Basinghall-street, the number was towards me, it never was out of my sight, it was about three times the distance from here to your Lordship.</p>

             the third, chapter twenty-third. There was a case determined therein 751, before Justice Parker and others for stealing goods in a warehouse; they kept a warehouse by the water side, where merchants usually kept goods till they would be put on board, that was to be a warehouse within the act. In this case, gentlemen, two reasons why the prisoner should be acquitted of the capital part; he was not seen in the warehouse, and secondly its being a doubt whether this is a warehouse within the act.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>How did you know who the man was,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150030"></xptr> that received the money? - Because I had seen him before, along with the rest of the ship's company, Stokes told me he had received it; the prisoner asked me what was the matter, I told him nothing, but Mr. Slop would tell him; he said, he did not know what it was about, says he, what has Mr. Slop got to do to me; says I, I do not know, Jemmy, says I, he will tell you; so I took him to Mr. Slop, and he was not at home, then I got a constable and took him to the compter.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing, whether he had done this or not? - No.</p>

               <p>Court. That is nothing.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Slop. What time of the day did he apply to you? - Between three and four in the afternoon, I was just going to dinner, I had no loose four-penny stamps, and I sent him for a shilling's worth of them, so I recollected his face perfectly well; and when he was first brought to my Lord Mayor, I looked among the croud to see if I recollected him, and I am quite sure, I am quite positive, I have no doubt of him, as sure as I can be of any man.</p>
               <p>How long might he be with you? - He was with me about five minutes, I told him it was an uncommon time, but I did not like to send him away.</p>

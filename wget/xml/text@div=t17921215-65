I came out of the country three weeks, a fortnight of the time I worked at Uxbridge for one Mr. Brown; the people at Uxbridge informed me if I came to London I should get better work and wages; accordingly I came to town on Friday, on Saturday I went up and sought after work, I went to Oxford-road and got my dinner; I went to the public house, and sat myself down and called for a pint of porter; there were two well dressed men with two tenant saws on the table, I asked them where I could get a job of work, they asked me if I was a stranger to London, I said I was, they said, I was welcome to go with them, and seek after work if I liked it; accordingly we went down into Holborn, I think they call it so, and we went into a master carpenter's yard, on the right hand side, and asked for work, he said, he did not want any hands at present, we came out, I asked them if they would drink, they thanked me they would, we had two pints of beer, we came out again, and went down several little streets, and they said, young man, as you are so civil to treat us with this beer, they said, if I would pawn these two saws, they would return it, I asked them what pawning was, they told me if I went in, and asked them to lend me 2 s. 6 d. on them saws, they would do it; so I went, and when I was there two gentlemen came in and stopped me, the men said at first, that they would stop till I had pawned the tools at the corner of the street, whilst I was in the pawnbroker's shop, these men came in and stopped me, there was a great number of people about the door; when I came to the justices, they said, they could not positively swear, and then they got the constable to mark them.</p>

            . I know the prisoner; and also knew the deceased, Eliza Anthony. The prisoner and her lived together as man and wife, at Mr. Williams, in Sherrard-street, for about three months; they left their lodgings, I believe, on Friday the <rs id="t18230910-19-cd106" type="crimeDate">25th of July</rs>

The prisoner came to me again, two or three minutes after twelve o'clock, to my lodging, and I just saw the deceased outside the door, but did not speak to her; they stopped about three minutes, and did not say where they were going. The prisoner came to my lodgings again between one and two o'clock that night - I met him on the stairs; he appeared very wet; I said,</p>
               <p>"Where is Eliza?" he said,</p>
               <p>"Poor thing, she is no more - she is drowned;" and he began crying. He followed me up stairs; I got a light; he was very wet indeed; he said they had been to the bridge together, and she had unfortunately drowned herself, and he had used every means in his power to save her, but could not; that they had been to the play; and that distress occasioned them to do it; that he meant to make away with himself - he was in a great deal of trouble, and was hardly himself; I could not understand at times what he did say; he remained in my room until between seven and eight o'clock - I then pressed him to pull off his wet things, he would not do it before. I knew he was very badly off in circumstances.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you ever see a man in more anguish of mind than he was when he came to you - A. Never; he seemed in very great grief - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100014"></xptr>had been intimate with him, and we had differed about his extraordinary affection for the deceased. He had asked me to let her sleep with me that night; I was not agreeable to it at first, but consented, at his great intreaty - I sat up for her till twelve o'clock, when he came to bring her - I saw him no more till he came in all over wet; every part of him was streaming wet; he said he had done every thing he could to save her, and wished me to go and alarm the people immediately; and told me to go and tell her mother, which I did; he would have gone himself, but he was not in a state to go; the mother lived in Boswell-court, Carey-street - she brought an officer at nine o'clock next night, and gave him in charge; he did not make the least effort to get away; he was a most humane and feeling young man I ever knew, and would not injure a worm.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you been living with him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her at the door, did you ask her to come in - A. I called Eliza, and she ran by the door immediately, and I saw no more of her - I had differed with her once or twice about him, and with him about her; he begged of me to treat her well, saying that she was deserving of good treatment - I heard from him and from her that he had proposed marriage to her.</p>

            . I lived in the same house as Bell. In July last I saw the prisoner when he came home, at twelve o'clock at night, and at two; he was very wet then - he was wet all over I believe; I did not feel his hat or clothes, but saw that he was wet. I saw his hat when I got up, and it was wet. As soon as he came in at two o'clock, I heard him say,</p>

            . I am a watchman of Jermyn-street, St. James's. On the night, between Friday and Saturday, the 27th of July, I saw the prisoner coming from round the corner, from the Market-lane, about half-past one o'clock; he was knocking his hands about, and saying,</p>
               <p>"My God, my God, what have I done. Oh dear, oh dear." I said,</p>
               <p>"You have done something I am sure, and I shall take you to the watch-house;" I asked him where he was going - he went and rang the bell of Bell's house, and said,</p>
               <p>"It is all right, it is all right." Holiday, who lodges in the house came up, and I asked if he knew the prisoner. He said</p>
               <p>"My man what are you?" he said,</p>
               <p>"It is all right, my name is Dyson;" Holiday said,</p>
               <p>"Your wife I believe lodges above me" - he said, Yes. He opened the door with his key, and let him in. I noticed his clothes - the upper part of them were not wet, for I stood close by him for two minutes or more, but I did not notice his legs; if he had been very wet I must have seen it. I saw no wet about him. I did not notice him lower down than his body.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you before the Grand Jury - A. No; neither before the Coroner or Justice. There is a gas-light close to the door. I could see as clear as I do now; there was nothing to lead me to observe his clothes - I did not feel them. I will swear the upper part was not wet; he had his hat on. I did not observe his hair. He was at the door when I noticed his clothes.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the night in question, I saw the prisoner standing at the door in Jermyn-street, about a quarter before two o'clock - I asked what he wanted there; he made no answer. I opened the door; he went into the passage - I asked where he was going; he said,</p>
               <p>"It's all right, my name is Dyson;" Mrs. Bell was at the bottom of the stairs; she went up, and he after her.

            . I am a waterman. On Friday night, the 25th of July, at a quarter before eleven o'clock, I left my boat, moored near Westminster-bridge, on the Middlesex side, under the arch. When I left it it was ebb tide, and there was not sufficient water for a person to drown; it was a-ground - the tide was leaving her. I went to the boat about a quarter before seven o'clock in the morning, and found her above Old Palace-yard, about a hundred yards from where I left it; she was fastened to another boat, afloat, in deep water, sufficient to drown a person. I went to Vauxhall in her, and observed a bonnet under the seat; it appeared to have been put there. When I got to Vauxhall I washed the boat - her benches, seat, and back board were very dirty, as if there had been a scuffle in it, as if one or two persons had scraped their feet all over. There was no water in it, except a little from rain; there are piles alongside the Speaker's wall, above the place where I found the boat - it was further out in the river than where I had left it, but there is a causeway two feet above the ground; she would not have been afloat at twenty minutes flood. She would not have floated between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you left her did you make her head fast - A. Yes, I chained her to the pier; it was high water about four o'clock; she was clean when I left her - there were mud marks about her in the morning, which shewed somebody had been in her who had been about the banks of the river. I found her between the speaker's gardens and the bridge; she would have been afloat at two o'clock where I left her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If a person comes from the bridge to the boat, is there sand or mud - A. A person might go to the bridge without getting mud, but might get mud in going from the bridge to the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. A man not used to get a boat off, and fasten it again, might tread about on the back were the marks were - A. The benches and back board were muddy; a man standing on the back board must fall into the water - the part of it which stands up was muddy. The painting was scratched; the scratches were not there the night before. The mud on the back board appeared to be done by their scraping their feet against it; they could not stand on it without falling into the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a person to be pushed over, behind the back board, might their feet come against it - A. They might. The marks appeared to me to be done by people struggling about. If they had walked in the mud, and then into the boat, there would be the prints of feet; but it was the scraping of feet. There was a watchman on the bridge right over the arch where the boat laid.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw the body of the deceased at the request of her mother, on the morning of the 1st of August - I understood it had been six days in the water. It was in a very advanced state of putrefaction. The head was exceedingly swollen, of a dark purple colour, and very much disfigured. I observed no other marks, except those of putrefaction - the head was swollen, which appeared to me to arise from extravasation of blood, and if my opinion be right, it must have arisen from external violence. I did not open the head; but it appeared to be from extravasation. I opened the body; the lungs were gorged with black blood, which proved she died from suffocation, from drowning. The appearance of the face arose in my opinion from extravasation of blood, in consequence of blows. I am not acquainted with any other cause, which could produce it than external injury previous to death. I do not think a blow on the body after death could produce these appearances. I do not think that the blow occasioned death, but occasioned the marks on the face. Suffocation from drowning was the cause of death.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not suffocation from drowning occasion the blood to go towards the head, and produce swelling in the face - A. I do not know, but I suppose a person strangled would have the face black - the return of blood from the head would be prevented, and make it of a dark colour; but I make a distinction between strangulation and drowning. I never examined a drowned body before.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I examined the deceased in company with Mr. Jeffries - the head was exceedingly swollen; there appeared marks of violence on the face, arising from extravasation of blood, produced by external violence, previous to death - they appeared chiefly on the left eye.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The state of putrefaction had considerably advanced - A. Yes. I have seen three or four drowned persons, after they had been three days in the water. I never saw one that had been six days under water.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not putrefaction discolour and enlarge the body - A. Yes, but not the peculiar sort of discolouration - the head does not swell except from extravasation. The marks were distinguishable from the general swelling of the body.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the skin of the face broken at all - A. No. I did not open the head, as I thought it evident without, that external violence produced it. The faces of all drowned persons are swollen, but not so much as this. Death from suffocation is followed by darkness in the skin to a certain extent; but the colour on this face was different - the discolouration would be all over the face, not partial, as this was.</p>
               <p>Q. Would a blow of the humane hand produce it - A. I should think it would. I observed no marks but these; they were under both eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not suffocation produce the marks under the eyes without external violence - A. Not to this extent; it would be the same colour I should think. I consider in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100016"></xptr>my judgment that the marks were produced by external violence previous to death.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and saw the deceased's body, and was led to suppose that external violence had been used, as there was a considerable discolouration, more under the left eye than any where else. In my judgment it must have been produced by external violence previous to death. The mark ran as a blow would, if produced by the side of a hand; it proceeded from under the eye, nearly up to the temple.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you seen many drowned subjects - A. Two or three; one had been taken out immediately after the accident - the other two had been two three days in water. A body being six days under water would certainly make a difference in its appearance; but I can judge what those effects would be. I have been seven years in practice.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would a blow given by the hand, producing such a mark, would it have stunned a person - A. I should think so, but if the body was so disfigured I cannot say on what part the blow was given. Dissection would have been the best way to ascertain the matter correctly - she was pregnant, and about five months gone.</p>

            . I re-examined the body before the Coroner's Jury, on the 2d of August, and observed the face and head a good deal disfigured and swollen. I examined the part particularly, and divided it with a knife, and found no extravasation, nor any one circumstance to induce me to believe that external violence had been used - I examined under the eyes, and cut open that part. I have often seen drowned persons, and saw nothing in this case different from what would arise from putrefaction and suffocation. When a body is immediately taken out of the water the face is dark, and the body swells eventually.</p>

            , of No. 11, Sherrard-street, Golden-square, waiter, saith, that he and the deceased cohabited together, as man and wife, not being so; he knew another woman who claimed to be his wife, not being so. They were all together on that day and evening; was to quit that lodging on that day - quitted the house about nine o'clock on Friday evening, the 25th of July last, and proceeded by her desire to the Haymarket Theatre, and remained till the conclusion of the performance was over - they then went together to Jermyn-street; the young woman walked on, and I stopped at the lodgings of Mrs. Bell, according as she had made me promise that I would see her again that night; she enquired where this unfortunate young woman was, as she had appointed to sleep there that night - that I requested Eliza to do so, but could not prevail on her; left Jermyn-street with Eliza, and walked down the Haymarket to the Westminster-bridge, went down on the left hand side of the bridge; were some time talking on that side of the bridge, and then walked under the arch to the other side the bridge, and she got into a boat and I followed; she then got from that into another boat that was close by it - was some time in the boat talking to each other; was then standing with one foot on the side of the boat, and she was leaning on me to the best of my recollection. Suddenly found myself in the water; not able to swim, never being able to swim in my life, but struggling towards the young woman, as I supposed, in the water; got hold of the boat, and got into it, and looking round and not seeing the young woman there, I supposed she likewise was fallen in; called Help, help, help, several times - Murder and help, again. I then listened, but did not hear anything in the water, but presently saw something above the water, which I supposed to be the young woman - I then cried, Eliza my dear, and strived to push the boat to get towards her, but finding the boat was fast, went to the other end, and pulling a bit of rope, which appeared to fasten it, it came easily undone, and then with one of the things they row the boat with, pushed the boat towards where I saw the young woman above the water; my strength in the agitation was not sufficient to push the boat as I wished it to go - she had disappeared again below the water, and I saw her a second time; she appeared to sink under the water directly. I could not get near her with the boat, and dropped down the piece of wood I had in my hand, and prayed to God to spare her life. Could not for some time get the boat to that side of the water to get out of it. When I got out of the boat, I came up the stairs as far as the end of the bridge, saw a man apparently intoxicated, and a dirty looking woman; seeing him in liquor did not inform him of what had happened, but went straightway to the house where Mrs. Bell lodged at, and rung the bell - before she came down a person who lodged in the house came and unlocked the door; I walked in - the watchman came from the other side of the street - came to the door, and the person who lodged in the house, appeared not to know me; told them my name was Dyson, then went up stairs; left Mrs. Bell on the stairs, coming to answer the door - told her that poor Eliza was no more; and begged her to go to her mother. On farther recollection, thought she would not get in, there being a gate, and therefore delayed it till later in the morning. She went to her mother, and I remained in the room until she came back - some little time after she came back it was time for the young person to get up, who slept with Mrs. Bell, and I went outside the door till she had dressed herself. When I came in, Mrs. Bell requested me to take off my wet things - I asked her if she supposed dry things could be of any consequence to me after what had happened; she still persuading me, I pulled off my wet things, put on a dry shirt, and went into bed.</p>
               <p>That it was my intention to destroy myself, and when the young woman found it was my intention, she determined on doing the same. I tried to prevail on her not to make away with herself, had written a paper, with an intent to put in my pocket, that I intended to drown myself - I accidentally left the paper on the table, and she got it and read it, and by that means it was that she found that I was determined to make away with myself.</p>

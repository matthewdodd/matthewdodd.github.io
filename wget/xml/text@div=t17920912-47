               <p>Perhaps too your servants in the inn have access to the place where the letters are deposited? - No, they cannot get to the place where the letters are deposited.</p>
               <p>How are the letters secured? - Secured, it is a private room, there is a hole to put them into out of the yard; I always keep the key.</p>
               <p>But may the servants get into that room? - When I am delivering the letters in a morning they may; the clerk of the parish comes to receive them.</p>
               <p>Is the room kept locked? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then only your wife can get into it besides yourself? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Dear Sister,</p>
               <p>Your's of the 5th I received, and have sent you twenty pounds, in two ten pound bills; you had better get the Cambridge bill changed in London, as it will not pass so easy in Yorkshire; and in case of accident, or death, send a note; I wish Mr. Carlisle to pay me again, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>You recollect that circumstance? - Yes;</p>
               <p>I believe you was sent for to Bow-street, by Mr. Parkins, the solicitor to the Post-office? - Yes;</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner at that time? - Yes?</p>
               <p>Do you imagine, do you think, upon your oath, and recollection, that the prisoner is the person that purchased that fore-quarter of lamb, and paid for it by a bank post bill? - No, sir, I do not think he is; I would not swear to him positively.</p>
               <p>In what respect do you imagine they differed? - I took the man when he came to the shop to have a wig on.</p>
               <p>Do you think he differed from the prisoner in any other respect, as to height and bulk? - I think he was a taller man?</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing that man who was in the shop? - I was busy, I did not take any particular notice.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five very respectable witnesses, who had known him a great many years, and all gave him a most excellent character.</p>

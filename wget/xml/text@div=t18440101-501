                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-inspector.</hi>) On Christmas-day I was at the Dock-yard, Deptford—the prisoner was a policeman on duty there that day—as I visited him, in a part of the yard called the cooperage, I saw him putting something into his hat—I went up to him, and said, "What are you doing? you have been putting something into your Hat"—he said, "No, I have just</p>

               <p>been taking my gloves out"—I said, "I know better, take your hat off"—he took it off, and in it I found these pieces of wood—they are such pieces as would naturally be in her Majesty's Dock-yard—he had his gloves in his hand—I said, "You are not fit to be on duty, I shall take you to the guard-room, you have something more in your pocket"—he then put his hand behind him, and took these pieces of wood out of his pocket—I told him to come to the station—he then put his hand into his pocket, or some part of his dress, and took out these pieces of lead—I saw it in his hand—he threw it behind some cooperage timbers—I said nothing, but spoke very sharply to him, and desired him to come on—we went a few paces further, and he threw a second piece of lead from him, which went on some timbers—I made no observation, but took him to the station, and said to the sergeant, "Unbutton this man's clothes, and search him thoroughly"—under his braces were found these pieces of wood, just above the waistband of his trowsers—I then went back to where I had seen him throw the lead, and found these two pieces there—before the Magistrate, he said he picked it up, as he saw it about the yard, for the purpose of giving it to the sergeant, that it should not be lost—there is no mark on the lead—lead is not usually marked—it is such lead as is in use in the Dock-yard.</p>

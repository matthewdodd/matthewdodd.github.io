               <p>Q. When did you lose these things - A. I do not know the day of the month; the prisoner lodged with me near three months; I lost a child's tippet and six shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you accuse him of taking it - A. The box stood under the bed where he slept; the prisoner came and took his bag away in a cart; I never suspected him till a person called to me in the street and said he had been robbed by Charles Cline to the amount of twenty six pounds, I told him I had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after having this conversation with somebody you found your property - A. No; only this tippet was found on John Edward's daughter; he took it off and gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. All you know is that your things were taken away and only the prisoner had access to that room - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner, he was taken before the magistrate, he was asked how he came by that tippet, he said he bought it of a jew in Grub Street, and four shirts; the prisoner said afterwards to me, now I remember, I picked it up in my room, I said what room, was it in the room you lodged in of Mrs. Lowry's; he said yes.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence I accosted Mrs. Lowry what men's shoes they were in my room, and a hat; they were in my room in the morning. I know myself innocent; I went to lodge with Mrs. Lowry in September last when I left her lodging I told her where I was going to at Walthamstow; the very first time I came to town I went to her house. On the 28th of June she accosted me, I said do what you please; I went up to the magistrate; Mr. Moser saw it was a slight case he would not trouble a jury with it. Afterwards I was taken up; the tippet I found in my box at Walthamstow; I gave it to the girl, not with any intention to rob Mrs. Lowry. The prosecutrix swore to the shirt I had got on; I delivered the key of my box, and persuaded them to bring my box up to the office.</p>

I lost my nails on the 22nd of December; my wife came and told me the prisoner wanted to give me an order - I went home and saw him; he asked whether I would make him some boxes, and what price I would make them for - he was then in my shop; he was quite a stranger to me - I told him the price; he hesitated a good bit, and said he could make them cheaper himself - he was alone at that time; he then went away - I thought he had a bulk at his side, and I followed him between thirty and forty yards - I then saw him give a paper to Costello, who was about ten yards from the top of the court where I live; I believe the prisoner took the parcel from his side - the prisoner turned his head, saw me, and made off immediately: Costello put the parcel into his hat, and his hat on his head - he was taken, tried, and convicted - I had seen the nails on the end of my bench; there were six packages.</p>

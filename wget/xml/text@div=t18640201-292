I live at 39, Redman-street, St. Luke's—before 9th January, I had been watching the New Half-way beer-house in Blackfriars-road—I have frequently seen the prisoner Smith go in there with Frederick Smith, who is since dead—in consequence of information, I went in on 9th June, accompanied by several officers—I entered by the door in Webber-street, and the other officers by another door in Gray-street—I then saw the prisoners and Frederick Smith in conversation—I pointed Frederick Smith out to the officers, and he disappeared into the back parlour—we went in, and saw him take two purses from his pocket, with a quantity of loose silver, and drop it on the ground—Fife picked up six florins and three half-crowns, all counterfeit—one purse contained 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—Frederick Smith said that it was his money—the female prisoner was ex<lb></lb>ceedingly violent, and threw away a florin, which Shaw picked up, and handed to me—it was bad—Inspector Brannan brought Johnson into the room, and gave me these four bad florins—the female prisoner gave the name of Ellen Jones at first, and afterwards Ellen Smith.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Brecknell, of 9, Middlesex-street, Somers-town—the prisoner lodged with us, on the second-floor, from 31<hi rend="italic">st</hi> March last. On 10th May I went out about half-past eight o'clock, leaving my husband and children at home—I left a box on a chest of drawers in the front-room first-floor locked, and another in the front-parlour unlocked—my husband came to me, and arranged where I was to put the keys—I returned about half-past twelve, met him 'near the house, and we went, back together—my little girl gave me this card; it has "St. Giles's Cemetery" on it, I had left it locked up in the box in the front-room first-floor, the door of which I left locked—there was a pair of sugar-tongs, seven spoons, and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver in the box—in the box down stairs I left two lockets, one ear-ring, with a cornelian stone, and a small ivory box—I looked for the box; it was gone—the prisoner was out—she returned in about three quarters of an hour, and I charged her—she said if she were me she would have the place searched—I said that could not be done without I gave her into custody—I sent for a constable, but did not give her in charge till eight in the evening—she wished her room to be searched, and I went into it, but I was certain the things were not there—I went in again, about five, and saw a quantity of white ash in the ironing-stove—my child opened, the door of the stove, and looked at it, and the prisoner said, "It is only wood-ash"—the fire was out—I gave her into custody about eight—she was taken to the station—the constable came back with me, and the grate had then been cleared out, a fresh fire lighted, and the ironing-stove moved into the middle of the room—I was in the room when the policeman searched the grate—the prisoner was then at the station—he found a small remnant of the box with a piece of the lining attached to it; also three other pieces of lining, which had been burnt, the front hioge of the box, and the top handle, a piece of sealing-wax, an ear-ring, and the bone handle of a parasol—this locket, ear-ring, stone, and ivory box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), are all my husband's—the prisoner saw me put money into the box on the Monday; that box was open.</p>

On the 21st of August, I was returning from the Play about twelve o'clock at night - I missed the party that was with me. I met one of the prisoners in Drury-lane, and asked her the way to the city; she was leaving me, when the other prisoner came up, and persuaded me to go home with her into Charles-street. I went to bed there; when I got up the two prisoners were there. I asked them where my things were? I missed the articles stated in the indictment. They said I had no more than what was in the chair when they met me, and that my things were unpinned, as if I had been with some person, which was not the case. As I went out, the young woman in the next room asked me if I had lost any thing? I told her I had. She went with me to Bow-street, and got an officer, who took them into custody. My apron and petticoat were found on one of the prisoners, and the stays on the other, they were wearing them.</p>

I asked Steel what she had got in her apron? she said it was her petticoat-the prosecutor claimed it. I asked where the other things were? (they whispered to each other.) Ingram pulled the stays off; Steel went to the bed, and fetched the stockings and other things.</p>

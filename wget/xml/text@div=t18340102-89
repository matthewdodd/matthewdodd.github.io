The prisoner had been in my service from August last - on the 24th of December I desired Mr. Seddons and Mr. Sands to go to my shop and make purchases of the prisoner - it was his duty to put all the money he took into the till, and to put down all the articles he sold in this book, which I afterwards copied into the till-book.</p>

            . I went to the prosecutor's shop on the 24th of December - I bought two quires of paper and some pens - I paid the prisoner a shilling, which had been marked, and three pence in copper.</p>
               <p>MR. ADAMS. This is the prisoner's book - he has entered for the first of these purchases only three memorandum books, 9d., for the second only 1s. 6d., and for the third only 6d. - when I went home I asked the prisoner what he had been doing - he said, "A little" - I called an officer and gave him into custody - this marked shilling was found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many marked shillings had been put into the till? A.Five in all - I found fourteen sixpences in the till - I don't know how many I left when I went out - there might have been sixpences put into the till - I had a good character with the prisoner - I have sometimes found a few pence more in the till than the book would account for - I cannot swear that it has not been as much as a shilling - it may have been the case, that if two or three customers were in the shop, the entries have not been made till they were gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written)."The unfortunate error which has brought me here I cannot account for. I can only offer you a few remarks upon the nature and conduct of Mr. Adams's business, which I trust may lead you to believe, as I assure you the fact is, that my error has arisen from mistake, and not from a disposition to wrong my employer.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020045"></xptr>The articles sold in Mr. Adams's shop are many of them of very small value, such as memoranda-books, steel pens, a quire of paper, &amp;c.; for such trifling articles many customers come in, in the day; sometimes several are in the shop together. The goods are bought, the customer pays, and perhaps wants change, and has it. For strict regularity, and to prevent the possibility of mistake, the entry of each sale should be made on the instant; if, however, a shopman were to go to the book to enter a sale to one customer, while another, or perhaps two or three others, were waiting in the shop to be served, they would become displeased at the delay, and leave the shop without purchasing at all; the consequence is, that it frequently happens that several different small articles are sold to different persons, and no entry made till the shop is clear; it then becomes difficult to recollect what article was bought by one person, and what by another; the money in the till and the memory are the only means by which the entries can be made. I had, on the morning in question, sold several different articles to a variety of people; I could not precisely recollect the articles sold to each individual, or the money paid for each kind of article; and I entered, to the best of my memory, the correct sums against particular parcels of goods, and I found the amount in the till and that in the book balance; and although I may not, and fear, as the evidence stands, have not made correct entries of the articles sold, and prices paid, I earnestly hope you will believe me when I say, that the gross amount of money received is correct, and not one farthing more was paid me than is put down. If I had intended to have embezzled my master's money, should I have placed it in the till? It is more reasonable to suppose that I should have put it in my pocket, and in my pocket the marked money would have been all found; but, gentlemen, only one shilling of that money was found on me, the whole of the rest was found in the till. If the sum which I am charged with embezzling had been found upon me, it would have operated against me; my own money was found by the officer, and amongst it one of the marked shillings, and that I can account for. I had two sixpences in my pocket. They are convenient for change, and I put them into the till, taking in lieu a shilling out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith, Mr. Moginie, Mr. Rouse, Mr. Kennett, Mrs. Matthew, and Mrs. Bertenshaw, gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

             sworn. - My husband is a bricklayer; about the middle of March, the prisoner came to me, and asked me to lend her a shilling, and she would leave me that duplicate till Monday; a woman that I met at the door, Mrs. Crane, told me it was stole, and desired me to take it to Mr. Farmer's.</p>

I know them to be mine; I bought them at the corner of St. Swithin's alley; they were under lock and key at the time they were stole; my house was in a deal of confusion; I had two physicians attending, and an apothecary three or four times a day; I believe I left the key somewhere careless; I have had them in my hand since Mrs. Farmer's death.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I saw you, Mr. Farmer, did I not say that Mrs. Farmer gave them me; the reason was, you once broke a pair of earrings in her ears, and therefore she would not wear any more, you were so passionate; they were given me by the deceased upon my word; I have been backwards and forwards for a twelvemonth; I am not saying but he paid me honest and just, but his treatment to his wife was bad.</p>

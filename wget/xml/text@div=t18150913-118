I missed them about the 12th of July; I don't know who took them of my own knowledge. The prisoner was a lodger of mine; he was accused of stealing them on the 20th of July, and then he said he brought them from America with him. I had had them I don't know how long. A publican told me he had bought them of the prisoner. I am sure they are mine; they had been marked J S with a C over it, and the C was picked out. We could see it was marked with blue where the C had been. The publican is here.</p>

            . I am the wife of Mr. Cooke. I missed some tablecloths some time after the prisoner had left our lodgings; he said he was going to lodge at Mrs. Wilson's in Nottingham-place. On my missing the tablecloths, I went to Mrs. Wilson, having heard he had offered some to her for sale. I told him I had missed them: but he said, those which he had offered to Mrs. Wilson, he had brought from America with him, and that they were his property. I begged to see them; but he said, he could not produce them, as he had given them to a brother officer, of the name of Dodd, who was then at Portsmouth. The next morning, the tablecloths were found at Mr. Teasdale's, the publican's; I knew them to be my tablecloths, and the C was picked out. I went to the prisoner's lodgings again, but found he was gone to others, a Mrs. Burton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. I believe the defendant has been serving in the British Army in America. I had a reference for his character to Mr. Glover, Secretary at the Admiralty. I believe it was four or five weeks before the prisoner was examined before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>ANN WILSON. On the 21st of June, the prisoner came to lodge at my house; it was the same day that he left Mrs. Cooke's; he offered me four tablecloths to sell; I observed, I should like to know where he got them? he said, he had bought them of a brother officer, at Bermuda, who told him that he had given ten dollars for the largest of them, for a mess-cloth. I did not purchase them of him. I afterwards saw the same tablecloths at Teasdale's, the publican's, and those which he has now produced are the same.</p>

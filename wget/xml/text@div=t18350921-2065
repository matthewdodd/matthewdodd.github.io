                  </hi>. I am in the employ of John Williams, of the Norfolk Arms strand. On the 18th of September, about half-past nine o'clock at night I was at the first-floor window and saw three men standing round the prosecutors's windows, which is opposite—one of them appeared boring something, as if to break the glass—they stood at the left hand corner of the shop window quite close together—I saw one of them put his hand in the window where the glass was broken—I did not hear it breaking—Watford is the one who was boring—he stood on the right-hand side, and was twirling his hands as if he was breaking the glass, for about five mi<lb></lb>nutes—I then went down stairs, crossed the road, and informed Mr. Simp<lb></lb>son what was going on—they not see me, as they were looking into the window—they were gone form the window then—they left just before I quitted the window—I then returned to master's window, stopped there a minute or two, and saw Watford walking to and for, as if looking out for a chance to get something out of the window—I went and pointed him out to Mr. Simpson, who took him—I know nothing of the other prisoner—I am sure Watford is the man who was whirling his arm, bor<lb></lb>ing at the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an hosier and glover, and live at No. 178, Strand. Goatley came to me on Friday night, the 18th, between nine and ten o'clock—he came over first, about half-past nine o'clock, and gave me some information, and in consequence of that, I went and examined my window, and found it was perfectly secure—he came over very shortly afterwards—I then went out and examined my window, and found a pane of glass broken or cut, and a piece out of it large, enough to admit a person's hand—this piece of glass fell inside, on a piece of handker<lb></lb>chief—It appears as if it had been cut completely out—It was perfectly smooth, and the rest of the pane remained—the piece taken out was as oval cut from corner—that was done between the first and second time of his coming over—the remainder of the pane was perfectly smooth—there were some pieces of silk handkerchief in that pane of glass—the hole was cut about three inches above the silk-handkerchiefs, and was large enough to admit a person's hand, and a piece of silk to be drawn through, for I tried it—I took Watford into custody about two minutes after I saw the hole—I was talking to Duke at my door, and he pointed out Watford—that was after I had discovered the hole—I seized him—he asked what I took him for—I said he knew as well as I did—he said I had no business to pull him about—a policeman then came up and took him—I do not think there was any body in the shop at the time Duke gave the information the first time—I did not leave the shop, but the noise is so great in the street that a whole pane of glass might he broken and I not hear it—I must have been in the shop at the time it was done—I can only see the top of the window in the shop, for the goods in the window concealed the corner in which this happened—It is impossible for me to see it—I do not think my boy was in the shop at the time—I think he was getting his supper—some braces were hung over where the aperture was made, and some were lying on the silk handkerchiefs—I think they had been pulled out of their place or they might have got there by accident or my boy might have displaced them; with that exception I do not think any think had been displaced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined Q.</hi> There is a great deal of noise in that part of the street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; my window is not above one foot and a half from the ground—the hole is, I should think, two feet and a half from the ground—the noise that prevents our hearing, is caused by omnibuses and car<lb></lb>riages passing every minute—I should apprehend that if they were passing exactly at the time, they might prevent a person on the opposite side seeing a hand in the window—I have had a whole pane knocked in, and not heard it—I am quite sure the window was not broken after Duke first came to me—he being on the first floor, I should think could see the pane of glass he might have been even over an omnibus—he was not ex<lb></lb>actly</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty on the night in question about half-past nine o'clock and saw the two prisoners standing at the corner of a court, nearly opposite the prosecutor's premises—I should think about thirty yards distance—I observed them several times between half-past nine and ten o'clock, when I passed backwards and forwards on my best—they sometimes separated; Barrett went up the court leading to Holywell-street whenever he saw me coming, and Watford invariably went up or down the Strand—this happened about three times—they were standing still, with their heads protruding out of the court, and as I came up one went up the court, and the other up or down the Strand—I am certain they are the men—I had notseen them before that night, but I have some slight notion of Barrett—after observing them three time, I heard a cry of "Stop thief," from the premise of Simpson—I was then farther down the Strand, the saw Barrett running towards me from Mr. Simpson's—he was running as fast as he could—I ran after him—he turned down Arundel-street, and I followed him—I was never nearer to him than thirty or forty yards—I called "Stop thief"—I did not see him stopped, but came up just at the time—I found a man had got him by the collar—I am sure he is the man I had seen three times with Watford, and whom I saw running—I took him from the man.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of the prosecutor. On the night in question, I stood at the door when master went out—I could see into the street—that was after Duke had given the information—as I stood at the door, I saw Barrett and Watford over the way, on the op<lb></lb>posite side of the street—Watford was standing with his back towards Barrett, and looking towards the public-house; and Barrett was looking towards our shop—Duke came over to master, and told him that was the person over the way in the brown coat—I did not hear him give infor<lb></lb>mation about Warford—he pointed to the one in the brown coat—I be<lb></lb>lieve it was Barrett—I did not give any name to the Magistrate; I said, he pointed to the one in the brown coat—Duke pointed with his finger towards his master's house, where they were standing, and said, "That is one in the brown coat"—Mr. Simpson immediately ran over, and laid hold of the one in the brown coat—the other did not observe it, as he was looking in at the public-house—his back was towards him—when the prisoner turned round, and observed Mr. Simpson, he got hold of the other one's collar, he immediately ran—that was the one (<hi rend="italic">pointing to Watford</hi>) that was taken on the spot—he had a brown coat on at the time—the other immediately ran away down Arundel-street, and turned down Water-street</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210154"></xptr>
               <p>and I after him—I laid hold of his collar, and had not time to say any thing, before he struck me—there was a cry of "Stop thief"—I am sure the man who struck me, was the man who had been standing with the man in the brown coat—I never lost sight of him till after he struck me; he then got out of my sight, and the policeman took him—I was on the ground, and when I got up, the policeman had got him—I am sure Barrett is the one who ran away—he knocked me down on my knees, and said, "You b----y young b----r if you don't let go, I will knock your brains out"—he struck me on the left ear, and knocked me on the knees.</p>

               <p>CHARLOTTE ROGET. I am single. On the 3d of April, between twelve and one o'clock. I was in Great Russell-street, Bloomsbury - I saw the prisoner as I was crossing <placeName id="t18260406-172-crimeloc923">George-street</placeName>

I was surrounded by a very great crowd, which impeded my progress - and when he was secured I got out of the crowd; my reticule contained the articles stated in the indictment. I saw him at Bow-street on the Monday following.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and found a sovereign upon him: I took him from the information I had received, that there had been a robbery committed - he said he knew nothing at all about it; I asked him where he got the sovereign - he said he had saved it by 2d. and 3d. at a time - he said he sold lamp cottons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing about it. I had saved a sovereign, and was going to change it that day, to go to market with. I am innocent of the charge - my father and mother are dead; I was apprentice to a shoemaker, but my sight failing I could not follow it, but took to selling lamp cottons.</p>

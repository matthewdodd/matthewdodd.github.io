On Friday, by enquiry, we learned where Frazier lived, we went to his house about eleven o'clock in the day, between eleven and one, I will not be positive just to the time; we knocked at the door; we tapped again at the door; she told us she would not open it, that the person belonging to the house was out, was gone to the London Infirmary, the woman belonging to the house was; I immediately lifted up the parlour window. Mr. Griffiths, who is a brother officer, he got in at the window<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150030"></xptr>and I got in after him; the door was fastened, which they refused to open, Mr. Griffiths going up stairs, meets Frazier in the passage, as he was going along the passage to go up stairs, Frazier came to the door as I stood at the door; the door was not open, but I was inside; I asked him what his name was? he told me his name was Hall; he is the one nearest the jury; I told him his name was not Hall; I asked him if he kept the house? and he said, yes; then says I, your name is Frazier; and says he, what if it is Frazier? I told him he was wanted; I did not tell him for what. While Mr. Griffiths was up stairs I opened the door and let Mr. Coombes in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let him in after you saw Frazier or before? - After. We then went into the parlour where this woman was, the back part of the parlour was dark, in which there was a bed on a turn up bedstead; Muslin was standing between the bed and the wall, standing up as right as he could stand, then it gave me suspicion that Collyer was there; I immediately turns down the bed, and Collyer was lying on his back on the bed, the house was searched afterwards but not by me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There was no butter found or butter tub? - No.</p>

When we came to the door we knocked at it, and a young woman answered, she would not open the door, and Taplin threw up the window, and Taplin and Griffiths got in first; Mr. Taplin opened the door for me, and I went in, Mr. Griffiths and I went up stairs and searched the up stairs room, but found nobody there; we came down and searched the lower room, there I saw the prisoner Muslin standing behind the bedstead; Collyer was wrapped up in the bed clothes of a half tester bed; I saw Frazier when I first entered the house, he said that his name was Hall, if we wanted Frazier he would go out and fetch Frazier, Mr. Taplin told him that he knew his name was Frazier.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. In your searching the house there was no butter tub or butter found at all? - No.</p>

               <p>I was one of the officers. On the 18th of December I received information of a man being robbed near Stepney; on the 19th I took John Clarke; on the 20th I, in company with Taplin and Coombes, took Frazier, Collver, and Muslin, at No. 1, Dean-street, East Smithfield; I knocked at the door, they refused to open the door; Taplin listed up the window and I went in, Taplin followed me; I went into the passage to go to the stairs, and I met Frazier, Taplin asked him his name; I did not justly hear what he said, I was going up stairs; I went up two pair of stairs, there sat a woman, I asked if any body else was there? she said no; I asked for the key of the one pair of stairs room; she said she had not got it; I came down and called for the key of the one pair of stairs room; it was brought me by Coombes; I unlocked the door and went in, but no person was there; I came down and went into the room, I went in first; Frazier was with Taplin in the room; after being a few minutes in the room, I believe it was Coombes, saw Muslin standing by the bed side, Taplin went to the bed to examine whether Collyer was there, and he found him in the bed with the bed turned up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You did not find any sirkin or butter? - No.</p>

            , I cannot rightly tell you the day of the month, it is about a month ago; we were going up Whitechapel, in going up Whitechapel we saw a little boy with two five shilling papers of halfpence, ten shillings worth; immediately Muslin said let us follow the boy, we followed the boy as far as Union-street, Whitechapel; then we snatched the ten shillings worth of halfpence out of the boy's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of this business of Hennen's? - We took the ten shillings-worth of halfpence from this boy and went up to Bow Common-fields, and they gave me three shillings and four pence; we went round and we met with John Frazier in Bethnal Green-road, then we went to a public house to have something to drink, going up White Horse-lane we met with this young man with the butter; this was about five or six o'clock in the evening; immediately when we were going along there I saw the man's butter fall down; as soon as the butter fell down I saw the man fall down.</p>

            Who knocked him down? - I cannot rightly say who knocked him down, it was one of the three; but the people running after them they all run spread on to Stepney Church-yard, and I ran, when I came to Stepney Church yard they came up to me; I never asked them whether they had got the butter or any thing. One of them took the butter but which of them I cannot say; I saw one of them take the butter.</p>

               <p>Q. How came they to take it? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did it lay when they took it? - It lay in the road.</p>

               <p>Q. Did either one take it up the second time? - One had it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you all go to Stepney Church yard different ways? - No, only I was before them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see which way they went? - No, only I happened to stop there, and they came running by.</p>

               <p>Q. You told us just now that you had part of the ten shillings. How came that? - They gave me three shillings and fourpence.</p>

            They gave it you, why? - I don't know, because they got it in that way, and I was with them, one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you a right then to part of the butter, or what the butter would fetch? - I never asked them about it.</p>
               <p>Q. What past when you got to the Church-yard? - They went right up Ratcliff Highway.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the prisoners live? - I don't know where they live; I know where one of them lived, I don't know where the other two lived, Richard Collyer lived in Thrawl-street, Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the others live? - I never heard; I never was in their company much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see either of these prisoners at No. 1, Dean-street? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How many public houses had you been in from the morning to the time this matter happened? - One.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a number of people about at the time this robbery took place? - There was nobody about but ourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Where there no boys about? - Not that I saw; that I swear positive.</p>
               <p>Q. If these three men are convicted there will be three times forty pounds reward? - I cannot tell I do assure you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Frazier. I keep this house No. 1, Dean-street, East Smithfield; I let it out in different apartments, and each lodger wants a key to the street door to let themselves in and out; two or three of these keys I brought from my father's and friends, and the rest I bought at an old iron shop to try if they would sit the lock of the door. I have witnesses to call that are sufficient to prove that these witnesses have perjured themselves every one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Muslin. As I was going down Whitechapel, I met with Collyer and Clarke, and they pressed me to go with them to get a bag of saw dust. Coming down Bethnall-green-road we saw a bullock, and a quantity of people about trying to put a halter about its neck, and we stopped there some time, and after that we had something to drink; coming up White Horse-lane we met this man with the butter, we were very much in liquor, we had stopped at the Rising Sun, in Bethnall-green, and had several pots of beer and other liquor in the public house; coming up this lane we ran against this lad, not thinking any harm, and came our ways home directly.</p>

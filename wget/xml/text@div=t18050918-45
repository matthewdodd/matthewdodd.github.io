             sworn. - I took in the petticoat myself from the line up at the two pair of stairs window; it hung there on a pole which is for the accommodation of the lodgers; I placed it on the bannisters; I saw the prisoner go up stairs, I thought he was a strange man, and being a washing I watched him; I saw him take the petticoat from off the bannisters; I was afraid to stop him at my own apartment, there being no one with me, for fear he should knock me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come down stairs with it? - A. Yes; I followed him into the passage; I asked him who he wanted, and passed him, and shut the door to, and shut him in the passage; I then returned, and asked him again who he wanted; he told me he wanted Mrs. O'Hara.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any Mrs. O'Hara in the house? - A. There was such a person, but I did not know her name, she had been in the house a fortnight; I told him he had property about him that did not belong to him; I put my hand to his breast, and took the petticoat from under his coat; he bid me not be foolish, and let him go; I told him I would not be foolish, and let the petticoat go; he was secured, and I delivered the petticoat to Mr. Gregory.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a single<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180041"></xptr>woman, are you? - A. No, I am a married woman, my husband's name is

               <p>Q. The poor man came into the house, and said he wanted Mrs. O'Hara? - A. He did not say so till after he had stole the petticoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say that his wife slept in the house with Mrs. O'Hara - she had left him, he thought it was her's, and he took the petticoat to punish her? - A. He said so at Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the petticoat wet? - A. It was a little.</p>
               <p>- GREGORY sworn. - I am a constable, I was sent for to take him into custody; I took the petticoat, and I searched him; I found three duplicates on him, one a pledge for a watch; I asked him how he came to take the petticoat; he said, he meant no harm, he should have delivered it to the landlady; I took him to Marlborough-street, I went to the different shops where the duplicates mentioned, they told me he dealt in watches, and pledged many things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 7th of August, when I came home from my work, my wife and I had some words; my wife went out, and I staid at home; the next morning I got up, the children told me their mother was gone to Mrs. O'Hara's; I went to No. 3, Leicester-street, to desire the mother to come home; I had sent my little boy before there, he not returning I was afraid he had lost himself; I went up stairs to Mrs. O'Hara's room, nobody answered me; coming down stairs I took the petticoat, I thought it was my wife's or Mrs. O'Hara's; when the gentlewoman followed me down stairs, she said, young man, you have got my petticoat; I said, is it your's, then take it; she said, stop there a minute; she went out, and brought an officer; I stopped till she came back with him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

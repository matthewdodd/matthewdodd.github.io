             sworn. - I am an officer: On the 1st of April, a little before nine at night, in Wellclose-square, I saw the two prisoners in close conversation together; Kemp had a piece of timber; they were talking very low, which gave me a suspicion; after a few minutes they parted; the prisoner Kemp put the timber on his shoulder, and went towards Parson's-street, East-Smithfield, and Norrish went towards Well's-Gardens; I followed the prisoner Kemp into Parson's-street; he stopped at a chandler's-shop, and took the timber off his shoulder, and laid it down by the kerb-stone; he then went into the shop, and, in about seven or eight minutes after that, he returned with a lighted candle; he then went into the cellar underneath the shop; he came out of the cellar again with a saw; he then took up the timber, and was going to cut it; I caught him by the collar, and asked him where he brought that from; he told me a man had given it to him to carry, but he did not know who that man was; at that time the prisoner Norrish came down to the same shop, with the fellowpiece; my brother officer,

             sworn. - Corroborated the evidence of Smith.</p>
               <p>- SIMMONDS sworn. - I am a lawyer; I sawed this timber for Mr. Waller before it was stolen; I knew it to be his property; I had seen it about two or three days before it was taken away; they were both cut out of one piece; I sawed them at Mr. Bartlett's timber-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take them to the building in Well's-Gardens? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pratt. Q. Was this shiptimber? - A. No; I cut it for joists; I cut a nail in two in it with a saw, which is very remarkable.</p>
               <p>Q. I should think pieces of joists must be very much alike; how could you know every distinct piece? - A. I cannot say as to that.</p>
               <p>Q. It is nothing extraordinary that you should meet with a nail in an old piece of timber? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never saw any other piece of timber, of the same length, the same thickness, and the same quality? - A. Yes, a great number, the same day, for Mr. Waller.</p>
               <p>Waller. I have no doubt of its being my timber; there were two mortice holes, at a certain distance from the end, which is very different from any of the rest; they laid at the outside of the rest; I missed them from the outside; it is twenty-five feet long.</p>


               <p>Kemp's defence. On the 1st of April, I was at a public-house, eating my supper, about eight o'clock in the evening; Norrish told me he had brought two pieces of wood, and asked me to assist in taking it home; I went with him, and he brought two pieces, and placed them against the rails; I took it for him to where this cellar was, and the officer took me.</p>
               <p>Norrish's defence. I bought them for five shillings, for fire-wood.</p>
               <p>The prisoners each called four witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

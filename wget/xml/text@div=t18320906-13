In May, 1831, I lived at No. 8, King-square, near the back of Mr. Kent's premises - I and my mother were sitting up on the night of the 6th of May, at work; I remember, at an early hour in the morning, going to draw the curtains of the window - I looked out of the window, and saw two men, who were the two prisoners; they were close against the dust-bin; I observed their faces particularly - the tallest (Anderson) had his face towards me; they both stood there - I saw Cross' face, but not then; when he turned away from the dust-bin, I saw his face - it was day-light, just before four o'clock in the morning, and I saw two females standing at a distance from the dust-bin: one of the females had two baskets in her hand; each of the prisoners took a parcel from the dust-bin, and put it into the woman's baskets - they were wrapped in brown paper; the woman's bonnet came off, and the other female put her hand to her head, and put her bonnet on; Cross said,"Never mind your bonnet, come along without it" - she said, "Harry, I must have my bonnet, it looks so to go without it, but you cut" - that woman was convicted this time last year; her name was Sarah Hooker - they all went away, the men rather before the women; the two men had occasion to pass our window as they went away; my mother and I opened the door, and went out; when the women said to the men, "You cut;" my mother said she thought it was time - we followed, and watched them into Long-alley; I gave information there to a private watchman - the dustbin is near the wall, at the back of the prosecutor's premises; I saw Cross at the time the female was having her examination at Worship-street, and recognized him as the man I had seen in the morning, and pointed him out - he saw me and my mother noticed him, and went away; my mother pointed him out to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long ago was that examination? A. This time twelvemonths - I have never seen Cross since till I saw him in the House of Correction, in August - I had not seen him before that occasion; it was quite day-light - my mother had the same opportunity of seeing as I had; I am quite positive he is the same person.</p>
               <p>Anderson. Q. Did you know me before? A. No; I have not seen you since, till you were at Worship-street last month - the dust-bin is about three yards from the window, which was shut.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you point them out to the watchman? A. Yes; the two men and the two women - he pursued them directly.</p>

            . In May, last year, I lived in Ballyard, Golden-lane; I know Cross - I remember his coming home at a quarter to four o'clock, one morning in May, and calling his wife up; she took out two baskets with her - she was afterwards convicted here; she was my sister - I heard she was taken up that morning; Cross went out with her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was she married to Cross? A. Yes.</p>

            . I know this parcel of silk; it is Mr. Kent's property, I am quite certain - here is my mark on the other parcel; it is Mr. Kent's - I had packed them up the day before; they both have my hand-writing on them - there are near 20 lbs. of silk here.</p>
               <p>Anderson's Defence. I am totally innocent of the offence, and hope you will consider it is sixteen months ago since the robbery was committed; the woman says the dust-bin is three yards from the window, which was shut down, and she did not know me before nor since - I deny knowing Cross.</p>
               <p>Cross' Defence. I am totally innocent of the charge; as to my fetching the woman out, it is certainly false - I do not deny having lived with her, but I had left her some months before; as to the people swearing to me, they say they never knew me previous, nor since, and they had but a short view - I was not prepared for my trial; I knew nathing of it till Saturday morning, when I was fetched here - I did not know what I had to meet, or anything, and could not get my brief drawn up in a proper manner; another thing I have to state, that is, that on the 6th of May, in the evening, I went to Mr. Hewitt's and had tea there; I occasionally used to work for him then - I had previously worked constantly for him, and I was there from five till close upon three o'clock in the morning, waiting for Mr. Hewitt to come home, to borrow 5s. of him.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner Cross a good character.</p>

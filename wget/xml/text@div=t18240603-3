            . I live in the house - my father does not; it is our joint property. My father has not slept in the house for two years; the lease of the house is his. On the 23d of April an opposite neighbour gave me information; I went out, and saw the two prisoners at the shop window; we have two windows to the shop. One of them stood with his back to the window, and the other with his face to it. I noticed them particularly - they walked away on my going into the street, and very shortly after one of my servants gave me information; I went out again, and the prisoners were then moving from the window; I caught hold of them both within a yard of the window, and a piece of silk handkerchiefs containing six handkerchiefs dropped from the person of one of them; it is worth 50 s. cost price - it is one entire piece of handkerchiefs; there is a line between each handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. When you buy them are they charged by the number of handkerchiefs or by the piece - A. By the number of handkerchiefs; the invoice specifies it to be six handkerchiefs - it is not applicable to any other purpose; we call it in our shop a piece of silk handkerchiefs; the value of each handkerchief is 8 s. 4 d. prime cost. The piece has not been cut since I bought it. I cannot say which of them dropped it: they were both going away together - I seized them both, and it fell between them; I set my foot on it. I am sure they are the persons whom I saw at the window when I first went out; they were in company. I saw the handkerchiefs in the window when I first went out. Part of the pane of glass had been cut out in order to get it - it was whole about an hour before, when I saw it. The handkerchiefs are the property of myself and my father.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Your father has not resided in the house for two years - A. No. The house is occupied by my family alone; my father lives in the country, and comes occasionally to dine with me, but does not sleep in the house. I call the property six handkerchiefs; it is in one piece, not separated, but there is a border to each handkerchief; the mark between each handkerchief is cotton instead of silk; it is merely a mark to guide the scissars in cutting it.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible to use one without using the whole till they are separated - A. Certainly; the size of each handkerchief is marked. I had been outside about an hour before to see how the window was dressed, and saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030005"></xptr>it all safe. I found afterwards that it had been cut by some instrument.</p>
               <p>SPRIG HARMERWOOD. I live in the Strand, opposite to Mr. Christian. On the 23d of April, at half-past ten o'clock in the morning I saw the prisoners together; one was looking in at the window, and the other had his back to the window, looking towards my shop; they went away together towards Hungerford-market, and returned again in five or ten minutes together, and looked in at the window, and in about a minute went towards Northumberland House, and went backwards and forwards three or four times, stopping at the window every time. I suspected that they were after no good, and took a description of them down on paper to give to the officers - I got a friend in my shop to watch them while I served a customer - he called out</p>
               <p>"They have got them," and I ran over to Mr. Christian's assistance, who had hold of them - they are the men I had seen lurking about.</p>

            . I live in Fox-court, Brook-street, Holborn. On the morning in question, about a quarter to ten o'clock, I was at the top of St. Martin's-lane, and saw the prisoners together, and knowing them before, I watched them for five minutes; they were talking together. I went on, and as I returned from Piccadilly, in the Haymarket I saw Mr. Christian following them; he collared them, and called for assistance, and I saw Nibbs fling the handkerchiefs from under his coat - Mr. Christian put his foot on them. I assisted him.</p>

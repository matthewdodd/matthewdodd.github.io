             sworn. - I keep a clothes-shop at Brenford: On Monday, the 21st of September, between nine and ten in the morning, the prisoner brought me a jacket and a coat, which I bought of him; I asked him if they were his own property, and he said his uncle had given them to him; he said, he was out of work at that time; I hung the jacket out for sale, at the door, and Mrs. Watkins came and claimed it; the prisoner came again, to ask me to buy something else, and I stopped him; he persisted in the same story, that his uncle had given them to him.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Watkins). Who left the house last, you or your wife? - A. I did; we left the house about half past nine, the night before, Sunday; it was dark then; I saw the windows all safe; we returned together.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any marks of violence? - A. Yes; a pane of glass was taken out, and the shutters were open; we returned on the Monday evening, between five and six o'clock.</p>

               <p>- EAGLES sworn. - I am a constable, (produces the property).</p>

               <p>Kilsby. These are the same that I received from the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Watkins. These shoes I know to be mine, by a cut in the toe, when I was cutting savoys; the jacket, I know, by two holes burnt by the fireside, drying.</p>

               <p>prisoner's defence. They can't prove that I broke the house open.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Watkins ). Did you know the boy before? - A. He had worked for me and for my father.</p>

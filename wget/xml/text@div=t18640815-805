                  </hi>. I live at 89, Waterloo-road, Kingsland-road—about 4 on the afternoon of 15th July, I was standing with my friend Mrs. Howard, at the end of Talbot-court, Gracechurch-street, waiting for an omnibus—I saw some one at the side of me—I could not swear it was the prisoner—at that time a young man drew my attention to my pocket and said, "Your purse is gone"—I felt in my pocket, and said, "Yes"—it was in my pocket before—I had a half sovereign, one or two sixpences, a three<lb></lb>penny-piece, two receipts, and a linendraper's bill—two or three minutes afterwards I saw the prisoner in the custody of a policeman—she was taken to the station house—I went there with my friend, and stated that my purse was gone, and what was in it—the prisoner did not disown having taken it at all—she made some remark—I saw a half-sovereign and two sixpences on the desk in the station, and the two receipts which were in my purse—my name was on them—I have not got the purse here.</p>

I live at 3, Frederick-place, Upper Clapton—I was standing by the side of the last witness on this occasion—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner by my side—I am sure she is the woman—I did not see her go away—I heard some one call Miss Sampson's attention to her pocket—the pri<lb></lb>soner had gone away then—I afterwards saw her in custody.</p>

About a quarter to 4 on the afternoon of 15th July, from some information I received, I went through Talbot-court, into Whitechapel, and saw the prisoner talking to a man—they saw me when I got within two yards of them, and the man ran away—the prisoner attempted to do so, and I stopped her—her right hand was closed, and I held her tight—I told her she would be charged with picking a lady's pocket—she said, "Oh no, not me; I am innocent!"—I kept her hand closed till we got to the station—I heard Miss Sampson state the particulars of her loss, and I told the prisoner she could put on the ledge what she had got in her hand, which she did—there was a half-sovereign, two sixpences, a threepenny-piece, and these receipts, which Miss Sampson identified—the prisoner said that the man took them and gave them to her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Bennett, tobac<lb></lb>conist, Belvedere-road, Lambeth—on the 11th of Feb., about half-past two o'clock, I was in my kitchen—I heard a bell ring which is attached to the shop-door—I went up and saw a young man in the shop—he asked for a cigar—I served him, and he left—I closed my gate after him and returned to my kitchen—I had not been there three minutes before I heard a noise—I went up and found the prisoner behind the counter—I am sure he is the per<lb></lb>son—his handkerchief was on the counter with three bundles of cheroots in it, which had been removed from the window—he had got hold of 8 fourth bun<lb></lb>dle in the window, and some of the cigars had been removed—I attempted to seize him—he knocked me backwards and ran out—I pursued—he was taken in Waterloo-road—I am sure he is the person—I never lost sight of him.</p>

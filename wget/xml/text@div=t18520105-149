                  </hi>. I live in Russell-street, Bloomsbury, and keep a coffee-stall, in Cornhill—I have known the prisoner about twelve or thirteen years. On Monday morning, 1st Dec, I was at my coffee-stall, in Cornhill, between 5 and 6 o'clock—I was warming myself over my coffee-stall, and fell asleep—I awoke, and saw the prisoner there—I said to her, "There you are, I see"—she turned round, and said, "And there you are, you b----vagabond"—I told her not to make use of that expression, but to come round, and I would speak to her—there was no one there but her and me—I heard the coffee-tap turned, and in turning round to turn it off, I received a blow at the</p>

               <p>back-part of my head—I received more than one blow; I cannot say whether it was two or three, because the first blow stunned me—I fell over her against a truck—I did not hear the prisoner say anything before I fell—I came to myself perhaps in two or three minutes, when I ran to the fire-escape man, and begged of him to look after my things, for I must run to the hospital—I found my head bleeding—I got a man on the other side of London-bridge to help me—I went to Guy's Hospital, and have been there ever since, till last Friday afternoon—the prisoner had not asked me for any money, or anything, that morning—nothing more was said by either of us than I have stated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon, at Guy's Hospital. Burrell was brought there about 6 o'clock on this morning—he was not admitted then, bat I examined him—I found three small scalp wounds at the back<lb></lb>part of the head—they were then bleeding slightly, and had evidently been bleeding more—they had been inflicted with some blunt instrument, such as this (<hi rend="italic">produced by the officer</hi>)—I dressed his head, and he went away—he came back at 10—he was then labouring under some inflammatory symptoms, which induced me to detain him, and he remained there until last Friday—the wounds were not in themselves dangerous, but wounds in the head always are so—I cannot say that he was ever in danger.</p>

On Monday morning, 1st Dec, I was on duty near the Royal Exchange—Burrell came running to me, with his head bleeding—I saw the prisoner standing at the coffee-stall—he told me she had struck him on the head—I went back with him to the prisoner—she said, "I don't think I have hurt him, for I only hit him twice"—I took her into custody—as I was taking her to the station I heard her drop something—I got a light, and found it to be this knife (<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>)—this poker I took from her hand at the coffee-stall.</p>

I was at Bow-lane station, when the prisoner was brought there—this poker and knife were given to me—I found no marks of blood upon them—I said to the prisoner, "This will be a serious matter, if the man should die"—she replied, "I don't think I have hurt him much; I did not use the knife, I only struck him twice with the poker; but he has driven me to it by his conduct towards me, and during the whole of yesterday I had neither food or firing."</p>

September 20th, 1863,—I wish to state that I went behind the hay-stack that was on fire to light my pipe, because it was so windy. After I had lighted my pipe I threw the match down on the side of the rick, and the rick caught fire. I tried to put it out several times with my hand and cap, but could not do it."</p>

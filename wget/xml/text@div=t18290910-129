The prisoner was in my employ on the 6th of September - he had been working with me till the Saturday, and on the Sunday morning I said, "Will you come and shoe some horses in Doughty-mews, and I will give you your breakfast;" he came and took some tools, and went - he came back, and laid down the rasp; I thought he had laid down all the tools, but he had not - in the afternoon I heard that he had sold them; these are the articles; I took him about nine o'clock in the evening - he was not in liquor in the morning.</p>

                  </hi> I am a hop-factor, 17, Maze-pond, Southwark—I know the prisoner—he came to me in the beginning of Oct.—I showed him a sample of hops that went by the name of "Andrew's hops" from the grower, the bulk of which that was a sample was lying at Messrs. Nash, Hicks, and Co., Pickle-herring wharf—I saw him again on 8th Oct.—he said he could sell those hops if I would take 70<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt. for them—I had mentioned 75<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as the price—I told him I would take 70<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., provided they were sold to a respectable person, and delivered and sold in my name, and for me to receive the money—he said he had sold them for 72<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was his profit—he said he had sold them—he had not bought them—he said he could sell them at 72<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "Whatever you sell them at beyond 70<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., shall of course be your profit"—he then said he had sold them for 72<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to Messrs. Haynes and Son, maltsters, of Paddington—he did not say anything about the invoice till the Tuesday or Wednesday—I referred to the "<hi rend="italic">Directory</hi>," to see who Messrs.

Haynes do not?"—he said he would, and he did give it—the policeman has it=the hops were said he would, and he did give it—the policeman has it—the hops were worth about 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he asked for an order for their delivery, and I told him I would send the order to Mr. Haynes, and inclose him the invoice—on that he said that Mr. Haynes had not any hops by him, and that he wanted them immediately, that he was going to Paddington, and would take the order with him—I gave him this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this writing, which is on the back of it, was not there then—I believe it to be the prisoner's writing.</p>

                  </hi> I am the solicitor for the prosecution—I saw the undertaking, and made a copy of it, which I compared with the original, very particularly—the last time I saw the original was in the office here, on 17th—the policeman then had it in his hand—I had it in my hand and gave it back to him, because I was not concerned for Mr. Collins, only for Messrs. Nash—I kept the delivery-order, and produce it.</p>

The copy of the undertaking being read, was as follows:—"I undertake to pay Mr. R. Collins of seven pockets of hops, marked, 'Andrews, of Brook-street, Kent, 1846,' provided Messrs. Haynes and Son do not pay the same on or before Saturday next. J. Chittenden, Oct. 8, 1847."</p>

               <p>On the 25th of August, between nine and ten in the morning, Mr. Archer came to the counting-house, where I was, and said, Master, master, for God's sake come up, you will see such an inhuman thing you never saw in your life. I looked into the fields, and saw a cow lying down, and the prisoner at the hinder parts of her, with his body moving backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Where is your counting-house? - In <placeName id="t17790915-50-crimeloc256">Hoxton brick-fields</placeName>

               <p>Where was the prisoner? - In the field.</p>
               <p>How far is the counting-house from the field? - I suppose about eighty yards. I saw him lying at the hind part of the cow, nearly close, with the middle part of his body moving backwards and forwards. The cow was lying down. I called to Mr. Petit; he came forward by the time the prisoner got up from where he lay. The prisoner buttoned up his breeches, and moved forwards towards a bank. Afterwards he got up, and came to the counting-house, where Mr. Archer, Petit, and I, were.</p>
               <p>How long did he lie down there? - About the space of a minute, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Whose counting-house is it? - Mr.

            's, the brick-maker. When he came to the counting-house, Petit charged him with the crime, and asked him if there was never a bull in the field, that he was obligated to be the bull? He made for answer, he had no connexions with the cow he was sure. He attempted to run away, but Mr. Petit catched hold of him and secured him.</p>
               <p>How far from the cow and the man might you be? - I suppose about eighty yards.</p>
               <p>Was you near enough to see distinctly what passed? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to say whether he had this sort of connexion which you suppose he had with the cow or not? - I cannot no further than what I saw.</p>
               <p>Then all you mean to say is, you saw him in that posture near the cow, but whether he had carnal knowledge of the cow or not you do not know? - No; I do not.</p>

               <p>What did you see? - No more than what Mr. Clarkson has related about charging him with being a bull and so, and he denied the crime. I told him I was not his accuser, but Mr. Clarkson and Mr. Archer were.</p>
               <p>Then you saw nothing did you? - I was five hundred yards off at work. I saw nothing, only I heard them charge him with being a bull, and I saw him attempt to run away. I, being an officer, took charge of him.</p>
               <p>You did not see any thing yourself? - No; I did not.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of the action, but I was at his examination. After he was locked up, I took off his shirt to search him, and the flaps of his shirt were all daubed with cow-dung.</p>
               <p>You was not present at the time when he was secured? - No.</p>
               <p>When was it you took him up? - Mr. Petit took him, and brought him to Mr. Wilmot's office. I attend the jail to carry the prisoners backwards and forwards. I brought him to Newgate. He acknowledged the fact to me in the coach, and said he was very sorry for it.</p>

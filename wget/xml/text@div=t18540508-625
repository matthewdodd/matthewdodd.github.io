                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Robert Attenborough, a pawn-broker, of No. 11, Greek-street, Soho. I know the prisoner by the name of Llishman, that was the name he generally pawned in—on 9th Feb. he pawned a coat—I have no doubt that this is the coat (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) which he pawned on the 9th Feb.—it has now a ticket on it for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., pawned on the 14th—it is a black beaver coat, lined with plaid—I have sufficient memory to say that the coat pawned with me on the 9th Feb. was a black beaver, and lined with plaid, on which I lent 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 14th Feb. this coat was again pawned with me by a man of the name of Hayton—I had known him before—I had seen him with the prisoner—I lent 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the coat.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Mr. Attenborough has many houses, has he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has four—there are three assistants besides myself where I am—Mr. "Wellman is the only person who takes in pledges besides me—it is a very common thing for persons to traffic in pledges, and sell their tickets—my attention was called to the parcel which I say was substituted for this first coat, about a month or five weeks ago, about the middle of April—that was the time we examined our stock generally—it does sometimes happen that we advance more money on an article than it is worth, but we do not usually lend 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on a coat not worth more than 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have been blamed by Mr. Attenborough for advancing more money on articles than they are worth—in the hurry of business it is quite unavoid<lb></lb>able—I am thirty-four years old, and have been in the pawnbroking busi<lb></lb>ness eighteen years—I have taken in pledges about twelve years—I have been with Mr. Attenborough about four years—I have not sworn to this coat—to the best of my belief, it is the coat—there is no mark about it—it was pawned again on the 14th—we place the ticket on it with a pin—we dry the tickets with blotting paper—when the thing is settled, the article goes under the counter, but in process of time it goes in what we call a well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This ticket of 14th Feb. would be outside the wrapper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the wrapper in which this coat was is left at home—I cannot swear positively to this coat; it was a black beaver coat, with a blue plaid lining, that I took in on 9th Feb.; but there is no mark by which I know this—when the parcel is made up, and the customer gone, the parcel goes under the counter till it is booked, which it is shortly afterwards; always on the same day—it then goes in the warehouse, where it is arranged with other coats, according to the price; it remains there till it is brought down to be taken out, or to be looked at—persons come occasionally to see the pledges, perhaps to bring a friend, or to sell the ticket.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been assistant to Mr. Attenborough for two years. I have been seven years in the trade—I know the prisoner as pawn<lb></lb>ing at our shop—I remember his coming on 10th Feb.—he gave in a ticket of a coat for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; this is the ticket—it is dated on 9th Feb.; this ticket is my writing—Mr. Cotton took in the pledge, and I wrote the ticket at his direction—I saw the coat that was pawned on 9th Feb., I did it up—to the best of my belief this is the coat—I remember it was a black beaver coat, with a blue lining—I did it up in brown paper—when the prisoner pro<lb></lb>duced this ticket on 10th Feb., he laid it down; I do not remember what he said any more than he paid the interest, and had a new ticket in another</p>

               <p>name—when the parcel came down I gave it him, I only took the ticket off, and laid the parcel on the counter—I asked him if he was going to take it out; he said no, he wanted a new ticket—when I put it on the counter it was towards him; I cannot tell whether he touched it—he said he must have it renewed, or something of that sort—I had a new ticket written—here is the ticket of 10th Feb., it was written by the warehouse boy, by my direc<lb></lb>tion—the boy wrote it at the desk, no doubt—I was moving about, I have no doubt I turned fifty times; I was in several places during the time—I am quite confident that I lost sight of the parcel—the prisoner was about the middle box—there are five boxes—I think our counter is about three yards long in front of the boxes—I cannot remember what time of day this was—the boxes are not very light—you cannot see into them clearly—whilst I was walking about, the prisoner had the opportunity of substitut<lb></lb>ing one parcel for another—I remember this parcel was there, and after the ticket was written, I put the ticket on the parcel on the counter—I had no idea but it was the same parcel that was brought down—the string was on it—I remember pinning this ticket on it—the parcel was afterwards booked and sent up stairs in the usual way—my attention was called to it on 3rd April—we then examined all the parcels done in brown paper—we exa<lb></lb>mined this parcel—it was in brown paper, and had the ticket of 10th Feb. on it—it contained this coat, which I should think is not worth more than 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to lend on it—I can positively swear I never lent the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on this brown coat—the ticket of 10th Feb. for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was on it—I did not take it in on 9th Feb., I folded it up—I am certain that this brown coat is not the coat that I folded up on 9th Feb.—between the time that I placed the coat on the counter for him to examine it if he pleased, and the time the ticket was made out, and I pinned it on the parcel that was sub<lb></lb>stituted, about a minute and a half or perhaps a little more had elapsed—On 3rd March I took in a pledge of the prisoner of a shirt and handkerchief for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I believe I took it in at dinner-time, between 1 and half past 1 o'clock—he came again the same day—I think it was very shortly after<lb></lb>wards; he said he wanted the parcel down to have sixpence more advanced on it—I do not thick the parcel had then been put in the warehouse, we had not had time—it may be two or three hours before a parcel is booked and taken up in the warehouse—when the prisoner came I got the parcel, and told the warehouse boy to write a fresh ticket for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I put the parcel on the counter to the prisoner, the same as I did the coat—the pri<lb></lb>soner generally went in the same box—when the ticket was written I put it on the parcel, and put the parcel under the counter again—my attention was called to the parcel now before me about 3rd April—this parcel contains a shirt and a handkerchief—this shirt is not the one I took in, nor is the hand<lb></lb>kerchief—the handkerchief I took in was a silk handkerchief; this is a cotton handkerchief—we do not take in cotton handkerchiefs—this shirt is worth 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it is a night shirt, there is no front to it—the shirt I took in was a day shirt—a calico shirt with a linen front—I am quite certain I did not take in this shirt and handkerchief from this man on 3rd March—I should think you could buy this handkerchief new for 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have a ticket of a handkerchief pawned by the prisoner on 11th March, for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a ticket of a handkerchief pawned on 13th March for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took in a handkerchief of the prisoner on 11th March; I lent him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—I remember his coming again on 13th March, in reference to this handker<lb></lb>chief—I had this parcel of 11th March down, and he said he wished to pay sixpence off it, and put it in for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and have a new ticket—I changed</p>

               <p>the ticket for him, and pinned the ticket on it—this parcel has no string, that is all the difference—this parcel contains a black neck handkerchief—this is not the handkerchief which I took in on the 11th—this is a silk hand<lb></lb>kerchief, but it is full of holes—the one I took in on the 11th was a pocket handkerchief—I cannot recollect the colour of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How often have you had this black handkerchief out since? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only once; we had quite enough of it then—it was not exhi<lb></lb>bited at the Police Court—these things were not exhibited before the Magi<lb></lb>strate—it often happens that one person takes the things in, and some one else makes out the ticket—I am taking in pledges all day—in one day per<lb></lb>haps 200 are taken in, all sorts of things, and each person being anxious to be served as speedily as possible—this brown coat is worth about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to lend on—these things are done up very often some time after the pledge has been taken in—it is very rare we have them in papers—mostly in wrappers.</p>

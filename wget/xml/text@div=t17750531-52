            . On the 20th of May, Nathan and another man hauled me into a bad house, and hawled me up stairs. Gillis brought a candle and held it; they put a handkerchief in my mouth, and swore great oaths. One said, cut her cloaths off, and the other said cut them off. The other man held me, and

               <p>On her cross examination, she said they dragged her into the house about nine at night, and kept her there till seven or eight in the morning. That they held her on the bed. That they kept the handkerchief in her mouth till they went away, which was about seven or eight in the morning. That her cloaths were taken away in the night. That one held her while the other took the things away. That there was no light when they took her things away. That a candle was brought, but they put it out.</p>

            . On the 21st of May, about seven o'clock in the morning, I met the prosecutrix with a Jew girl, a woman of the town. The Jew girl told me the prosecutrix had been robbed, and shewed me the house, I went into the house and enquired if a young woman lay there with two men the night before. Gillis said, yes, but she did not know the men that brought her in; that she gave them a candle; and they gave her eighteen-pence for the lodging. I went, and found

               <p>I and one Powell met the prosecutrix, she said, she was going to Mile-end, and ask'd us to go a little way with her: We went; then we asked her to lie with us, and agreed to give her a crown between us: And she went to bed very willingly. I went out to get something to drink, when I returned, Powell was gone: And as he was gone, without paying his half, I would not pay mine; so I went about my business.</p>

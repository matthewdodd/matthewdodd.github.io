               <p>GEORGE CHAPMAN. I am a tidesman in the Excise. I was placed on board the Fairy, at Gravesend, she came from Virginia. On the 18th of April I accompanied her into the <placeName id="t18200517-77-crimeloc439">London Docks</placeName>

On the 23d of April, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner on the forecastle of the ship, and asked him what he wanted? he said he wanted to see a shipmate. I said there was no shipmate there, and he must go ashore. The cook of the ship was eating something on deck - he said the prisoner had come up the forecastle - he left the ship; Reader went after him, he said he had nothing about him. We found a quantity of tobacco tied round his waist in hands as it is packed - I found more in his hat; he said he had it from a person belonging to the ship. I found the bulk-head partly broken down, and planks removed to get at the hogsheads - part of one was broken and tobacco gone. I asked him several times to describe the man who gave it to him, he refused.</p>

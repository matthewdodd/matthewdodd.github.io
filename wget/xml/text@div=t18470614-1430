                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable B</hi> 123.) On the morning of the 2nd of June I went to Mr. Thompson's in Ecclestone-street—he desired me to follow the prisoner—I saw him go from Mr. Thompson's premises to Wilton<lb></lb>crescent—I saw him take a fitting from a lamp in Wilton-crescent, in the public street—he was there above an hour, as near as I can tell—when he had done. I follow him to a broker's shop in Ebury-street—I went in, and this fitting was standing on the counter—as soon as he saw me he said to the woman, "What do you want for this?" as if he was going to buy it—I stood for a minute or two, and I said, "Are you going to buy this, or to sell it?"—he said, "you want to know too much?" and said to the woman, "Have</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It is my duty to go and look at the gas-fittings; I took this one, and put it up in Wilton-crescent; there was no screw or washer to it; I knew it would require them if they were not there; I have been in the habit of taking them out and shifting them for years for Mr. Thompson.</p>

The prisoner was in my service occasionally for nine years—it was his business to attend to the gas-lamps when ordered, but on that day he was ordered not to go to that place—I am employed by the contractor, and I had to make this good—the prisoner was not employed to repair it—he put up another pipe in its place.</p>

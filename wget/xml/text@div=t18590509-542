                  </hi>. I am a labourer—on 29th March, about 11 in the morning, I was drinking in the Sugar Loaf public-house, Dockhead, Ber<lb></lb>mondsey—a man named Why brow was there—there was no quarrel, but they pulled me out to fight—we fought one or two rounds, and I said "I don't want to fight any more"—we left off and shook hands, and were good friends; but the prisoner, who stood by my side, put her hand to her hair, jobbed something into my eye, and the sight was gone—I had said nothing to her—I put my hand up, and the sight of my eye fell into my hand—a hair pin was found at my feet—I have been at the Opthalmic Hospital six weeks—the sight of the eye is quite gone—I do not suffer any pain now, but I cannot do any work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Pearce, and live at 5, Dock-head, Bermondsey. On 29th March, I was passing the Sugar Loaf, and saw the prosecutor and Whybrow fighting—the prosecutor's face was bleeding—he said, "I don't want to fight any more"—they left off for several minutes, and shook hands—I saw the prisoner there—I saw her take a hair-pin from her hair, and push it into the prosecutor's eye—she drove it in forcibly—I heard him call out, "Oh, my God! you have blinded me; the sight of my eye is gone"—he thought it was a knife—I picked up a hair-pin, and said, "No, this is what it was"—the prisoner stood there for a little while, and I fetched the prosecutor's young woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am visiting surgeon at the South London Opthal<lb></lb>mic hospital—I saw the prosecutor there three or four days after the acci<lb></lb>dent—I found a small punctured wound in the cornea, into which the iris protruded, and the lens was opaque; he had, in fact, cataract produced by the fracture; the sight is quite gone; there is a chance of recovery, through an operation for cataract—he is still a patient, but all the inflammation has sub<lb></lb>sided—it was such a wound as might be produced by the thrust of a hair-pin: it would have been dangerous had it penetrated further; cases of death have occurred from wounds to the eye; a very severe blow might cause the eye to burst; the brain is more easily reached through the eye than through the skull; but it would be a difficult thing to produce death by a hair-pin.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep Roding farm, at Wanstead. On 9th June, I had twenty-eight ducks—they were turned out on the river—I saw them safe a little after 2 o'clock—I went again in the evening, at half past 6 o'clock, or a little later—I went towards the river—I got about 150 yards from the cottage—I saw the prisoners throwing stones at something on the river—I got nearer to them, and saw they were throwing at my ducks—I saw one duck killed by the prisoners, but which of them threw the stone that killed it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185806140077"></xptr>
               <p>I cannot say—I got within about thirty yards of them—I did not know them before—I saw one duck killed, and one lying on the bank killed, and I saw Cansell take it up and put it inside his flannel jacket, and they both ran—I followed them I should think to within 500 or 600 yards of Cansell's house—I lost sight of them over the brow of the hill towards Cansell's house—I lost four ducks—one was taken away and one was lying dead on the water—Barrett was dressed in a blue Guernsey, a cap, and cord trousers—and Cansell had a flannel jacket, cord trousers, and a cap—I have no doubt they saw me before they ran.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, living at Walthamstow. On Wednesday, 9th of June, I was returning from my dinner, about a quarter or twenty minutes past 2 o'clock in the afternoon—I passed the prisoners in a field adjoining Mr. Wilkinson's premises; they were hanging on a gate—I knew them before, and have no doubt they were the men—Barrett had a blue Guernsey on, corded trousers, and a cap, and Cansell, a flannel jacket, a cap, and corded trousers.</p>

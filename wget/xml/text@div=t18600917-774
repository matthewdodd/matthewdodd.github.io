                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser, of Southampton-row, Holloway-road—On Saturday night, 8th September, the prisoner came in between 10 and 11 o'clock—he was shaved—I attended to him—when he got up he took the paper to read—he was standing near the gas-light and his cap caught fire—a customer told him of it and her said he would punch his head—I told him to go about his business, as I would not have customers insulted—he went out and came in again and insulted me, and said he would punch my head—he knocked me down—I get up again and tried to get him out of the shop—after a scuffle I got him out, and in the scuffle we both went down together—I was underneath, and he took my nose with his teeth and bit a small piece off the end—there was a piece of it fone—I called to my young man, and he came and pulled him off—I got up and he struck me again—I went in my shop, and he ran in the shop and knocked me down again—my nose bled and he ripped my shirt all to pieces.</p>

I live at 4, Matthew-street, Highbury-vale—I was in the prosecutor's shop when this affair took place—it was between half-past 10 and 11 o'clock—I saw the prisoner there; he stood reading the newspaper, with his back to the gas—his cap caught fire, and the gentleman who was being shaved said, "Your cap is too near the gas"—the prisoner put up his hand and his cap was on fire, and he began to call the gentleman every<lb></lb>thing he could think of—Mr. Hughes said, "I can't allow such language in my shop on Saturday night; you had better go out"—he went out of the shop and came in again and said, "You take it up, Mr. Barber"—Mr. Hughes said, "You had better go out or I shall put you out"—the prisoner said, "I will knock you down"—Mr. Hughes put his hand to his breast and pushed him out of the shop, and they both fought together just outside the door—I cannot tell what transpired outside, but Mr. Hughes came in again and was bleeding profusely from the nose—he said, "He has bitten me in the nose"—I saw it was bleeding profusely—I did not see any more after that, for I left—the door was open—the prisoner did not come in again, bat Mr. Hughes did.</p>

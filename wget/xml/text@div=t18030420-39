               <p>Q.Who was the person that did pay it? - A. Mr. William Henry Maul, clerk in the Pay-office at Plymouth, and who corresponds with Mr. Cooke. He said he had not received it. I then called to the clerk in the outer office, who had made this abstract upon the prize-list, and asked him if he knew any thing of the particulars relative to it. He would not acknowledge receiving it. He was asked for his certificate from an officer on board the Hector; he produced one.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you got it? - A. Yes, (produces it); he immediately produced it, and put it in the hands of a young clerk in the office.</p>
               <p>Q.Is that the same paper? - A. It has been in various hands; I cannot say whether it is or not.</p>

               <p>Q. After you had discovered that this was not Mr. Rice's name, what did you do? - A. I carried it to Mr. Cooke; he came, and told him he was a rascal, and that it was a forgery; he was taken into custody immediately.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon after did you hear him describe himself by a different name? - A. At the third examination he called himself William Boulton.</p>

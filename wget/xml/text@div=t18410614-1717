                  </hi>. I live in Westbourne-street, Pimlico. On the 15th of June, about half-past one o'clock at night, I was in the Mall in St. James's Park—I Had my hands in my trowsers pockets—I was going home and met both the prisoners together—they asked where I was going—I took my hands out of my pockets, and pushed them aside, and directly my hands were out, theirs were in, and I missed my money—they undid my trowsers at the same time—I had two half-crowns, one shilling, and a sixpence—I called for a policeman—Grounds stooped down, and said she had the rheumatism in her legs—she came back to Wright, and said, "If you have the man's money why don't you give it to him?"—Grounds was the one that put her hand into my pocket, but both tried to unbutton my trowsers—I had the money in my pocket not a minute before they came up to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Grounds' Defence.</hi> When he came to Bow-street he swore that Wright held his hands while I robbed him—do you think for a moment a man solid and sober would allow any body to come up and hold him while an<lb></lb>other robbed him, and not call for assistance till he saw a policeman near?—the policeman came up, and then he gave us into custody—he said, at the office, that he beard me say, a hundred yards off, that I had the rheu<lb></lb>matism in my legs—the Park has very little' light—could he see me stoop down, and if I had his money, why did I say to Wright, "Give it up?</p>

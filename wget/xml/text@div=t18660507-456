                  </hi>. I am a pensioner from the 55th Regiment of Foot—on Sunday night, 13th April, about 12 o'clock, I was <hi rend="italic">convenient</hi> to Drury-lane—two men came up to me and robbed me—one knocked me down, and the other took off my coat with my two medals on it—it was the two prisoners who have pleaded guilty—they were the only two that robbed me, but there were four persons that I observed; I had seen <hi rend="italic">William Driscoll</hi> previously, but I won't swear against him; I will let him off—he was about twenty-five or thirty yards from me at the time—he was alone—as I was going to the Police-court, last Saturday morning, I saw William Driscoll, O'Neal, and another man—O'Neal spoke to me, and asked if I was going to prosecute—I said it was a thing I did not like to do, but I could not do without my medals and discharge papers and my coat—he said, "If you get your medals, coat, and other things, will you leave London, and not prosecute?"—"To be sure I will," said I; so after the lapse of two or three minutes he pulled my two medals out of his pocket, and gave them to me—William Driscoll said he was the man's brother, and he gave me half a crown not to prosecute—I am almost sure I saw William Driscoll near the spot when I was robbed—I have a doubt—I had not known him before—I am sure he was the person that was standing twenty or thirty yards off at the time I was robbed.</p>

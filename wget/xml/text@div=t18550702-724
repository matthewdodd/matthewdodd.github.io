                  </hi>. I am servant to Robert Henry Bristow, of No. 8, Grove-road, Brixton. On a Thursday, in last January, the prisoner came to the side gate and rang the bell; I had never seen her before—she brought some lace in a basket, and asked me to buy some—I bought a small piece which came to 6rf.—she said that she was in very great trouble—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece to go and get change, and bring it back; she asked me for some<lb></lb>thing to eat, and I gave her some small pieces of bread, some mutton, and an ounce of tea—the tea was my own—she did not come back as she had promised, and I never saw her again till Monday, 11th June, five months afterwards, when she came again and rang at the bell—I went, and she said, "Well, Miss, I suppose you have not forgotten me"—I said, "No"—she said, "You have not forgotten the 2. piece;" I said, "No, but I will for<lb></lb>give you that"—she said, I must tell you all; I would have come back and paid you, but I have been in trouble; I was watched at the gate with the tea you gave me, and have been in prison four months, all through what you have done"—she charged me with' stealing the tea from my master—I told her that I did not, that it was my own, and it was very strange that she should be taken into custody for what I had given her—she said that while she was in prison she had one child died, and her husband was very ill, and that she was in great distress, and wanted 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as she had to make up 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay her lawyer, and had got but 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and if I did not give her 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. she would have me up before the Court for stealing my master's property, but if I did I should hear no more about it—that frightened me—she said that my master and mistress must know all about it, and began screaming and cry<lb></lb>ing—I told her I could not give her 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I would do what I could for her—she made a dreadful noise, and I begged her not to do so, and told her I would do what I could for her—I went up stairs, fetched down two half crowns, which I gave her, and she said, "Oh, my God I is this all you are going to give me?"—I said, "I cannot give you any more"—she said, "You must"—I told her I did not think I could give her any more—she said, "You must, or else your mistress and master must know about it"—I then gave her a morning frock of mine, and another half crown, and she went away and said she would call again on the morrow, and tell me whe<lb></lb>ther it would do or not—she did not come then, but she came on the Wed<lb></lb>nesday, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and said that what I had given her was not enough, aud I must give her something more, anything would do, shawls or anything—I gave her a shawl, and she went away and came again about 7 o'clock on the same evening, and I gave her a gown piece and a pair of socks—she said the same that time, about my master and mistress know<lb></lb>ing it, and that I should get into trouble—she offered me a bottle of something, which I would not take—I gave her the things because she threatened me and frightened me, and I believed that J should be taken to the eourt—she had that child with her.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 58). On Wednesday, 13th June, about half past 7 o'clock, I was on duty in Grove-road, Brixton, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner come out at the gate and join a woman named May, who was holding the prisoner's child—I asked the prisoner what she had been doing, she said that she had been begging; I told her she must walk away—I saw a bundle under her arm, made towards her to question her, and she dropped this gown piece from under her shawl—I picked it up, and found under her shawl this pair of stays—she said that she had exchanged them with a lady for some catsup.</p>

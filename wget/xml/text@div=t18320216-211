On the 4th of January I saw the prisoner, whom I knew by sight, taking a load of fifteen slates from the building - he took them from the hall of the building, or from the barrow - he took them to Mr. Carter's, a builder, in Drury-lane; I did not lose sight of him till he went in there - I have since seen the slates in the possesion of Mr. Carter; they are worth 3d. each, at the wholesale price - I had no mark on them; they are common "dutchesses;" he was about ten yards from the building when I first saw him, and going from the hospital - I did not miss any slates from the building.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Carter. On the 4th of January the prisoner came to my master's shop, between ten and eleven o'clock, with some slates on his shoulder; I did not count them - he said there were fifteen - he said he had a job of his own, and he wanted a few nails to finish it; he asked if Mr. Carter was at home - I said No; he afterwards if Mr. Carter was at home - I said No; he afterwards came and brought some more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took some slates to Mr. Carter's on the 4th and on the 6th; I went for the money - he said Mr. North had been there, and I waited for him; I had one thousand five hundred slates, which a gentleman bought for me to cover four houses with - I had two hundred left, and I took them to the top of Sloane-street; I used one hundred and seventy there, and this thirty were what I had left - I took them in a cart to the bottom of St. Martin's-lane; I then took them to Mr. Carter's; I had taken slates to his house once or twice before.</p>
               <p>MR. CARTER. He never did, to my knowledge, but my father might have bought some of him, as we deal in building-materials.</p>

On the 20th of March I missed a pencil-case and handkerchief; I spoke to her about them, but she denied all knowledge of them - she remained with me three weeks after that; I kept losing property, and said it must be her- she absconded on Sunday evening; I saw her again on the Wednesday following, the 20th of April, at her sister's, Mrs. Foster's, Liquorpond-street, and gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.She was bound to you by the parish? A. Yes; I was not a Policeman then - I went into the Police last September twelve months, and gave up my business, but my wife instructed her in binding; I occasionally follow the business now, when I get a job - she was not apprenticed to my wife; when I missed her I went to look for her - her sister said she lived in Elm-street, but I could not find her there - her sister afterwards fetched me to where I found her; I asked what she had done with the pencil-case - she said she had never seen it; she never confessed it to me - I did not intreat her to return to me, saying I could not go on with my business without her; I saw her at her sister's on the Wednesday - I asked if she had not sold the pencil-case for 2s. - she said No; I asked what she had done with the handkerchief - her sister said, "Oh, that is all right - she has<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120046"></xptr>pledged it;" I did not say she worked better than my wife - I thought it would be indecem for me to take her into custody; I felt for her, and believe if she had good parents to instruct her, she would be a good girl - I prosecute her because this plunder has been carried on for two years; she had not been a month with me before she destroyed her indentures - Mrs. Green lives opposite me; I never spoke to her till the Tuesday. when she told me she had seen the prisoner with the handkerchief; the prisoner's sister came on Tuesday, and said she would be answerable for her appearance on Wednesday, and on Wednesday I went there by appointment, to take her into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that you went by appointment to give her into custody? A. Not to give her in custody; I have not sworn so - I did not meet her to know if she would accept my pardon, and return to my employ; not a word of the sort passed - her sister wished me to do it, but I said I would not, for I said I thought some punishment was necessary, and I took an officer there with me - she denied taking the pencil-case till she was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was in your service, how many rooms did you keep? A. I at first had two parlours, a back room, and kitchen - the prisoner slept in the front parlour, with my wife's mother; but when I joined the Police I moved to the west-end of the town, and I had but one room for myself, my wife, three children, and the prisoner; I find no fault with her for work.</p>
               <p>MARY GREEN. I live in St. Ann's-court. The prisoner came to my house, I think in March - she said she was going to her mother's, and had no pocket-money - she wished to sell this pencil-case, which she said was given to her by a lady as a keepsake, with a Hymn-book; I gave her 6d. then, and afterwards 2d. 3d. and 1d. - she gave me the handkerchief to keep till next day, when she had it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How long had you known her? A.Since Christmas; I merely bought this to oblige her, promising she should have it again at any time, if she gave me the money - I offered to lend her the money and not take the case; it was of no use to me - she pressed it on me; she had shown it to me nine days before, and said Mrs. Flood was in the habit of taking it from her, and giving it to the children to bite when they were cutting their teeth; none of the shilling I gave her was spent in gin on my premises, but that evening Mrs. Foster sent for a quartern of gin; she insisted on doing so - I am not in the habit of drinking; Mrs. Foster paid for it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JOSEPH WEST. I am a Policeman. I received the prisoner in charge on the 20th of April; Green gave me the pencil-case.</p>

               <p>Witnesses for the Defence.</p>
               <p>MARY FOSTER. I am the prisoner's sister - she was apprentieed to Flood two years ago, and about six months after that he left his business, and joined the Police; the prisoner called at my house on the Tuesday after she ran away, and I immediately sent my sister for Flood; Mrs. Flood had been in search of her before that, and when I sent, Mrs. Flood came - Nidsey was there, and we went to Mr. Flood's house; he said if she would return to work, and state where the articles were, he would forgive her - he said she was as clever as his wife, according to her age, and could earn 7s. a week; I then returned to my sister, and got from her what had become of the pencil-case - I saw Mrs. Green at the time she mentions, but she did not require to be pressed to take gin; I certainly sent for it - it was not paid for out of the sixpence.</p>
               <p>JOHN FLOOD. Mrs. Foster did not come into my house on Tuesday - she came into the court, and sent for me out of bed.</p>
               <p>JOHN NIDSEY. I live near Croydon. I was at Mrs. Foster's on the Tuesday night, when Mrs. Flood was sent for - she came with

            ; we accompanied her to Mr. Flood, and saw him in a public-house opposite where he lives - we were there an hour and a half, and he promised several times that if Mrs. Foster could ascertain what the girl had done with the pencil-case, and she returned to his service, he would forgive her - that she was a clever girl, and could earn 7s. a week.</p>
               <p>JANE LOCKWOOD. I am the prisoner's sister. I went to tell Mrs. Flood the prisoner was at our house - she returned with me, and then we went to the public-house opposite Flood's: his wife sent for him - he said if she would state what had become of the pencil-case, and returned to him, he would forgive her.</p>

I saw Mrs. Norton coming out of the cellar; I delivered her into the charge of one of the constables and ran down into the cellar; there were three cellars; in the farther cellar I found one Story, a soldier in the Guards, cutting out blanks; after securing him I came back to the cellar close to the bottom of the stairs, there I saw a large press fixed with dies in it, and a fly ready for striking the impression upon halfpence; there were a quantity of dies laid round the place, and these counterfeit halfpence; lay scattered about the press. I found a parcel upon a shelf on one side of the stai rs which had been badly struck and were laid by as waste; in the two pair of stairs closet we found three pair of dies; a quantity of blanks, and the cecil they were cut out of, the whole apparatus was complete.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went to this house in Plough-court. In the cellar, at the bottom of the stairs, there was a large press fixed for stamping the impressions; and in another cellar there was a small press for cutting out the round blanks. These halfpence I found close by a water-tub, which was close to the fly. Every thing was as complete for coining halfpence as could be.</p>
               <p>When was Norton taken up? -</p>
               <p>Prothero. I met with him and took him up about a fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>Was there any way to get into the cellar but through the house?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No. Whoever lived in that house must know that there was a large press in that cellar, for by throwing the fly, part of the wainscot in the cellar was broke out to give it room to work.</p>
               <p>What light was there in the cellar? - It is dark, but is light enough to work without a candle.</p>
               <p>Court. Could any man have taken that cellar, or these cellars of the owner of the house, for any purpose of working, or any other purpose? - There was a kind of a small kitchen and dresser, where was a quantity of dies.</p>

               <p>Do you know the house these witnesses have been speaking of? - Yes, it belongs to me. At Michaelmas, 1779, I let it to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Was he in possesion of it in May last? - He did not quit it till last Michaelmas; they took away their goods at night, just before Michaelmas day. They sent the key to me on Michaelmas day last.</p>
               <p>Do you know of his living there? - No. I never saw him there. He came in the evening and took the house of me; he signed an agreement, which I have here, I am almost certain he is the man.</p>

When I heard they had been detected in coining, I went after my rent; I could never see him, but I saw his wife frequently.

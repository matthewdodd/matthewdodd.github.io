                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Peter-street, Saff<lb></lb>ron-hill. The prisoner lodged in my house about five months, and quitted without notice—he is a cabinet-maker, and occasionally did jobs for me, and had a room—several of my goods were in that room—he had done work on some of them—shortly before he left, I missed some of them, and asked if he had had any of my boxes—he said yes, he had one or two—I asked him how many, and he gave me up a lot of duplicates, and said he had pawned them—I never authorized him to pawn any—I was not indebted to him any wages—I saw him again about the 8th of April, in Ray-street, and gave him in charge—I lost sixteen boxes.</p>

                  </hi>. My father keeps a pawnbroker's shop on Clerkenwell-green—I produce these articles, which were pawned at our shop by the prisoner, in the name of Harris—I took in articles from him pawned at six different times, between the 3rd of January and the 5th of March—he has redeemed them several times by pawning others for them, and sometimes by paying for them without pawning.</p>

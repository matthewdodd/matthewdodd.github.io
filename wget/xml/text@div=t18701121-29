                  </hi>. At the time in question I carried on business as a money changer, at No. 1, Strand—on the afternoon of 7th September the prisoner came to my shop and offered me these two notes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi> for 1000 live each, on the National Bank of Sardinia; in English money that would be 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—they are very good imitations—he asked me to give him the value of them in English money—he produced these from a packet which he had in his pocket—I spoke to him in French—I did not give him the money, but, from what I noticed, I sent my clerk to some other gentleman to make certain, not liking the look of the notes—while my clerk was away I said to the prisoner, "I don't like the look of these notes, have you any others about you that I might choose from?" and he then brought out these fourteen notes—I said "Have you any passport to show me who you are?" and be brought oat his passport, which I detained, not liking the look of the notes or the man—I sent for the police, and handed the notes over to them, saying that the man could not give a proper account of himself, would they kindly make inquiries, and if they were satisfactory, they would give the notes back to him—the prisoner was in my office all the time—I spoke in English to the police, but I translated to the prisoner what I said—the officers asked him some questions through me—he said he was a commercial traveller, and I think he said he received the notes from some man at some hotel in Soho—he could not give a distinct number of the house, or the place where it was situated—he did not say what firm he travelled for—I think he said be came from Milan—he did not say he had received the notes from some man in Soho, he said he received them from some man in Milan, and he gave a reference to some place in Soho.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). On 7th September I was sent for to Mr. Hands, and found the prisoner there—Mr. Hands gave me those two notes, and also the fourteen—I had the two notes in my hand, and I said to the prisoner, in English, "Are these yours?"—he nodded, and said "Yes"—I then said "Are the fourteen notes yours?"—he again said "Yes;"</p>

               <p>but seeing that he spoke imperfect English I requested Mr. Hinds to translate what I had to say to him—I am a German—I then asked him whether he could refer me to anybody in London who knew him as a respectable man—he wrote this on paper, "Hotel d'Italie, Mons. Polli, Soho Square"—I said "What does that gentleman know of you?" said "I am a silk merchant from Italy, and I go to Mons. Polli's Hotel, where I meet gentlemen of whom I buy goods"—he said that in French to Mr. Hands; I understand French sufficient to understand that he said "I buy silk at Polli's Hotel, but I don't know the gentlemen of whom I buy it"—I asked if he could refer me to anyone else who also knew him; he then became very sullen, and would not answer—I told him I had reason to believe these notes were false, and I should take him into custody, which I did—on searching him I found two pawnbroker's duplicates, dated 6th September, 1870; one for a watch and chain for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other for a pair of solitaires and four studs 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in the name of J. Metelli—found no money nor any scrap of paper of any description—he afterwards told me he was staying at the Charing Cross Hotel, at room No. 17 went there and assisted to search that room—his luggage consisted of three portmanteaus and a hat box—torn up in the grate I found pieces of paper which were afterwards pasted together, and proved to be a letter, dated Turin, from Metelli to Roco Metelli in London, and I see by the date of his passport, he was in Turin at that time—it is a receipt for a registered letter—I found very excellent wearing apparel in his portmanteau, but no papers of any sort, except a jeweller's bill, and no money whatever.</p>

I am cashier at the National Bank of Italy at Milan, and am a shareholder—the two notes uttered to Mr. Hands are forgeries; they are good imitations—the genuine notes are printed on special paper at Florence—I produce one of the genuine notes—these four-teen other notes are all forgeries, and are identical with the other two; the one uttered to Mr. Baum is a forgery, and the same as the others; the three with Mr. McKeown's name on the back are false, and of the same de<lb></lb>scription.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). These twenty-one notes which have been found to be forged were given to me as genuine, and I received them as genuine from the firm of Perelli and Polli, money-changers at Milan, at the beginning of April in the present year, in exchange for a certificate of Italian stock. Later I came to know that one of the partners was con<lb></lb>demned to ten years' hard labour for having attempted to put in circulation forged notes. My good faith is proved by being in the company of Mr. Beretta when I changed the notes, and by leaving my address in London. If I had known they were forged I should never have sought the company of Beretta to have them exchanged, especially as he knew me intimately. After two months I returned to London, and continued to frequent the hotel kept by Beretta, who never told me anything about the notes being forged; on the contrary, he received me well; therefore, he could not have suspected they were forged. When I obtained exchange for three of the notes in the City, the clerk went out and returned and said they were genuine; therefore, that confirmed me that they were genuine. I was astonished, when I went to the third money-changer to have two more changed, to be told they were forged. I then gave up all the remainder that I had, my passport, and everything. I had no idea of it before then. If I had been a forger I should have acted in a different way. I should have tried to obtain change of the whole lot in one day, of different money-changers, and I should not have travelled with a passport in my own name; consequently, I protest that I am innocent I had two witnesses I had requested to attend, one of the name of Duncan, and the waiter at an hotel, whose name I don't now recollect; but it appears they are not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a diamond merchant, living in Bury-street, St. Mary Axe. I have had dealings with the prisoner about two years—I have known him three or four years—I have entrusted him with diamonds to sell—he came to me, in the morning of the 17th of June last, between nine and ten o'clock—he said he wanted some certain sized diamonds for Messrs. Nock and Williams, between two or three grains each—I told him I had not got three grains, I had two grains—he said they would do—Nock and Williams are jewellers in Firth-street, Soho—he said he saw the clerk, who gave him an order to bring some diamonds of the size for Nock and Williams—in consequence of that I gave him an order to Blogg and Co., and told him the diamonds were not in my possession—besides that, he said he had an order from a party coming from abroad, for some</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184108230135"></xptr>
               <p>rose diamonds, and he had got to meet the party at the Swiss Coffee-house—I let him have the rose diamonds—he had twenty-five carats of dia<lb></lb>monds, worth about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were not sold to him—the arrangement was, that when he got any goods of me, they were entrusted to him as a bro<lb></lb>ker—he received 2 1/2 per cent, commission on what he sold—he had another lot of diamonds of me—I did not see him again that day—he promised to call back in the evening, and said he would bring me a good deal of money—he said, Messrs. Nock and Williams wanted some credit, would I let them have it—I said, I knew them very well, he might trust them three months—between twelve and one o'clock the next day, a boy brought this letter to me—the prisoner was taken into custody last Friday morning, between two and three o'clock, at his own house—he said he lost the diamonds in Leadenhall-street—I heard him afterwards say, in the office, that he lost them at Charing-cross, between three and four o'clock—here is the box that he used to carry the diamonds in, with a chain round his neck.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This is the prisoner's box, is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Nock and Williams Are very respectable people—I do not think the prisoner has acted as my agent for twelve months—I find this is the largest amount of property he ever had of mine—I do not think he had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property of mine for a month before—he might have pro<lb></lb>perty of mine eight or ten times—I know Charles Isaacs, to my sorrow—I indicted him—he took the advantage of the law, and was acquitted, be<lb></lb>cause there was a mistake in the name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know a house in Bridges-street, Covent-garden, kept by Pruss? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I know the house—it is not in Bridges-street—I have got nothing to do with the house—it is a club-house—I bought the lease of the house, and let it to Pruss—I know a man of the name of Isbell—I never gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or any thing else, either money or money's worth.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever represent you was born at Portsmouth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I under<lb></lb>stand I was born there—I did not give Isbell 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to swear I was born at Portsmouth—I gave him no money—he said he knew my father, and that I was born at Portsmouth—I became a freeman of London four or five years ago—Isbell was the person I produced to prove I was born at Portsmouth—upon my oath I did not give him any money—I had no attorney in the case—Isbell did not receive a farthing for coming to state I was born at Portsmouth—there was no affidavit—I do not remember an affidavit being read in my presence before the commissioner—I know Benjamin, of Duke's-place—he keeps a coffee-house—dealers used to go to it—it is a place of business—there may be cards played there occasionally—I have sometimes played a rubber of whist—I never played for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have paid for what I played for—I have not been in the house at all for two years—I do not know whether I have ever played there for as much as 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a game—I was examined at Clerkenwell on an occasion when a man of the name of Nathan was prosecuted—I received a subpana—it may be a year ago, or more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, did you not swear there that you never played for more than a shilling a game in your life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what I swore; but that has nothing to do with it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not go from that very place at Clerkenwell, and on that very same evening played at Benjamin's for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a game? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not play for any sum—I have not been at Benjamin's for two years—I</p>

               <p>never lost at any sitting at Benjamin's as much as 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Benjamin was indicted by my mother-in-law—she was not living with me at the time—I do not know where she lived—she was the prosecutrix against Benjamin for keeping a gambling-house—she did not prosecute him at my instance —I was subpoenaed as a witness—I believe Mrs. Moseley, my mother-in-law, proved the gambling—the case was not tried at all—I do not know how it was—they did not call witnesses on either side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, did not your mother-in-law, Mrs. Moseley, receive 100? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, sir, and T did not receive any thing from any body for that—I did not receive 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nor 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that occasion—I sued a party that owed me 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I received it—that was Nathan—he was the prosecutor on the occasion when I was examined as a witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Since the prisoner has been in custody have you been to his cell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, sir—I saw him with the officer at the Mansion-house, and I saw him in the lock-up place as I went by—"the habiliments of prayer" is what they put on their arms—the inside of it contains prayers written—I can swear I never made use of such language to the prisoner while he was in the lock-up place, as to say that he would be transported for seven year, or perhaps for life—I do not remember saying any thing of the kind—he had told me before that he would pay me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he state in the lock-up place that he would work for you for any thing, even to blacking your shoes for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember it—he did not say, "How can you, as a religious man, swear to such a false-hood as to say I mentioned the name of Nock and Williams?"—I did not have any conversation with him in the German language.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner produce to you the parchment with the prayers on it, and say, "Can you, on these prayers, say that I named to you Nock and Williams?" and did you not say it was on that statement you would hold him, otherwise it would be a debt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, sir, I never said any thing of that kind—I did not see the prisoner's brother at the bar—the solicitor offered me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said, "If you will not take it, I can bring witnesses that will kick you out of Court."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the Lord Mayor recommend you to settle it, and desire this man to write to his friends? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The Lord Mayor might have said it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked what was the extent of your transactions with the prisoner, did he at first bring parties to sell you diamonds? <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Yes—I always dealt with the parties, not with him—the money did not pass through his hands—the house spoken of is in Bedford-street, not Bridges-street—I sued a man named Nathan for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the Judge granted an order that he should pay it—I spoke to the pri<lb></lb>soner at the Mansion-house, as I passed by with the officer, that was all—I did not talk with him through the bars of the cell, when the officer was not present—the prisoner called to me in Hebrew, and the observation I made was, "You have robbed me, I don't want to see your teeth."</p>

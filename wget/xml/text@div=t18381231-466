Previous to the 7th of September, and on that day, I was assisting him in his business, as he had been unwell—about half-past seven o'clock that morning, a person came in and called for a glass of gin—he was immediately followed in by the two prisoners—they followed one an<lb></lb>other in as quickly as they could—the first person stood against the counter at the bar—when the prisoners came in I noticed all three winking together and nodding their heads at each other, and rubbing their hands, making</p>

               <p>signs to each other—the prisoners consulted together to know what they should have, and Simpson asked for a glass of hot rum and water—I went a few steps to get hot water, having none in the bar, and as I returned' I saw the person who first came in and is not in custody, coming out of the bar—the prisoners were standing in the same position as I left them, lean<lb></lb>ing over the counter, the cash-box being immediately under where they leant—I asked Simpson what that person did in the bar—he looked very much confused and hesitated, and then said he thought he was our baker come in to warm his hands—I said he could not think that, as they were <hi rend="italic">pals</hi> of each other—Simpson immediately asked me to draw him two glasses of ale quick—I drew them—he gave me a shilling, and I gave him eight<lb></lb>pence out—they both drank some—I then immediately looked for the cash<lb></lb>box, and missed it directly—I said, "That <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> has stolen the cash-box"—Forbes immediately left what ale was in his glass, and shot away out at the door—Simpson was leaving in the same way—I ran round and collared him—he said he would <hi rend="italic">go</hi> out to look to his horse and cart—I said he should not till I got an officer—one was fetched, and I gave him in charge—Forbes has shaved some of his whiskers off since he was committed.</p>

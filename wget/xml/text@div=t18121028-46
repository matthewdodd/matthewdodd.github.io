               <p>Q. Do you know anything of this fact of having lost any bank-notes - A. Yes; they were upon Mrs. Beazley's dressing table, on the second floor. I had put them there. They were taken on the 16th of September. I left them there about twelve at noon. Directly I put them on the table I told Mrs. Beazley. They were missed on the 17.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not your sleeping-room - A. No. It is the dressing-room, adjoining the sleeping-room. You must go through the sleeping-room to go to that room. I was out of town all Thursday. I did not hear of it till the next evening. The prisoner came to the house twice on the 16th. He had formerly been a servant, and had come to ask me to come back again. I left them on the table, and told Mrs. Beazley that they were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen these notes again - A. Yes. I had changed a two hundred pound note at the Bank, and in consequence of the loss, I got the numbers of the notes. I had received them at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181210280054"></xptr> Bank of England. I got change on the 11th of the month. I saw the notes again on the 18th, in the custody of

               <p>Q. Can you be certain that these four notes that you charge the prisoner with, that you had not paid them away - A. Yes, because I can recollect the payments that I made. All the notes except the four five-pounds, and the thirty pound, I had paid away. The prisoner, when he lived with me, behaved well, was honest. I meaned to take him again, had not this occurred.</p>

             I am a clerk in the Bank, in the bank-note pay-office On the 11th of September, Mr. Beazley brought me a two hundred pound pound note. I changed it for him. I gave him three forty's, one thirty, and ten five's. The thirty pound note was No 11,347. That entry is made by Hancock. I paid the notes. Date 29th of August, 1812. Ten five-pound notes; they were numbered from 13,967, following numbers, to 13,976, inclusive; all dated 5th of August, 1812. I gave the notes, and Hancock posted them.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I apprehended the prisoner on the charge of Mr. Beazley. I searched him, and found no thing on him. I went up stairs to his box. He went with me. He opened his box with a key that he took out of his pocket. I searched the box, and while I was searching it, the prisoner was standing close at my side. He put his hand privately into the box, and put something into his coat pocket. I searched his coat pocket immediately. I found three Bank of England notes, and twenty shillings in silver, wrapped up in one parcel. One thirty pound note, No. 11,347, 29th August, 1812; a five pound note, No. 13,974; the other five pound note is the following number, 13,975, 5th of August, 1812. No other note, and twenty shillings in silver. I asked him, what he had done with the other five pound note. He said he had paid for some shoes, and some other articles, and the twenty shillings were the remaining part of it. These are the notes. I then took him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What time did he come on the 16th - A. He came early in the morning. He was to return at four. He returned at four.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

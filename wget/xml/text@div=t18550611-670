                  </hi>. I am waiter at the Royal Albert tavern, Wands-worth-road, kept by Mr. Smythe—he has recently gone into that house—on Tuesday, 8th May, there was a large party there—in the course of the evening I saw the prisoner in the house; about half-past 11 or 12 o'clock—I do not recollect seeing him before—he was in the parlour—I took no notice of him—the party separated and the house was closed about half-past 2 o'clock—I went to bed about 2 o'clock—I slept in the kitchen, close to the bar-parlour—my master was the last up—when I went to bed I recollect pulling off my apron, and throwing it on the bed—I was disturbed about half-part 4 o'clock, as near as I could judge, by hearing some one about; but I did not take any notice of it for a time—some one then opened the door leading into the kitchen—I lay very quiet for a time, then got up and went out of the kitchen into the passage leading to the street door; I there saw the</p>

               <p>prisoner just in the act of opening the door—he had got something tied up in my apron—I asked him his business; he said be had orders to sleep there—I asked him for the bundle; he would not give it me, and after a time I laid hold of it, and took it from him—I found it contained a large piece of cheese—it was a cheese which had been partaken of the night before, and had been left on the bar table; the apron had been on my bed—I left the prisoner for a minute to go up and tell my master; he got up and came down directly, but the prisoner had then gone—I afterwards found a coat in the parlour—I do not know who it belonged to.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Royal Albert public house, Wands-worth-road—on Tuesday evening, 8th May, 1 had a large party at my house—it was rather a late one—towards midnight I saw the prisoner in the parlour, taking a glass of wine with a friend of mine—he had not been invited as one of the guests, and had no business there—the party broke up about 2 o'clock—I was the last up—I saw the house cleared of everybody, as I believed, and made everything safe; the hall door especially—between 4 and 5 o'clock I was awoke by Constable, who brought up a bundle containing a piece of cheese which had been on the bar table over night—I got up and went down as quickly as I could—the prisoner was brought to the house shortly afterwards by one of the railway police—my house abuts on the goods railway yard—I asked him what he could mean by it, or something of the kind; I almost forget the answer he made to me; it was some evasive answer—when the metropolitan policeman came, I asked the prisoner what business he had in my house—he told me he had slept in an easy chair—there was an easy chair in the bar parlour—one of my guests, Mr. Letts, had left a coat on that chair, and a handkerchief of mine was also left there—when I came down in the morning that coat and handkerchief were gone—I afterwards saw them in the possession of Murphy, the policeman at the station—I saw some cheroots taken from the prisoner's person—I cannot swear to cheroots, and he told me so—they were like some cheroots that I missed—I saw some envelopes taken from him; they were like some that I missed—I saw some pieces of ham taken from him—I cannot swear to them—there had been a bam left partly cut; the pieces looked as if they might have come from that—there were places below, in which the prisoner may have concealed himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You missed no money or plate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I should think there were near fifty persons at the dinner; it was an opening dinner on obtaining my licence—I had been in the house fifteen months—only those came who were invited—the whole of the persons who were in the room at 12 o'clock at night had been invited, with the exception of one or two—I knew the prisoner by sight, and by reputation—he is a public house broker; at least, he is an appraiser and auctioneer—I have known the name for five or six years—I have heard that he is a notoriously drunken character, and that he has had <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—I do not know it; I never drank with him—it was Mr. Goodwin that I saw him drinking with on this night—I do not recollect seeing him drinking with Mr. Timmings; Mr. Timmings was one of the party—I do not believe the prisoner would have stolen these things if he had been in a sober state—the fifty persons consisted of friends connected with the house, and also friends' friends—a small piece of cheese was taken out of the prisoner's pocket; it was the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185506110166"></xptr>
               <p>same kind as the larger piece—he was very drunk—a coat was found, which he had left behind; that coat was torn off at the sleeve, the part that was torn was also found—I think the policeman took it out of the coat pocket that the prisoner had on—his own coat was not nearly as good as Mr. Letts'.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What state of drunkenness was he in when you first saw him about 12 o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was not drunk then—how he occupied himself between that time and the morning I do not know—I always thought him a respectable man, and holding a respectable position; I know his brother and mother.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he was brought back by the police had he the coat on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had—he said nothing about it—it had been left on the arm chair where he said he had been sleeping—the potman found the old coat in the public parlour, not the parlour in which he was drinking with Mr. Goodwin—the coats were both dark; one was brown, and the other green, I think-perhaps the difference to a drunken man would not seem great.</p>

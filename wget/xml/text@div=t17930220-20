            . On Saturday the 19th of January, I was in the shop, and a lodger in the back parlour came to me and asked me if I had lost any thing; her name is Mary Norris, she was brought to bed last night, so could not be here, she said a woman ran out with a bundle in her lap, I ran to the head of the kitchen stairs, and I looked down and I saw the things were gone, they were hanging on a line in the back kitchen; I told her to run, she run; I went out afterwards, and I saw the prisoner

             walking gently; as soon as I set running, I cryed out thief and then she walked faster, and gave a little run, and then she was stopped; she went up Plumb-tree-street, and turned round on the right hand, I don't recollect the name of the street, I saw her stopped there; just as she was stopped, she dropped the things, I saw her do that I am sure; she dropped them all together wrapped up in an old bed gown, which was not mine, I picked up the things, then we took her to my house, and went for a constable, and I asked her how she could do such a thing; I never saw her before as I remember, she said very little, she asked me if I would forgive her; I told her I could say nothing to it; because a constable was gone for; the things were taken before the justice; the constable has the things now.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen them before you missed them? - Very lately, about ten minutes to the best of my knowledge, the door was generally left on the jar, and was cooking my dinner; the woman, as I understand, had been up stairs to a lodger in the garret.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask her if ever she saw me in her house in her life? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Harrison. You saw nothing of the prisoner till she was brought home? - No, she was brought home about one o'clock; I went for the constable and gave him charge of her, my wife had brought the bundle, and we went to the justice's together.</p>

               <p>I am the constable that was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; I have got the bundle, delivered to me by Mr. Harrison. (Deposed to by Mrs. Harrison.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never went into her house in my days, nor never near the place; I was going home through Broad-street, Bloomsbury, and just at the end of Holborn a man comes to me and said you must go back; I said, what for? says he, you will see presently, and when he brought me back, this woman had her linen, and said, I had been robbing her of it; I said, no, I had not, for I did not know her; she said, she was very sure I was the person; for I had a black gown on; she brought me before the justice, and there she told the justice that the woman that took the things had a black gown on; I never deprived her of a halfpennyworth, nor never was inside her doors in my days; and the gentlemen said they bad frequently been robbed by the lodger in the house, and that there was not a week but they were robbed of several things, and that if it cost them twenty guineas they would transport me, and I should pay for all.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Harrison. Did you ever say any thing of that sort? - I never said no such thing; my husband in his passion might say he would transport her; I have frequently been robbed, but never by my lodgers. She said, at the justice's, that if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200038"></xptr>I would let her go, she would pay me half a guinea that night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My husband earns a guinea a week. I have no occasion to take any thing; I never expected my trial, her lodger, that she said robbed her, sent me word that she would not find the bill against me.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Harrison. This old bed gown that the things are wrapped up in, is that lodger's that she was acquainted with.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no witness here, I had been to great Rider-street to my husband and was going home; and where they found the linen God knows, I don't know no more than a child unborn.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Harrison. I saw her drop them out of her lap, but she turned the corner, and there was a man before me that pushed on to catch her before me, she was going down the place called the Vine-yard.</p>

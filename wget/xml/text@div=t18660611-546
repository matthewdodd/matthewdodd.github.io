I am a carman in the employ of Mr. John Smithers, who carries on business at 3, Well-street, Well-close-square—on 8th Feb-ruary I went to the docks to fetch a pipe of port-wine to take to Mr. Potter's, of Tower-hill, which I did—the wine was in the cart, and I left the horse and cart outside, while I went in to speak to Mr. Potter—I was there about five minutes, and when I went out the horse, and cart, and wine, was gone—the horse and cart was brought home by some one next morning.</p>

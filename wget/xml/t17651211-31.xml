The two prisoners came in the shop on the 13th of November, about six in the evening. Briggs wanted a pair of stockings; I shewed him some. Nothing would do. I went to reach down some black ribb'd; he said there was somebody at the door: he opened the door: the goods mentioned in the indictment were just at the door. Treviss was standing just without the door. I saw him hand out the handkerchiefs and lawn mentioned in the indictment, to the other, who ran away with them. I shut Briggs in, and called my husband down stairs, who kept him while I went for a constable. I went to Sir

Briggs asked Treviss, what he had done with the handkerchiefs and lawn. Treviss's answer was, he had lumped them. We never found our goods again.</p>

When we were got in at Sir John's, Briggs winked to me to come high, to hear what Treviss said; then he asked him what he had done with the goods; Treviss answered he had lumped them. I desired Sir John to ask him the meaning of lumping; Briggs said, lumping was pawning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Street. I was at a public house, near Sir John's. Mrs. Lamb came in, and said she had got a thief in her shop. I went with her. I knew Briggs. I said, what have you been at; he said it was one Blinkey, going along to Sir

            . I am a watchman. On the 7th of November I saw the prisoner come out of Cheapside, and go up to Mr. Walter's door. I heard the key rattle in the door, and thought it was Mr. Walters opening his own door; it was twenty minutes after twelve o'clock. I said, "Your key does not seem to act, Sir" - He said, "Yes, it will." I asked him if he wanted a light? he said, No. I was just opposite. I went to my lanthorn, got a light, went over to him and said, "Lay hold of the light, and let me try." I could not open it. The candle went out, I went to get another-at that moment the prisoner opened the door and went in - I suspected all was not right. As he was shuting the door, I put my elbow before the door and prevented its being shut. I went in; the prisoner was at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030019"></xptr>bottom of the stairs. I said, "Do you live here?" He said, "Yes." I said, I did not think he did, and asked how long he had lived there? - he said, two days. I asked him what part of the house he occupied? - he made no answer for some time; he at last said, "Watchman, I beg your pardon, I have made a mistake in the door." I asked him where he lived? I took him out of that to several other doors-the key would not fit any; I then took him to the watch-house. He afterwards said, he lived at No. 23, Garlick-hill, which was some distance from Bow-lane. Two other keys were found on him. He would not tell where he lived at first. He did not appear the least intoxicated till I called the patrol - He then appeared to sham intoxication.</p>

            . I am constable of the night. I found two other street-door keys on the prisoner. He said he had lived eight months on Garlick-hill. I at first thought him in liquor; but when I was going to send him to the Counter he was quite rational.</p>

            . I am a carpernter, and live on Garlick-hill. The prisoner had lodged with me since July last. The key belongs to my door - I gave it to him. The other two keys, I believe, belong to a warehouse which I have opened for him in Lawrence Pountney-lane, where he carries on an agency business.</p>

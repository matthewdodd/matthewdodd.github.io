The prisoner and I had been drinking together on the evening this matter happened; we had been drinking in my house, and in a public-house - we were all the worse for liquor; I do not know that the prisoner took the property - they were all separated about the room; it was my servant's fault: the sheets were at the fire airing - the shirt was in the drawers- she bid me a good night; I do not know where she lives - I know her well; I think it was about half-past eleven o'clock; she took nothing that I saw - nor do I know who took them; I saw the things the next day at Mr. Barnes's house.</p>

            . I am superintendent of the Houseless Poor in Grub-street. The prisoner came there with two others drunk - they were Jane Moss and Ann Evans; the prisoner had this bundle - they were all intoxicated, but not so bad but they could walk; they came about half-past twelve or one o'clock on the 13th instant; I questioned them, and finding they had a bundle I sent them to the watch-house: Harding said she had bought the things in the bundle in Petticoat-lane - I saw Collard the next morning.</p>

            . I was officer of the night. The prisoners were brought in, and said that they lodged in Playhouse-yard; I went there the next morning - Mrs. Collard came up and asked for the same three girls; I asked her what she wanted, and she said they had robbed her; the prisoner told me she bought the things in Rosemary-lane - they were wet.</p>

            . I went to Playhouse-yard to see if they could give me any intelligence of the things I had lost - the things I saw at the watch-house were mine; I do not know how I lost them - there is no mark on the sheets; I think they are like mine - there were six on the horse; the handkerchief looks like mine - it is the same pattern - the shirt is my little boy's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man stood at Mrs. Collard's door, and asked her to come out; she said, "Come in, girls, and have something to drink" - we went in, she quarrelled with her servant, and turned her out: there was a man there - he went out - Mrs. Collard gave us something to drink; the bundle was at the door, and I took it up, and as it was too late to go home we went to the Refuge.</p>
               <p>MRS. COLLARD re-examined. My husband was out - there might be a man there.</p>

No, in the morning; I asked if I could have the change - I never saw him after I gave it into his hand - I positively swear that; I will swear he did not come back, say his master could not give me change, and I tell him to get change elsewhere - I saw him go towards his master's with the note; I believe my husband had leave from Mr. Conant to compromise the matter.</p>

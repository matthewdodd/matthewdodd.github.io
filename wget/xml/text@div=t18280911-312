            . I am a constable of St. Martin's. On the 30th of July, about eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another person pass me; the prisoner had two loaves of bread - I stopped him, and asked where he got them; he said, "Close by" - I said, "Show me where;" he took me to shop in Oxford-market, but he had not been there - I then went to the Bakers'-arms, but as I was going in he said, "It is no use telling you lies, I took them out of that basket;" I went to Pocock, who claimed them as his employers, and having been taken form his basket - his masters are Charles Baxter and another, and live in Charlton-street; the prisoner seemed in great distress. <rs id="t18280911-312-verdict1602" type="verdictDescription">

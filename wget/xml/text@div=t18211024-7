My family consist of my daughter, and myself, I have no servant, a gentleman lodges with me. On the 15th of September, I went to bed at half-past eleven o'clock, we all three went up to bed together, I had secured all the doors and windows - I am sure I fastened the back parlour window, on the ground floor, the shutter was shut, but not fastened, they were inside shutters, the window was fastened by the catch. I and my daughter slept together. About half-past two o'clock in the morning, I heard the stairs creak, and footsteps going up and down. I went to sleep again, supposing it to be my lodger; I got up, about half-past six o'clock, and when I came down to the first-floor front room, I found the door open, and the back room door also, my bureau was open, and all the drawers pulled out, I went and told my daughter, and then searched, and missed the articles mentioned in the indictment - some of the linen was my daughter's, the books and plate were mine, and a silver watch, was mine, the other, which was gold, is my daughter's; one umbrella, was my lodger's, the other mine, it had an embossed border, the shoes, sheets, scarf, silk-handkerchief, one bombazeen, and a coloured dress, were mine; the other dress, and two handkerchiefs, were my daughter's, and the rest, my lodger's. The books were the History of England, Josephus, and a large family Bible. About seven o'clock that morning the watch-house keeper called; I went to the watch-house between eleven and twelve, and saw part of my property. I had spoken to the prisoner once before, at my door, about seven o'clock, on the night preceding the robbery, which was Saturday, the 15th of September.</p>

            . I am a watchman; my beat is in Euston-street, Euston-square. On Sunday morning, the 16th of September, just before three o'clock, I heard footsteps of several men - I was on my beat, walking about and saw several men - I followed them about a quarter of a mile, across a brick-field - four or five of them had bundles, which made me suspect them. I overtook Nott, and asked him to assist me - they saw us pursuing them, and mended their pace, and went down Euston-street, towards Tottenham-court-road, crossed the New-road into Upper Thornaugh-street, and were turning down Carmarthen-street; as they turned the corner I secured Hayward - he had a bundle under his arm, wrapped up in a grey cloak; when I seized him, he dropped it, Nott picked it up, and I took him to the watch-house. While I was securing him his hat fell off, in his struggling to get away - he did not make a forcible resistance, only struggled; his hat fell off, another watchman picked it up, and brought it to the watch-house, and I saw a pink dress taken out of it. He was searched in my presence, at the watch-house, and I saw a pair of silver sugar-tongs, a glass salt, silk and a white handkerchief, a pair of silk stockings, and two latch keys taken out of his pockets. I saw Nott pick up a grey cloak bundle, which the prisoner dropped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said he would go quietly with you, and did - A. He wished me to loose him after he had struggled to get away. I kept all the men in view till he was taken. I am positive he was in their company.</p>

            . I am a sculptor, I had been acquainted with Hayward about a fortnight before this affair took place. I spent three afternoons with him, and have frequented his house - I have also met him at Maynard's, in Spring-gardens. In consequence of his kindness to me, he mentioned the obligation I was under to him, and said I might do him a kindness in assisting him to move away some goods. We proceeded to the house of Mr. Connelly, the Yorkshire Grey, near Fetter-lane (this was on Friday evening), to meet some others of his acquaintances; they did not come, but on the following evening, Saturday, we went there precisely at half-past nine o'clock, and met four people there besides ourselves; we stopped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240008"></xptr>about half an hour, and then proceeded to Charlton-street, Somer's Town, they left me at the corner of a public-house for five or ten minutes - Charles-street turns out on the left of Charlton-street - they left me by myself, the rest went somewhere, and returned in about ten minutes, we passed Stebbings's house and crossed a brick-field behind the premises, to a public-house in Euston-street, which is a quarter of a mile off; we staid there till past twelve o'clock,, and then came from there to the field at the back of Stebbings's premises, we staid there for a quarter of an hour, and two of the men who met us at the Yorkshire Grey, took a bundle which they had with them towards the house - one of the men wore a glazed hat. I saw the window broken open by a man named Bill, the one who wore the glazed hat was beneath him; Hayward was with me, about ten yards off, the other men were near us, at the back part of the premises. Bill got in at the window, and let the man with the glazed hat in at the back door - they were in the house about an hour, or an hour and a half. A man was stationed at the door, he took the things, and brought them out, and among the rest there was a book - he kept bringing out things to us - we were at the back of the premises - and one or another disposed of them under our clothes. When they came out something was forgotten, and Hayward said something that was of more consequence, was left behind. Bill and Hayward went into the house, and one of them brought a small bundle out. The property was taken to my lodgings in the New-road, Pancras. Some of the linen was put into an outer cellar there, only two men came there, and they brought the bundle of linen, and an umbrella, nothing else; nothing was said about bringing any more to my house. The other men were waiting a little way off. I went with them part of the way towards town - The bundle of linen was large and heavy, and they were tired of carrying it. The umbrella had an embroidered edge, it was separate from the bundle. We all came away together from my lodging, and turned down the road towards Somer's Town, went up a street without a name, and then through a street leading into Carmarthen-square - the watchman followed us, we went up some other streets, and were dispersed by the watchmen. I went away alone, home to my lodging. I did not see Hayward taken. When I got to my lodging I found Bill, who broke into the house, and a man, who looked like a coachman, that went down into the cellar for the bundle - I was desirous of its being taken away. They said they intended to take it away, and that we should go to Charles-street to get a cross rattler (a coach to take away stolen goods). We went down Tottenham-court-road, Bill shewed me some tea which he had hid. We made our nearest way to Charles-street, Covent-garden, I staid while Bill and the coachman-like looking man went and had some coffee. A man, with his face lacerated, came up and assisted in moving some of the property; Bill went and spoke to the coachman, who was the prisoner, Judd; he called him Bill, and appeared acquainted with him. They went to my lodging with the coach. I was inside the coach. Bill, the coachman-like looking man, the man with the cut face, and another, all rode on the box, and the rest inside. Upon getting to my lodging the bundle and umbrella were taken out, and put into the coach - Judd kept on his box. While they were being put in I saw through the handkerchief that there was linen in the bundle - and an handkerchief and table-cloth fell out they were put back into the bundle. We proceeded, through various turnings, to pass away the time, a roundabout way to Gray's Inn-lane, the end near Holborn; we got there about four o'clock, I should think. We waited in the coach at a court called Fox-court; some conversation passed about trying to avoid the watchmen, Judd heard it, he stood at the door at the time - I do not know that he joined in the conversation. We waited there about a quarter of an hour, people came up and down the court, and the things were taken at different times to the lodging of the man with the cut face, who kept a glass and some gin in his hand, and when any one came by he kept talking about ill-usage, and being left by his companions. They could not get the property out, and proceded down Holborn; Judd proposed to stay on the stand with the property in the coach till seven o'clock, and said he could then dispose of it in Oxford-street; he stood on the stand with the coach, and we all waited at a public-house in view of the coach. My companions wanted to get away from me in the interim, and kept trying to lose me in the street, by going round the stalls in Fleet-market - we did not remain at the public-house all the time; I followed them. When they found I was determined not to lose sight of them, Bill said</p>
               <p>"We had better go to the crib at once." We went, they turned the coach round, and it was driven by Southampton-buildings, into Chancery-lane. They all got into the coach, except me - I walked; Judd drove. When they found I was following them they turned a contrary way, and said "We will meet you at seven o'clock this morning, under the Piazza, Covent-garden; "I agreed to that, and went away. I went to the Piazza, but they did not come. I was apprehended at three o'clock that afternoon, and told the watch-house keeper of this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long is it since you have worked at your trade - A. It was three weeks previous to this. I knew Hayward for a fortnight before the robbery. I did not understand this to be a robbery, till I saw the men at work at the window - I then began to suspect something.</p>
               <p>Q. You were determined to have your share - A. I was anxious to get away, but was glad to accompany them to pass away the time. I asked what a cross rattler meant, and they told me, and there was a deal of conversation going on at the house we set out from, and there I learnt what a crib meant. I did not know before - I intended to serve Haywood. I meant to return to honest employ, next day, if I could get it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You intended first to share in the booty - A. Yes; I was not aware what they took me to the house for. I partly suspected before I saw the window broken open, but such was my opinion of Haywood, for his gentleman-like conduct.</p>
               <p>HAYWOOD. I leave my defence to my Counsel.</p>

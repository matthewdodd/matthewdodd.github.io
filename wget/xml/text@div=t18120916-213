               <p>Q. What had you in your pocket at that time - A. In my left hand coat pocket I had a pair of leather gloves, a bunch of keys, and some halfpence: I believe about two-pence; and, in the inside pocket, was my pocket-book. On my passing Bride's passage. I was surrounded by four women and by four men. The prisoner was passing my left hand; he put his right hand into my coat-pocket: finding his hand in my pocket, I turned sharp round, and in turning sharp round, he was unable to get his hand out. I seized him with my right hand; and, at the time of my seizing him, his hand was in my pocket; he could not get it out. I then charged the watchman with him, whose box is at the end of Bride's passage, and he took him immediately to the watchhouse in Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the 27th of May - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it that he was not prosecuted sooner - A. It was put off by the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> I am one of the city detectives—on the 14th June I watched the premises of Messrs. Gaine and Co.—about five minutes past 4 p.m. I saw Mackey leave—I followed him into Philpot Lane, where Levy was waiting—they both went to the end of the lane and stood leaning against a post, very close together, for two or three minutes—they then went into the private compartment of a public-house" in Lime Street—they were there a minute or two, and then came out and separated, Levy going in one direction, and Mackey another—on the 15th I saw Mackey come out about one o'clock—I followed him into Thames Street, where he met Levy; they spoke and separated almost immediately—on the 17th I saw Mackey leave, and I followed him to Eastcheap, where he met Levy—they went to the end of a court, and in about a minute they parted—on the 19th I again followed Mackey to Eastcheap, where Levy was waiting, and on the 19th, in company with an officer named Space, I again watched Mackey—I saw him leave about twenty minutes past four—I followed him to East<lb></lb>cheap, where he again met Levy—they both looked round cautiously, and then crossed the road and went up Talbot Court—they returned in two or three minutes, and went into a public-house in Lower Thames Street; from there they went to Eastcheap, where they parted, Levy going in the direc<lb></lb>tion of the Tower, and Mackey into a coffee-shop—I called him out and told him Levy was in custody; he denied him—I took him to the station—at the station they were brought together—I said to Mackey, "There is the man I spoke to you about; do you still deny knowing him? "—he said, "I do know him, I gave him five dozen ivory combs"—the inspector asked Levy whether he knew Mackey, and he said, "No, I do not; I have never seen him, I do not know him"—the following morning, on the way to the Mansion House for examination, I said to Levy, "This man (pointing to</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Ernest's-street, Regent's Park. On Monday evening, 17th March, the prisoner came, near nine o'clock, for half an ounce of tobacco and a penny candle—he gave me a half-sovereign, and I gave him change, and he left—I discovered that the half-sovereign was bad, and I ran into the street, and into every public-house, to try to find him, but I could not—I then went down to the station in Little Albany-street and described the prisoner, and put the half-sovereign in a little box, which I have in my pocket, till Lockerby came and took it on the Friday.</p>

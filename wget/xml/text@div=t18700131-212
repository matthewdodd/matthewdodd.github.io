                  </hi>. I am bandmaster of the Fusileer Guards, and live at 49, Cumberland Street, Pirnlico—I was formerly in partnership with a Mr. Bartlett—we took premises of Mr. Unite about the middle of 1867—I was indebted to Mr. Unite 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner was at that time acting as my solicitor in the matter—I made a proposition, through him, to pay the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by two instalments, one on 1st November, And the other on 1st January—I sent the first 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the prisoner, and that was paid—on 3rd January, 1868, I received this letter from the pri<lb></lb>soner, stating that Mr. Unite had applied for the balance, and on the 4th I wrote to the prisoner, enclosing this draft for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The letter was called for, and was handed in by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>, <hi rend="italic">and read, as follows</hi>: "Dear Sir. Excuse me for not having sent the balance to Mr. Unite. The cause of my delay is simply that the cheque, which was drawn on the 28th ultimo, somehow or other got among my papers, and for the life of me I could not lay my hand upon it till this morning. I now beg to enclose the same, and trust it will reach safely."<hi rend="italic">The cheque wot payable to the order of the prisoner</hi>.)</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE BYLES</hi>. "<hi rend="italic">This will not do. In order to make out this charge, there must be a direction in writing to apply the instrument to a specific pur<lb></lb>pose. There is no such direction here; on the contrary, it is quite plain it was not to be handed, to Mr. Unite, but the prisoner was to receive the money, the cheque being made payable to his order. No doubt it would have been his duty to hand the money over to Mr. Unite, which he did not do, for which an action might be brought, or an application made to one of the superior Courts to answer affidavits; instead of that, an indictment it brought upon this Statute, and it. has not been proved that he had any written directions, as alleged. That being to, it is my duty to tell the Jury there it no evidence to go to them</hi>".</p>

                  </hi>. I am a <hi rend="italic">dog</hi> dancer at a music-hall, and live at 6, Durham Place, Peffer Street, Borough, near the prisoner—on Saturday evening, 12th November, between 5.30 and 6 o'clock, I was standing against a shop, in Peffer Street, and saw the prisoner and a young lad, Hugh Nicholls, who asked me a question, and the prisoner said "Heugh!"—I replied "Heugh!" to him, using the word back again, as I thought he was jeering me, and I touched him three times under the chin with my fingers, not with my fist—he then kicked my shins three times, and I struck him on the eye with my fist—he then said, "God strike me stone blind, I will go up stairs, and get a knife, and rip you open"—I went indoors, and got my father to come and take care of me—I came out again, and my father and mother followed me—I then saw the prisoner at the corner of the street, about nine yards from me, with a knife in his right hand, and made my way to run home, but, in turning round quick, I ran up against a lamp-post, and he came over and stuck the knife into my left shoulder with all his force, and said, "I have done it for you"—he ran away; my father ran after him, and I followed—we caught him with the knife in his hand, and brought him to the corner of the street—I then felt so giddy that I had to let go of him—I went indoors, took off my coat, waistcoat, and shirt, and found I was bleeding very much, and went to the hospital—I still feel weak, and cannot dance now—I had had no quarrel with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am nineteen years old, and the prisoner is fifteen—the first struggle did not occur near Elizabeth Lashmere's door, but after<lb></lb>wards we were three yards from her door; she said "Callaghan is coming," and I rushed across towards my own house—I did not turn round and face Callaghan; we did not both meet face to face in the road—I had nothing with a knob at the tip, in my hand, covered with a handkerchief, nor did I aim a blow at the prisoner with it—I did not say, "Now, Callaghan, come on"—I did not strike him on the head with it, nor did he stagger back—we did not fight in the middle of the road, and both fall—the people did not call out "One has got a knife, and the other has got a hammer"—I swear I had nothing in my hand; I only had my fist—I did not come out again after I was wounded—I did not go home, pull my coat off, and say, "We will have a fair fight"—I do not know Catherine Foley—the prisoner did not call out, "Pray take that hammer from him, or else he will kill; me with it"—my father did not come out and take the prisoner by the throat with both hands, and hold him as tight as he could—a woman did not call out "Let them be, man to man"—I had a life preserver, but I chucked it on the tiles six weeks ago; it had a string round it—I am not a fighting man—I have fought twice, for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each fight, but only twice;</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's father—he is about twenty—he came in on this night, and said "Father, will you come out and see me righted?—I went out, and my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> followed <hi rend="italic">after</hi>—I saw the prisoner by the corner shop, ten or eleven yards from me—he ran across towards me, with a knife in his right hand—my boy made a rush to get away, and fell against a post, and the prisoner dug the knife into his shoulder with all his force, and said "Now, you swine, I have done it for you!" and ran away—I ran after him, caught him by the collar, and asked him for the knife, but he would not give it to me—I got hold of the blade, and loosened it—my finger was cut—he turned me round, and got away—this is the knife; the blade is loose—I pointed out the prisoner to the police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My son and the prisoner did not make a rush at each other; he made a rush at my boy—I was examined at the Police Court—it is true that they made a rush at each other—that was when he had the knife—I seized the prisoner by the neck with one hand, and seized the knife with the other—I did not seize him so that he could not breathe except through his nostrils.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If I had done so, he would have had an opportunity of driving the knife into me—when my boy came out with me, he went towards the left-hand shop, and the prisoner was towards the right-hand shop—he did not go towards the prisoner, but the prisoner rushed at him, and he rushed away—my boy ran towards him two or three yards, and then turned round to run away, and ran against a post.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see the father and mother there when the blow was given; I saw them both there after it was given—they may have been there when it was given—Priestley told me that he had had a quarrel just before—I saw the prisoner come from the door—his eye was bleeding—they</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Peffer Street—I was outside my door and saw the prisoner and Priestley scuffling—they moved from Mrs. Lashmere's door, and Priestley struck the prisoner on the forehead with a two-pronged hammer—the prisoner said "Take the hammer from him, or he will kill me with it"—there were very few people about, and they were all young men—after the blow was struck old Mr. Priestley came up and caught the prisoner by the throat with both his hands, and held him very tight, so that he could scarcely breathe—I said "What a bad man the father is to catch hold of the young man by the throat, let him loose, and let them be man to man"—somebody fetched me away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. I</hi> did not know that at the time the father had hold of him the son had been stabbed—I saw no knife—Priestley had this hammer in his right hand, and struck the prisoner a violent blow on the left forehead with it; there was nothing else in his hand—I saw nothing white in his hand.</p>

On the 9th of December, I was in the kitchen with my family; my son George had fastened the back door, and the door between the wash-house and kitchen was latched. My son opened the kitchen door to go into the wash-house; he immediately started back, and said a man was there. I took a candle, and found the prisoner standing in the wash-house. He said he wanted a lodging. I asked why he came there for a lodging, and how he got in; he made no answer. I found the wash-house door latched - he could not have come in except through there. I asked which way he came into the yard; he said through the house, meaning the cart-house. He was secured.</p>

            . I was in the kitchen, and went into the wash-house about half-past seven o'clock, and found the prisoner there. I came in from the yard half an hour before, and was the last person there, and shut and latched the door, I am certain. He was leaning on the copper, near the door - nothing was moved. I had shut the cart-house door, and chained and padlocked it inside, and came in through the shed at the back door, and shut that. I found the padlock gone - it was in his pocket: he tried to lay it down without my seeing him, but it rattled in his hand, and he put it into his coat pocket.</p>

            . I am a constable, and was fetched. I found the prisoner in the cart-house, and in his coat pocket I found the padlock. I asked what he wanted there - he gave no answer. Next morning I found that the cart-house door was broken, so that he could put his hand in and take off the padlock. The cart-house is attached to the dwelling-house.</p>

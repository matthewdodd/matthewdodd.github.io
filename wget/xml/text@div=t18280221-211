            . I am the prosecutors' foreman. I employed eight men to unload on the 23rd of October - the prisoner was not one of those men: but he brought a sack to the barge while I was on board; I knew him as a labourer about there; he had come to me in the morning, and said"Ned, you are a working very hard - I'll give you a spell," meaning to assist me. I said, "I thank you;" this was about ten o'clock, and about twelve he came and held a sack to me; I filled it - he carried it out of the barge; I expected he would take it into the granary, where the other men carried theirs - he took the sack from Haley, as it was his turn to bring a sack.</p>

            . I was employed to unload the barge. The prisoner came there - he took sixteen or seventeen turns for another man; I saw him take a sack down a street, opposite King Henry-stairs; I do not know where to - I heard him tell Haley, he would take a sweat for him, as well as another man; he did not go towards the granary with it - I told Long of it; I was coming down the plank from the granary at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long is it since you quarrelled with this man? A. I never quarrelled with him - we never exchanged blows. I was at Kingston three years ago - I was charged with robbery there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the prisoner carried sixteen sacks of corn to the granary just before? A. No; about an hour before - he did not abscond.</p>

            . I was at work on board this barge, and saw the prisoner. I did not see him take the corn - I was in the granary, and missed a man out of his turn, as I received the corn from the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? A. Four or five years - he was well known, and has been about ever since, I believe.</p>
               <p>MR.BODKIN to EDWARD LONG. Q. Does Haley live in the neighbourhood? A. I have see him several times. Mr. Young has not told me, he had sent to find him; I heard a Mr. Evans was looking after him one day, and could not find him; Hawkes was in the barge with the prisoner</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was employed to clear a shed of coals in Tooley-street; I went to Cane's wharf to get a barge to clear a ship, and met Hawkes who wanted a job; we saw these men at work - Long asked me to give him a spell, which I did, and then gave another man about twenty turns; a woman named Murphy sat on the stairs with apples; she spoke to me as I went in and out of the granary; at flood tide, I said I must go, as I was then to have a barge; I called a man and gave him up my sack - I stood talking to Murphy for ten minutes, and then went away to the harge.</p>
               <p> - HAWKES. I was with the prisoner; he offered to give them a spell, and carried some sacks into the granary - I was with him when he left; we were both going to work in a coal-barge at flood-tide; when we left he had no sack or any thing of the kind; we left together about eleven o'clock, and I continued with him all day.</p>

            . I was selling apples on the 23d just by the stairs, and saw the prisoner carry corn into the granary twelve or fourteen times or more; I was there till after he went away - he took nothing away. I saw him carry the last sack up two planks, and then give it to a man; he then took his jacket and hat, and asked me to give him a pint of beer - he took an apple and went away.</p>

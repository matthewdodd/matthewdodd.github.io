               <p>and placed in the room—the panes of glass were taken out of the frames—I saw an iron boiler which was down in the kitchen—the shop-front had been taken down, that was carried off with the rest of the things—the doors were forced right off their hinges and carried off, and some wainscot—I did not see the elder prisoner till the things had been removed—they were all gone before I saw him, and the van had returned the second time—when it drew up to the door, at least twelve or thirteen men got out of it, some with crow-bars—they then made a furious attack to get posses<lb></lb>sion of it again—I was in the premises, and Mr. Graham and several others—I was there as a friend of Wyatt's, who held it for the landlord—they made a furious attack on the premises, led on by the younger prisoner—the elder prisoner was standing opposite, encouraging the men to go on, but they could not effect an entrance—the policeman arrived, and cleared the pavement altogether—nothing was taken away after I saw the elder prisoner—there was not an entrance made—I did not hear the elder pri<lb></lb>soner say any thing about the things which had been carried away—I have heard nothing about it since from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Mr. Wyatt, who had part of this house. I do not remember Mr. George being tenant of the house—on the 5th of Au<lb></lb>gust, my father was in Whitecross-street prison—I was at the house on Wed<lb></lb>nesday the 5th of August, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, the bell rang, my mother opened the door, and in came Chadwick the younger—I said to him, "What are you going to do? who are you?"—he said, "I will tell you all about it"—I ran directly to get my brother and all the friends I could—there was a tilted van—about two persons fought against me and my brother, but there were about a dozen and a half that took away the fire-grates, windows, partitions, and put them into the van—the partitions and windows were fixed, and formed part of the house—they severed them, and took them away—they cleared the way with crow-bars—they were damaged in taking down—the sashes had been removed from the first-floor up to the second before, and they carried them off—I saw two of the men fall through the window, and break them in the cart—they were all carousing together—I saw the elder prisoner at a public-house, and he came over the way—I cannot say whether he interfered in the removal of any of the things—he was a witness to it—he was standing opposite—he put his hand to his nose at our party—I was inside the house, and could not look at him—I had quite sufficient to do to keep my own head on my shoulders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he wave his hand to any body, or any thing of that kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he did not attempt to put his hand on me or any one else—he was quiet enough—I have had a little refreshment to-day—I am quite sober now—I have lived in this house six years altogether, full—there were other lodgers in the house besides our family—my father was a lodger—he paid rent for living there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, I dare say the last—why rent, you know, has been disputed for some time—I will swear he has paid rent for living there to my knowledge—I remember George living there when I was a boy, but not in the time my father took it—it is eight or nine years ago that I remember George living in it, when he kept a saddler's shop there—I cannot tell how long since he left it—it is more than five years—I dare say about seven, but excuse me, I do not know so much about it as my brothers do, because I have not been there—I have been in service—I was footman to the late Judge, Sir John Vaughan. The house was in a very bad state of repair latterly—it was not tenantable—I do not think it has been tenantable for the last three years—my father and mother lived in the attics—I have often</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184008170183"></xptr>
               <p>seen Mr. Chadwick there—I cannot "ay how long it is ago that I first saw him there—it might be two or three years—he did not inquire of me whe<lb></lb>ther it had belonged to Sir Andrew Chadwick—I did not hear him inquire of ray father—I cannot tell whether my father has been very much engaged about Sir Andrew's property—my father was clerk of St. James's Church—I think he ceased to be so in 1823—he is here to-day, outside—I do not know that he very much interested himself about Sir Andrew's pro<lb></lb>perty—I never heard him tell the prisoner that the house belonged to Sir Andrew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> To your knowledge has Mr. Jorden Chadwick paid your father for keeping possession of that house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You see I do not know any thing of it, because I am travelling all over the country as a servant—my bro<lb></lb>ther might tell—I remember my father being distrained upon for the King's Taxes—Mr. Chadwick paid the distress out—I cannot tell whether it was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—fixtures, stoves, and such things were distrained on—I do not know whether they were condemned—I cannot tell when Mr. Chadwick paid the distress out, because he claimed the property as the heir of Sir Andrew—he might have paid it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you negociate for your father with Mr. Margetts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My brother did—I know of Mr. Margett's paying some money—I do not know what he paid for my father's liberation—the younger Chadwick came to the house about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning—I said, "What are you at here?"—he said, "I will show you, my boy"—just in that way, and I went out and got "a force" directly—that was not after my father had agreed to give up possession to Mr. Margetts—there were so many claims to the place, it was a dreadful life to live in it—I have been cut down myself by a crow-bar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the house in such a state before the Chad wick's came to it that it was not fit for any decent person to live in with comfort? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I certainly must say there were windows taken out—I know Mr. Mason, a carpenter—I do not know his son—I did not see Mason about the house at the time the van was there—I will swear he was not there—I had seen him about there a day or two before—I do not know that he has been employed by Chadwick to take away all the old materials inside. and repair the house entirely—Mason is an intimate friend of my father's—I do not know what he was doing there—I should say he was inquiring how the property got on—he is not a builder—he is foreman at some place—he only gets 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in this house. I was there on the 5th of August—I saw the younger prisoner, and several men with him—I was not there at the time they first came—I saw them taking away the fixtures, the grates, and the partitions of the different rooms, which were standing when they first came—I saw them take them down—I did not see the elder pri<lb></lb>soner at that time—I saw him when the van came the second time, nothing was removed after that time—I did not hear any one say before him what had been carried off—he was over the way at the public-house when I went there, standing with his back against the bar—I did not ask him any thing—the only words he said to me was that I was a coward—my father lived in this house when Mr. George was there, and paid rent to Mr. George—after that he lived there without paying any rent at all—on the 5th of Au<lb></lb>gust</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184008170184"></xptr>
               <p>my father had an action brought against him for an ejectment, and had gone to prison for the costs—no arrangement had been come to on the 5th of August, by which my father was to give up the lease, and hold the house for Mr. Margett's—I do not know who Mr. George was tenant to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Perhaps you know that he did not pay rent to any body else afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My father paid rent to no one after he paid Mr. George—he has lived there for the last six years without paying rent to any body, up to the 5th of this month—the house was certainly unfit for habitation the greatest part of that six years—part of the roof was in, the second-floor windows out, some of the doors were off, and as to the necessaries there was no using them—the parlours were tenantable enough—we lived in them somewhere about three years—the second-floor and the garrets were bad—the first-floor was not—my sister slept in the first-floor, though the windows were out—we slept in the parlours—it was principally wood-work that was taken away on the 5th of August, and marble from the front of the grates—I know Mr. Mason—I did not see him there about that time—I do not know that Mr. Chadwick had employed him to do some repairs to the wood-work—I do not know that he was employed at all—no repairs have been done to it by Mr. Chadwick—they were shaving the windows, that is all—the planer was at work one day—that was about the 5th of August—I cannot say exactly—it was I and my two brothers that gave up possession to Mr. Margetts—we had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Margetts for it, not more—we had my father's release from Whitecross-street as well, be<lb></lb>side that—he is not entirely discharged from the debt—we have undertaken to pay it when we come to better circumstances—I have lived in the house up to the 5th of August—Mr. Chadwick has been there very often latterly—he has not paid my father for keeping possession of the house—he has not given any thing to my father and mother that I am aware of—I do not know that my father has interfered a great deal about the property in that neighbourhood—I never heard him tell Mr. Chadwick that it was Sir An<lb></lb>drew's house—I know Mr. Chadwick claims it as the house of Sir Andrew, but there are so many claimants—I have seen this printed paper in the window—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—I cannot read.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Acton-street, Grey's Inn-road. My father was the executor to Sir Andrew's estate—the elder prisoner claiming that property, introduced his son to me—no rents have been paid to the executor—my father has been dead thirty years.</p>

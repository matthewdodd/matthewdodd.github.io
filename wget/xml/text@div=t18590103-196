                  </hi>. I am agent to the Kent Fire Insurance Company—in December, 1857, I saw the prisoner in reference to his effect<lb></lb>ing an insurance—he required the sum of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be insured upon his effects</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He told you, did he not, that his stock varied very much? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot call to mind any particular conversation upon that point—I cannot say he did not say so—it was a special risk, that means more; on account of the nature of the stock and the premises—it is my business, as agent for the Company, to go over the premises and look at the nature of the risk—I passed through the shop with Mr. Roper to look at the back premises—it is my duty, as far as possible, to protect the interests of the parties to whom I act as agent—as part of that duty I ought to look at the premises before I recommend an insurance—I did so—the premises consisted of a cellar (the basement), the shop, then the bedroom, and then the attic over—as far as my recollec<lb></lb>tion serves me, there was a gas-light at the end of the counter—I do not recollect whether there was a gas-light suspended from the ceiling of the shop—my attention was not called to that at the time—I was there to look, but my attention was not directed—I did not notice what the material of the ceiling of the shop was—I could not have told if I had looked—to my recollec<lb></lb>tion no intimation was given that a surveyor might examine the premises—I made a memorandum—the result of such a memorandum sometimes is that the Company sends a surveyor, if their attention is particularly called to it—I cannot say whether the prisoner knew that I had made a special memoran<lb></lb>dum of that kind—this is the memorandum that I made, "The stock of Richard Roper, corn dealer, of Royal-hill, Greenwich, consists of flour, seeds, &amp;c., the stock of hay, straw, and clover is kept in a timber-built shed in rear, but almost adjoining the back premises. "That was with a view to inform the Company that there was something more than usually dangerous—when a representation of that kind is made to a Company they do not generally send their own surveyor to go over the premises, unless they are specialty requested to do so—I cannot say whether or not I said anything to the prisoner about a surveyor.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Thomas Wheeler, and live in Addy-street, Deptford—I am a distant relation of the prisoner's wife—I went to the prisoner's house in September to nurse Mrs. Roper during her confinement, which was on Thursday the 9th September—she occupied a bed-room on the first floor—I remember the fire taking place on Sunday, 12th September, about 4 o'clock—on the Saturday night before retiring to bed, I had been down stairs into the kitchen—that was about half-past 11—I went down to make some gruel—I then went up stairs, and I did not leave the room any more that night—the gas-lights were burning when I left to go up stairs—there is a gas-light in the shop, and in the back parlour, which leads out of the shop—the gas had not been turned off at all then—Mr. Roper had not come up stairs to bed himself—I left Mr. Roper and the girl down stairs—I think the gas was full on at the burners—during Mrs. Roper's con<lb></lb>finement the gas had been led on, in case she wanted anything during the night—when I went up stairs at half-past 11, I left Mr. Roper and the servant down stairs—the servant's name is Waterfall—Mr. Roper came up stairs about a quarter of an hour after—he came into the bedroom and said "good night" to me and his wife, and then went to his room—since Mrs. Roper's confinement he has slept in a front room on the same floor, and the servant and the children slept in the attic—the steps of the staircase leading to the attic are just outside the bed-room door—I can't say how many stairs there are—there are two flights of stairs; I can't say how many there are in each flight—after the prisoner had said good night, I went to bed and went to sleep—after I had been asleep I was disturbed by Mrs. Roper speaking to me—she said there was a nasty smell in the room—I did not smell anything—I can't say what time it was that she spoke; it was some time in the night—I did not leave the room; I went to sleep again—Mrs. Roper awoke me to attend to her; I attended to her and then got into bed and went to sleep again—I was disturbed again by Mrs. Roper saying she smelt fire; I did not smell the fire—Mrs. Roper told me to call Mr. Roper; but before I could do so, he burst the room door open and rushed into the room—he was in his drawers and night-shirt—he said, "There is fire, for God's sake open the window, and get out as fast as you can!"—Mrs. Roper's bed was near the window; close to the window—the window on that model (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) represents the window of the bed-room from which we got on to the roof of the adjoining house—when Mr. Roper rushed into the room, the flames followed him—he assisted Mrs. Roper out of the window, on to the out-building; he then assisted me out, and gave me the baby—he left us there, and jumped off the wash-house place and went to make an alarm—before he burst the door open he knocked at the door, and called up stairs to the girl, "Lizzy, Lizzy!"—after he had got us out, he got us out himself—at that time the curtains of the bed were on fire—when he assisted us on to the out-building, we stayed there till he came back; he was away about twenty minutes—when he returned he got us off the out-building into a person's house—the position of the bed had not been moved since Mrs. Roper's confinement—it was moved about a month before, from behind the door—I mentioned about the bed being removed myself for convenience.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> To get more room for you when your mistress was confined, I suppose. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had attended her in two former confine<lb></lb>ments, and have known her all her life—I had an opportunity of seeing the prisoner on the former occasions, as well as at the time of the last confine<lb></lb>ment—he was very affectionate to his wife, and very fond of his children; as far as I saw he was a good husband and father. The first time Mrs. Roper said she smelt something she was not out of bed—she was not in a fit state to get out of bed—I attended to her, and then she laid back again and went to sleep; when she said she smelt fire on the second occasion, I did not notice it—I was very sleepy—when Mr. Roper came into the room, I was undressed, in bed—he was in his night-shirt and drawers; nothing else. The eldest of the little girls who was burnt was about five and a half years old, I think, and the other a year and seven months—it was not my wish that the gas should be left burning in the shop; Mr. Roper did it for my convenience, in case I might want a light in the night—the lamp was suspended from the ceiling with a globe over it—I cannot say whether the globe or bell was broken; I never noticed it—I was not in the shop very often—the room in which Mrs. Roper was confined was furnished—as far as I know, there was no alteration in the furniture from what there had been a month before; I did not see any—the remainder of the house was very decency furnished—there was a double chest of mahogany drawers in the room, with mahogany knobs—I have not seen the cellar where it is sug<lb></lb>gested the fire began—Mrs. Roper was confined about the time I expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember Mr. Roper's saying anything about its being unlucky that she should have been confined at that moment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said it was rather unfortunate, that he had let his shop—he asked me how soon she would be able to be removed—I told him I could not tell exactly, it was according how she was in her health; I said I thought in about ten or fourteen days—she certainly could not have been moved before without very imminent peril—she was helped out of the window—there is a cistern over the water-closet—I asked her to step on that, thinking it was wood—I was not aware there was water there—she put her foot on it and it gave way—she did not go into the cistern, only a little way; I pulled her back from it when I found what it was—she had spoken to me on the subject of leaving the shop—I had pinned the window-curtains together to keep the draught out—when the prisoner came to wish her good night they were pinned in that way—he took leave of her very affectionately, the same as usual, with affection, but nothing more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer and valuer, residing in Lewis<lb></lb>ham-road, Greenwich—I knew the prisoner before this fire took place—I heard of the fire on the Sunday morning, and on that day I offered my services to him—I have had experience in making valuations—I saw Mr. Roper on the Monday morning between 10 and 11 o'clock, at Mr. Cowell's, his father-in-law's, in Church-street, Deptford—after some conversation relative to the loss of his children, which he was deploring in a very dread<lb></lb>ful way, I said that he had better try and not think anything more about that at present, but give me some account of his loss—he said he did not want to claim anything, although he should be a great loser; nothing could compensate him for the loss of his poor children—he appeared very much distressed indeed in his mind, and it was with that intention almost, that I thought it would be doing the man a charity to call his mind away from it. He asked me what was requisite to be done—I said I should require an inventory of the whole of his goods—he said that he had prepared an inventory when he sent for the agent to insure, and he asked me whether it was not usual for an insurance office to send a surveyor to see whether or not the proposed insurer had got value to the amount which he proposed to insure for—I said it was not usual, for they generally trusted to the agents to fulfil that part of the duty; but I said, as he had so recently made an inventory of his goods, it would serve to refresh his mind—he did not produce the inventory—he has not done so at any time. I asked him how he was insured, whether he was insured properly—he said he could not tell—I then asked him if he could tell the amount of premium he had paid—he said he could not recollect exactly, but he gave me an amount something near it, and I knew, from that he was insured properly—it was doubly hazardous, because it is a very hazardous business, three risks—the premium was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that would be three risks—I was satisfied from that that he was insured properly—he told me he was insured for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, as he had so recently made out an inventory, it would serve to refresh his memory; and if he would proceed at once to give me the items, I would go on with it—he did so, or rather, I may say, I did it—a claim was afterwards sent in to the insurance office—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not the paper upon which I took down the items from him—I took it down in my book—this is it (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>). It was done in this way—of course, being a valuer, and being used to houses of almost every description, I have a pretty good knowledge of what furniture there may be in any house; and as such, I dictated to him, and said, "Was there so and so?—"Did you have so and so?"—and that was the way in which we got at the items—for instance, I said, "We will begin at the top of the house—to take the first thing, there is a bedstead: what sort of bedstead was it?"—he said, "An Arabian bedstead"—what I took down from him in my memorandum was, "An Arabian bedstead, with white dimity furniture"—then I went on again, "What mattress was there to it?"—just in that way—and he said, "There were two mattresses, and a palliasse;" I have got that—I said, "Was there a mattress?"—"Yes"—"Was there a feather-bed?"—he said, "Two beds; one was a cotton-bed, and one was a feather-bed"—he told me of the palliasse—he also told me there were two pairs of sheets, four blankets, and two counterpanes. I sent this claim in to the insurance company, with this letter annexed—there is also attached to it an acceptance of the company's offer by Mr. Roper—it was written by me, and signed by him—he told me there were six cane-seated chairs, mahogany-tray, dressing-glass, and deal dressing-table.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask him whether there was this, or did he tell you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I asked him—he scarcely told me anything himself, but I knew—there is "a fender and set of fire-irons"—I have not counted the number of items altogether—I dare say there are 209 items altogether, in the different rooms of the house—this is an exact copy of my book—there is a japanned wash-stand and fittings, and Brussels carpet to cover floor, formerly laid down in a much larger room—he told me that—I asked him what carpet it was, and he said a Brussels carpet; and it excited my surprise, a Brussels carpet being in an attic; and I received that explanation, that it was down in a much larger room in a better house; and when he came there he had no other place for it, and put it in the attic—the floor-cloth he also said was in the other house—there are prices put to all these articles; I put them—not all of them without assistance; but the majority of them I did; for instance I did not know the size of the Brussels carpet until I asked him about the probable size of the room; and as he gave me that, I put down the price—I valued the yards, so many yards at so much a yard—he did not tell me the number of yards; he told me the size of the room, as far as he could recollect, which the carpet came from—I said to him, "Was the parlour the carpet came from as large as the room we are in now?" and he said, "Yes, rather larger;" and I then knew it would take more than twenty yards, perhaps twenty-five. I took him through all the rooms in the house—I was with him about two hours and a half—altogether I was with him four hours; but I was about two hours and a half or three hours making this out—this was on the Monday—I was with him from 10 in the morning until he went over to the inquest at 3 in the afternoon—the questions were asked by me, and answers were given by him to all my questions relating to the furniture, as described here—I remember a set of <hi rend="italic">papier mache</hi> tea-trays in the parlour, the front room first floor—I asked him about them—I said, "Were there any tea-trays?"—he said, "Yes;" they are charged at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there is au item, "A large bouquet of wax flowers, under a glass shade, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I asked if he had got any ornaments of any description, and that was given me under that head—there is also an item, "Books, various, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I asked him about books, and I put the value to them—I said, "Were they worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?" and he said, "Yes"—there is "a long dinner service complete, of 150 pieces, cost 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I did not put that down—I must give a little explanation with reference to that dinner service, if you will allow me; when he spoke about the dinner service, I asked what sort of dinner service it was; whether it was a long dinner service—he said, yes, he thought it was—I said, "How many pieces were there?"—he said he could not tell; he said there was a quantity of other things which he bought at the same time; and subsequently he said, "Altogether I dare say 150 pieces:" and, consequently, I entered it in my book as "A dinner service complete, etc. etc., 150 pieces"—and he said, "I should think it amounted to from 8 to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said altogether the 150 pieces cost him from 8 to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and I put down 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—here is my book with the item entered; "Dinner service complete, etc. etc., 150 pieces"—there are two etceteras—there is a statement in my book of the cost; it is in private marks—they are all private marks—the word "cost" is not there—I have no recollection of how I came to insert the word "cost" in the claim—I had no further conversation with the prisoner about it; I never saw him afterwards—I do not recollect particularly how I came to insert "cost" here—the item, "China tea and coffee service, 7 guineas, bought at Masters's, Deptford-broadway," I inserted from him—I heard from him where it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030075"></xptr>
               <p>bought—I asked him about the items following: the cut-glass celery-stand, water-ewer, two goblets, twelve cut champagne-glasses, twelve wine-glasses, twelve liqueur-glasses, twenty-four tumblers, four cut decanters, and dessert service, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him about all those in the same way, and he told me of them—I recollect the "Two glass candlesticks, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" also the "Suit of fine black, with embroidered trousers and waistcoat, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" "An Alma coat, lined with silk, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" "Dress coat, lined with satin and quilted, and silk sleeves, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" "One velvet waistcoat, and one silk ditto"—I took that down from him—the "Coburg black dress, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." is a woman's dress—I had none of the female's dress from Mr. Roper—they were supplied by his wife's sister—most of his own clothes were stated by himself, of course I could not tell what clothes he had—he gave me those I have described—the stock I took from him—he said he thought there might be near upon four<lb></lb>teen sacks of flour—in the exercise of my duty, I of course endeavour to ascertain the exact amount, so as to be fair between both parties—I made out this inventory on the Monday night—this is an exact copy of my book, as near as possible—all the items he gave me are contained here—he had nothing to do with the letter I sent in; he never saw it—when. I had finished the inventory, I went over to the inquest with him; and the last I saw of him was after the inquest was over; he went into Mr. Waldy's on Royal-hill, where his wife was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to send the claim in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will tell you—on the Monday night I compared the inventory and the claim, as you see it there, and on Tuesday morning I took it over to Mr. Roper, at Mr. Cowell's—I asked if Roper was in; they said he was walking in the garden—I went to him, and he and Mr. Abbott were together—I said, "I have prepared your inventory and claim, come and sign it"—Mr. Abbott said, "Come up-stairs; "I said, "No"—I knew that the poor children had been brought over from Greenwich the night before, and I said, "Bring a pen and ink down, and do it here"—Abbott went up-stairs and brought a pen and ink down—Mr. Roper held the inventory in his hand, and he sat down on a piece of board that was put there for a garden seat—Abbott brought the pen and ink, and I said, "I want you to put your name there; I have claimed for the whole amount, and I wish it was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is his signature—the value of the items is 483<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is not the claim; that is the value of the goods—I cannot say that he read the claim before he signed it—I did not read it over to him, or make any explanation of it to him—I told him I had claimed for the full amount, I could do no less, and I was very sorry he was not insured for more money—I told him that before he signed—he did not look at the inventory at all; the only thing was, as he held the paper by the corner, young Mr. Abbott said, "What does it amount to?" I said, "Turn over, and you will find it on the last page, or the last but one," and as he turned it over in his hand his eye caught a double chest of drawers, and he said, "You have only put down 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for that, it cost me more"—I said, "Never mind, here is more claimed, for than you insured for; it is not worth while putting down more money"—the claim is 290<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that is what I call the full claim—I did not claim for the shed—the shed was insured separately I found, and I did not claim for that—this is the letter in which I made the original claim—I was then acting as the agent for Roper in making the claim.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he know anything of that letter, or direct you to write it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the contents were not at all dictated by him—he never saw it; the letter expresses that—I did it on my own</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you were not at all acquainted with the prisoner until this transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not personally—I have seen him, and had conversation with him at his shop—I had no personal acquaintance with him whatever, but it being in my way of business, and hearing of the fire, I volunteered my services—he at first said he should not claim at all; he said, what was the use of money to him when he had lost his poor children, it would not bring them back; he could work for more money—I said, "You ought to consider those that are alive"—it was upon that and upon ray persuasion that he went through this business—he never said from the beginning to the end that the whole of these articles were on the premises at the time of the fire—I presumed they were, but he never said so—I have before this been called in to value after fires—before I sent in any claim to the insurance company I went over the premises with a view of judging of the value of the articles upon them—I went twice before I sent in any claim—I went in the afternoon, at the same time as the jury went over to view the ruins, and again the next morning—I was only allowed to take an observation of what I could see, not to touch anything—there is no doubt that there was then property on the premises to the full value of the claim—where I thought I had overvalued, from what I could see, I went and altered my book—there were some things only charred, so that I could actually tell the quality of them from observation; and some of them I found I had put down a little bit too much, more than what was just, in my book, and I altered it—the prisoner knew nothing at all of that—you will find in my book some figures erased and different figures put down—those erasures and alterations were made upon my observation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Independent of everything that the prisoner stated as having been in the inventory, what would be your opinion of the value of the property burnt upon the premises, from what you were able to observe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> All that I could see exactly corresponded with what he had given me, what I have taken down—there were things I found that I had not got down at all—there were plenty of articles in the ruins that were not included in my estimate; I should think to the amount of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had no entry of any bed or table linen—I reserved that to be put under a separate head, but I found that I had got so much in excess of what I could claim for, that I did not enter them; I said it was no use—there was a quantity of blankets and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030077"></xptr>
               <p>different things there that I had not got any account of whatever—the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the dinner-service included other items; he mentioned sets of jugs—they are not down in my inventory in any other form—I have no account of any sort of dinner-service except that, nor any other glass of any description, nor is there any cutlery in the inventory—I have never counted the number of items; I daresay there are 209 entries—I can tell you out of those how many I found traces of—out of 11 in the attic I found traces of 9; in the bedroom out of 26 I found 21; in the front parlour, which was of course destroyed, where the seat of the fire watt, I could trace 11 different things—I have not got the number of things that were there—the attic had fallen through and showed itself on the top; the middle floor was entirely burnt; but the heavy goods, the expanding dining table, the loo table, and those sort of things had been left at the top, and I could see them—on the ground floor I found everything as specified—I did not know anything of the prisoner's character or reputation at Greenwich before this, not personally—I have only been to his shop, and had conversation with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer and appraiser. I was employed to investigate the prisoner's claim by Mr. Hodsoll, the accredited surveyor to the Kent Fire office; he happened to be out of town at the time, and I transacted his business for him—on the Tuesday after the fire, the claim that had been sent in was put into my hands, and on the Thursday I went to the ruins and made an examination—I could trace some of the house-hold furniture that had been claimed for; of some all traces were gone—I could only trace a small proportion comparatively with the number of articles claimed, perhaps not one article out of six or eight, (<hi rend="italic">referring to a memorandum</hi>)—I traced the things in the attic, a portion of them—I found the remains of the bedstead, and some of the bedding—I could not trace the whole of the things by a very large proportion—I could not find any traces of china, glass, dinner, or dessert service; I found a small portion of common blue and white ware, but certainly nothing like a dinner, dessert, or tea service,—I could trace no portion—I have been in the habit of examining ruins for upwards of thirty years—traces of china glass, and such things would be found, broken and smashed to pieces, but I did not find a dinner-service by following the patterns—I did not find a vestige of a book; books are to be found after a fire—it is very difficult to burn books, they will char all round, but you will find the centre will not</p>

               <p>burn, you may read the title—I saw traces of about half a sack of flour,—if there had been fourteen sacks of flour on the premises when the fire took place, I think I must have found traces of pretty well all—the action of the water and the fire will calcine the floor so that you cannot destroy the whole of it—I found traces of a very small portion of the wearing apparel at my first view—I found a small portion of it in the wardrobe—I should have expected to find traces of the greater portion, especially of the man's wearing apparel; the waistbands of the trousers, and the backs and collars of the coats; it is a very hard matter to burn such things as those—there was no fire-place in the attic—I think the model will show that.</p>

I remember the fire—some short time before that, the girl Waterfall had been in the habit of bringing things to our house—the day Mr. Roper let his shop, in the evening she brought about a dozen plates in the perambulator—that was the first time she brought anything—it was on the Tuesday evening, she came with the perambulator and the two children—the next day, Wednesday, she came four times—she brought things each time—she brought a dinner service, she brought part of it each time—I do not know whether she brought the large dishes that day—between that time and the fire, she brought it all as far as I recollect—I took some of them in myself—I put them in the back parlour on the sofa as she brought them in, until I had convenient time, and then I placed them in a box in the back parlour—I did not receive the dessert service; I know it was there, I saw it, and a case of wax flowers was there—I saw one sack containing books, two parlour lamps, and three paper tea-trays—there were some earthenware jugs, they were not real china, only mock, three were brought to my house—I saw a scent bottle, and a tea pot—I know that all those things belonged to my son-in-law—they were all afterwards given up to the police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long has Mr. Roper been married to your daughter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say correctly, I think about seven years—he has been a kind and affectionate husband to her, and an excellent father to his children—he has always been a respectable man, I believe, and highly esteemed by everybody until this affair happened—I learnt from Mr. Roper him self the reason why the things were sent to my premises—that was before they were removed; he gave me this reason, he came to my house</p>

               <p>and said, "Mother, I have let the shop"—I said, "You have? I am glad of that; what have you let it for?"—he said, "130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and take the stock—my wife wished me to ask you if you would take in the crockery, because we had so many things broken coming from Plaistow here, and she wishes to pack them herself, because she <hi rend="italic">looks</hi> every hour, and she wants to pack them to send them away"—I never saw my daughter but once while the things were being sent to my premises; she knew of their coming—it was her wish for her husband to ask me to take them in, to take charge of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness, and live with her at 7, James-place, Deptford—I remember, on the Wednesday or Thursday before the fire took place, Mr. Roper's boy bringing two boxes on a truck—I asked him to bring them into the house—I believe they contained china, as I heard them rattle in bringing them in—I also saw some wax flowers in our house, and one sack of books—on the Saturday before the fire, the servant Waterfall came—I met her in the passage—she had her master's writing-desk—she told me so—I think it was between 6 and 7 in the evening—it was not quite dark—the desk was left there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are the sister of Mrs. Roper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I learnt from Mr. Roper why these things were sent to our house; he told us that he had let his business—he did not say that in the presence of his wife—he came to our house, and my mother and myself were at home—my sister was expecting to be confined every day—I used to go and visit her once or twice a week—my father is a tailor, and my brother also—they made things for Mr. Roper—they always have made things for him—he had a great many things—Mrs. Roper had been a dressmaker—she had a good stock of things—I have assisted her in making them—I am a dress-maker and milliner—I know that my sister had a good stock of wearing apparel—I am quite certain of it—they lived in better premises and in better style at Plaistow—I have seen much of them together—he is indeed a good father and a good husband—we took charge of the little boy the same day upon which my sister was confined—he was too unwell to go back, or he would have been returned on the Saturday—I heard an offer made by Miss Morton to take one of the other children during my sister's confine<lb></lb>ment, and Mr. Roper declined, and Mrs. Roper likewise.</p>

I am the prisoner's father-in-law—I removed a glass shade and wax flowers from the prisoner's house, on the Thursday before the fire, I think—I did not myself remove anything else before the fire—at the latter end of August, I pledged some articles for Mrs. Roper; silver sugar-tongs and forks, twelve or fourteen plated spoons, a bread knife, a decanter and stand, one or two gowns, to the best of my knowledge; and a small frock, wrapped up in a drab curtain, I think—I also pledged a coat and two waistcoats, belonging to the prisoner, at a pawnbrokers, named Barr—I pledged them in the names of Brown and Bircham—I handed the money to Mrs. Roper—I cannot exactly say how much I got altogether—I think it was just upon 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the articles have since been produced, and I have seen them.</p>

On the Friday week before the fire, Mrs. Roper gave me a carpet-bag to take charge of; that wag at the prisoner's house—I took it to my house—I afterwards unpacked it—it contained glass—there were four decanters, a celery glass, a water ewer, two goblets, three dozen wine glasses, and some champagne glasses—I afterwards pledged them for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the request of Mrs. Roper, and gave her the money—I pledged them at Mr. Burt's, Powis-street, Woolwich.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Mr. Roper was not present at the time, was he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I never had any communication with him on the subject—this was on the Friday week previous to the fire—I am now working as a labourer in the Woolwich Arsenal—I never was a bricklayer; I was a glazier—I had something to do with repairing these premises of Mr. Roper's, at the time he took them—I assisted in the shop—the ceiling immediately over the shop was canvas papered and then painted—the canvas was nailed to the rafters of the shop—it was from that ceiling that the lamp was sus<lb></lb>pended—on the wall on the right-hand side upon entering the door there was also canvas, but the left-hand I think not—I think at the side it was lath and plaster under the canvas—there was no lath and plaster to the ceiling—the prisoner paid me no direct wages for what I did, being his relative, and not being in employment at the time—I was there to assist him, as a friend or relative, without any direct regard to wages—I was paid some trifle—there was money expended on the house by Mr. Roper—there was a front put to the shop, at considerable expense, and the inside was thoroughly fitted by him; everything new and appropriate to the business upon which he was about to enter—it was originally a hairdresser's, and had to be turned into a corn-chandler's—the fittings alone, I should say, must have cost from 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a rough guess; the alterations altogether, window and all, I should say, cost not less than 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I was in the prisoner's service close upon two years—I was in his service at the time of the fire—shortly before the fire I received several things from the prisoner's house to take to Mr. Cowell's house at Deptford—I began to take them on the Monday night—I think I first took a dozen plates on the Monday night—I went several times from that time to the time of the fire—I took a few articles at a time; it was in the evening part, at dusk—the prisoner told me to take them to Mr. Cowell's, but I was not to tell any one—I remember the large dishes being moved—Mr. Roper moved them himself—I remember the stand of wax flowers, they used to stand on the table in the front parlour up stairs—they were removed on the Wednesday night by Mr. Cowell—I remember a quan<lb></lb>tity of glass that used to be on the sideboard in the front parlour—I missed the glass on the Friday before the fire—I did not miss the decanters—on the Friday week before the fire I saw a bundle tied up, it was a largish bundle; it looked like clothes wrapped up—it was bound up in some white dimity—Mr. Cowell came there that evening—I remember that same day dusting Mrs. Roper's bedroom—I dusted the wardrobe—in doing that I opened the drawers where she used to keep her dresses, in order to dust the ledges, and I saw that the dresses were gone; they were silk dresses—I also saw a pawn-ticket—some books were removed before the fire—I remember holding the sacks for some books to be put in—there were two sacks—I am quite sure there were two sacks of books—Mr. Roper put them in—I remember a writing-desk being removed, that was on the Saturday night about eight o'clock, the night of the fire—I did that by Mr. Roper's direc<lb></lb>tion—he told me to take the writing-desk to Mrs. Cowell's; it was rather heavy—it was wrapped in a little bundle handkerchief—I removed two globes on the Friday—the boy removed the lamps in the basket, on the Saturday night of the fire—I remember the prisoner giving me some direc<lb></lb>tions about getting some turps—it was about eleven o'clock at night that I got it; but he had told me about it in the evening part—he told me to get some turps, and see how they sold it, and I got half a pint—I asked him how much I was to get, and he said, "You will see how they sell it"—nothing was said about how much I was to get—he gave me sixpence and a bottle; it was a large white glass bottle—I have got turps for him before—there was a bottle in which I used to get it, but this was a bottle I had never had before—it was larger—I went and fetched some turps—I got half a pint, at Mrs. Harding's, in London-street, Greenwich, that is an oil shop—a young woman served me—I have been to the shop since—Maria Harding was the person who served me—when I had got the turps I brought it back, and gave it to the prisoner—I don't know what he did with it—I gave it to him, and he said, "Have you brought so much as that?"—I told him how much there was—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bottle I used to fetch the turps in—in two or three pennyworths—the bottle I got the sixpennyworth in was larger than this, and it was a flat bottle, something similar to this (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—I had never got as much as half a pint of turps before—Mr. Roper said he wanted it to clean the bookcase with—I had never seen him cleaning the furniture himself—I went up stairs that night about twelve</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030084"></xptr>
               <p>o'clock—I stayed in Mrs. Roper's room about ten minutes, and then I went up to bed—the prisoner went up at the same time; we both went up together—before he went up, I observed that he turned the gas three parts off—I had not been down in the cellar that day, nor the day before—I had not been down there for three or four days—there was no gas in the cellar—when I went up stairs to bed, as far as I can judge, everything was safe—I was awoke by the prisoner after having gone to bed—he called "Lizzy" twice—I said, "Yes, sir," and got out of bed, and went to the door, and opened it—I had not smelt any smell of fire before that—when I opened the door I saw the flames at the bottom of the stairs—the heat was so great I ran to the window—I climbed out of the window, and was ultimately saved by the fire-escape from the roof—I have seen all the things that have been produced here to day—I know the desk, it is the desk I have been speaking of—this is my master's dinner-service, and the glass, and the wax-flowers—I have since seen the things which were pawned—all the things I have seen were my master's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say you generally fetched only one or two pennyworth of turps? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, two pennyworth would about three-parts fill this bottle, I should think—I was not accustomed to fill even, this bottle—the six pennyworth did not fill the other one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to buy half a pint? who told you to do it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Roper told me to get some turps—I did not get the usual quantity, as I thought the bookcase would take a good drop, that was the reason I bought five pennyworth—it was fivepence the half pint—I had a sixpenny piece—I had not known in the morning that the furniture was going to be cleaned—I did not mention on the Sunday morning that I had to clean the furniture the next day—I swear that—I remembered this turps after I had been examined half a dozen times—I did not think of it at first—I did not say on the Sunday that I was going to clean the furniture the next day—Mr. Roper said on the Saturday night "I want you to get some turps, and we will clean the book-case"—I generally cleaned the furniture—I believe the boy Morris took away the two sacks of books—directly there was the alarm of lire I got out of the window as quickly as I could.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fireman in the service of the parish of Green<lb></lb>wich—I have been a fireman for twenty years—on 21st September I was placed in charge of the ruins at the prisoner's house—I have been in the habit of forming a judgment as to the origin of fires—I have seen premises just after they have been burnt down—on Friday, 22d October, I went down into the cellar for the first time—the cellar was accessible before that at one part, the flap at the back of the shop, but not the steps, where it was choked up with rubbish—I removed the rubbish from there—I found that the steps were nearly consumed—the bottom step was not consumed—they were wooden steps—I am speaking of the step-ladder; that went from the shop into the cellar—I produce the bottom stair of the first flight—it was a step-ladder; there was no stair there—there was no staircase from the shop to the cellar, merely a step-ladder—there was a staircase leading up stairs, just above the step-ladder, leading from the shop to the upper part of the house—this is the bottom step (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); the other part was totally consumed—when I went down, having cleared away the rubbish, I found part of some hay and straw, lying cross ways on the steps (<hi rend="italic">referring to the model</hi>)—under this part of the flooring the straw was totally con<lb></lb>sumed—the flooring was very much burnt at one part—it runs about two feet six from the bottom step—the flooring was charred more or less; further on here it was not charred, on account of the straw not being consumed—this piece of paper describes the position of the straw under the step, and part of a truss of straw was lying on the top of the step—I cannot say how many treads there were to the steps; they run nine inches apart—I dare say there were nine or ten—there was straw lying underneath the ladder—the wood-work of the other parts of the cellar was charred, and the roof also, more or less—I have seen this model before; it exactly repre<lb></lb>sents the roof of the cellar as I saw it burnt in October—I am able to say that the fire came from below, because, if it had come from the top, it would have burnt the contrary way—the hole underneath was rather larger than at the top—I saw no other straw, or truss of straw in the cellar, except what is produced here—I examined to see whether there were traces of straw in the shop, and could not find any, and I should say that they had not been removed or examined before I looked—if the fire had com<lb></lb>menced in the shop above, and any rafters or wood had fallen from above into the cellar, it might have set fire to the straw; but the rubbish would have fallen on it and smothered it, and so much of the straw would not have been consumed—there are five holes burnt in the floor (<hi rend="italic">pointing out, by the model, their position with regard to the staircase</hi>)—we got the fire well under by a quarter to 5; and if it began in the cellar, the heat would be very great there—if the flame had gone up from the cellar, it would, no doubt, have gone up rapidly and with intensity, and it would then have ascended the staircase of the house—supposing the fire originated there, that would be the first place it would go to—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bottom step of the first flight; the fire coming from the cellar, this part was burnt; it was situated next to the opening—if the fire came from the cellar, it would catch this opening, and not the other; it was charred underneath—I can say that the fire originated in the cellar, at the bottom of the steps.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a foreman in the London Fire Brigade 19 years, and have been 29 years in the service—I am in no way connected with the Kent Fire-office, nor with, Smart or Lilley—I was at the prisoner's house about 5 o'clock on the morning the fire occurred. On 24th and 25th October I went to the ruins to examine them—that was before the examination before the Magistrate—I have not the least doubt whatever of the fire having begun in the cellar under the cellar stairs—this flooring (<hi rend="italic">taking it out of the model</hi>) exactly represents the state of the flooring as I saw it—I believe the holes to have been made from underneath, from the flame coming under here—the fire appeared to have gone up the stairs, through the roof, and through the roof of the adjoining house—it was all down when I arrived at 5 o'clock—I saw the remains of four or five trusses of straw, and from that there must have been a great body of fire shot up—if turpentine was put on the straw, it would aid the rapidity and intensity very much.</p>

                  </hi>. I am professor of chemistry at the Middlesex Hospital—supposing turpentine was mixed with straw for the purpose of being fired, no smell whatever of the turpentine would remain afterwards, if it was perfectly consumed—in order to test that, I made some experiments, and burnt some straw with turpentine, and some without—in this bottle I burnt some straw saturated with turpentine; there is no smell remaining.</p>

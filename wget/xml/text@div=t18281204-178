On the 16th of October, I gave him two bonnets in a bag to take from my house, No. 2, Chequer-alley, to Mr. Johns, in Redcross-street, Cripplegate - he came back without them, and brought a parcel; he said Mrs. Johns had sent her young man for the bonnets, and he had given him that parcel - it contained a dirty greasy frock.</p>

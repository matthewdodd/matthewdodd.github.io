                  </hi>. I am a working-jeweller, and live in Benjamin-street, in the parish of St. Sepulchre, Middlesex. The prisoner called on me on the 19th of July, and solicited work—I did not set him then—my lad went down to him, and he wrote this note in my parlour—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"Mr. Davis's compliments to Mr. Onions, and begs to say, that could he give a little employment, at a weekly small salary, he could introduce him to a good ready-money trade of jobbing and orders. 10, John's-row, near Bath-street, City-road, July, 19th, 1841"—I engaged him on Wednesday, the 21st—no wages were mentioned—I never men<lb></lb>tion wages till I have tried a man one or two days—he came about half-past nine o'clock on the 21st—he said he had a letter to write, he went away, and returned about ten o'clock—he worked till four o'clock very well—he then said he would go round to some of his customers at different parts of the town—I knew he had been several years in the manufacturing line, in a respectable way, and said, "As you are going round, you may know a great many persons," and I let him have a quantity of goods, to show to customers to sell—he went away with them—he returned at half-past six o'clock, bringing all the goods back—he said he had had an offer of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the diamond pin—I had put 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—he then took three cameo brooches out, one at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and two at 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he said he had an offer for, at nearly the price I had put on them—I was surprised he had not sold them—he then selected two pairs of ear-rings, and said he had been offered 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I had said 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I would sell them for 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if the parties would give the money—he said he was sure they would give the money, they were men of respectability, and he would be sure to bring back the money—he then selected a turquoise and a garnet-keeper, which he said he had been offered 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for—I wanted 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him he could take that, and was very sorry he had not sold them, being so little less than I wanted—he said, "I could not do that without your con<lb></lb>sent, being only one day in your employment"—he also took a twin pin, with a chain, which he said he had been offered money for—I at last said, "Go out again directly, and I will give you a diamond cluster ring, worth 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., besides, as you have got such good customers"—I said, "What time will you return?"—he said, "I don't think I can return before ten o'clock, for I am to wait at some hotel for a gentleman, a shopkeeper at Davenport"—I said, "I wish you could get back by half-past nine o'clock"—he said, "Then you must let me have 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and I will be back by half-past nine o'clock"—he took out the articles stated, amounting to 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he did not return that night—I was very much alarmed, and next morning I sent my youth, Churchyard, up to his lodging, to see what had become of him—he got a policeman—I saw the prisoner at the station on the 22nd of July.</p>

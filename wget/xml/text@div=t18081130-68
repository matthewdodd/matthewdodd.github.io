               <p>Q. Did you see him - A. My niece saw him. As soon as he was gone, she called out to me the old man has got another pound of candles; I followed him to his lodgings; I found him, I took him by the collar, desired him to deliver up the candles; he told me if I would not hurt him he would pay me for them, I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300052"></xptr>him as he had robbed me so many times before I would detain him. I sent for a constable and delivered him up, and the candles.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tide waiter, in the Customs. On 29th March I was at the Custom House, in the morning—I had my bag, containing my bed and other articles—amongst them was a coarse blue boat cloak—they were in a waterproof bag, painted blank, about three feet and a half high—we roll the bed and bedding, and put them in—I saw the bag on the Monday,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185305090097"></xptr>
               <p>and saw the contents of it, and on Tuesday, the 29th, about 10 o'clock in the morning, I saw the bag in the passage leading into the Custom House, where we always leave the bags—I was about the premises waiting to be sent on other duty—I beard that a bag was missing belonging to another officer—I wept to assist that officer in looking for his bag—I then looked at my own—it was not in the state in which it had been; the tie had been taken off it, and it was open—I did not tie it up again; I left it in that state—I went to look for it again in about three quarters of an hour; it was then gone—I had not directed any person to take it away—I went and made a communication to the gatekeeper, at the western entrance to the Custom House Quay—a person taking the bag could not have gone out without going through some gate—I have never seen or heard of the bed or bedding since, but I have seen the cloak—I know the prisoner; he used to be about that place many times; he would have an opportunity of passing up and down that passage—I am not sure that I saw him that day.</p>

I was in the tide-waiters'-room on Tuesday morning, 29th March, between 9 and 10 o'clock—I had the misfortune to lose my bed and bedding—I was discussing that matter with my brother officers when Stewart discovered his loss—I had seen the prisoner that morning in the passage leading to the back yard from the western gate of the house across the tide-waiters' room—he was about ten feet from the room at the time I saw him, going away from the room—that was about three-quarters of an hour before Stewart missed his bag—the prisoner had a bag on his back which I supposed contained a bed—it was one of the usual</p>

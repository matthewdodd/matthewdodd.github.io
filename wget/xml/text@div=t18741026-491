                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>). On 15th September I took the prisoner on a warrant granted on the 14th—I went to his house in Oxford Road, Barnsbury, got into the garden over the back wall, and caught sight of him in the back kitchen; he made a start to run away, but I rushed in and caught hold of him—I said that I had a warrant for his arrest for obtaining goods of Messrs. Candy, of Watling Street—he said "It is a debt, they can't make a fraud of it"—I said "I will read the warrant to you"—ne said "Never mind, I know what it is, I know all about it"—I got hold of him, opened the front door, called for assistance, and Harding, whom I had placed there, came—I said. to the prisoner "Have you any duplicates in the house?"—he said "No"—I found these nine duplicates in a pair of trousers in the dresser drawer and in another drawer these twenty-three duplicates relating to hosiery and other things—I went with the prisoner upstairs and found the second floor front room locked—I asked him for the key—he said he had not got it—I said "Is there anything there?"—he said "No" I took him to a closet on the same floor, which was locked, and said "Is there anything there?"he said "No"—I said "Where is the key?"—he said that he had not got it—I ordered the front room door to be forced open and the cupboard, and then Harding pro<lb></lb>duced seventy-eight duplicates from the front room and sixty-six from the cupboard on which the advances amount to about 330<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—sixty-seven of the duplicates were of 1873 and were then a year old, and forty of them were out of date—eighty-seven of them are of 1874—the aggregate of contracts and duplicates out of date is upwards of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—contract notes are given by pawnbrokers for three months or one month, as the case may be—I also found a large quantity of papers and bill heads relating to various transactions, invoices of goods from different firms, a cheque-book of the London and County Bank, Islington Branch, and one of the National Provincial, a pass-book of the Birkbeck Bank and several counterfoils of their cheques—the pass-book is made up to November, 1873—twenty-three cheques out of the twenty-five have been taken out of the cheque-book of the London and County Bank—here is only one blank cheque here now, but you will find the others among the papers—Messrs. Candy and Mr. Sayers are the names on the last two counterfoils—I have never seen any duplicates relating to Candy's or to the Wood Street Company's goods, but I went round with the witnesses and traced the goods—I found on the prisoner these two receipted invoices of Messrs. Candy's (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also found a letter of 24th July, signed Richard Morris (<hi rend="italic">Marked E</hi>)—there was not a chair or a table in the. house, they were using two drawers as a table and chair, and in the bedroom I found a mattress and a few things to cover it, and wearing apparel belonging to the prisoner and his wife was lying about—I found receipted invoices of Young and Rochester, of April 4th and 7th, and Wood Street Warehouse invoices of 1st and 7th September—the prisoner's wife asked Harding to allow her to go to the water-closet—he followed at a respectful distance, and after she left, this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found on the floor—it is dated</p>

I am salesman to Sayer and Heale, of Bishopsgate Street—on Saturday, 29th August, about 7.45 in the evening the prisoner asked to be allowed to leave a parcel there because he was going to have his hair cut—he returned saying that the shop was shut, and came in and fitted on two pairs of boots, one pair was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the others 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took off 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as he took the two pairs—he took out a check-book and wrote a cheque for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the London and County Bank, Islington Branch—I would not have let him take the boots without the cheque, but he also mentioned the names of two gentlemen who were very good customers of mine, which induced me to believe that the cheque was good—he paid it to me as cash, and it was returned to me unpaid at 3 o'clock on Monday afternoon—on the Tuesday night I saw the prisoner outside the shop with one of the pairs of boots on his feet—I noticed them when he was given in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am accountant to the National Provincial Bank of England, Islington Branch—we always require introduction or reference with customers—the prisoner opened an account with us on 8th July, 1874, with 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he received a cheque-book of twenty-four cheques—on 9th July he drew out 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 10th, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in favour of Mrs. Hazelton—on 23rd July the account was overdrawn 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that was by accident—this is a cheque-book belonging to our branch; I can't say it is the prisoner's book—this is a letter sent to him on 24th July giving him notice of the overdraft; the account continued in that state until 3rd September; he then paid in 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid in the first thing in the morning, and the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. between 3 and 4 o'clock; that made him in funds to the amount of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 4th September, 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was drawn out by a cheque in favour of Mrs. Hazleton; that left two guineas altogether—twelve cheques were drawn on this account, seven were paid, five were presented and not paid—on 31st August he had no credit at our bank or any right to draw a cheque; we never allowed him to overdraw—the cheques produced, drawn in favour of the Wood Street Company and Candy &amp; Co., were all refused payment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know of any arrangement that you made with the manager when you opened the account, I was not present—I am quite sure he did not allow you an overdraft—I don't think it likely that he would allow you to draw upon country cheques—the cheques drawn in favour of Mrs. Hazleton might be presented by any one else.</p>

We keep all the cheques that we honour, we do not give them up to the customers—the fact of these two cheques being found in the prisoner's possession would show that they were never paid by us—it is very common for customers at banks if a cheque is dishonoured to go round to the bankers who have presented it and pay the money, and then the cheque would be given up to them—these two cheques are marked "N. S." by our bank, so that they were not paid there; they must have been taken up in the way I have suggested.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 174). At 11 o'clock, on 31st October, the prisoner and thirty other sailors were outside the German Flag public-house in St. George's-street quarrelling—I told them to go away—the prisoner would not; he was drunk—I took hold of him and he struck me with his fist, and then drew a knife, opened it, and struck at my face with it—I struck his arm aside, and caught him by the collar—the sailors dragged us both into the house—another constable came to my assistance, and we took him to the station.</p>

I was in the public-house with my ship-mates; a man came into the house with his shipmates, and asked us to give him a glass of ale; my mates would not do so, and then we began quarrelling. The man followed us when we came out. There were eight or nine men outside the door; when I came out they flew at me and struck me; they knocked him and made a hole in his head, then he got up and took a knife out of his pocket; his shipmates came and dragged me out of the public-house; then the policeman came up and took me.</p>

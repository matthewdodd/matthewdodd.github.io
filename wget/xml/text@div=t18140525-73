               <p>GEORGE HARRICK. I am a constable. I was at the fair; I saw Martin and the prisoner. I asked Martin what was the matter; he said this fellow has cut my watch-ribbon; he has got my seal and key. I searched the prisoner, and after I had searched him Martin had got the seal and key in his hand.</p>
               <p>Martin. The prisoner had dropped it out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never had it in my hand, nor never saw it.</p>
               <p>Harrick. He told me if I would take him to the magistrate, he would tell something that would be of advantage to the public. I took him. He told of the prisoners that are now coming forward, and where the gold seals were pawned.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Trinity Buildings, Great Tower Street—on the night of 16th April I was on Tower Hill and heard cries of "Police!" and "Murder!" from a beer shop—I went in and saw three soldiers in the bar behind the counter, and the landlord was down on the floor; two soldiers had knocked him down—I stood alongside the counter and saw the prisoner pushing and pulling the people about—he then opened the till and put some copper money into his right-hand pocket, leaving a threepenny or fourpenny piece and a halfpenny, on the edge of the till—he did not put the till back again—I followed him and gave him in custody ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afteerwards.</p>

               <p>Row—on the night of 16th of April there was a bit of a bother with a strange civilian who had never been in the house before—the prisoner and another one teller than him made a bother about taking the civilian's um<lb></lb>rella, and he and another knocked my husband and another man down ind sent me up against the counter—the prisoner took the money out of the till, and I jumped over the bar and called, "Police!"—there was not much in the till, as I had taken all the large money out before.</p>

There were ten or twelve soldiers in the house, and a number of loose women. They were fighting all over the house.</p>

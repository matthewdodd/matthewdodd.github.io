                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Warren, who keeps the Salisbury Arms, Bear-street, Leicester-square. On Friday, 5th Dec., between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the bar, and ordered a bottle of rum and a bottle of gin—he had an apron on, and no coat—I served him with a bottle of gin, and got a man who was stopping with us, to fill a bottle of rum—after I had filled a bottle with the ordinary gin, I said, "We have a better quality, sir, if you prefer it," giving him a drop in a glass—he said, "That is very good; I prefer the best, and don't mind the price"—I filled a second bottle of the best, and laid both bottles on the counter—they came to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I would refund 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the two bottles when they were returned—he laid what appeared to me to be a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of Eng<lb></lb>land note on the counter—I took it up and looked at it, and being a dusky day I thought it a very good one—I asked him where he brought it from—he said, from Mr. Gordon, Cecil-court—I said, "Are you Mr. Gordon?"—he said, "No, but I will put Mr. Gordon's name on with pleasure"—I fetched pen and ink, and he wrote on it, "C. Gordon, Cecil-court"—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Cecil-court is quite convenient to our house—I took the note, and put it in my pocket, gave the prisoner 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change, and thanked him, and he left—I paid the note away, I think, on the 10th, to our brewer's collector; it came back on the following Tuesday, as a forgery—I knew that there was a Mr. Gordon living in Cecil-court; I did not know him, but I had heard customers speak of him—On 17th Dec., the prisoner came again, and asked for a bottle of the best gin—I took an empty bottle in my hand, and went into the parlour and spoke to nay husband—he is an invalid—the prisoner could not hear what I said to my husband—I came back to the bar, put the bottle of gin in paper, and laid it on the counter—the prisoner laid down a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, apparently, to me—I took it up, and looked at it, and said, "Is this your own note?"—he said, "No, the gentleman's name and address is on it"—I said, "Yes, but it does not look to me nice"—I took it into the parlour, and spoke to my husband, and brought it back, and said to the prisoner, "They won't give me change for it, they don't think it a right one"—he said, "Give it to me, if it is a bad one I will take it back to the person"—I said, "No, I shall detain the note until you fetch the gentleman from Princes-street, who owns it"—my hus<lb></lb>band went round and came in at the front door, and left the house with the prisoner—I said to him, "Go with this gentleman to Princes-street, and fetch the gentleman that owns this note;" and I said privately to my hus<lb></lb>band, "Give him into custody, that is the person that brought the other note"—the prisoner looked very pale, but said nothing; he went quietly with my husband—I kept the note in my hand—I marked it afterwards at the station—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave it to Ryan the constable when he came back with my husband and the prisoner.</p>

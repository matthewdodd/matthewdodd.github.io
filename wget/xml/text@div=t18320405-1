               <p>Q. What do you know of this transaction? A. A person brought to our counting-house this letter, containing the bill of exchange I now hold in my hand; I do not know who the person was - the letter was wafered at the time; by the endorsement on the letter it appears to have been brought on the 9th of October, 1829, and I believe that to be the date - I did not see the prisoner after that till he was in custody about a fortnight ago; we did not make any advance on the bill, nor see the prisoner about it - my partner had before advanced him 500l. on a bill of lading; I am certain of his being the person who was at our house, although he had whiskers at that time, which he has not now, and he had no wig then - if he had, it was not one of the colour he has now; when I saw him at Lambeth-street his whiskers were shaved off, but I am quite sure he is the man, both from his tone of voice and his appearance.</p>
               <p>

            . I am a clerk in the house of Fletcher and Co., and was so in October, 1829. I know the prisoner's person, and am quite positive of him - I saw him at the house previous to this transaction, but not subsequently till he was in custody; I never saw him write, but we have done business with him upon writing, which he acknowledged to be his - he called at our house the latter end of September, 1829, with a bill of lading, which had his endorsement on it, desiring the contents to be delivered over to our house, and 500l. was advanced on it; this enables me to form a judgment of the character of his hand-writing; (looking at the bill) I do not believe the bill to he his writing, nor the acceptance, but the endorsement I should say is his hand-writing; - I did not see him write when he presented the bill of lading; I never saw him write, but from my judgment from the endorsement to the bill of lading - I should say the letter which contained this bill was his hand-writing; I did not see him after the transaction about the bill of lading, till he was in custody - he was then very much altered in appearance; he had light hair when he called at our counting-house, and I considered that it was his own hair; he had a black wig on at the office, similar to what he has now, and he had very small light whiskers, which are now shaved off - I have not the least hesitation in swearing he is the man who I saw relative to the bill of lading.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you compare the hand-writing of the letter with the endorsement of the bill of lading? A. I have; my judgment remains the same - I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050004"></xptr>not the least hesitation in saying positively it is your hand-writing, both the letter and the endorsement on the bill - I received the letter, and handed it over to Mr. Holl; I stood by him while he read it, and saw the bill taken out - I have not the slightest doubt it is the bill which was in that letter.</p>
               <p>MR. EDWARD FLETCHER. In October, 1829, I was in partnership with John Myrie Holl and

            . I saw the prisoner at our counting-house, on the 30th of September, and early in October, 1829, relative to a professed shipment of goods - this was before the letter and bill arrived at our counting-house; I did not see him afterwards till he was in custody - I saw him sign and endorse the bill of lading, upon which I advanced 500l. - I have not a doubt upon my mind that the whole of the body of this bill of exchange is in the prisoner's handwriting; I do not know

            , of Berwick-on-Tweed, and never could find any such person - I have not made inquiry at Berwick.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the letter which contained the bill - does that letter appear to be in the hand-writing of the prisoner? A. It does; I have no doubt whatever that it is his hand-writing; I saw him endorse the bill of lading - I have seen him write twice, and have not a doubt of its being his writing: when I saw him in custody I knew him again immediately; he had the same black wig on as he has now, but at our counting-house he had rather light brown hair, and as far as I could judge it was his natural hair; I think I described him to the officers in 1829, as having whiskers, but do not recollect that - I remember the colour of his hair perfectly well; the bill of exchange is addressed to Robert Makin and Co., merchants, Liverpool; I do not know such persons myself; I have since seen Mr. Meyer, who was connected with them; the William is the ship the bill of lading alluded to; I believe the endorsement on the bill of exchange to be the prisoner's hand-writing - there is an endorsement on the bill in the name of Usher.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you try if there was such a person as Coates to be found? A. Yes, I found there was a Mr. Coates in St. Martin's-lane, but could not find him himself - he is subpoenaed here to-day: I never heard of your being at Havre, in France, nor any thing relative to an imposition being practised upon you in any shape whatever; I marked the bill, and know it again - it has been in our solicitor's hands part of the time; I did not advance any money on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear of my having been latterly unwell? A. You applied to the Magistrate to be continued in the infirmary - I never heard of your having had a fever.</p>

               <p>The letter containing the bill was as follows:</p>
               <p>Brighton, Tuesday, 6th of October, 1829.</p>
               <p>GENTLEMEN, - With the hope of finding the William safely arrived by the time I return to London, which will be on Sunday or Monday next; I came to see this celebrated place, accompanied by a Mr. Usher, who is considerably engaged in trade in Dublin, and who I shall take the liberty of introducing to you; Mr. Coates, of St. Martin's-lane, who presents this letter, has kindly undertaken the trouble of paying for some things purchased by me in London, for which purpose I send the enclosed bill for 200l., for which I request you will be so good as to give a cheque on your bankers. No demand shall be made on you for money untill the bill be paid; my letters are directed"Post-office;" perhaps you would be good enough to take them into your care should there be any - shall make you an early call on my arrival in London. I am, Gentlemen, yours, &amp;c.</p>

            . I am clerk to Back-house and Co., of Liverpool, and was formerly clerk to Makin and Co., of Liverpool; I was their book-keeper in 1829, and know their hand-writing; there are only two partners - (looking at the bill) this acceptance is not the hand-writing of either of them; I have seen them write frequently for about thirty years, and am certain this was never written by either of them - I know no Mr. Anderton, of Berwick-on-Tweed; if they had a customer of that name, I must have known him - I never heard of such a person transacting business with them: we had no acquaintance whatever at Berwick-on-Tweed - I have known the prisoner nearly twenty years, and have not a doubt of his person; when I knew him he had lighter hair, and wore pretty long whiskers, of a light colour: when I saw him at the office he appeared as he does now - I knew him in Liverpool, and have frequently conversed with him; he knew me in Makin's office, and knew who they were - he never resided at Liverpool; his father did business with Makin, and lived at Sligo, in Ireland; the prisoner frequently came with him, and was introduced to our house by the father, who was in the corn trade; the firm was Morgan Macdonogh and Co.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you recollect when my father ceased to do business with Makin and Co.? A. Fourteen or fifteen, or seventeen years ago; it is nearly twenty years ago that he was introduced by his father; the prisoner himself never did business with the house - I saw him occasionally in the streets of Liverpool, within two or three years ago, at different periods.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that I was acquainted with the banking-house where you made your bills payable? A. I cannot tell; we had one

            . I think I have known the prisoner about three years; I knew him in October, 1829 - I took a letter, by his direction, to the counting-house of Messrs. Fletcher and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the letter? A. I really cannot say; it was directed in the way this is - I took it by the prisoner's direction; I am not aware that he did any thing more, than desire me to take it to the counting-house - he, at that time, had more hair upon his face, and I think, if any thing, it was lighter than the hair he has now.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hair on his head light or dark then? A. On my word I cannot say; I did not see him at the office, and do not think I have seen him since I witnessed an instrument for him, when he was in Whitecross-street prison, eight or nine months ago - I am perfectly satisfied of his person; I lived in St. Martin's-lane for many years - I have a warehouse there now, and had so in 1829.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How came you to take the letter? A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050005"></xptr>On my word I do not know how I came to take it, but it strikes me I had the letter at Nightingale's, a tailor, who worked for him; I called there, and I believe he was there, and he might ask me if I was going into the City- I know I was going into the City.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know his hand-writing? A. Yes- I am satisfied the letter is in his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What did I say to you when you took the letter? A. I really do not recollect; I am not aware of your desiring me to get any money from Mr. Fletcher - I heard you were under embarrassments about fifteen months ago; I never heard of Usher, of Dublin -I recollect your being arrested by Nightingale, a tailor, for about 40l.; you were in prison at his suit - I know Nightingale; I have got goods for him on credit in the City - I have known him about twenty years; you were released from prison on signing a deed of some property you have in Ireland - I witnessed your signature in prison; I am not aware that I signed any paper - this is my signature, (looking at a paper) - I never knew Usher of Dublin; the deed was signed six or eight months ago- I think you have been at my house once or twice during the last year, on a Sunday; I said I should certainly never injure any man if I could avoid it, but if called upon to answer questions about you, I should tell the truth; I was not at all aware of the transactions between Messrs. Fletcher and you, not in any shape - I might have heard it, but I do not take notice of other people's business; I think you once told me you were lodging at Bayswater - I do not recollect hearing of your living at No. 19, Downing-street; I never asked you to interfere in getting a peerage for a gentleman in Wales -I recollect I once called on you at Hill's hotel, Charing-cross; I unfortunately was bail for you - I took you from there and surrendered you; I knew a Mr. Dawson, a member of Parliament, who lived in Downing-street - I understood he was acquainted with you, but never knew you lived in his house; I have solicited votes for members for Westminster - I think I have had letters from you, but do not know where they are; I am satisfied the letter produced is your hand-writing - I do not know Mr. Addington, of Middleton-hall.</p>

Haywood and Co., the Liverpool bank, and made their bills payable at our house; when Messrs.

            - it is possible we may have paid bills drawn by him on them; I should judge by the appearance of this bill that it was never presented at our house - it does not bear the mark of the notary; I have paid acceptances of Messrs. Makin's at our house - I think this acceptance differs materially from what I have been accustomed to see, but from my ignorance of the party I should decline saying it was not their acceptance; it does not resemble their acceptances on which I have acted - I think, on looking over our books, we appear to have paid bills drawn on them by Anderton.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, I am here a stranger - the circumstances of the case debar me from making any defence than what I could elicit from the gentlemen present; as to their swearing to my hand-writing, you, of course, will judge, and as to Coates I was not aware he would have been here, or I could have let you see the character of that man - he caused me to be arrested after coming from France, and being plundered by a man named Usher; Mr. Fletcher wrote to Ireland respecting Usher, and got a letter giving him the character of that man, and he read it at the office; I know Coates and Usher were very intimate - he will not acknowledge he knew Mr. Addington, about whom he bothered me exceedingly, by saying he wanted a peerage, that he had the interest of the Marquis of Conyngham, but could not get the Duke of Wellington; and he will not acknowledge where I lived, though he knew perfectly well - I have been entirely deceived by Usher; he went to America from Havre, in France, where I followed him, to try to recover money he had from me - the newspapers have spread reports of my being a swindler, to prejudice my case, of my having swindled people at the west end of the town, but not a single person has come forward against me; I lived at No. 89, Regent-street, up to the time I was apprehended - I am an utter stranger here, and can have no witnesses; as to Coates, many persons know he is as hardened as a stone; he is a perfect Judas, and has been told by a Judge, that the next time he came into a Court he had better take care, for he perjured himself then; an apothecary at Westminster, named Cowan, knows he is connived with a notorious character on elections, named Stanbury - I hope your Lordship will think of my unfortunate situation, being subject to the reproach of a villain, who commenced with Nightingale to rob me of my property, and I was obliged to sign a deed, through terror and fear of him, subject to a sale if I did not pay my debts in six months; he is well known in London as a notorious fellow, and he signed this paper that I should be in no danger (reads), "Mr. McDonogh has given me a deed of trust, executed by him to Mr. Nightingale, which I engage to return, in the event of his being arrested on any account whatever before he reaches Mr. Nightingale's house;" Davis and Co., their attornies, would not be concerned for them, and they employed another; I am well aware of the influential body I have to do with, and am sorry they have gone about slandering me even in the prison I am in - I wish to ask Mr. Fletcher when he was at Exley's office, in Devon - shire-square.</p>
               <p>MR. FLETCHER. I know these parties as prosecutors on another indictment - I was never at their counting-house in person; I have made no inquiry about your property - I have heard something about title-deeds, but have no reason to believe you have any property whatever; I sent my attorney to make inquiry about you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There are several letters of mine in the hands of Exley and Co., which might be produced - I trust the Jury will consider whether the bill is my handwriting.</p>

            . I am clerk to Barnet, Hoare, and Co., bankers, Lombard-street. Fletcher and Co. kept cash at our house; (looking at a cheque) this cheque is drawn by them - I paid it on their account, and returned it to them; I do not recollect the person I paid it to, but he gave his name as Macdonogh - I gave him eight 5l. notes- (looking at four 5l. notes, Nos. 12,481, 12,482, 12,484, and 12,485, dated August 17, 1829) these correspond in number and date with those entered in my book as paid for this cheque.</p>
               <p>MARY PRATT. In 1829 I lived at No. 8, Charterhouse-street. To the best of my belief the prisoner paid me these four notes - he lodged and boarded with me for four or five months; I made a small cross on them, which I find here, and believe these crosses to have been made by me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I very ill at your house? A. Yes, for, I think, eight or nine weeks - I do not recollect any body visiting you but Mr. Stevenson; I was perfectly satisfied with your conduct - you paid me every thing before you left.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he stay some time at your house after his illness? A. Yes; he did not lose his hair - I think it was a lighter colour than he has now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not obliged to have my hair cut off, to have leeches applied? A. I recollect some of your hair being cut off for leeches; you complained very much of your head, and I think had a blister at the back of it, but there was no appearance of a loss of hair when he recovered.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I feel for Mr. Fletcher's loss, and am very sorry for it: I was made the dupe of a man who came here after leaving another country, and was prowling about with a considerable sum of money, with one Allen, a Scotchman; they travelled together, and invented all this - he called on me in Downing-street, and asked me to let him use my name and firm, he having failed; I trust you will consider what I have offered in my defence has not been done from hardened feelings - I regret the loss exceedingly; I have often blamed people in London for being suspicious, as I did not know what a place it was, but from my experience since I have been committed, I cannot blame any body; I never thought such vice could exist - I have been made the dupe of a vile man, who is now in New York; at the time the bill of lading was delivered I was not aware of its being an imperfect instrument till Usher went to America - I then became aware of it, and was on my guard, fearing I should be arrested. -Mr. Fletcher cannot state whether the bill of lading is my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050007"></xptr>hand-writing; if the stamp is an English one, it is not a legal instrument - if I had known it was forged I should never have paid for my lodging; I did not know the goods were not shipped by Usher.</p>

            . I went with Mr. Dean to the Crown alehouse; there we found eight or ten people in bed, the prisoner was one of them; he told us the mug was in the same room, we went up and found it; (produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor) the prisoner said he was in liquor when he took it, and he did intended to have brought it again the next day, and throw it over into the skittle-ground, and that he had been very uneasy about it; but that the other man that was with him said, George, hang it, (that is, make money of it) you want money; we found it standing upon a box.</p>

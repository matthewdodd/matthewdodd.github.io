                  </hi>. I am medical officer of St. Pancreas Workhouse—on Saturday night the 30th January, about 11 o'clock I examined the child shortly after its admission; I did not see the person who brought it—it was suffering from the effects of cold; the limbs were cold, and it had a bruise on the back of the head, a bruise on the forehead, and a distinct mark of a ligature round the neck—there was a blue mark on the bridge of the nose, the eyes also were slightly blackened and swollen; the mark on the nose was simply a slight abrasion—the abrasions on the forehead and back of the head appeared to have been done at the same time—I have heard the circumstances under which the child was' found—the fact of its having been thrown over the wall would be a very likely cause for those abrasions—the mark round the neck lasted three or four days—I treated the child during that time—it was in danger for some days; it had considerable irr<lb></lb>itation of the brain, was slightly convulsed, and also had a slight cough—it was a cold night—if the child had been allowed to remain out all night I believe it would have proved fatal to it in a few hours—it was fairly out' of danger at the end of four or five days, but—it has never entirely recovered its health; it is still suffering from the exposure—I account for the irrita<lb></lb>tion of the brain by the fall on the' head, and to a-certain extent increased* by the effect of the strangulation—I have no doubt, apart from these injuries, the child was very fairly nourished; it appeared" to have been a healthy child—it was between eight and nine months old.</p>

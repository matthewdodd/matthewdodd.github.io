                  </hi>. I late at 3, Enkel Street, Seven Sisters Road—the prisoner came to lodge with me about a week before 5th April—on Satur<lb></lb>day, the 3rd, I gave him notice to leave—on Sunday night he went up to bed about 8 o'clock—I went to bed about 12—his room was on the floor below mine—my wife heard some one walking up and down stairs—she got up and opened the door and called me—I went out of my room, and saw the prisoner come up the stairs from below, and go into his own room with a light—I went down, hearing the cracking of wood—his door was open, and I saw the window curtains in flames, and the Venetian blinds and the toilet table were all on fire, and the carpet was burning—there was no gas in the room; he had a candle, but it was knocked out and was lying on the floor—the prisoner was not in his room then; he was down below—I managed to put the fire out—the prisoner then came upstairs to his ream again, and we persuaded him to dress—I said "Mr. Day, hew did you manage this, did you do it accidentally or purposely?" he said "I done it purposely, because you gave me warning to leave"—I took him to the police-station, and gave him into custody—I firmly believe that he was not in his right state of mind; he seemed in a regular state of delirium, I don't know from what cause, but since the occurrence we have heard that he had come from a private asylum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think he had been linking; he kept intoxicating liquors in his room, and drank them—I have since heard that he had been confined by his own will for two years as a dipsomaniac—he had only been with us four or five days—he was in his shirt at this time—the candlestick was on the floor, broken—if a light had been accidentally set to one of the curtains all the burning I saw might have taken place from that—there' was muslin on the toilet table between the two windows—I don't knew whether a window was open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of last witness—on this Sunday night I heard a crackling noise; I awoke my husband and the servant, and went downstairs—I saw the prisoner standing in a state of stupor in the passage—I did not speak to him—I ran out into the street, and called for help when I came back I got a light—he still stood there; he seemed not to</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was under the influence of drink—he seemed to be in such a funny peculiar manner I could not tell whether he was drunk or not. being in the house so short a time, I had not had time to go for a reference, and did not know where he had come from—I knew he had spirits in his room; I understood that he suffered great pain, and was under medical treatment—he had no solicitor before the Magistrate—he asked me there "Do you believe that I did it intentionally?" and I said "I do not believe you did"—I believe he did not know what he was saying or doing, but we were excited then, and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 307). I was called to the house about 20 minutes past 12 in the morning of 5th April, by Mr. Hallett, who said he should give the prisoner into custody for setting fire to the place—he appeared to be very stupid, as though he had been drinking previously and was recovering from drink—I said to Mr. Hallett, "What proof have you that he set fire to it?" he said "He must have done it"—I looked round the room and saw what had occurred, and I refused to take him into custody, because I did not think he did it intentionally—I went to the station and informed the sergeant on duty what had occurred—I then went back, and at the corner of the street I met the prisoner with the prosecutor and they went with me to the station—on the way there the prisoner said, "I done it by accident."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He seemed stupid, and I could make no sense of him at all—I thought he was suffering from delirium tremens—he seemed excited, he made replies that I could not understand, talking wildly—from what I saw in the room I formed the opinion that the fire was accidental—if the candle had fallen against one of the curtains the fire might have spread from that.</p>

                  </hi>. I have an establishment at Burleigh House, Highgate, and also in Cavendish Street—I have known the prisoner about two years—during the greater part of that time he has been a patient of mine as a dipsomaniac for habitual drunkenness—he goes on very well for a month, and then breaks out and gets very drunk for a week—drink makes him quite irresponsible for his actions, he does not know what he is about, he gets sodden with drink—he begins by getting drink and ends by getting so drunk that he tumbles about and is unconscious of what he is doing or saying, and has to be put to bed—I should not pay any attention to what he says when in that state.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That would not depend on what he said, but on the amount of drink he had taken and the condition in which he was—if he answered questions rationally I should consider he was rational—he was under my care as an ordinary patient—he resided there, and left about two</p>

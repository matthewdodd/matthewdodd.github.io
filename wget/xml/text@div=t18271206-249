Mr. Milledge keeps that house; I rented a house of my master, adjoining the public-house.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Is your house in the public-house yard? A. Yes; it is next to the public-house, but there is no entrance from it to the public-house - I knew Hough by his coming to the public-house - I have drank with him - he was not a particular friend - I had seen him before. After locking up my house at nine o'clock the night before, I went to the public-house, and had a pint or two of beer, and I slept at my master's that night, as I had not a bed at my house; I had never slept in my house.</p>

On Friday morning, the 9th of November, about half-past twelve o'clock, I saw the two prisoners and Lock come out of the King's Head-yard; Hough had a bag under his arm, I had not the least idea of it being stolen; I thought they had been at work down there, as Abdell, the nightman, lives down there. In the morning, I received information from Whitaker, went to his room, and saw the pannels broken, and the lock off the door.</p>

            . I was taken up for this felony, on Saturday night, the 10th of November. I went up to the King's Head, public-house, to get a pint of beer, on Thursday night, the 8th November, and Whitaker offered me a glass of rum and shrub; when I had drank it, I was going home; but Longman said "Don't go yet, I will put 1l. into your pocket;" when the house was shut up, we all went out, and stopped against the gate; Longman and Hough then went down the yard; the outer door of the house, where Whitaker lives, was open; Longman and Hough put their feet against Whitaker's room door, and broke it open; Longman went in, and brought out a hat, a coat, several waistcoats, trousers, handkerchiefs, and some harness; he gave them to Hough, who put them into a sack; we all went out of the yard - it was about twelve o'clock, or half-past; we went to Constable-alley, and Longman put the property under a house; we then went to Darkhouse-lane, near London-bridge, and staid their till four o'clock; we then returned to Constable-alley for the parcel, and I took it to a man named James Pagett, who brought a sovereign to the Golden Heart public-house, in Phoenix-street, kept by Van, that morning; I got it changed, and we had some steaks, and beer - the landlord took the reckoning out of it; in the course of the day, Pagett paid some more, which was put on the table and divided. I fetched the steaks myself from a butcher's in Brick-lane, and the landlord dressed them; the property was sold to Pagett.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you come here in custody? A. Yes, from the House of Correction; this is the second time I have been in a Court - I was here before, but only as a witness. I was in trouble myself last Session, on suspicion of carrying a parcel - I was not tried; the gentleman did not come against me - I was at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that parcel contain? A. Harness; I was never in custody on any other occasion. I did not break the door, nor carry the goods - I swear I did not break the door.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you sell this property? A. No; I saw Pagett about selling it; he gave 2l. for it all; he asked Longman how much he wanted - he told him 2l.; he lives at No. 2, Hope-street, Spitalfields. I had 5s. out of the sovereign, and we had 5s. each afterwards, and the beef steaks and drink among us.

             re-examined. I took Hough into custody; he came into a public-house where I was sitting, and I charged him with this robbery - he said he had not done it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say, "You had better come before a Magistrate, and clear yourself?" A. Yes- he said, "I am agreeable," and went. The witnesses stated what they have now, but Hough gave no account of himself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you hire these rooms of your master? A. Yes, to take care of some property, and I intend to live in them; I had been living in the public-house, and continued there till this house was fitted up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the key of the outer door? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Had not Mr. Milledge a room or two in the house, for his own use? A. No - he let it all in seperate tenements. There are four rooms - I have two, Abdell one, and a widow has one; the street door was open when I went out; I had closed my own door, and am positive that I locked it.</p>

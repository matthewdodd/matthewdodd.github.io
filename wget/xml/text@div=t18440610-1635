                  </hi>. The prisoner was my servant; she came on the 2nd of May, 1841, and left on the 1st of Sept., 1842. In consequence of her coming to me with a policeman, and saying that she had stolen some things from me with the assistance of a man, I searched a trunk that was under the bed in one of the rooms—I found it nearly empty—it was kept locked—I opened it with a key—I cannot say what property had been in it—it was property that had been put by when my sons were in business—I know it was full of linen—these sheets and table-cloths are marked in my own handwriting, and are my own—they were put into a large trunk with other linen, not being wanted for general use—I saw them last in the trunk five or six years ago--no one had had been to it that I know of—here are some pictures and frames which I know exceedingly well—they are mine—I cannot say where they were kept—they were put away as not being in general use—these knives and forks are such as we have in general use—two pairs of children's knives and forks I can distinctly swear to as being mine—this tea-pot is part of a tea-service pre<lb></lb>sented to me by my sister when I was first married—I have not seen it for five years—I have seen the knives and forks while the prisoner was in my service—the china was in a closet which I frequentlyentered—I can only judge of the blankets from their having the same mark which the laundress was accustomed to put on the linen—this piece of furniture I can positively swear to—that was inclosed with the blankets.</p>

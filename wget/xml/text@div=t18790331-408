                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Bray, carpenter, 2, Clayton Street, Caledonian Road—the prisoner has been lodging with us since last July, with his wife and children—he had two kitchens in the basement with an area in front—on the 23rd February I was upstairs in the evening nearly 9 o'clock, the prisoner was in the kitchen—his wife and children were not in the house—I had given the prisoner notice to quit about a fortnight previously—his wife and children had not gone away in consequence of that notice—I did not notice anything upstairs till on coming out of the room to fetch some water I discovered the smoke—I was going downstairs to see where it came from, when some people knocked at the street door—I opened it and some one ran in directly—I stood in the passage to keep them from going into another lodger's room, because there were only some children there, and the lodger was out—I went afterwards into the kitchen, and saw the prisoner sitting in front of the fire, smoking—some infants' clothing and rags were burning by the cupboard door—the drawers were open and the place was in great confusion—he said nothing to me—Mr. Knight put the fire out—the floor was not much burnt—the cupboard was scorched a little—my husband gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grinder, and live at 1, Clayton Street, Isling<lb></lb>ton—on the night of the 23rd of February I heard cries of "Fire!" next door—I came downstairs and saw the smoke coming up the staircase—I ran downstairs and opened the door, and the smoke came out of the kitchen—there was a good deal of smoke, and I could hardly see anything for a moment—I stopped a moment till the smoke got out, and then I saw the prisoner sitting in the chair—I said, "Mellish, what are you doing are you trying to set the place on fire?"—he said, "No, a spark fell out'—I looked down and there was a heap of rags burning—the bundle was about a foot high by the cupboard—I put it out—the prisoner did not help me—he sat in the chair and never attempted to move at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187903310053"></xptr>
               <p>all—he threw some of the things back again on to the floor while they were burning—I believe he was sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was not much damage done—I do not know if you were out when the fire happened, you were in when I was there—the fire-place was about 18 inches from the bundle of rags.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 286). When I went into the house on the 23rd February, the kitchen was in a state of confusion—in one corner, on the right-hand side from the fireplace, some clothes were burning, and underneath the table, in front of the fire, was a heap about two feet high of cardboard boxes broken in pieces—the prisoner's wife is a milliner—the drawers adjoining the boxes were drawn out, and papers and boxes strewed about them—the burning rags were about four or five feet from the table—I took the prisoner into custody—he was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. On that day I had a second leg of pork—I saw it safe about five o'clock—Titford told me something—I went to Mr. Wood's shop, and looked behind some beef, and saw the leg of pork hanging—it was mine—I knew it by a lump of bone on the end of the leg—I looked over the legs I had, and missed that one.</p>

                  </hi>. About a quarter of an hour after I had left Mr. Wood's I came back and saw Bates take a leg of pork from the same hook, and throw it down to Gay, who took it up and carried it to the same place behind the two quarters of beef—Bates said to Gay, "All right"—he looked through the railings to Mr. King's—he saw he was not looking at him, and then he took it away.</p>

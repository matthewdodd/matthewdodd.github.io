There did not appear any violence. I said, my door is open; and directly I said so, the prisoner looked at me from behind the door in the front room. I screamed out, and ran down stairs. My brother and his wife went into the room. I went to the publick house, and the landlord came with me. I cannot say whether Keys was in the house. I locked my door safe when I went out; I did not leave any body in my apartment when I went out; I do not know that any body was in the house; I am quite certain I locked the door. The things were all in one set of drawers, which I locked; but I found them open on my return with the landlord. There did not appear to be any violence done to them; the things were all found in his pocket. The value of the goods I am not a judge of.</p>

I seized him; the things were taken, from him, and delivered to me, and I have kept them ever since. (Produces the things.)

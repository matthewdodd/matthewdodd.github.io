                  </hi>. I am a soldier discharged from the 60th Rifles on 8th January—we were living at Winchester—on coming to London the prisoner made a statement about stopping for the night—we left our kits in a public-house and went for a walk—we had a quart of ale; he took me into a coffee-shop in Spitalfields—we went up stairs, and he put his hand in my pocket and took out 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was the worse for drink—he also took a silk handkerchief off my neck, and he took my discharge and gave it to the manager of the shop and said he would come back at 9 o'clock in the morning—he did not do so—I afterwards got his address, went to Colches<lb></lb>ter and saw the prisoner at his house there, and afterwards took a policeman there and enquired whether he knew anything about my things—he said that he knew nothing about them—I told the policeman to search the house and we found my things in the prisoner's box—I had given him no authority to take them.</p>

On 12th January I searched the prisoner's house at Colchester, and found the kit, produced, in a box in a bed-room—the prisoner was charged with stealing it—he did not reply then-afterwards he said that he did not know anything about it—on the way to the station ho said "I shall have to thank drink for this."</p>

                  </hi> The prisoner was in our employ—there was no under<lb></lb>standing between us that he had power to send linen out of our place to sell it—he was sent with a sample-shirt, to see if he could sell them, and would get warehousemen to come and look at goods, but he had no authority to take out goods—I said to him, "You had six pieces of linen last Thursday;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184905070061"></xptr>
               <p>where are they?"—he pointed to a shelf, and said, "There they are"—I said, "There are not six pieces there"—he said, "They are not all there"—I said, "What has become of them?"—he said, "I gave them to my wife to sell"—I said, "Produce them"—he said, "I cannot; she may have sent them to the <hi rend="italic">world's-end</hi>, or to Dover; I cannot tell"—he afterwards said, "I have made a memorandum that I have had them myself; I suppose I am responsible for them"—I said, "Certainly not, for goods given you to cut out"—at the end of this book here is a memorandum, "E. D., April 25, two pieces of linen, 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" that memorandum would not pass between me and him; they were given out to him for the express purpose of cutting out—this book was entirely under his care; it is the book in which he enters the work he gives to the people; it was not between me and him; it is all in his writing; it was kept in his own cutting-room, on my premises—here is the entry of the delivery of the goods to him—I have not looked to see whether he has charged himself the right price for these articles—he has entered them to himself on 25th April, and they were not delivered to him till the 26th—he had no opportunity of entering these after I charged him—if my servants ask me I should let them have goods at cost price—if these had been regularly booked they would have passed through my warehouse—this is the book in which they are entered to him—on previous occasions what has been entered on one side to him, he has accounted for on the other—he has not entered anything on the other side here, but in another book he makes an entry of these two pieces to himself—in the book in which he should have discharged himself he has not—on Thursday, the 26th, these goods were delivered to him, and on the Tuesday following I gave him into custody—he had several days to have entered them—this is the cutting-up book—here is "April 26, eighty yards of Irish. E. B."—the entry is Prior's—the prisoner has signed it that he has received it from him for the purpose of cutting up—he had no time for cutting it out; it was only given him in the morning, and at two o'clock the girl fetched it away—his wages were 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—the woman with whom he lived earned a good deal from my premises—she manufactured stocks—she had work out in a different name—fifty yards of linen would require 500 yards of calico to make up into shirts—I thought it was a large quantity, and requested to look—we have had entries since he was in custody—if he had not accounted we should have detected it when we came to see whether these two books tallied—if my suspicion had not been excited he might have returned these and made them up—he was not allowed to pay the workpeople; he gave them checks, and sent them down for pay—he had told me on the Monday previous to the 26th that he could neither get the hands nor the calico at the price, which excited my suspicion when he wanted the goods—it was his own act to get this linen; he must have asked for it—he came to me and told me he wanted some linens at that price.</p>

I sell shoes—on the 15th of April I had some shoes hanging outside my door—I saw them safe about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, and about a quarter before nine o'clock I heard a scratch—I thought it was the glass being cut with a piece of flint—I went out, and a person who was coming in told me something—I looked up, and missed some shoes—I pursued the prisoners, who were together—I took Cooper with these nine pairs of shoes under his coat—the person who I supposed to be Taylor crossed over, and went down a street opposite—I brought Cooper back, and sent for a policeman—I did not see Taylor's face—but from his dress and size, I have no doubt he is the man who was with Cooper—I saw him the next day at the station-house.</p>

            . I am an ironmonger; I have known the prisoner some time. On the evening of the 14th of February he came and asked what I gave a pound for a washing-copper; I said 6 1/2d - he then went and got this copper; I said, "I hope you got it honestly - you know the impropriety of stealing goods and then selling them;" he said Yes, he had been at work at a gentleman's at Little Chelsea, who had it about in the way, and he had bought it of him - I gave him 10s. for it; I then said, "What did you give for it?" - he said 9s.; I said it was worth a shilling to bring it from Little Chelsea - my man put it out the next morning; the prisoner saw it, and said I had better take it in - I asked why; he then said it was stolen, that he had sold it for a man, and he had told me a story the night before - I sent for the officer, who took him.</p>

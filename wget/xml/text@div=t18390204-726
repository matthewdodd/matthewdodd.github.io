                  </hi>. I am an officer. I went with a search warrant to No. 8, Hanover-street, Long-acre, to the front-room, first-floor, which the prisoner occupied—she was in bed—as soon as the prisoner opened the door, she said, "Oh, Mr. Shackell"—I told her I was come to search the room for some things stolen by young Cameron, and I asked her if she had any duplicates—she said "Yes," and handed me a little bag with some in it—I asked if she had any more—she said, "Yes," and gave me another bag, with more duplicates, about sixty in all—but some were of her own property—amongst others I found some relating to the articles in question—she said she had purchased some of them of a person of the name of Cameron—there was a box in the room by the side of the bed—Mrs. Sanderson, who was with me, identified the boa—I took the prisoner, and a person of the name of Dyer, who was there—Dyer stated he had known Cameron a long time, and knew him to be a thief, that he had purchased some of the duplicates of him, and the prisoner had done so too—the prisoner made no observation on that—Dyer re<lb></lb>quested Mrs. Sanderson to leave the room while he dressed, and they got almost to high words—I said I could not have any words, they must go before the Magistrate.</p>

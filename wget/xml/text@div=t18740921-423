I am the wife of John Sharp Moore, and keep the Post Office in Grange Road, Bermondsey—in February last I was employed at the Post Office in High Street, Borough—I was then unmarried, and my name was Hughes—on 10th March, about 6.30 in the evening, the prisoner came in and asked for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of penny stamps—I took them out of the drawer, and before giving them to him he put his hand in his pocket for the money—he said that his hands were so cold he could scarcely feel the money, and threw something in paper on the counter—I pushed the stamps towards him, and took up what be threw down to me—he ran out of the office, and on opening the paper I found it contained a brass coin—I reported the same evening and sent the coin to the Head Office—I believe this is the same coin he put down—I picked out the prisoner afterwards, and I am quite certain he is the same man.</p>

                  </hi>I a barrister, and live in King's Bench<lb></lb>walk, Temple. On the 1st of June I was in Old Bond-street, about six o'clock in the afternoon, with Mr. Storey—I felt something touch me be<lb></lb>hind my legs—I turned, and saw the prisoner close behind me, and my purse on the ground, the prisoner was in the act of picking it up, and was walking away with it—I put my hand on his shoulder, and charged him with having got my purse—he put up his hands in a supplicating pos<lb></lb>ture, and said, "O Lord, Sir, it was not me "—I am not certain whether I took the purse from his hand, or whether he dropped it, but I took it and have it—(<hi rend="italic">producing a purse</hi>) and it contained the money stated—I had put it into my hind coat-pocket an hour before.</p>

                  </hi>I live in Jermyn-street. I was with Mr. Fos<lb></lb>brook, walking arm in arm—he suddenly disengaged from me, and collared the prisoner, and at that moment I saw a purse drop from the prisoner when he put up his arm—Mr. Fosbrook picked it up, and the prisoner exclaimed, "Lord, Sir, it was not me I assure you, " or words to that effect.</p>

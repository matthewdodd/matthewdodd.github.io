            , Esq; she enquired for the lady's maid; I opened the door, and said I was the person. She said she came from from a sister of mine, that desired her to come, and that I would learn directly. I told her I believed I should not learn, but she might come in, and I would look at it. She asked for some broken victuals, saying, she had three small children that had not broke their fast that day. I gave her some victuals. She said, she would teach me to do a little for nothing. This was on the Saturday; and on the Thursday following, we saw it advertised. We sent to enquire whether it was that or not. It appeared to be our spoon, and my master went and brought it home. The day afterwards I met the woman in Lincoln's-inn-fields, and told her of the spoon, and took her to the pawnbroker. At first she said she knew nothing of it. She confessed she offered it to pawn, but did not confess how she came by it. When I asked her that, she made me no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you carry her to the pawnbroker's?</p>
               <p>S. Crawley. I expected to have found my master there.</p>

               <p>Q. to S. Crawley. Are you sure you did not give her the spoon?</p>
               <p>S. Crawley. I brought the victuals to her in my hand; there was no spoon amongst it, that I am positive of.</p>
               <p>Q. What victuals did you give her?</p>
               <p>S. Crawley. I gave her a bit of pigeon-pye, and a bit of beef.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the crest scratched before it was lost, as it is now?</p>
               <p>S. Crawley. No, it was not.</p>

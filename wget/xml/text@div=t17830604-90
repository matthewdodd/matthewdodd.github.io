               <p>I went in between five and six, and I saw the prosecutor sitting in the box in this publick house, and the prisoner with him, nobody was near him but the prisoner, and nobody near his pockets, the prisoner was very busy about his pockets, and I saw her draw out a silver watch; then she jumped over the table and changed a shilling, and called for a quartern of gin, she stood in the tap-room, I waked the man and told him he was robbed; the man said, he had lost one shilling, his handkerchief, and his watch; I told him that was the woman that had his watch, she denied it, I saw no more afterwards; there was nobody in the box but the woman and the man; there was a good many in the tap-room, I did not know who, there was some watchmen, the landlord was busy serving purl; he could not find any constable.</p>

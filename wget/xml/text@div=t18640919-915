                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 22, William-street, Great Suffolk-street, Southwark—on 18th August, about a quarter to 1 in the morning, I was in Suffolk-street, and I turned down a gateway for some purpose, when Driscoll hit me in the face, and knocked me down—he struck me several times in the face, and then Haley came and lifted me by my hair, and hit my head against the stone—I am sure of her, and I laid hold of Driscoll, and never let go of him—a policeman came, and I then let go of Driscoll, and missed my watch—Mr. Hilman came out at a gateway where he lives, and in a minute or so a policeman came up—I had seen my watch safe about ten minutes before—I gave the prisoners in charge, and at the station I searched all my pockets, and had not got the watch—while they were taking the charge Driscoll came to shake hands, and said, "I have not done you much hurt; do not appear against me in the morning; I am only a labouring man like yourself, do not interfere with my work"—he came close up to me, and after he had been put in the cell I put my hand in my right-hand trousers pocket, and there was my watch—he had been close to me on that side—I had felt for it in that pocket before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you out late? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I had been to Wal<lb></lb>worth to see some friends—I had had a glass, but was perfectly sober—we had a drop of porter between four of us, but no spirits—I did not see any one, or knock against any one, when I turned down the gateway—I am not married—I work at Easton, Amos, and Co. 's, Southwark-bridge-road, but through this ill-usage I have been obliged to leave—I had no chain to my watch—I took it off before leaving home, because I knew I should not be home very soon, and I thought the chain should not be seen—I always wear it in my right waistcoat-pocket—it was dark down there—I had only gone two or three yards down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, of Suffolk-street—my house adjoins the gateway, and I have a side door into it about ten paces up—about a quarter to 1 o'clock on this morning I was in the kitchen, and heard a smothered cry of "Police! I will not let you go till a policeman</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186409190099"></xptr>
               <p>comes"—I turned the gas off, and and then opened the door and came upon the prisoner and prosecutor two feet from the door—it was a moonlight night—Driscoll was in front of the prosecutor, who was smothered in blood—I said, "Halloa, what is the matter? let the man alone"—Haley said, "He has assaulted my husband—I said, "Then we will all go to the station together"—Driscoll said, "I shall not go to the station"—Haley said, "And I am sure I shall not"—I said, You all will"—I called "Police!"—a policeman came—we got a little way to the station, and Driscoll refused to go further—I got the policeman's rattle out of his pocket and sprang it—I did not go to the station, as I had only my slippers and trousers on—the prosecutor was covered with blood, and there was as much blood along the place as to appear as if they had killed a pig.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the woman in a very excited state? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She wanted to get Driscoll away from the prosecutor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Haley. Q.</hi> Did I say "You assaulted my brother?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Tea—I did not hear the sound of the prosecutor's head go on the stones, but he had a dread<lb></lb>ful place on his head.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>, 79 <hi rend="italic">M</hi>). I heard a cry of "Police!" and found Driscoll and the prosecutor holding each other by the collar, and Haley <hi rend="italic">pitching</hi> into him right and left—the prisoner said, "Let me go"—the pro<lb></lb>secutor said, "No," and he hit him in the face—they both fell—I laid hold of Driscoll, and the prosecutor got up and gave him in custody—I had not lost sight of Haley—as soon as I took hold of Driscoll the prosecutor said, "I have lost my watch"—I said, "The female must come too," and another policeman came and took her—another charge was being taken, so we waited in the reserve-room, and I said to Linfield, "You had better be sure if you have lost anything else; search your 'pockets"—he felt in all his pockets, and said that he had got a few halfpence but no watch—when the charge was being taken I put the prisoners behind, and put the bar across—Dris<lb></lb>coll tried to shake hands, and said, "Let me go to my work to-morrow: I don't know the woman"—I believe he said that twice—he came to the bar to the prosecutor, and his left hand came in contact with the prosecutor's pocket, so that he could put anything in.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, 25 M</hi>). I booked the charge against the prisoners—Driscoll stood on the right of the female, and turned round laid hold of the prosecutor, and said, "You are not going to lock me up, governor, and keep me away from my work; I know nothing about this woman"—she was inside the bar, close to him—I saw her lay hold of the prosecutor's coat with her right hand—the constable said, "What a false-hood you are telling; you said just now the was your wife"—she said that the prosecutor had offered her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. under a gateway—he said, "Nothing of the sort; I never spoke to you in my life"—when the prosecutor went to sign the charge-sheet, he put his name, and said, "By God, the watch has been put in my pocket in the station-house"—the glass was broken.</p>

I said, "That is my business." He said, "Come with me" I said, "You had better go." He said, "Come, and I will give you 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>" I said, "Go on; keep your 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." shoving him. He struck me, and I called put "Denny." This young man came, and they both fought I took him by the hair when he was on the stones, and said, "Leave go," but I never thought of robbing him.</p>

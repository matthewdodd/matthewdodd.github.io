            . I have lately come from Ireland. On Wednesday the 17th of August, I was walking down <placeName id="t18140914-176-crimeloc996">Cornhill</placeName>

I asked the prisoner what he would take for a dozen plumbs; he said, nine for sixpence. I looked out sixpennyworth. I drew out a sixpence, a shilling, and a three-shilling token. I had them in my hand open, so that he could see them. I put the plumbs in my pocket, and offered him sixpence: he said the sixpence was bad, give me that three-shilling piece, I will give you two shillings and sixpence. I gave him the three-shilling piece. I had a suspicion of the man, because I knew the sixpence was a good one. He put the three-shilling piece in his right hand breeches pocket; he began to make a bustle with the silver in his pocket; he said, here is your three-shilling piece again; he said, he had no change; he took the three-shilling piece he gave me out of his left hand pocket. I looked at the three-shilling piece; I perceived it to be a bad one. I looked at him, and asked him what his name was, and where he lived; he told me. I sent an old woman for a sheet of paper to take down his name and residence. I said, my lad you want to go to Pat with me now. There was a comrade with him; he said , sir, what are you about, I will give you a three-shilling piece if you do not like that. I said I liked it so well I would keep it and him too. The constable, Brown, was near. I gave the prisoner in the charge of Brown, and I also gave

             the three-shilling token that the prisoner gave me out of his left hand pocket.</p>

             I took the prisoner into custody. Mr. Fitzgerald gave me the three-shilling token; I gave it Mr. Westwood before the Lord Mayor. I searched the prisoner; he said he knew nothing about it. In his right hand pocket I found two or three three-shilling pieces, and under the leaves in the corner of the prisoner's basket I found a bad shilling. This is the shilling, and this is the three-shilling token uttered to Mr. Fitzgerald.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Barnes—we live at West Drayton—I had an iron boiler; I saw it safe last Monday—a policeman came to me on Wednesday, and I then missed the boiler and an iron tea kettle—these are them.</p>

I saw the prisoner about 1 o'clock last Tuesday morning—he had this boiler and kettle—he was coming in a direction from West Drayton—I asked him what he had got; he said an iron pot and a kettle he bought of a man, and gave three pots of beer for them—he said afterwards he gave four pots—I went to Mrs. Barnes, and she identified these articles.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> There was a great number of ns left work together, and went to Drayton; I went into a public house, and stayed till 11 o'clock at night; I came out, and there was a man carrying this pot and kettle; he asked me if I would buy them; I said they were no use to me, but if he was hard up I would give him a pot or two of beer for them; we went into a public house and had it, and I fell asleep with the pot and kettle; the officer <hi rend="italic">woke</hi> me up, and I went away with them; he afterwards came and took me; I would not have had them if I had been sober.</p>

I was put in possession of Fisher-house by Mr. Swaine—I found three at four men there when I wen home, and Norris was one of them—the next morning when I got up, Norris came to me—Mr. Bickers had been there in the night, and left word that the attorney said we must move away that day at all events, that they would not hurt a thing if we would only go out; that he levied on my things for near 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., odd but said that we could take all our things away if we would go out; and we moved about one or two o'clock that Friday—I got a van, and two of them helped to put the goods in—Norris was in the house at the time—there was another man went by the name of Norris has well—I left the premises ad they they has been—nothing was pulled down or destroyed.</p>

On Saturday, the 27th of May, about six o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, I saw a cart loading with lead, at Fisher-house—I saw fletecher there—I will not sweat positively that the prisoner Norris was there, but I have no doubt of it—I knew it was wrorng, and ran directly to fetch an officer and man who I had on an estate adjoining to protect it—I was not more than two minutes gone, and when I retunred the prisoner and cart were gone—I have heard Bickers say, not direclty to me, that they would have the whole of the house—both Bickers and Norris said so.</p>

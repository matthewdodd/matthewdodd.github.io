               <p>o'clock, I was at his house—there was some little altercation between him and his wife; she told me that he had got my father's money—he said be had not—we had a struggle, and I got him on to his bed—we fought together, and I gave him the eyes he has now—he then gave me the money out of his pocket—I was then leaving, and my little girl said, "Father, uncle has got a knife"—as soon as I heard that, I fought my way into the next room, and found myself bleeding—the prisoner went outside and called, "Police"—a policeman came, and I believe the prisoner was taken to the station—I was not conscious that I was struck with a knife at the time; I saw something brown in his hand, but I could not see, as he had pulled my head down on the bed—I had got the money from him at that time.</p>

I am eleven years old, and am the daughter of the last witness—I was in the room when my father and uncle were quarrelling—I saw that my father had got the money from my uncle; my uncle then took a knife out of his right-hand pocket, opened it with his teeth, and stabbed my father in the head with one hand, while he held him down by the hair of his head with the other—I cried out, "Oh, father, uncle has got a knife"—my father got himself off, and my uncle ran outside the street door, held by the knocker, and cried out, "Police."</p>

I am divisional surgeon to the police—I was called to the station on the evening of 26th December, and found the prosecutor—he had an incised wound on the left posterior side of the head, an inch in length, laying bare a portion of the occipital bone—it was not a wound that could have been caused by falling upon bricks; it was a clear incised wound, done by a sharp instrument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> When I returned from my work about a quarter to 5, I found nobody at home; they were all at the public-house. I went over, and we had half a quartern of rum, and brought a gallon of beer home with us. As soon as we got in, the prosecutor began quarrelling with his wife, a usual thing with him. After same time he went out into the yard. My wife told me to go to him, as he was very sick. I went out to fetch him in. He was very drunk, and he knocked his head against the wall. When he came in he said to me, "Give me the old man's money, or I will knock your b—eyes out," and he struck me as I was sitting on the bed, and caused me these eyes. I could scarcely see out of them for a fortnight, and have almost lost the sight of one of them. He got me down, and took the money out of my pocket. In the <hi rend="italic">scrimmage</hi> we both rolled off the bed,</p>

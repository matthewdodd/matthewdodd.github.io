                  </hi>. I live at 5, Great Earl-street, Seven Dials—the prisoner is my brother-in-law, my youngest sister's husband—on 15th March, between 9 and 10 in the evening, I went to a public-house at the corner of St. Martin's-lane, with my wife, to have half a quartern of gin between us—having had that I came out—the prisoner was outside—he said something to me about a sixpence—I was walking away when he struck me with some sharp instrument on my lips—I was not quarrelling with my wife—I had no words with her—the prisoner did something to me, I cannot say what, and directly it was done I fell down weltering in blood—some bystanders and my wife saw the prisoner run away—I am sure it was he who struck me.</p>

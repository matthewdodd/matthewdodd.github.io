               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. What day did you make the first payment? A. I cannot say, but they were in May - they are down in Colonel Cooper's book at home.</p>

               <p>GEORGE JOSIAH PAYNE. I have not received either of these sums of the prisoner - if he received them, it was his business to give them to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. One of these sums I never received.</p>
               <p>CHARLOTTE COX. I can swear I paid them all to him, and two of them were made paid in the weekly book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then when you paid the 12s. 7d. did the book go home? A. Yes; it went home twice with two of these sums receipted in it - it went home every week to be made up - when I paid him the 8s. 6d. he took it home, and it never returned.</p>
               <p>MR. PAYNE cross-examined. Q. Is it customary for your books to be made up every night? A. No; every man accounts to me nightly for every thing received in the day - I had noticed that Colonel Cooper's book did not come in regularly for several weeks - I inquired for it, and it was said that Colonel Cooper was out of town, and the book was locked up, and they were not having any goods - I always received the money myself.</p>

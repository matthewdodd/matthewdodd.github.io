                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a general shop, in Greyhound Court, Strand—on 7th June, I served the prisoner with 1/2 an oz. of tea, which came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I am sure he is the man—he gave me a florin—I gave him the change the less—next morning I tried the florin and it broke in three pieces—I put them into the fire and saw them melt—I know it was the florin he gave me, because I had no other, only shillings and sixpences, as he gave it me after 10 at night—on the next Friday night he came again for 1/2 an oz. of tobacco, which came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw a florin in big right hand—I said then I had not got any; because I did not want to take any more of his money—on Saturday, the 10th June, he came again in the middle of the day for 1/2 an oz. of tea, which came to 1 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he tendered a florin again, it was shiny and black like the other—I told him I had no change and gave it back to him, and he left without the tea—he came again at 11.30 that night for lib. of bread, and offered me a florin again—it was like the other, and I took it to be the other, and I refused to take it—he left, and I spoke to a constable, and pointed him out after he had been to a butcher's.</p>

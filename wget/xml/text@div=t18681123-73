                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames Police Inspector</hi>). On Saturday morning, 31st October, I was on duty on the bank at East Greenwich, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soners, each in a separate boat—Tullett had a boy with him—they rowed up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186811230061"></xptr>
               <p>to a barge called the <hi rend="italic">Sow</hi>, partly laden with coal—Freshwater went first, and Tullett followed—Freshwater got on board the barge, looked round for a few minutes then got into the barge's hold, and handed a large quantity of lumps of coal to Tullett, who was in his boat, and he placed them in both boats—I should think about 6 cwt. or 7 cwt. was handed out—a boat was then coming towards the barge, and they pushed away, rowed a short distance up the river, and run the boat's head on the mud close to where I was—they then threw some muddy water over the coals—they then rowed towards Blackwall—I got into my boat and followed them, and lay behind a schooner in mid-channel—as soon as they saw me shove from behind the schooner they dropped the sculls and spoke to each other a few words, and then Freshwater commenced throwing lumps of coal overboard, and the boy in Tullett's boat did the same. I rowed up to them as fast as I could, and put a constable into each of their boats, and took them to the Police Ship, Blackwall—they each had about 4861bs. of coal in their boats—there is a difference in the appearance of coal dredged from the bottom of the river and that taken from a barge—there might have been 50 lbs. of coal in their boats which had been dredged, but the remainder had not—it was only wetted on one side, where they had thrown the mud and water.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far off were you when you first saw the men at the barge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not more than two hundred yards—I was on shore, behind the bank—there were several barges together near the <hi rend="italic">derrick</hi>, or hydraulic lift—they were about twenty minutes at work handing out the coal—I had to go some distance along the bank to get to my boat—I did not lose sight of them—they were not more than fifty or sixty yards from me when they threw the mud and water over the coals.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames Policeman</hi> 51). I was on duty with last witness and saw the prisoners go up to the barge <hi rend="italic">Sow</hi>—Freshwater stepped out of his boat into the barge, and passed a quantity of coal to Tullett—I went and got our boat, and we boarded the prisoner's boat off Blackwall—I saw Freshwater throw a quantity of coals overboard—I examined the coals in their boats—the outside part was muddy, but the other side was dry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were the boats heavily laden? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were—it is not uncommon to dredge for coal in the river, or to take dust sweepings from barges—they don't get lumps of coal with the sweepings—there were no sweepings in their boats.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. Cory, coal merchants and barge owners—on 31st October they had a barge called the <hi rend="italic">Sow</hi> lying next the derrick—it was laden with twenty tons of Tanfield Main coal—I have seen some coal produced by Mr. Reed, and it was similar to that in the barge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Can you say whether any are missing from the barge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because we do not weigh them out—I saw the coal in the prisoners' boats—I am a judge of coal; there were only two varieties there; they did not appear like dredged coal.</p>

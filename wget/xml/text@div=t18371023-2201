                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Bostock. The prisoner came to lodge with me as a married woman, for three days—she left my house on the 21st of September—a man named Dunkett and her took the lodging together—I missed her from the room—she left the man in the room ill on the 22nd, till the Monday following—after she was gone, I missed a pair of sheets, a quilt, a pillow, a counterpane, and bolster-case, which were my husband's property, and part of the bed furniture, which she had for use—the man was ill in bed without the clothes—he was not able to get out—but at last he opened the door, and we found the room robbed, and the duplicates left in the room.</p>

I have a sheet, a quilt, and blanket, which were pawned at our shop by the prisoner, in September, the 16th, 18th, and 21st—I had no conversation with her—I have known her nearly two years as a customer living in Peter-street, in the neighbourhood—I always knew her by the name she grave, White—I always understood her to be married, and that her husband kept a hair-dresser's shop, as she told me—I never knew her by the name of Dungate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into custody on Wednesday, the 27th of September—I told her it was for robbing the prosecutrix, who was with me at the time—she merely said she expected to be sent for before—on the 25th I had been called over to the house, and took the man into custody, and found the duplicates in a washing-stand drawer—when I took her, she said it was Dungate's fault.</p>

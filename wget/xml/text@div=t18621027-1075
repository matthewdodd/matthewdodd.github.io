                  </hi>. I am the son of the proprietor of the Old King's Arms public-house, 104, Holborn-hill—I have seen the prisoners there several times—on 6th October, about 8 o'clock in the evening, I was standing outside the house, and saw them there—David Bryan was very drunk; Casey was with him—I did not see Catherine Bryan at that time—David Bryan went into the house and was very noisy—the person in the bar refused to serve him—Casey was the only one in the bar with him—she was trying to persuade him to go out, but did not succeed—he continued making such a noise that it was impossible to carry on the business, and we tried to eject him—I fetched Childs, a constable, who tried to persuade him to go out quietly—Bryan said that he should not go out for him, or for anybody, until he was served with a pint of beer—Childs still persevered in endeavouring to induce him to leave—Childs and I then caught hold of him and got him as far as one of the doors—he caught hold of my arm and wrenched it round—I have felt pain ever since—we did not use more violence than was necessary—we succeeded in getting him out, and he remained outside making a noise—a large crowd collected outside, and I gave him in Childs' custody for assaulting me—Casey went out peaceably, and I shut the doors—Lammas came up and went to Childs' assistance—they both endeavoured to disperse the mob, and secure Bryan—I saw Bryan kick Childs, and catch hold of his stock and try to strangle him—I then ran to the station to get the assistance of other constables, and when I came back, I found the crowd still congre<lb></lb>gated, and the scuffle going on—the traffic could not get by, and was obliged to go round—two officers had then got Catherine Bryan in custody—that was the first I saw of her—she was behaving violently, and trying to kick them.</p>

On 6th October, in conse<lb></lb>quence of a communication made to me, I went to Mr. Orgar's house, and found Bryan and Casey at the bar—Bryan was drunk, and was creating a great disturbance, and using foul language, so as to prevent the carrying on of the business—Mrs. Orgar was behind the bar trying to induce him to go away—young Mr. Orgar endeavoured to get him to leave—I was required to assist, and requested him to go peaceably—he said that he did not care a b——for any of us, and used very indecent language—I and Orgar pro<lb></lb>ceeded to put him out—we did not use more force than was necessary, and Orgar gave him in custody for an assault, and being drunk and disorderly—when I had got him outside he was still very riotous—I endeavoured to get him away—Lammas came up, and we took him in custody—he at once commenced kicking and plunging—he kicked me several times, and seized me by the throat several times, and pressed me by the throat—we had a long struggle, and both fell to the ground several times—he was kicking me the whole time we were struggling, both when down and up, about the legs and different parts of the body, and at length he gave me a severe kick on the lower part of my stomach, which made me sick and powerless—that was when I was on the ground—the women kicked me on the legs, and endeavoured to rescue him, and the others kicked me as well—I did not strike Bryan with my truncheon—I was obliged to place myself under the care of a surgeon—I was in the hospital for one night—I have suffered ever since, and was obliged to relinquish my duties some time.</p>

On the 12th of January I was in a loft over the stable, in the yard behind my master's house - I saw the prisoner coming out of the stable, about five minutes before four o'clock in the afternoon - I asked him what he wanted there; he said could I give him a job, or did I want a hand in the stable - I told him No, and asked what business he had to go into the stable; he said he saw no person in the yard, and he went to see if there was any one in the stable; I told him he had done wrong in going in - he said he knew he had, and he would not do it again; he walked out, and in about two minutes I went into the stable, and missed a bridle out of three which had been hanging there; I ran out, and saw the prisoner running down Green-street, on the opposite side of the way - I overtook him, took his hat off, and found this bridle in it, which is my master's.</p>

            . I am the constable. I was in Green-street, and saw the prisoner go into the stable-yard, and come out - he was walking when I saw him stopped- Putt had then called to him; I saw his hat knocked off, Putt took this bridle out, and gave it to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a servant to Miss Jane Green, at Whiteland House, King's-road, Chelsea. On the 31st of July, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was in the garden, and saw Wade handing an urn out of the window to Jones—Wade was in the house, on the store-room window on the ground floor—Jones was standing outside—I had seen that window shut about an hour before, close, but do not know whether it was fastened—I had been in the store-room, and am certain it was shut down—it is part of the dwelling-house—there was third man standing in the road, who appeared to belong to them—Wade got out of the window, and Jones gave him back the run—they went out of the front garden into the road—the third man whistled and said, "All is right"—that was before Wade got out of the garden—they went down Turk's-row, by the Asylum wall, and up Sloane-street—Wade walked by himself, and Jones and the other man behind—Wade went up Sloane-street into the New-road—I went and asked a boy for a policeman, and I followed Wade and seized him—the policeman was close to me at the time—Wade said the two whom I saw with him gave it him to carry to Knightsbridge, and were to pay him for it.</p>

"I am not to stop here to-night; but I will pay you accordingly, and I will have a cup of tea;" and with that he had a cup of tea, and stopped till a quarter after seven o'clock, till he went to Soho-square.</p>

The prisoner lodged five or six months with me; this pillow was let to her with the room - the sheet was taken from my club-room on the 8th of April, 1826 - I did not wish her to remain with me any longer, and she left; I found it in pawn about the 15th of April - she was taken about the 12th of March; her husband lived with her, but remained in the lodging ten or twelve days after she left; he had the same opportunity of taking it as she had - whether he was at home when it was missed I cannot say.</p>

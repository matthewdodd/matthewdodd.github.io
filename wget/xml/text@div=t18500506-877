                  </hi>. I live in Bath-street, City-road, and am a cigar-dealer. In Dec. 1849, the prisoner entered my service—an agreement was entered into between us—this is it (<hi rend="italic">dated 22nd Dec, 1849, agreeing to serve the prosecutor three years, as town traveller, to settle every Friday, and not to sell on credit without Mr. Phillips' consent, at a salary of</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per week, and 5 per cent. commission on monies collected</hi>)—early in Feb. the prisoner said to me that he had called on Mr. Blest, who keeps the King's Arms, at Woolwich, and he</p>

               <p>thought he should be able to do business with him—on 18th Feb. he took out a box with 61b. of cigars—he returned in the evening without it—I asked him if he had sold the box of cigars; he said yes, to Mr. Blest, for 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked what credit he took—he said about a month—on 13th March I discovered that Mr. Blest had not taken the cigars—on 18th I gave the prisoner in custody—I said to him, "You have received some money?"—he said, "Yes; I was coming down this morning with it"—I said, "I have been to Woolwich, and called on Mr Blest, and he knows nothing about purchasing the cigars"—he said, "No; he don't know you"—I said "He declares he has not purchased anything of the kind"—he said, "Well, he did, and I got the money"—I never received any money for them.</p>

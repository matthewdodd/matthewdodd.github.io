               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Cunningham. She was taken at my suit.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against her?</p>
               <p>Cunningham. I was asleep in a publick house, at <placeName id="t17481012-21-crimeloc123">the White Lyon, in White Lyon street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was it night or day?</p>
               <p>Cunningham. It was in the day time.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be asleep at an ale-house in the day time?</p>
               <p>Cunningham. Because I was working late at night, and could not get into my lodging, so I went to this house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a night house?</p>
               <p>Cunningham. I believe it might, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it?</p>
               <p>Cunningham. It was on a Sunday morning; for on the Saturday night I was working late.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this done?</p>
               <p>Cunningham. I believe it was between eleven and twelve o'clock, but I can't tell. I lost my silver stock-buckle, and a shilling in money; the maid of the house saw it done, I did not see it done.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the house while you was there?</p>
               <p>Cunningham. I don't know that she was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober when you went there?</p>
               <p>Cunningham. I can't say I was directly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had a shilling in your pocket then?</p>
               <p>Cunningham. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take the prisoner up?</p>
               <p>Cunningham. I took her up about a fortnight afterwards, upon the information of the maid of the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you live there now?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I am there till the trial is over.</p>

               <p>Mitchell. He used to drink there sometimes in the day time; I never saw him in the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes; I have known her ever since I have been there, by her using the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see the prisoner do?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I saw the prisoner take the stock-buckle out of the prosecutor's pocket, and three half pence, I saw no more; and I said I would call my mistress, and she threatened me, my Lord, if I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. This was just as she was going out at the door; I could not tell my mistress while she was in the house, for she threatened my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your master been here?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. He has been here almost all day.</p>
               <p>Pris. Cunningham put this woman into the warrant.</p>
               <p>Cunningham. I put four of them in, upon suspicion.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174810120019"></xptr>Pris. But you put Mitchell into the warrant first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mitchell tell you of this before you took out the warrant.</p>
               <p>Cunningham . Yes; she told me of it that very morning.</p>
               <p>Pris. There were two soldiers, and two women there</p>
               <p>Mitchell. There was never a soldier there.</p>
               <p>Pris. The landlord is a very wicked man, my Lord; can he be an honest man, that keeps such a house as that, and keeps his footman?</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How many person were about at the time? A. I did not see any person except the one to whom I gave the sword-stick - I believe when I got up there were two or three persons; none of them are here - in two or three minutes, I suppose, there were a dozen, but no one was near me till the Policeman came up; my friend is not here - the Policeman took the sword-stick from the man I gave it to: I believe he was a bricklayer - I believe one of the Policemen saw the beginning of the transaction; I was sober - I suppose the theatre closed about a quarter-past twelve o'clock; I then went to an oyster-shop, but had nothing to drink there - I do not know the name of the street; I am a stranger in town - I suppose I staid there an hour; I have the watch-guard on now which he was trying to break - the prisoner appeared to be drunk when he was taken; I did not make an observation about his being drunk before he struck me - no one was with him; I have not seen the purse since; I did not see any one near him at the time - there were plenty there in two or three minutes; I charged him with attempting to take my watch and purse before I got to the watch-house; I had seen my purse safe about two minutes before, as I had met a Policeman, and asked him to direct me to Somer's-town, and he did - I took my purse out to give him some silver, but I had none; I then put it in again safe.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable, and was on duty near Turnstile. I heard the cry of Police! went to the spot, and found Mr. Hodges rising from the ground- I saw the prisoner draw the sheath from his stick; he broke it, threw one piece away, and approached him with the other piece - they fell, and I came up and took the prisoner, while he lay on Mr. Hodges; I took charge of him- the prosecutor did not say the attempt at that moment: I took the prisoner to the watch-house, but found no money; a great many people had collected, and I gave him to my brother officer - in going along Great Queen-street; the prosecutor said he had robbed him of his purse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he said nothing about his attempting to rob him at the time? A. He said he was going to take his watch away - when I came up to the place there were a dozen or near two dozen of common girls; there were three or four round at the time I came up - there were several round; I did not see the prisoner searched - I examined the place where the scuffle occurred after the prosecutor said he had lost his purse; there were some girls about the place - I saw the prosecutor rising from the ground, and the prisoner take the sword-sheath; the prisoner had an opportunity of handing away the purse if he had taken it - there were several persons round who attempted to hustle me off; I do not cousider that the prisoner was any more drunk than I am at this present time;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090098"></xptr>he pretended to he drunk - several people followed us, and a great many staid.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I met the prosecutor at Turnstile, and he asked me the way to Somers' - town- I went and showed him part of the way; this was about two o'clock in the morning - he pulled out his purse, and said, "I have no silver, or I would give you something;" I said it was not required; I bade him good night, and soon after I heard Police! called - I went up, and took the prisoner from my brother officer - I took him to the watch-house, and searched him, but could find nothing but a few half-pence and some silver; there was a mob when I came up.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were any other persons near enough to take the purse from him? A. Yes, there was, from the prisoner or the prosecutor - they touched them: I believe the prisoner was let out afterwards, but I cannot say.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Were you at Turnstile at the time? A. Not at the first attack; I was a reserved man at the station-house, but was sent out patroling - it was between Turnstile and Holborn that I saw the parties; it was by my orders both of them were taken - there was a common woman of the town there; this young gentleman said,"This man knocked me down, and we had a fight;" I did not come up till the mob had gathered - I am not an inspector or superior officer, I am only a private Policeman; these others are my equals - they had seen more of the transaction; they had not got hold of the prisoner at the time I came up - there is another officer coming here; we considered that the best way was to take them to the station.</p>

            . I am a letter-press printer, in the employ of Vizetelly and Branston. I bailed the prisoner, and he remained at my house till six or seven o'clock on the Sunday evening; on the Monday morning, at half-past nine, I had occasion to go out - on my return he was waiting at my house, and said to me, "Come, young fellow, or we shall be too late," and we went to the Police-office; I have known him two years - he has been an honest young man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he keep good hours? A. Yes; when I have known him he always was at work at his regular time; I had seen him up to nine o'clock on that Saturday evening, when we were paid, and then we parted - I know where he went to; I did not go to Turnstile - I was in bed about twelve o'clock; the amount of the bail I gave was 20l. - that was before the inspector, who is not here; the inspector read the charge over to me, and it was for disorderly conduct in the street, and a street fight or row, I will not be positive which; he was not charged with felony at the time of bail.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HODGES re-examined. Q. When was the first time you said you had been robbed of your purse? A.

               <p>- Pocock. I am a Policeman.

               <p>- Pocock.

               <p>SAMUEL HODGES re-examined. I have no recollection of seeing Pocock at all - I saw Carlisle, and asked him the road, and took out my purse; I put it safe back, and buttoned the pocket up - I was not drunk; I had been sitting five hours in the theatre, and then went to the oyster-shop, but I did not drink any thing, upon my oath.</p>

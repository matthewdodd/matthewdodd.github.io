On the 29th of December, about ten minutes after six in the morning, as I was coming to London, I was stopped by the prisoner; he clapped a pistol to my breast and demanded my money; I told him I had but sixpence about me; I gave him that; he was with me, I believe three-quarters of a minute, and I had time enough to observe his face, and particularly his hair and I took notice of his voice. After the prisoner left me, I went to a Blacksmith's shop, and the prisoner not having taken my watch, I left it there, and I described to them the face, dress, and hair of the prisoner, and they went in pursuit of him, and then I came on with my teem to London.</p>

            . The prosecutor came to our shop and told us he had been robbed; it was then about a quarter past six o'clock, he described the man to have a bunch head of hair and rough as if he had laid in straw. The prisoner came by within a quarter of an hour after. When I saw him, I suspected from the description Head had given us, that he was the man that had robbed him. Edwards and I followed him for about three quarters of a mile, then Mole and Banks joined us and we secured him; we brought him back and when we were going to take him into a house he made resistance: he turned himself round, drew out a horse pistol and flashed it at me; it did not go officer it must have tore me to pieces, as he was within half a yard of me. We searched him and found another pistol upon him.</p>

            . I was at the blacksmith's shop when the prosecutor came there; he delivered me his watch. I knew him very well; so I carried his watch home. As I came back, the prisoner passed by. I took the candle from the smith's shop and held it quite up to his face, and I was satisfied then from the description Head had given, that he was the man that had robbed him, and that induced us to go after him. I saw him attempt to shoot Woodland, but the pistol missed fire.</p>

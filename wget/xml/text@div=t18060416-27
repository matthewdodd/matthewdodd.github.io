               <p>Q. About ten o'clock in the evening, what part of the town was you in. - A. In the <placeName id="t18060416-27-crimeloc150">Strand</placeName>

               <p>Q. In what direction might you walk. - A. I come from Southampton-street, and crossed the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go on the river side of the way. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What course did you pursue when you got on that side. - A. I intended to go on the left towards Temple Bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing intercept you in your course. - A. Yes, before I had time to turn either to the right or to the left a man jostled me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that man a stranger to you at that time. A. Perfectly so, he said that he met me a night or two before, he was very poor, and wanted the twenty pound I had promised him, I said I had never seen him before, and would not give it him, he said he must have it, as he knew me and would swear to me any where.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way were you then walking. - A. At that time I rather went to the right; the man was very importunate, and said, that he must have some money; he repeated several times that he had met me before only a night or two ago; I had only half a guinea and a seven shilling piece in my pocket, I gave him the seven shilling piece and told him to go about his business, he said that would not satisfy him, he must have the twenty pound; two men came up, and took me under each arm, said they were Bow-street officers, and that I must go with them; they hurried me down the street, I resisted, and said I defied them, I said I had done nothing that they could hurt me for; they all said that I had met that man a night or two before, and had promised him twenty pound, that they would swear to me any where; I said I had made them! no such promise, and would not give them the money, they said I must on account of my character, as they would all swear I had; one of the men whispered to me and said, I see you are a gentleman, you had better give him the twenty pound, and we will let you go; I was frightened at being surrounded by three men.</p>
               <p>Q. When all this was said respecting your character, what impression was made by that declaration on your mind. - A. I concluded that they meant to accuse me of some unnatural crime; I put my hand into my pocket and took out my purse; one of the men snatched it out of my hand and said now you may go; I run to Richardson's hotel, where I had just left a friend of mine (Mr. Wheathley), I told him what had happened.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in your purse and what sort of a purse was it. - A. A red leather purse, it contained a draft for eighteen pound, drawn by my brother

               <p>Q. Had the draft been accepted at that time. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What else had you in your pocket book. - A. There were some receipts and memorandums, there was a bill of Mr. Clay's, and a bill and receipts of Powel's, and a list of bills I had to pay while I was in London.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. Who the person were Mr. Orde, I understand you to say you know nothing of. - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take any notice of the colour of their clothes, or of the size of the men. - A. I think the two men who took me under the arm were very tall men.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took the pocket book out of your pocket, what was the purpose that you pulled it out for. - A. Probably I should have given it the men.</p>
               <p>Q. You pulled it out for that purpose in consequence of what they had said. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it under the impression of terror that they had excited in you at the moment. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say it was under the same terror that you had given the seven shilling piece to the man at first. - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say it was the terror of that accusation that they suggested to you. - A. It was, and to get rid of them.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. I believe you are a tailor and breeches maker in the Strand. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 25th of March did the two prisoners at the bar, or any other person, come to your shop. - A. Yes, between eleven and twelve the two prisoners and another man, who called himself Muir or Mier, I am not certain which.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when they called. - A. I went forward to take the orders from them, my foreman followed and said, I know one of these gentlemen, he had a suit of clothes when you were in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the hearing of the prisoners. - A. Yes, I believe Bevan accosted me first, and Muir or Mier, the other man that is not here, they said that they wanted superfine great coats, and after agreeing for the price, my foreman measured them; the while my foreman was measuring Bevan and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160023"></xptr>Muir, Hemmings said that he would have a waistcoat and a pair of breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that waistcoat to be made, or one ready made. - A. He concluded to have one that was lying in the window; I then showed him some stuff for breeches, he fixed on the Manchester stuff for breeches, and Bevan produced the draft.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that draft, and see whether that is the draft that Bevan produced to you. - A. I believe it is the same, but not in the same state in which I received it from him; that is the draft, I endorsed it.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave it to Lavender at the office. - A. I did, in the presence of the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did Bevan give you the draft. - A. When he presented that draft to me, he said, Mr. Lingham you will see if it is all right, and we will call in the course of an hour for the ballance; they all three left my shop; before they went away Bevan endorsed his name, he asked for a pen and ink, and wrote upon it G. Bevan, Grosvenor-street.</p>
               <p>Q. After they were gone did you take the draft to Mr. Fogous to be accepted. - A. I did, almost as soon as they went away it was accepted.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did they call upon you again. - A. They did not call so early as I expected, I left the money with my people, it was about two o'clock, they all three came together, I then gave them the ballance, amounting to 7 l. 18 s. deducting 10 l. 2 s.; I gave the change to the man who is not here, to Muir, who was a taller man than either of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time was the coat to be finished that was ordered. - A. The coat was to be finished for Muir by six o'clock in the evening, but it was got off till seven o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. When was Bevan's coat to be finished. - A. In the course of a day or two, and Hemmings' breeches was also to be finished in a day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners afterwards at your house. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 28th you presented the bill to Drummonds, was it made payable. - A. On the 31st I did for payment, there was three days grace.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I believe the payment was stopped. - A. It was, and Hemmings was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say that after your foreman told you he knew one of the persons, he measured them for the clothes, which occupied some time. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in the middle of the day. - A. It was, and publicly done in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. And Bevan, the person who was known to be in the shop before, was the person that gave his name. - A. He gave his name, and endorsed it on the back of the draft.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon their leaving you the draft, Mr. Lingham, as you are a man of business, I ask you was there any thing that lead you to suspect them, they giving you an opportunity of knowing whether it was good or bad, or whether it would be accepted or not. - A. That gave me a better opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. How long a portion of time was it agreed upon that you should have for making the enquiry. - A. They said in an hour they were to call.</p>
               <p>Q. So that after the person had described his name, and after they all had given you the same paper for the purpose of making the enquiries you thought fit, these persons came publicly to your shop again. A. They did, as near two o'clock as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. I think I understand you to say, my friend, it was not Bevan that received the money, but Muir, who is not here. - A. Muir received the money, but Bevan gave the check.</p>
               <p>Court. You said you gave the ballance of 10 l. 2 s. A. I paid the change in this manner; a five pound note and three one pound notes to Muir, Bevan gave me half a crown back and I gave him sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you send the clothes home. - A. By the directions left, they were all to be sent to Bevan's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was the only person that gave any direction, the others gave no direction. - A. No more directions than they were to be sent to Bevan's house, as Muir was to call at night for the account.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as to the residence of the other persons they gave no account. - A. They did not</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hemmings (to prosecutor). Did you ever see me at that time on the night you was robbed. - A. I do not know that I saw you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney (to Lingham). You say Bevan was the only one of the three who gave you his address. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the address that he gave you was Grosvenor-street. - A. Yes, I have another direction, one hundred and something in Swallow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you got that direction here. - A. One of the officers has, I gave the officer the direction.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he give you the direction of Swallow-street. - A. At the time that he ordered the goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. He was taken in consequence of that. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he give the address to Swallow-street at the same time he wrote on the back of the bill. - A. Much at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not strike you the address being in Swallow-street, and on the bill is Grosvenor-street. A. The goods which he ordered while I was in the country were sent to Grosvenor-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not strike you as something extraordinary that he should write on the back of the bill Little Grosvenor-street, and give you a direction to Swallow-street. - A. That was where they were to be sent to.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he lived there. - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not attend to this bill to see if he had endorsed it. - A. I did not look at the back of the bill till it was shewn me at Mr. Drummond's office; on their leaving it me, I looked at the front of the bill (I saw there was three days grace) to see if it was good, I did not look at the back of the bill to see the endorsement.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean your observation went no farther than to the person to whom it was payable. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Hemmings's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I was going up a street near the Adelphi, about half past nine o'clock, on Monday the 24th of March, I heard a noise in the street, and I saw a parcel of people together, there were two tall gentlemen had hold of this gentleman, who is here; one of the two men was a servant in livery, I asked them what they were ill using the gentleman for, they told me I had nothing to do with it, for they were officers, or if they was not, they knew well what they were about; the gentleman pulled a pocket book out and had it in his hand, one of them snatched the purse, and directly after that they all ran away, the whole of them, after they were gone I picked up the purse, and I took it the next day to a public house; I could not read myself, I shewed it to a gentleman that was in the house, I asked him if he could tell me who it belonged to, he said yes, if I enquired at Mr. Orde's, in Lincoln's Inn Fields, he believed there I should find the owner; I went to Mr. Orde's, in Lincoln's Inn Fields, I asked the butler if that purse did not belong to him, he took it and opened it, and said it did not, but he could inform me who it belonged to; he did not tell me the gentleman's name, but told me to inquire at No. 22, Sackville-street, and there I should find the owner; I called there that evening, Mr. Orde was not at home, the servant told me if I would call the next day at ten o'clock, I should see him; I called the next day at ten o'clock with the purse, I saw one of these gentlemen, I asked him if that purse did not belong to him, he said yes, it certainly did; he asked me how I came by it, I told him that I believed he lost it in a scuffle on the Monday night; he asked me whether I was there at the time, I told him yes, that I was coming by; he asked me if I was an officer, I told him no, I was not, but the two other men who had hold of him said they were; the next day I met with a traveller, after I had found the pocket book, I went with him to the Hit and Miss, the corner of Swallow-street; I bought a pair of stockings and a handkerchief of him; coming out I met with Bevan, Bevan asked this traveller how he did, would he have any thing to drink; Bevan, and me, and this traveller went back into the public house to have something to drink, he asked me if I knew any tradesman in town.</p>
               <p>Court. Who asked you. - A. Muir.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the traveller. - A. Yes, he asked me if I knew any tradesman in town, I told him, I did not; he asked Bevan if he did, Bevan said yes, he knew a taylor that made clothes for him; he said he took a check in the country, he would be glad to get it exchanged, he wanted the ready cash to buy more goods; Bevan told him he might get it exchanged by laying out a pound or two for what clothes he wanted; Muir asked Bevan what clothes he wanted, he would pay for them with the check, and he might pay him again, then he should be able to get his note exchanged; Bevan told him he would have a great coat; he then asked me if I wanted any thing, I told him no, I did not particular want any thing at present, but I did not mind having a waistcoat and breeches; he asked Bevan if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160026"></xptr>would put his name to the note, for he said he could not write himself; Bevan put his name to the note; and said to Mr. Lingham, I beg you would inspect into the note to see whether it was good or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you mean to say this conversation passed of his putting his name to the note. - A. This was at Mr. Lingham's.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not said any thing of your going to Mr. Lingham's yet, where was it that Muir asked you if you wanted any thing. - A. That was at the Hit and Miss in Swallow street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before you went to Mr. Lingham that the traveller asked Bevan to put his name to the note. - A. That was before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you went to Mr. Lingham's. - A. Yes, I had a waistcoat and breeches which I paid for to Muir; then I left him, and did not fee any thing more of him.</p>
               <p>Bevan's Defence. I was at Bath last December with a paralytic complaint in my arm; I saw Muir at Bath as a pedlar, he used the Lamb; by that means I became acquainted with him by going to see the papers of a day; on the latter end of December, or January I should say, I left Bath; I never saw Muir again till the 25th of March I met him in company with Hemmings at the Hit and Miss the corner of Swallow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say Hemmings you mean the prisoner. - A. Yes, he asked me to have something to drink; we returned into the Hit and Miss, and when we come out of there he presented the draft to me, which I took to Mr. Lingham's; he asked me if I knew any tradesman that would discount it for him, I said I knew Mr. Lingham, whom I had bought clothes of, and that I should tell him that it was not my draft, that it was his, that it should be left for inspection for an hour or an hour and an half; Muir said he had no objection to that, but as he could not write, he begged I would put my name to it, and he said that he had taken it in trade; he agreed that we should leave the note at Mr. Lingham's for an hour or an hour and a half, that Mr. Lingham might see it was right, at which time we should go again to get the balance. Muir ordered a great coat to be done that evening, as he was going out of town; he asked me if I wanted a great coat, I said I should like to have one of the same cloth that he had, but that at present I could not afford to pay for it; he owned me a pound note for being at Bath, he lent me another, and two pound I took out of my pocket and gave him, as he insisted to pay for the things out of his draft; I told Mr. Lingham a few days hence would do for my coat; on Friday evening I sent my wife for my coat; I have not seen Muir since, nor did I know that the note had been obtained in a fraudulent manner, nor I should not have presented it at a place where I was so well known, if I had meaned any fraud.</p>

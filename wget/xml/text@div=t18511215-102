               <p>given in on his passing his last examination—the last item is Fordarti's; at the end of the account—I produced an account of sales; one of the items in the account which he signs is "deposited or pawned"—I find here, under the head of "of whom bought," Allipson and Co. "when," March 27th; "number of pounds," 160; cost 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; "with whom pawned or deposited," Attenborough; "when," May 17th, 13th, and 24th; there are three dates, May 17th is on a line with what I am reading; "sum received" 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; then it says, "on hand" "with R.

Kearsey and Masterman—I will not be sure—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the accounts</hi>), no I think that will not appear on any account—Mr. Kearsey has accounted to the estate for what is left—I know Boyd's writing—this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his acceptance—it comes from the official assignee—it appears to have been dishonoured on 7th June—it is a five months' bill—(<hi rend="italic">read dated London, Jan</hi>. 4, 1851, <hi rend="italic">drawn by James Imray, on I. Boyd, payable to order, five months after date, for</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">value received</hi>)—it was taken up afterwards, and therefore it is in the bands of the assignee—Fisher's account on 5th April, 1851, is 150lbs., purchased 5th April, at a cost of 215<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is pawned, but there are two others, on 15th and 16th, and the three are pawned together on 17th—the 15th April, is "Tatlock 70lbs., cost 101<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 155<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—"16th April, Fellows, 230lbs., 339<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—the three are pledged on 17th April, with Drakenfords, for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received—it does not appear whether any portion of that has been redeemed—the total amount due to creditors at the date of the bank<lb></lb>ruptcy, is 11,214<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—then there is another item for liabilities, at distinguished from actual debt, 572<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not think I can say how much of that amount has been contracted from Jan. this year; the balance-sheet does not show it—the assets on the balance-sheet are, "debts good, 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" "property taken under fiat, 19,018<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" "property con<lb></lb>signed abroad for sale, 294<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—that is the whole—the rest of the items on the other side consist of housekeeping liabilities and losses, which are "by losses, as per list, 4,023<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" and for bad debts, 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he has put down as loss the sums of money which he did not get, the difference between what he got, and the cost price—the second sheet of the balance-sheet is headed, "creditors"—it commences with Allipson and Co., on 11th June, 1851—here is my acceptance which was not paid—I have not calculated the sums of money for acceptances, due to the whole of the creditors about that time—these acceptances in the balance-sheet, of 11th, 19th, and 28th June, 1851, are all Allipson's—they are put down as creditors for 30,718<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is the total amount of Allipson's debt.</p>

               <p>did not record it in writing, but his attention having been since drawn to it, he desired that a memorandum should be made, which has been done long since the prosecution—it was made within the last two or three weeks, in consequence of his attention being called to the fact that there was no written direction; but in the first instance I received his direction verbally on the day the bankrupt passed his last examination, 2nd Oct.—I may mislead you; I will say further, it was brought to me by my clerk the other day to be approved of—I produce the bill of exchange for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that came from the assignee as part of the bankrupt's papers, therefore it was paid on 11th June—there is no statement on the proceedings of what was done with the money got from Drakenford's on 11th June.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you speak of pledging, you speak of that which is distinct from pledging at the pawnbroker's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think there are but two persons with whom pledges are made, Drakenford and Attenborough—I do not know that Attenborough cannot receive such sums under the Pawnbrokers' Act, or that they are matters of specific agreement between the parties—Drakenfords are not pawnbrokers, they are silk-dealers—Allipsons are my clients; nearly all the silk-merchants are—I do not know from Allipsons how much money they received during the time I have been speaking of, from the bankrupt—I do not know that 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been paid to Allipsons—I did not attend the examination before the Magistrate, my clerk did—the statement from which I have been reading, is from the accounts of the prisoner—the Act of Parliament on which this prosecution is instituted, passed in Aug. 1851; several of the items contained in the accounts are before the passing of the Act; the first pledge stated here is 14th June, 1849; as to which transaction it appears by the same accounts that the goods were redeemed from Attenborough's in Aug. 1849—my impression is, that Mr. Dodson was the broker for Fordarti in this transaction, through whom the sale was effected—supposing the assets in the balance-sheet to be realised, they would show 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I was the bankrupt's solicitor in 1847, this statement was furnished voluntarily by him, there was no holding back of any sort, nor has there been throughout the whole transaction.</p>

                  </hi>. I am salesman, in the employ of Allipson and Co. I have been so sixteen years—Mr. Allepson's Christian name is Martin, there is only himself in the business; he is a silk-merchant, of 9, King's Arms-yard, Coleman-street—I know the defendant, he is a silk-manufacturer, and carried on business at 20, Spital-square—the business of a silk-manufacturer is to convert the silk into goods—on 27th March I sold the defendant 166lbs. 8 ozs. of Piedmont orgazin silk, at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it came to 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the custom of the silk-trade, with reference to credit, is cash in fourteen days, or a bill at five months, it depends on circumstances—if the manufacturer pays cash in fourteen days, be has the privilege of the discount which is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, or he can pay the whole amount at five months; this was settled on those terms—he did not pay cash in fourteen days, but bills were given.</p>

               <p>left it, and went next morning, when he said he would take it at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the usual terms—that is the way we generally deal; the salesman goes round and shows his samples, and the manufacturer gives his orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not on this occasion press him to take them, and mention an instance of a man named Vanut, who was buying silk of you, and getting a profit by the re-sale? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never said anything of the sort—I very likely told him that the markets were getting up; I cannot recollect whether I did or not, I may have done so—I dare say about 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has passed into the hands of Allipson and Co. from the defendant.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the price of orgazin silk at this period? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I sold him on 27th March 166lbs. 8ozs. weight, at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per lb.—this is the price-current, list of the greatest brokers in England, Messrs.

On 15th April I had a transaction with the defendant on my own account—I went to him, and found him in his warehouse, in Spital-square—I said I had got a sample of foreign thrown tram for sale, and asked him if he was a purchaser—he said, "Yes"—I showed him a sample, and asked him 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound—he consented to take it at that price—there was 981bs. net, 99lbs. gross, which came to 142<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 17th April I saw him again at his warehouse—exactly the same sort of conversation and dealing took place, and I sold him a parcel of 2391bs. of Italian <hi rend="italic">orgazin</hi>, at 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which came to 343<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at the usual credit, five months—I had a transaction with him on behalf of Mr. Fellows—I cannot tell you the date; I think it was 16th April; but I sold him the only parcel of silk Mr. Fellows sold him—it was 249lbs. and some odd ounces—I have not cast it out, nor the price—I sold it for a gentleman, and therefore we had not the price—I went to him as a broker, and showed him the sample—I went to him in all cases; he did not come to me—I cannot say what he said when I showed him the sample, but he consented to take the silk at the price I offered it at—when I left his warehouse I went to Mr. Fellows, and informed him I had sold his bales—our porter is here to prove the delivery, if it is required.</p>

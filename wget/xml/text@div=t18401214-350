                  </hi>. I am a sailor. On the 14th of December I went into a public-house—I had my watch, the foreign coin, and the other money stated, with me—between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening the prisoner came in and sat on my left-hand side—she put her hand into my left-hand pocket, and I lost my watch and money—I told the officer of it—the watch produced is mine.</p>

The prosecutor made a charge against the prisoner—I took hold of her, and asked where the money was—she said she had none—I asked her about the watch—she said she had none—I took her to the station—in going along she stopped, and wanted to sit down—I told her no—when she got to the station she sat down—I saw her put her finger about her neck, and she undid her bonnet—I took her bonnet off, and this purse dropped from her hair—I then took off one of her boots, and out of it fell this watch, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

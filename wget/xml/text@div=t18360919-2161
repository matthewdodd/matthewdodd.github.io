                  </hi>. I am a porter in Newgate-market. On Monday, the 29th of August, I was in the tap-room of the Rainbow public-house, in Newgate-street, in company with the prisoner—he tossed me for a pint of beer, which I paid for, and we had half a quartern of rum—after drinking the rum the prisoner refused to pay for it—he had to pay for the whole of it—he had called for it—the deceased, Robert Beach, was the barman—on the prisoner's refusing to pay for the rum, Beach put his hand on his shoul<lb></lb>der, and told him he could not leave the house till he hand paid for it—the prisoner tried to get out, and the deceased took hold if his collar—the pri<lb></lb>soner struck him on the side of the head—the blow did not seem sufficient to knock a child down—it was a very slight blow—a scuffle ensued be<lb></lb>tween them, but I did not see any blows struck—the prisoner was intoxi<lb></lb>cated a little—Beach put his head a little on one side, that was all I no<lb></lb>ticed—in the scuffle the prisoner's smock-frock came off—I picked it up, and put it on the tap-room table—he had the wristbands up, and in the scuffle it was pulled off by Beach—he pulled it over his head—I took two<lb></lb>pence out of the smock-frock, and paid the deceased for the rum—the de<lb></lb>ceased struck Storey in the eye, which knocked him against the wainscoat and stunned him, and knocked him down—that was after the scuffle—I dragged Beach into the tap-room and put him on the table—he asked me to get him a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, which I did, and when I came back the prisoner was gone home—that was all I saw—the deceased was not thrown down—he never fell at all—he was perfectly sober for what I know.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the Rainbow at the time—I went there with the deceased, who was my brother-in-law; and while I was there, the prisoner and Denton came into the tap-room—I saw them toss for beer or half-and-half, which, I believe, Denton lost—they afterwards tossed for rum, which Storey lost—they both partook of it; and when they came out of the tap-room to the bar, they were going away without paying for it—Beach said, "It is not paid for"—Storey said it was, if he had had it, but he denied having had it—Denton and myself told him he had, and persuaded him to pay for it—he was afterwards going away without paying—Beach came out of the bar, and followed him to the door—he had just got outside the door when Beach put his right hand to his left arm to prevent his going away—the prisoner turned round, and struck him with his right hand, about the neck or head—it was not a hard blow, nor yet <hi rend="italic">easy</hi>—it was a middling blow—Beach did not fall—I directly went up to him, and pulled Beach in<lb></lb>side, as they had got hold of one another—I parted them—they still stood outside the bar, and Storey still wanted to fight—I told him, if he hit any body he should hit me, and I got between them—Beach said, "Let him alone; I dare say he will be quiet now;" and put his hand on my arm to keep me on one side, as Storey was about to take his smock-frock off to fight with Beach again—Beach got hold of the bottom part of the smock-frock to keep him from taking it off, but Beach was a cripple in both hands—he was a painter by trade—he could never open his hands far—Storey got his smock-frock off and threw it down, and he struck Beach again—that was a hardish blow—Beach lifted up both his hands in self-defence, and struck Storey—a scuffle ensued, and Storey fell very heavy against the wainscoat, and fell on the floor—he was taken into the tap-room by some<lb></lb>body—Beach went round directly, went into the bar, and sat himself down—he was very much in a tremble—I went into the tap-room, and Storey was sitting on a stop—he recognised me, and said, "You are going to take Cross's house"—he said, "I will recollect you, I will give you a turn for this"—I was about taking Cross's house at the time—I saw Beach in the bar after that, and Denton came to the bar with the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the rum—Beach refused it, because it was taken from the man's pocket—I said, "Nonsense! take it up, and put it in the till," and he did so—I left him about five mi<lb></lb>nutes afterwards, and in three quarters of an hour I was sent for, to say Beach was very ill—I went up stairs, and saw him being bled—he had been ailing for a couple of months before—he had had an attack of the gout</p>

                  </hi>. I am out of business. I was at the Rainbow—there was a dispute respecting some run between Beach and the prisoner—he asked the prisoner if he was going to pay for the rum—he said he had not had it—he said, "You shall pay for it before you go out"—the prisoner went to go out—Beach came out of the bar and caught hold of him—they then came in again, and the prisoner said, "I will fight you"—Beach said, "I don't want to fight; pay me for my rum; that is all I want"—the prisoner took off his smock-frock, and struck Beach a blow on the back past of the head, towards the ear, as it appeared to me—Beach returned the blow, and the prisoner fell down—Beach went and sat sown in the bar-Storey was taken into the tap-room two or three men out of the passage—he either fell down or was knocked down, I cannot say which—I saw Beach strike him a blow—I only saw the prisoner strike Beach once—I was behind the door the first time, which prevented my view—he had his frock off at the time he struck Beach—I saw him take it off, and he almost instantly struck the blow—Beach did not fall at all—he went into the bar directly after the prisoner fell—he appeared pale and faint—I went away, and returned in about an hour afterwards—the doctor was there bleeding him then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Newgate-street. I saw Beach and examined him up-stairs on a table—he was then alive, but per<lb></lb>fectly insensible, without sense or motion, he was suffering under symptoms of apoplexy—I bled him, without any relief—I saw no appearance of external injury—I examined his face, head, and neck, and saw no mark at all—he lived about six hours—I endeavoured to employ other things, but it was ineffectual—I bled him almost immediately I went there—the blood flowed very indifferently—I took above two pints and a half of blood from him—I examined him after his death—after opening the skull, I found the vessels of the brain very much injected, filled with blood—the brain itself was completely filled with blood—the substance of brain itself was healthy—the forth ventricle was completely filled with extra vasated blood—there was no appearance sufficient to cause death—there was no mark of external injury, nothing from which I could judge this was occasioned—I never saw him before—there might be external blows sufficient to cause those appearances, without any appearing externally—it might also arise from excitement—I am not able to distinguish whether it was external injury or excitement—a person suffering under excitement, receiving injury on the head, is more liable to have a vessel of the brain ruptured.</p>

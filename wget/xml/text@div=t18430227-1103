                  </hi>. I am bar-man to Thomas Ballance, who keeps the Red Lion, Ratcliffe-highway. On the 12th of Feb. I went with a party to Croydon, in a one-horse phaeton, and on our return to Tulse-hill, I was upset, and considerably injured—Miss Shepherd was with me, and Mr. and Mrs. Renton—I was taken into a stable—before I was taken in there the prisoner had come up—he said he was a particular friend of mine, and he gave his card—I could hear what he said, but I was unable to make an answer—a <hi rend="italic">fly</hi> was procured, and I was taken home—I had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and two Spanish coins—I had a ring on my finger—I missed that ring—I had a black dress-coat and two silk handkerchiefs—I missed some money and my handkerchiefs—I got information, and went to No. 2, New<lb></lb>ington-causeway—we knocked for an hour and a half, and got admittance at last, through the prisoner's brother, Douglass—he knocked at the door, and the prisoner opened it—I told the prisoner I had come to remunerate him for his trouble, and to ask him if he could give me any account of the articles missing, as I had lost a black dress coat, two handkerchiefs, a ring off my finger, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and some silver—when I mentioned the ring, he said he knew nothing about it—I said, "Did you not see it on my finger?"—he said, "No"—I asked if he saw any one take it off—he said, "No"—I said, "Did you not take it off yourself?"—he said, did I mean to throw a slur on his character?—I told the officer to speak to him—he asked him two or three times over, and at last he produced the ring from his waistcoat-pocket—it was mine—we also found my two silk-hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs and the foreign coin—I had a foreign coin similar to this, and this ring I know to be mine.</p>

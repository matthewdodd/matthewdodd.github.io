                  </hi>. I am a merchant, carrying on business at 17, Gracechurch-street—on the 10th November I was in Cheapside, near Gutter-lane—there was a great crowd, and a lot of boys scrambling for toppers—I had my watch and Albert chain with me, in my waisicoat pocket—I was assaulted both in front and behind, one man throwing a quantity of <hi rend="italic">sludge</hi> in my face, which nearly blinded me—I observed three or four men round me—I had a pocket book and some money in an inside pocket—I put my hands so as to keep possession of my pocket book, and some one unbut<lb></lb>toned my coat, and took ray watch—I did not see who did it—the watch.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186211240078"></xptr>
               <p>produced is my watch—the swivel if gone, and there was a smaller chain and locket attached, which is lost.</p>

Q.</hi> Will you swear positively that your coat was buttoned? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will swear I had two buttons buttoned, but I won't swear I had three—I missed my watch about ten seconds after the <hi rend="italic">sludge</hi> was thrown in my face—I did not give any information that I had lost it—I do not say I was sober—I had been drinking—I had had about half a bottle of wine—I was not intoxicated—I was going home to dress to attend the Lord Mayor's banquet—I cannot swear by whom my watch was stolen.</p>

I am a ticket collector at the Old Swan pier, and live in Blackfriars—I was in Cheapside on Lord Mayor's day—it was about a o'clock—I saw the prisoner put his hand over the last witness's shoulder, unbutton his coat, snatch his watch, and ran away—I put out my leg to throw him, but he jumped past me—I cried out "Stop thief," and the police<lb></lb>man caught him.</p>

On 10th November I was on duty in Gutter-lane—I saw the prisoner coming down, and I stopped him—I said, "What have you got?"—he said, "All right, I've got it," and he handed me the gold watch and chain produced—I took him to the station, and searched him, and found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—he gave an address at Leicester, which was false.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I am entirely innocent. I picked up the watch and chain. I was rather excited in picking up such a thing. I handed it over directly to the policeman. The gentleman says he lost another chain and locket, and if I had stolen it that would have been found upon me when they searched me at the station house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wharf clerk to John Ismay Nicholson and others. On Saturday, the 29th of January, we received 400 kegs of anchovies in the morning—they were landed on the wharf, and placed very near to my box, where I sit to give tickets to the men—in consequence of information I counted them on the Monday morning—there were then but 399 kegs—Hale, Ballard, and Jennings were at work at the wharf on the Saturday—I gave them tickets for pay.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a casual labourer at Nicholson and Cot's wharf. On Saturday, the 29th of last January, about six o'clock, I saw Hale with an apron—he was about a yard from the an<lb></lb>chovies—I saw him take his apron off, and give it to Ballard, who took a keg of anchovies from the pile, and wrapped them up in the apron—Hale was standing by, I was standing close to him—Ballard asked me to take it, and give it to Jennings, who stood outside the partition where the box stood—I refused—he then took it himself, and handed it to Jennings—I waited to be paid—immediately after I had received my pay, I and Ed<lb></lb>wards went to the Queen's Head public-house, and in a few minutes Jen<lb></lb>nings came in—some secret conversation transpired between him and Edwards—I then heard Jennings ask Edwards if he knew where it might be put away—I understood it to mean where it could be sold—Edwards said he did—they then, went away together—I staid at the house, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184202280034"></xptr>
               <p>about a quarter before nine o'clock Jennings, Ballard, and Edwards re<lb></lb>turned, without Hale—Edwards said, when he came in, he was dissatisfied as all he had received for his trouble was 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—some time after that he said he had received 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Ballard and Jennings were by at the time</hi>) he said the first place they went to they were offered 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and the second place they went to they had sold it for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a quarters of gin—he said Ballard had 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., Jennings 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Hale 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not hear Ballard or Jennings say what they had received—two pots of beer were called for—I remarked, that as I had not received any of the money for it, nor had any share in taking it, I should not bear any blame of it—Mr. Beesley spoke to me on the following Wednesday.</p>

On the night of 26th January I was with Brown in Tottenham Court Road about 8 o'clock, and saw the prisoners—we followed them into the Hampstead Road, they separated and I lost sight of them for a short time—I saw them come back and go with another man to the Southampton Arms—we went in—I laid hold of Mayor and Brown took Hickey—they were both asked-what they had in their pos<lb></lb>session—they said "Nothing"—Hickey appeared to take something out of his pocket—I seized Mayor's hands and held them till assistance came—he struggled very much—we also took the third man, and he was afterwards discharged—I searched Mayor and found in his right trowsers pocket this bad florin, and in his left waistcoat pocket this bad shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced)—he</hi> said that he did not know the florin was bad and that he could not account for the possession of the shilling—I saw Brown search Hickey and take eight florins from his pocket.</p>

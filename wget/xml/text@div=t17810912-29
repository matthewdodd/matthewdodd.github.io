               <p>Upon the 17th of July, between twelve and one, the prisoner and another boy were calling Dust! in the street. My wife was in the shop, and I was busy. She called out to the maid, to bring the dust up. We have a back-door goes into <placeName id="t17810912-29-crimeloc147">St. Martin's lane</placeName>

She did not; but went with the child to school. The dustman took the dust, and returned and carried the box down stairs. Just after, my wife went, and saw the mark of the dustman's feet on the stairs. She had some suspicion the dustman had been down stairs. The watch was always somewhere in the kitchen, for them to cook by: I had seen it on the shelf that morning. In less than two minutes after they had taken away the dust, the watch was missed. I went to the door. The dust-cart stood about fifteen yards off, on the other side of the street. I went to the prisoner, and said, Give me the watch you have taken out of our kitchen. He said, What watch? I said, Did not you take the dust from the back-door, out of that alley? He said, Yes. I said, Did not you carry the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120029"></xptr> box back? He said, No; the other boy did. I asked the other, if he carried it down? He said, No; the prisoner carried it down himself. I asked him then, again, if he carried the box back? He said, he did. I brought him back to the shop, and charged him with it. My wife said, If he produced the watch, she would send him about his business; but I said, if I found that watch upon him, I would prosecute him. I sent for a constable; and in the interim I shook his coat, and felt the watch between the linings. I held it till the constable came: he put his hand into the lining, and pulled out my watch.</p>

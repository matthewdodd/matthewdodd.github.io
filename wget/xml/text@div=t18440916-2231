                  </hi>. I live at Harefield, and am bailiff to my uncle, Wil<lb></lb>liam Trumper. On Friday morning, the 30th of Aug., about seven o'clock, I saw the prisoners going across the pasture fields belonging to my uncle, at Harefield—they went into a blind ditch, which has a hedge growing over it—I went round, and came up to the spot where they were—when I got near them I heard what I thought was the sawing of meat—I got assistance, and re<lb></lb>turned with William Trumper and George Holt to the spot where I had seen the prisoners—they had then left—I examined the place, and found two loins of mutton in the ditch—they have not been preserved—they were covered with a bag—I saw Foy going away from the spot—he was from seventy to a hun<lb></lb>dred yards off when I saw him—I sent for a policeman, showed him where I found the mutton, and delivered it to him—when I saw the prisoners in the ditch there was nobody else about—the mutton was partly in and partly out of the bag.</p>

               <p>the 30th of Aug., about eight o'clock, I received information of the loss of these sheep, in consequence of which, I with another policeman, took the two prisoners into custody—I took Grainge leaning against the back gate of his own premises, at Harefield, about a quarter of a mile from where the mutton was found—I took Foy in the road, about 200 yards from Grainge's house—I noticed on the right shoulder of Grainge's jacket marks of fresh blood, and observed some cliver-seeds on his jacket—I found a dog fastened up in his house, and a basket hung against the wall, with about a quarter of a pound of mutton suet, and some pieces of mutton, which had been recently cut off the loin, about half a pound—I afterwards had two loins of mutton delivered to me by young Mr. Trumper—I compared the mutton found in the bag with the loins, and they corresponded with both loins—I went next day to the field near the ditch, and found the dog I had found in Grainge's house lying on this smock frock, at the spot where the loins of mutton had been found—I went there on Saturday evening about six o'clock, which was the next day—I also found a piece of breast of mutton laying about five yards from the dog, weighing about nine pounds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at Uxbridge. I had some sheep belonging to Thomas Symons, a butcher, at Chelsea—I rent some land at Harefield, and placed thirty-seven sheep there—I counted them on Sunday, the 25th of Aug.—they were all right then—I have seen the field and ditch described—it is about a mile and a half or two miles from where I kept Symons' sheep—on Friday, the 31st of Aug., hearing somebody was in custody—I went again to the field, and missed two sheep—they were Lincoln wether sheep, very fat, and unusually large and forward for the season—I saw the loins of mutton which Trumper found, also the neck and breast found by the officers—I compared the suet and pieces of mutton found at Grainge's house with the loins found in the ditch, and, in my judgment, they corre<lb></lb>sponded—I never found the skin of either sheep—in my opinion the mutton was Lincoln mutton—the loins, neck, and breast, were all of a very large size, and corresponded with the lost sheep, in its state of forwardness as well as quality—it was not cut up as a butcher would cut it—I believe the neck and breast were parts of the same animal.</p>

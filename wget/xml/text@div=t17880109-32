               <p>Do you mean a piece that was cut? - Yes, India muslin; they told me that the checque was too small; I reached a whole piece of India muslin out of the same paper; they objected to that, it was too small a pattern; I asked one of the shopmen named Whitworth, to give me some others, which he brought me; he brought a quantity, but among these were four pieces of six-quarters British muslin; I did not shew them all at once, but according to the patterns which I thought would please them, they did not fix for some time; at last they fixed; and I cut the prisoner Roberts a quarter, and gave her change; after she had taken her change she went out of the shop, and the woman with bruised eyes,

            , to the best of my recollection, went out about two minutes before; they were gone out, I imagine, about five or ten minutes; I mentioned to the young fellow in the shop, I suspected they had taken something; he said he had a suspicion of them likewise, by their appearance; on looking about, we found there was one piece of the six-quarter British muslin, which I shewed them last, was gone; I said, one of them has left her muff behind her, which was a black feathered muff; she returned for it.</p>
               <p>Which woman brought it in with her? - Roberts. Two women came back, the two which I served, that is, the prisoner Roberts and Wilson; I threw a piece of print over the muff, and detained them for a minute or two; she said finding her hand cold was the reason of missing her muff; I asked Mr. Ashby whether I should detain the women; he said, you may depend upon it they have not got the property about them; I asked one of the shopmen to follow them, which he did, and I afterwards went into a public-house near the corner of Bartlett's-buildings, where the three prisoners and the other shopman Whitworth was; there were the three prisoners, and three other women; the three prisoners were shuffling together; Mr. Ashby ordered a constable to be fetched; I ran out to the public-house door to watch that they did not come out; Whitworth and the constable went in first, he came back, and I went along with him the second time; it is a very dark small room, and the three prisoners were altogether in a bustle whispering; the other three persons stood by the window in the light.</p>
               <p>How far from these three? - I suppose as far as I am from the table.</p>
               <p>Did they mix with these three? - Not at that time; I pushed the two small women away; says I, let us have none of this work here, get into the light; after that they were examined, and the constable said to me, which shall I take out? I said take out that woman first, that was Wilson, she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090050"></xptr>being the woman I most suspected; then I told him to take Roberts, and after that he took the other; we examined them three, we found nothing; two others were examined; the constable came in, and said, let us look round the room, before the other is examined; and upon looking round the room with a candle, we found a bundle under the table, which

             picked up; on opening the bundle, which was tied up in a dark handkerchief, on the top of the bundle there lay a remnant of print, and two pieces of muslin tied up in the same handkerchief; one of these pieces was one that I missed of the six-quarters British; the other piece was one of the two which I reached from behind me on her first asking for muslin, both whole pieces; they had the shop mark upon them; one was only marked that morning; the constable asked me if I knew them pieces; I said yes, I was positive they were the same; they were taken into custody and committed the next day.</p>

               <p>Had you seen the other three women before? - Never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Had they been in the shop that afternoon? - They had not.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Not at the time these women were there, there was not a soul to buy a piece of goods at that counter from the time they came in to the time the goods were missed, nobody except our own people were in the shop.</p>
               <p>Who was in the shop? - Mr. Ashby and Mr. Hardinge, and a porter; we have to pass from one shop to the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Counsel for the prisoners Roberts and Wilson. Mr. Price, what may be the value of these two pieces together? - The value of the two, I should rather speak under than over, are, at least, five pounds.</p>
               <p>Have you got the muff here? - No, the woman had the muff back with her.</p>
               <p>What might be the value of the muff? - No great matter, five shillings, perhaps.</p>
               <p>Then this woman had been gone some minutes before she came back for the muff? - She had.</p>
               <p>They had been gone ten minutes without being followed, or any means taken to take them? - Between five and ten minutes.</p>
               <p>The prisoners Roberts and Wilson were not present in the room when the pieces were found; I believe they had been taken into another room to be examined? - They were taken out one by one into another room to be examined.</p>
               <p>Were they brought back again into the room where this bundle was found, before it was found? - No.</p>
               <p>Then they were not present when it was found? - No.</p>
               <p>The other three women had been still left in the room, while these three women were examined? - They had.</p>
               <p>It was Roberts that purchased the articles? - Yes, Roberts and Wilson came in together; there appeared no connexion at all between them two and the other woman while they were in the shop, as I perceived.</p>
               <p>You have told us that there was a lady in the fore-place? - There was.</p>
               <p>Which of the shops was it in? - It was in the middle shop.</p>
               <p>Was that lady in a situation to have a view of these people while they were dealing with you? - Not all of them.</p>
               <p>How far distant from the counter? - Not as far as from you to me.</p>
               <p>Within two or three feet? - Somewhere thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Was she in a situation to see what was going on there, if she had paid attention? - Probably she might, if she had paid attention.</p>
               <p>What other persons were there in the shop besides? - No other customers.</p>
               <p>How many persons belonging to the shop were there? - There was Mr. Ashby; he is here; Mr. Hardinge; he is not here; Mr. Whitworth; he is here; myself and the porter; he is not here; he was in the front shop; I do not believe he was in either of the other shops.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090051"></xptr>Is there a glass partition? - The shops are a distance of a yard or two, and divided by glass doors.</p>
               <p>Then there were this lady, the porter, and Mr. Hardinge; there were in these different shops these three persons that are not here now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long were you searching these three women in the other room? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was it half an hour? - I cannot tell to half an hour, I was in the room chattering with the other women, I imagine it was half an hour; there was one woman not searched, because we found the property, before we searched her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Counsel for Simpson. You have stated to the Court and the Jury, that the person who calls herself Simpson, went out some time before, about two minutes; had any, and what conversation passed between you and her? - None in the shop, any further than I told her, finding her sitting there, that I would wait upon her in a few minutes; she told me she was not in a hurry.</p>
               <p>Was that in consequence of any thing she had said to you? - No, there was nothing further.</p>
               <p>She said she was not in a hurry; then after you had served Roberts, did you ask her if she wanted any thing? - I asked her at the time Roberts and the woman was in the shop looking at the muslin.</p>
               <p>Then did not you ask her what she would please to have? - No; Whitworth served Simpson.</p>
               <p>In which shop was she served? - In the same shop, and at the same counter.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the woman come into the shop? - I observed the two women come into the shop; Roberts and Wilson came in together.</p>
               <p>Did they come in first? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon after they came in, did Simpson come in? - Between one and two minutes as near as I can tell.</p>

               <p>I am a shopman to Mr. Ashby; the prisoner Roberts, and Wilson came in first, the other about two minutes after; at the time they came in, I was engaged with a customer in the front shop, just by the house door; I was very soon at liberty, and went to serve the prisoner Simpson in the middle room with some cambrick; I shewed her three or four pieces; she bought some cambrick to the amount of two shillings and eleven pence; she gave me half a crown, and desired I would keep the cambrick and half a crown, and she would call again and pay the five-pence, and she was in want of a body-lining and some callico, and she went out; this is the cambrick she bought; she did not call for it; when these two ladies came for the muff, I followed them to a public-house which they went into, the corner of Bartlett's Buildings: I watched them in the back way; they went up a passage to the back door from Holborn; I followed only two women; I ran round to the front door; I found that the women were altogether in a room; I saw these women with several others through the door; I stopped in the house a few minutes; I then left the house, and ran down Shoe lane to get a constable; the constable and me went into the room where these women were, and I pointed out the two women to the constable; then we asked Mr. Ashby whether he would have these women searched; and he wished to have them searched; then we took them one by one out of the room.</p>
               <p>Who was searched first? - I am not positive; there were five searched, there were six in the room.</p>
               <p>Did you begin with the women that had been in the shop? - I am not positive which of the women were searched first; I believe those that had been in the shop.</p>
               <p>Was the woman that was not searched, one of the women that went into the shop? - No, the woman that was not searched was not in the shop, he searched five of them; we then thought it necessary to look round the room, and I looked underneath the table and picked up this bundle; we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090052"></xptr>opened it before the constable; I believe Mr. Price was in the room; I found these two pieces of muslin; the constable has the bundle with the whole contents.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. At the time that this bundle was found, was either of the three present prisoners in the room? - They were not; there were some other persons in the shop; and some were there who are not here now; there was a lady in the shop, the wife of a merchant.</p>
               <p>How long might you have been searching these five women? - I cannot tell for a few minutes; about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Were the other three permitted to go at large? - No, they were taken.</p>
               <p>How many of them were taken? - They were all six taken, and afterwards three of them were discharged.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Was Harding and the porter in the shop when the women were purchasing the muslins? - Mr. Harding was for a certainty; I believe, the porter was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I think you said you served Simpson with some cambrick? - I did.</p>
               <p>She gave you half a crown, and told you she should come again? - She did.</p>
               <p>When you went to the house, you fixed on two, you did not fix on any more? - I did not; the women were in a very small dark room, and it did not strike me that this was the woman that bought the cambrick.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure now that she was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>- HAWKINS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable; I was sent for to a public-house; when I came there, I was given in charge of six women; the first I examined was Wilson, I found nothing on her; I examined four more, and found nothing; when I came back to the room, the shopman found a bundle in the corner of the room.</p>
               <p>Price. This is the second piece of muslin that I shewed them; this is the shop mark; it is Mr. Ashby's property; and this is the piece that I missed also.</p>

               <p>I keep the public-house the corner of Bartlett's Buildings; one of these two prisoners that are alike in size, (Simpson and Wilson) came to my house between three and four; she asked for a glass of brandy; she sat about a yard and a half from the bar in a box, I handed it to her; she said, she had some company coming; and soon after, four or five women came in for something to drink, and one of the women came to her, and said, they were come; I served them with some liquor separately, and I shewed Whitworth and the officer into the parlour, and after the fifth person was searched, the bundle was found; I thought the women seemed to be acquainted.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had any body been in the room before these women came? - It is a back parlour, and there was no fire; I do not know that any body had been there, but my own family had dined there.</p>

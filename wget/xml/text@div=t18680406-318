I am the wife of John Evans, who keeps the Lord Nelson, Robin Hood Lane—on 11th March, about eleven o'clock in the day, the prisoner came in and tendered me a bad shilling for a glass of ale—I gave it back to her and told her it was bad—she gave me a good one and I gave her the change—she came again next day for a pennyworth of gin—I served her—she gave me a sixpence and I gave her fivepence—I put the sixpence in an empty till—she went out of sight for a few minutes, and presently I went away—I went to get change for the only sixpence I had, and it was bad—next night, March 13th, she came again for a quartern of gin, and gave me a bad shilling—I said this is the third bad coin you have given me—she said—"Oh is it, if it is I will give you another one"—I told her about the sixpence, and she said that she would give me a sixpence, too, but she did not—I gave the bad coins to the constable—her companion ran away directly I said that I would send for a constable.</p>

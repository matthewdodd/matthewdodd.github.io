On the 20th of January I fastened the house myself, my family consists of my wife, two children, and a maid servant; I went to bed at eleven o'clock, the house was broken open between four and five o'clock in the morning, the cellar shutter was forced and broken in two pieces-it is a flap outside the door. The watchman alarmed us between four and five o'clock, I got up, came down, and found the shutters broken, and the prisoner in the cellar, laying on the coals, I told the watchman that he was there, and he took him into custody; I asked him how he came there, he said that he was a poor man out of work, a cabinet-maker by trade, and that he only came down into the cellar for a night's lodging. I asked him how he came to break the door? he said that he did not know that he had done any harm. I took him to the watchhouse, and gave him in charge to the constable. On our return we searched the cellar, and found a chisel, nothing else; we found a brad-all on him at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HARROW. I am a watchman of Stepney parish; I was passing the house about three o'clock, on morning of the 20th of January, and observed a little piece of the door broken, but it was fast then; I came round again at four o'clock, and found it broken open - I alarmed Mr. Gillham; he came down into the cellar. I had called out to him at the window, that his flap was broken open, and asked him if he knew it. He told me to wait till he came down. I never saw the prisoner about; I only call the hours, we do not call the half-hours, but we keep walking round-mine is a long beat. I did not see any body break it open, I found the man in the cellar; the chisel was found underneath the prisoner, where he was laying. The door was split open, The door which leads from the cellar had a mark in it which fitted the chisel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you not say at the office, that you found the door partly broken - A. I found a little nob off - I say so now.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GILLHAM. The door which leads from the cellar was locked. I compared the chisel with the mark, it appeared as if an attempt had been made to break it open.</p>
               <p>JOHN SURIER. I am the constable of the night. Gillham brought the prisoner into the watch-house at a little before five o'clock. I took him in charge, searched him, and found a brad-all on him and a key.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is the key of my lodgings. I was shut out of my lodgings. The flap appeared to be loose and I opened it, and went to sleep there for the night. GUILTY. - <rs id="t18170115-107-punish565" type="punishmentDescription">

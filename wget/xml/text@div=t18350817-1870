                  </hi>. I am a tripe-dresser. The slaughter-house which this offal was in, is in Newport-market; it is Mr. Dineley's; his agent is Mr. English—I have agreed with him for a great many years, for all the middle gut of the beasts which are killed there—the butchers pay so much for killing there, and he sells the offal—the prisoner Anderson was in my service—he goes to the slaughter-house, and they deliver the offal to him</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 52.) On the 30th of July, I was watching near the slaughter-house. I saw the prisoners there—Peploe came first with a donkey-cart, with the name "W. Nellis" on it—he drew it up to the New Market—the donkety's head was facing the common slaughter-house, and it was near some sheep slaughter-houses—after he had done that, Nellis took a tub out of the cart; it was then empty—they took it into the commone slaughter-house where the beast are killed—they came out with running gut in it—they shot that into the donkey-cart—Nellis walked away round the corner, after he had stood looking about—Peploe stood near the donkey-cart—just after Nellis went away, Anderson drove up with Mr. Wood's cart—I saw Anderson, and a boy in company with him, go into the slaughter-house, and bring out tub of middle gut and when they came out, they beckoned to peploe, who crossed over to Anderson, and took the tub of middle gut, and threw it into the donkey-cart, and left the tub over it in the front of the cart so as to cover them closely—I cannot say where Nellis was while this was doing; but when I went up to the cart, he came out of a slaughter-house, where they slaughter the sheep—I do not know whether Anderson and the other boy took the tub into the slaughter-house, but I saw them bring out the same tub—I went up to Nellis's cart—in a minute after I had seen this Nellis came out of the sheep slaughter-house, opposite where the cart was—I took them both into custody, and the boy that assisted Anderson—Nellis said he did not authorise his boy to take any thing of the kind—he could have seen what was done; but I cannot say whether he did—I have been a butcher—I am quite sure that which was brought out was middle gut. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know what Nellis was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard he keeps a boiling-house—the tub was so full he could have seen what it was—I could tell at ten, or twenty, or fifty yards off—I was standing in the public-house, looking through the window; not ten yards off—there was no<lb></lb>thing else in, because I examined it all carefully—there was nothing but mid<lb></lb>dle and running gut—the running gut was thrown in first, and the middle gut last, and the tub on it—the offal consists of the middle and running gut—in some slaughter-houses they are all thrown down together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined. Q.</hi> At the time the running gut was placed in, Anderson had not arrived? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the running gut is slimy, and the other is thicker and fatter.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with the policeman on the 30th of July—I have heard his account, but there is one thing which I think he did not see: upon putting the first quantity of gut into the cart (which was shot into the back of the cart,) they put the tub on the stones; then when</p>

               <p>Wood's cart came up, peploe heckoned to Anderson, and pointed to the tub; he then went in and brought out two quantities, and put it into Mr. Wood's cart; the third tub he brought out, he put on the stones, and beckoned to Peploe, who came and put it into the cart, and turned the tub over it—that was after Nellis was gone—if he was looking he could have seen them—we went and took the direction on the cart, "W. Nellis, Vine-street."</p>

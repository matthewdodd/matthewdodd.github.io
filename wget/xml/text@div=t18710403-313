                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Alfred John Ellen, a coffee dealer, at 4, Laurence Pountney Hill—on Saturday, 4th March, about 11 o'clock, I saw some coffee, weighing 1 cwt. 2 qrs. 11lbs., in the passage of the warehouse—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the wrapper in which the coffee was—I saw Burke about 1 o'clock, when I went for my dinner, in the passage adjoining the warehouse—he went down Duoksfoot Lane into Thames Street.</p>

I am a dock labourer, and reside at Spitalfields—on Saturday afternoon, 4th March, about 3.45, I was in Fish Street Hill—I saw Burke there, with a bag of coffee—a man came down the hill with a barrow—he stepped from the pavement into the road, and put the bag of coffee into the barrow—something passed between Burke and the man with the barrow, but I was too far off to hear what it was—in a moment or two Burke took the coffee off the barrow, and left it in the road, passed me, and went down Monument Yard—the man with the barrow went down the hill—I stood and looked for a moment, and then went up to the coffee—a policeman came up, and we took it to the station—this is the wrapper it was in—I gave a description of Burke to the police—I did not notice the other man.</p>

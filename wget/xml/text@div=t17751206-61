I said, yes. A constable took me to a public house where they were, and I picked them out; I described the horses they rode when they robbed the coach: I was then taken over to Portsmouth to the Fighting Cocks, where they had put their horses up, and saw a small brown horse with a star in his forehead, and an iron grey, which answered the description; and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060088"></xptr> believe were the horses they were on when they robbed the coach: the prisoners were then in custody.</p>

               <p>I was in the yard when my husband let the horses; he is sick, and cannot attend: we bought the brown horse on the 24th of May of one Mr. Hardwicke.</p>
               <p>Did he let out horses? - No; he had had it long before; my husband broke it when it was a poney.</p>
               <p>Whether it was let out to any body on the 12th of May? - No; it stood at livery at our stables; it was never let out while it was his: the spotted mare we bought of one Mr. Bishop in July; I know nothing of the grey horse.</p>
               <p>When did you let the grey horse? - The sixth of October, for a week or eight days; it was to go to Wey-hill Fair.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you speak positively, that the brown horse was not let out on the 12th of May? - I am sure it was not let out; he never let his horses out.</p>
               <p>Was it ever out of the stables in the month of May? - No, to the best of my knowledge; I keep the book, and know when the horses are out and in.</p>

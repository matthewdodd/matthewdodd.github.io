She said before the justice she left a lodger in the one-pair-of-stairs? - I am not certain whether any body was in the house; when I returned I opened the street-door; I attempted to unlock my own room door, upon which the prisoner, who was inside the room, opened it; this bundle lay tied up upon the table, and another handkerchief was spread open; he came up to me, and said, O you eternal bitch! and put both his thumbs to my throat, and threw me down in the passage; I hallooed out, and called out thieves! A little boy who lives in the house ran out, and then the prisoner ran out; a gentleman seeing him run out, and me lying in the passage, stopped him, and brought him back. He had in his pocket a black cardinal of mine, my husband's silver shoe-buckes, and two silver tea-spoons.</p>

            . - A. Yes. On the 29th of November, about two o'clock, the prisoner came into our shop; I was alone in the shop; she asked to look at some black prints for a dress, which I immediately got for her, they were not patterns that suited her; she said she would first speak to her sister who had purchased one, and have one like her's; she went out of the shop, calling Mary, Mary; her sister was not with her. I know no more till after the piece of print was brought in by Mr. Beal for us to own, I then knew it to be ours; he gave the print to me, I put it in the desk wrapped up in paper, and gave it to my husband in the evening. I am quite sure it was the same piece; it was a printed calico, blue ground with a small white spot. Mr. Riddlestroffer measured it, it was seven yards and a quarter, and of the value of ten shillings and sixpence prime cost.</p>
               <p>Q. When Beale brought back the calico, did he bring the prisoner back - A. No, she was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. You never perceived her to take it while in the shop with you - A. Oh no, sir.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On the 29th of November I was at work at Mr. Riddlestroffer's; the prisoner was detected there, and taken into the back parlour. She came in about a quarter past two in the afternoon, she was put into my custody, she pulled a piece of cotton out of her apron and gave it me; she said, take care of it. Then Mr. Riddlestroffer told me to go to the neighbours; in consequence of that I went to Mr. Gilbert's, I gave the piece of printed cotton to Mrs. Gilbert, there was a young man in the shop at the time, they both said it was their own. I left the piece of printed cotton with Mrs. Gilbert, and at the magistrates I put a mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q. The same piece that the prisoner gave you, you gave to Mrs. Gilbert - A. Yes.</p>

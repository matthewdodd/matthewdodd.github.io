            , the prisoner at the bar, who was one of the three, came up to me, and bad me throw down my bundle which I had under my arm; and I said, for God's sake do not take my bundle from me; I never saw him before; he directly said he would be damned if he did not lay his stick about me; this alarmed me, as he had his stick in his hand at the time; the other two men were close to him; there was no conversation between them, they were all three together; then I threw down my bundle, and one of the others picked it up; after they had got a distance from me, I turned round to see which way they went; and the prisoner called out, damn you, madam, make the best of your way home, or else I will be after you; I made the best of my way to Chelsea; the bundle contained the things in the indictment; I did not see the things put in, but I had a bill of them; I put two shifts in the bundle, but not the shirts; the gown was rolled up in the bundle; I did not see the skirt, but I am sure I saw the shifts; they were wrapped up in the gown; the things belonged to Mr. Jacobson; I went after them, because my aunt takes in washing.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any interest in the washing of these things? - No, Sir, I am only a servant.</p>
               <p>If you had lost them, should you have thought yourself liable to have paid for them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might this robbery take up? - A few minutes; I am sure of the man; he was pitted very much with the small pox, and he had a long nose, a short thick set man; he stood facing me when he spoke to me.</p>

               <p>Look at the prisoner? - I am sure the prisoner is the man; the property has never been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, my friends are not come.</p>
               <p>How was the prisoner taken? - My uncle gave information; I saw the prisoner in the Borough at the Justice's in Union-street.</p>
               <p>How long was that after you was robbed? - About a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Was any body else in the room? - Yes, there were plenty of people.</p>
               <p>You went there in expectation of seeing the prisoner? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did the magistrate, or any body there say that is the man? - Yes, they did.</p>

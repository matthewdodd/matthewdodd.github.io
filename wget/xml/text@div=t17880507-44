               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes; he was tried here in December, 1785, and was capitally convicted; I was present when he received sentence of transportation in January, 1787.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner the same man? - Yes; I took him down to Woolwich.</p>

               <p>I don't deny but what I am the person; they put me on shore at Woolwich, contrary to my sentence, and forced me to work; I got home to my father to make him what recompence I could for what I had done; I have been hard at work for my bread ever since I came home; the ill usage I met with made me leave the place.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a very good character, and deposed that he had been hard at work, and very industrious ever since his return.</p>

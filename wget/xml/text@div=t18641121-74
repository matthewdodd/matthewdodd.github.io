               <p>the Prince of Wales beer-shop—I went in, and called for a pint of beer—there was a disturbance between the landlord and another man—the man wanted to fight the landlord—I got in between them and tried to prevent it—the man struck me a violent blow, which I returned—the man's wife came and took him away—then the prisoner came, and said he would have a turn, and he wanted me to go outside—I said I would not—I went out to go to my work, when the prisoner gave me a violent blow under the ear—I knocked him down—I then found I was covered with blood, and I had a wound on the head—I was then taken in a cab to the hospital.</p>

I live with my parents at No. 12, Church-street, Black<lb></lb>friars—on Monday, the 14th October, I saw the prisoner and Mr. Garlick fighting—the prisoner had hold of Garlick's hair—the prisoner had a knife in his hand—I saw him strike Garlick with the knife—this is not the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it had a white handle, and it was a little bigger than this.</p>

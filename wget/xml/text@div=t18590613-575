                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Milnes, of the Duke of Wel<lb></lb>lington public-house, Hackney-road—on 10th June, about 8 o'clock in the evening, I was in a cab in Finsbury-square, going to Weston's Music-hall—I had my purse in my hand, and, as I was pointing out Finsbury-square to my friend, I dropped either a sovereign or a half-sovereign out of my purse—I called out, "Hold hard, <hi rend="italic">cabby,</hi> I have dropped some money," and put my head out at the window—in consequence of what the cab-driver told me I told him to follow an omnibus which passed on my right hand side, as my back was to the cab, that was the same side as my land had been—we overtook the omnibus in Threadneedle-street, and I got out and spoke-to the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the driver of a hackney-carriage, and live at 10, Harrison's-place, Hackney-road—on the evening of 10th June I was driving Mrs. Milnes along Finsbury-square, and in consequence of what she said I turned the cab round and saw the prisoner jump off an omnibus <hi rend="italic">monkey-board,</hi> pick up something, and go on again—I turned round as quick as I could and went after him—he went like this (<hi rend="italic">Rubbing his hands together</hi>)—I came up to him at the end of Moorgate-street, and said, "Here, the lady wants you; you have picked up a sovereign which she has dropped"—he smiled, and said, "I picked up nothing"—the omnibus went on again to the end of Threadneedle-street, and the lady got out of my cab and got into the omnibus—I followed over London Bridge—when he got there he asked the lady for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said, "Give me my sovereign and I will give you your 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said that he had picked up nothing—the lady gave him in custody, and went to Southwark police-station, where the prisoner said, "I have not picked up a sovereign; here is what I picked up," producing a half-sovereign, which the inspector took.</p>

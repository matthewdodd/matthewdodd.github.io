I am a labourer, and live in the Borough—on the night of 2nd June between 6.0 and 7.30, I was walkng up the Lambeth Cut with an acquaintance named Tyler—we were sober—I had seen the prisoners about 1 o'clock that day, when a man named M'Carthy asked me to give him some tobacco, I told him I had none—Lewis walked up and said, "We've got money to buy our own tobacco,"—in the evening I was coming from the Mitre, where I had had a glass of six ale, and a pot of half-and-half, another man asked me for a pipe of tobacco—there were then three or four men, and more collecting—I told them I had got none—one man said "If I had some <hi rend="italic">baccy</hi> I'd give 'em some in a minute"—Lewis ran up and knocked me down—Budd used very bad language—he said "You b—y sod, I'll kick your guts in, and murder you and the like"—he knocked me down again, and a third time near the Victoria</p>

               <p>Theatre, where Lewis and another man lay on me—Budd took the money out my pocket—I told him he was getting my money—a shopkeeper led me into a pie-shop while he fetched a policeman—I gave Budd into custody—he said, "You shall remember this, you sod, and I'll blind you, and mur<lb></lb>der you"—I saw afterwards Lewis and a young woman, Emma Curtis—I gave him into custody.</p>

This prosecutor said I struck him, and gave me in charge.</p>

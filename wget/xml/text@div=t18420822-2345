                  </hi>. I am a trunk and portmanteau-maker, and live in John-street, Oxford-street; the prisoner lived with me as errand-boy for three years, and left me last November. On a Saturday, about a week previous to the 20th of July, I went by the shop of a Mr. Jacobson, in Oxford-street, and saw a portmanteau at the door, which I thought I knew—I went home first, then made some inquiries of Mr. Jacobson, in consequence of which I went</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, and live at No. 322, Oxford-street. Eight or nine months ago the prisoner came with a portmanteau—he said he was out of employment—I was full then, but took his address down, and in the course of a fortnight he came again with the portmanteau—I bought it of him—we pay to much per inch, and I paid him for twenty-four inches instead of twenty—on Saturday evening I found my mistake, and went down to him at his father's house, and he came and paid me back the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not recollect what I gave for that one—I cannot swear to these three, I have to many men that make for me—I showed those I bought of the prisoner to Mr. James—one was outside the door—he said it belonged to him, and I invited him up stairs, and showed him all the portmanteaus that were on my premises.</p>

On 8th March, about 11.30 p.m., the prisoner's husband came up to me in Long Acre bleeding from his right hand and neck—I put him in a cab and took him to Charing Cross Hospital—in consequence of what he told me I went to Short's Gardens about mid-night to a back room on third floor—there was no look on the door—I went in and saw a child lying on a bed asleep—two drops of blood were on the pillow, and there was much blood on the mattress and sheet and a quantity on the floor—I found a knife at the foot of the bed with blood on the blade and handle—I was alone—I took the child away, took the knife with me, and padlocked the door—I communicated with Taylor, another constable.</p>

In consequence of what Counter told me, I went to Short's Gardens about 3.20 and saw the prisoner standing in the doorway—I asked her if she lived there—she said "Yes"—I said "Why don't you go upstairs?"—she said that she and her husband had been quarrelling about the child—I said "Why don't you go and get your child?"—she said "He won't give it to me"—I went up with her and found the door locked—she said "He has gone out and locked the door"—I said "Where is your child?"—she said "Inside"—I drew the staple and went in, and the child was not there—she said "He has taken the child with him"—I said "How comes that blood on the floor?"—she said "Me and my husband have been quarrelling"—I took her downstairs and told her I should take her for stabbing her husband—she said "He is a brute; he has had six months at this Court for assaulting me"—she also complained at the station of his being a brute to her.</p>

I am a surgeon of Charing Cross Hospital—about 12.30 on Sunday morning the prosecutor was brought in—he had just fainted from loss of blood—I found a deep wound on the back of his right hand, which was bleeding furiously, an artery being divided—he also had some superficial wounds on the back of his neck, not deep or dangerous, but more like scratches—there had been very little blood—the fainting was caused by loss of blood from his hand—the wounds might have been caused by this table-knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he is still an out-patient.</p>

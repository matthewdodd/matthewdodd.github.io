                  </hi>. I am parcels clerk at the Bull and Mouth receiving office of the Great Northern Railway, Angel Street, St. Martin's-le-Grand—the prisoner was parcels porter in the office—he has been in the employ of the Company two years—about 2.30 on the 6th May, Mr. Whiffen brought me a parcel—the prisoner received it and signed for it—I have the book here—shortly after that I had occasion to send the prisoner up stairs—whilst he was up stairs, I saw two pairs of trousers under a desk in the outer office—soon after that I had to go into my own room to see some one—I returned to the office shortly after and saw the prisoner, who had just come down stairs—I said "What about those trousers that were lying under the desk table"—he said "What trousers?"—I repeated "The trousers lying under the table there," assuming they were still there—but on looking under I found they had been taken away—I then observed the prisoner had a small parcel in his hand, roughly done up—I said to him "What is in that parcel?"—he said "What business is that of yours?"—I said "Well, if that is the only answer you can give me I shall certainly take means to ascertain," and at once passed through my private office and brought in the foreman with me from the yard, but as we entered the outer office we both saw the prisoner was leaving with the parcel in his possession, and he ran up Angel Street as fast as he could away from the office—I sent the foreman after him, and some few minutes afterwards they returned together—after the prisoner came back I found Whiffen's parcel had been tampered with—I afterwards saw this parcel in the possession of Hollis, the officer, which contained two pairs of trousers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When a parcel is delivered it is placed back behind the barrier—it is the prisoner's duty to receive the parcels and put them in a place of safety—Mr. Whiffen's parcel, when we re-examined it, contained a pair of trousers, a coat, and waistcoat—it was fastened very loosely under—it had evidently been untied and tied up again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Edmonton. I was called up on Thursday morning, the 11th of Dec, about four o'clock, to see the body of a child that had been found in the water—the child was shown to me by Sergeant Harrison at the station-house—the face was swollen, the limbs extremely rigid, and there was the general appearance usually discover<lb></lb>able in drowned persons—there was a peculiar rosy appearance of the surface—the child's night-clothes were wet—it appeared to have been drowned, and, from the coldness of the body I thought it had been dead several hours—on the following day, Friday, the 12th, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found no external marks of violence on the body—on examining the interior I found nothing indicating an unhealthy state—the lungs and brain were gorged with blood—that is a result which generally follows from death by drowning, and the blood was dark and fluid—I have not the slightest doubt the death was caused by drowning—I attended the prisoner a year and a half ago—I then considered her in a weakened, debilitated state of health—one result of that was her hair falling off—I recommended her head should be shaved in consequence of that—I do not know whether it was shaved—a general state of physical debility would be likely to affect the nervous centres undoubtedly—it might produce functional disturbance of the brain, and would unquestionably at times affect the reasoning powers—it would bring about partial insanity—I have not attended her since that time, a year and a half ago—I attended her for a cold in the spring of 1844—I cannot remem<lb></lb>ber whether it was before or after that, that I recommended her hair to be shaved off—I have not attended her within the last twelve months.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a subject in the state of general debility in which you found the prisoner had subsequently become a mother, and had suddenly lost her milk, would not that add very materially indeed to the probability that it would affect the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most decidedly so; and if it did affect the brain it would unquestionably produce temporary derangement—I have been in Court during the examination of the witnesses.</p>
               <p>

I was in the room behind my shop on the evening of the 15th of November, I saw Morland come into my shop on his hands and knees - the other two were then looking in at the window; Morland went out, and soon after came in again, took this bladder of lard, and went out with it - I had lights in my shop, and am quite certain of his person - I followed him - he threw it down into the gutter; I picked it up and brought it into my shop - the prisoners ran off - I had seen them before, and had been watching them.</p>

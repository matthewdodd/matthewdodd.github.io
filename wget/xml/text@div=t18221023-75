On the 18th of September (the day of Egham races), about half-past one o'clock, Fearby and Whitton came in a horse and gig, and dined at my house - they had often been there before, and had slept there once; they asked what time the races began, I told them half-past two o'clock - they went away about half-past three, and returned in the same gig, about half-past eight; it was dark then. The other three prisoners came in directly after, and there was a sixth man in their company (who gave the name of White at Kensington); there were ten in company altogether - they all appeared in company, one with the other, and went into the same room, and all appeared acquainted; they sat in the same room. Leicester came in a gig with White. When Fearby returned in the evening, I stood at the door - he told me to move his horse in the same position as a gentleman's, who was going away at the time, that it might not be exposed to the draft. The horses were kept outside in the gigs all the time they were there. The whole ten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230054"></xptr>were in the parlour on the ground floor - it is quite separate from the bar and tap room; nobody could see what passed in the parlour - the parlour door was open most all the time, for one of them observed that it was warm, and desired me to leave it ajar. There is a passage four or five feet wide, between the bar and parlour. I was in the parlour twice to wait on them, and was in and out of the bar and tap-room. They sat at the tables - there are two or three tables in the room, but no one large enough for them all to sit at. I could not see what they were about. Some of them had tea, some grog, and some pipes. I, my wife, and servant all went into the room occasionally, to wait on them. Some of them went out at times; Fearby was out once when I went into the room. The staircase comes into the passage, which the parlour door opens into; it fronts the street door, and that passage leads into the garden. One of the men who came in the fourth gig, and who is not here, while he stood in street asked me to shew him the way to the water-closet, which I did - it is in the garden; I unlocked the door for him. They talked as if they were all in one general company, and sang two songs. They staid about an hour - the horses and gigs staid outside all the time, close to each other; away from the principal entrance, towards the tap. I missed nothing before they left.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did they leave - A. After singing two songs, they all joined in the last chorus together. I stood in the tap-room, hearing it; I cannot say whether they were all in the tap-room at that time, for I was not in the room for a quarter of an hour before; but as soon as the song was sung, they were all off as quick as a shot out of a gun - they were out in a moment, and all into their gigs in a moment. Fearby and Whitton were the last who got into their gig. I advised them to stop a little, as there was danger from a waggon which was in the way. Whitton dropped 3 d. into my hand for the hostler, as he got into the gig, without waiting to have his horse reined up, as he usually did; he and Fearby got into the same gig - they came first and went last. Several of them went out of the room, while they were there. Fearby in particular walked up and down the passage, with his great coat and whip in his hand. In the course of ten minutes after they were gone, my wife alarmed me; I went up and found the bed-room door open - the lock had been picked - it was locked before. I found five or six boxes and the bureau all broken open, and marks of violence on them. I found a small bit of a polished steel instrument, which had been broken in the room. My papers were all on the bed, where one of my children was asleep. I missed the articles stated in the indictment. The handle of the punch ladle was broken off, and only the silver part taken. The value of the goods stolen was nearly 100 l., besides which three 5 l. Bank-notes, one 5 l. Abingdon note, sixteen sovereigns, a half-guinea and a 7 s. piece were taken. I sent my wife for an officer, who came. I and my hostler set off in my gig; the officer and his son and another went in his cart. We told the patrols on the road of the robbery, and when I came to Kensington, I found the five prisoners in custody, three of them in one house together, at the Marquis of Granby, that was Leicester, Fearby, Whitton, and White the two others were near the gateway of the palace, about thirty yards off, in a gig. There were four gigs in all came to my house, three persons were in one gig, and one on horseback - all four gigs set off towards London - I only came up with three gigs. At the time they were at my house, no persons were taking refreshment on the side of the house where they were, and where the stair-case is. I have found the three 5 l. Bank-notes at the Bank. White has escaped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long was White in custody - A. I do not know; I left him in custody. I was there an hour; they went away in a great hurry. My house is on this side of the racecourse; it is nine miles from town; there are cross roads between me and town. The bar is between the passage and tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot persons come into your passage out of the taproom - A. Certainly; the passage communicates with the staircase; but they must go through two kitchens to get to the passage from the taproom; but from the parlour they can get to the staircase. The passage runs right through the house, and there is another passage which leads into the bar and into the tap-room; but the general passage is where the staircase is; but it cannot be got to from the taproom, without going through the kitchens. No guests sit in the kitchens. The passage dividing the taproom from the bar, does not lead to the passage communicating with the staircase, except by going through the kitchens. There were plenty of people travelling up and down the road. The prisoners were in the room; we put the best company in; they sat at three tables, and kept us all in full employ. They called frequently for the attendants; and left a pint of ale unpaid, which was served to them when they first went in; they were off so quick I had no opportunity of mentioning it; neither of the prisoners called for the ale. When the parlour door is open I can see into it from the bar, the door was a-jar. There is no other staircase.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. You have one common passage to your house - A. I have; one passage leads to the taproom, the principal passage leads to the staircase; at one end of that passage is the door leading to the street, any person standing at the door can see the bottom of the staircase, it is four or five yards from the staircase; any person can come from the street to the stairs, without going through any room. The parties arrived in four gigs; it was dark, I think they could not have got the property without a light. The bed-room is the back room, first floor, and looks into the stable yard; it has only one window, and the window cannot be seen in all parts of the yard; a candle in the room would not throw a light over all the yard, for the window is hid by a wall; the light would fall on the yard, except in one direction. Some of the prisoners came out and paid for what they had; I had only served two of them. White ordered the first glass of rum and water himself; it was not paid for; the man who came on horseback ordered ale - he is not here. Three men were in the last gig.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were much engaged with their orders - A. Yes; I did not go into the passage much myself, I was principally at the door to see if the horses were taken care of; I was in and out at the door, in the bar and tap-room, While I was at the door no person went in, so as to go up stairs. When the parlour door is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230055"></xptr>open, they could see into the bar; the bar door is right opposite the parlour door. Fearby and Whitton are the only persons I remember seeing before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does the passage which divides the taproom from the bar, communicate with the stable yard - A. No; they desired the gigs to be moved from the passage leading to the staircase, on account of the draft. There was three or four candles in the parlour; I did not miss any candle at any time.</p>

            . I am wife of the last witness. On the evening in question, I remember all the prisoners being in the house. I was in the bed-room five minutes before they came into the house, my child was in bed there; I went to the box which contained some of the property, and took another box off it, every thing was then perfectly safe; I locked the door when I came out, tried it, and put the key in my pocket, and kept it till I went up and discovered the robbery; the articles stated in the indictment were in the room; the prisoners came in five minutes after I came down. Fearby came into the house by himself, and asked me for a glass of brandy and water, and a pipe - (He and Whitton had dined there) - I knew them both before; I did not see the others come in. I made the brandy and water, and took it into the parlour; Fearby and Leicester were then in there, and some more were coming in at the door, I did not notice them; I went into the parlour again in about ten minutes, with bread and butter; there were seven or eight there then; I can only swear to Leicester and Fearby, I did not observe Whitton at that time. I went into the room again, in about twenty minutes, some were drinking, some smoking, and others at tea then - it is common for people to call for different things if they are of one party; they gave orders at different times; the parlour door was open most of the time, I was to and fro in the parlour, and crossed the passage to go there. I was generally in the bar while they were there; nobody could come in at the front door and go up stairs, without passing the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. If any person went from the parlour door to the stairs, must you also see them - A. Yes, I cannot see the stair-case from the bar-door; I could see them come from the parlour-door, but could not see whether they went up stairs, as it is five or six yards from the bar. As I stand in the bar, my face is towards the street door, my right side towards the parlour, and my back towards the staircase. I remained down stairs till they all went away. No guests were in the house except the ten in the parlour. There were people in the tap-room, most of whom were there when we made the discovery; they could not come from the tap-room and pass the bar to the stairs without my seeing them. I saw three men go from the tap-room into the passage, and go up to bed while the prisoners were there; they were waggoners, whose waggons stood at our house - one of them had slept there for fifteen years. While the prisoners were there they kept walking about, and Fearby walked up and down the passage with his whip in his hand, and he brought me his glass to fill with brandy and water; he left the glass with me and went out of doors; my husband was in the bar at that time; my face is turned the same way when I mix liquors as at other times. I sent the servant up with the three men when they went to bed; that was half an hour before the party went away; they sleep on the second floor. I was present when the party went away; one did not pay. Whitton came to the bar to pay; that was the first time I had seen him; and Leicester came to the bar for a pipe. They went away all in a moment. I went to tell the gentleman on horseback that he had not paid his reckoning, and they were gone before I could get to the door - they were all moving off - I just saw the chaises. I went up to the bed-room in about five minutes; nobody had been in the house in the mean time. I found the lock of the bed-room door open, without any appearance of violence - it was half open. I had the key in my pocket. I found a mahogany box which had contained the property on the bed; the lock was broken off, and papers strewed about; another trunk and the bureau were broken open; my husband sent me for a constable, and set out in pursuit.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you not state at Bow-street that it was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after they left that you went up - A. I said about ten minutes, but never mentioned a quarter of an hour; I cannot tell the exact time. We have lived a year and a quarter in the house. There is an inner door in the passage, between the bar and street doors - it is two or perhaps three yards from the bar; the stairs are about five yards from the bar; there is no window in the bar opposite the parlour; I can see through the bar door, but if I am mixing liquors I am away from it. I serve at the bar door.</p>
               <p>Q. Fearby first came into the bar - A. No. I met him in the passage at the inner door - he ordered a glass of liquor, and took it into the parlour to him in about five minutes; only he and Leicester were there then - they had not taken their seats. I met the others coming into the parlour as I came out. I went into the parlour again in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour with bread and butter. There was then seven or eight people there - I saw Curry and Raven drinking brandy and water at the same table as those who had tea. There might be six persons in the tap-room - none of them had come from the races. I was not in the tap-room while the prisoners were there, but was just before; there was then about six persons there, three of whom were the men who went up to bed. The passage leading to the tap is on one side of the bar, and is very narrow, and the passage to the parlour on the other side. A person coming through the taproom must go through two kitchens, to get to the parlour. They could get to the stairs without going through the bar, but not without our seeing them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. How many times did you go into the parlour - A. Three; a quarter of an hour might elapse between the first and second time, and in twenty minutes I went again, and then saw Raven and Curry - they sat drinking together and another person by their side - I do not know whether he was drinking with them. Raven came to the bar to ask for change for his 5 s. piece, just as he was going. We never put two parties into the parlour together, without asking if it would be agreeable. The tables are not used by different parties - we have seldom occasion for them. These races make very little difference to us. We have three or four rooms, and seldom put two parties into one, as they are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230056"></xptr>never all full at once. Some gentlemen had left the parlour just before they came in. I mixed liquors for nobody else while the party were in the parlour - I might mix a glass for the tap-room. The waggoners knew the house very well - they did not go to bed at the same time.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. When the property was missed, were the waggoners applied to - A. I went up stairs, they were all in bed - I did not examine their rooms - they staid till morning, and one came back in the evening. I believe two of them went away about three o'clock - I had not been to bed then. The gentlemen who were in the parlour before they came were there when I went up stairs - I went to fetch some Banbury cakes for them; they were not out of my sight afterward till they left. I only speak of time and distance by guess.</p>

            . I am hostler at the house, and have been so nearly four years. I recollect all the five prisoners being at master's house on the 18th - I am sure of all their persons. Fearby and Whitton came in the morning, and came again in the evening with the others, and five more, about half-past eight o'clock; they all came within three minutes. Fearby and Whitton were in one gig; two more gigs had two in each, and another had three - one was on horseback - that was neither of the prisoners - they got out of their gigs, and walked in; I stood outside all the time taking care of the gigs and horses; they walked into the parlour - Fearby kept walking in and out several times, and he looked in at the bar window - he spoke to me - some of the others came in and out - I could see the passage from where I stood - nobody except that party went into that passage while they were there - Fearby and Whitton frequented the house - they went away about half-past nine in their gigs all together as quick as possibly they could - they appeared sober. I heard of the robbery soon after, and immediately went off with my master in a gig after them, and at Kensigton we found Fearby and Whitton in the Marquise of Granby, and some were in the next house - the prisoners and White were all stopped at Kensington - I found them in custody of the patrol when we came up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was it not a very busy day - A. No. I think it was between three and four minutes after Fearby and Whitton came up that the rest came - it was not five minutes - the other three gigs came up as quick as they could, one after the other, at a pretty good pace - a man can drive half-a-mile in four minutes. Fearby came up and spoke to me about his horse - he had given directions about it when he first came. I had the hay in a crib at the door, and did not leave the door at all. I was in the tap-room when Fearby arrived and was called out - the gig had just pulled up - I did not see it come up. I left about half-a-dozen persons in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. How do they get from the yard to the taproom - A. Out at the yard-gate. I can go into the tap-room from the street. I went into the tap-room after they were all gone - there were several persons there then - there were not so many as nine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. I suppose while the gigs stood there many others drove by towards London - A. Yes; Curry and Raven were in the third gig. I did not move their gigs - if more had called at the house I should - Fearby's stood nearest to the door - they were all drawn up with their heads facing the bar-window, which is in front of the house - they were aside of each other - the crib was just by the tap-room window. I stood facing the passage, with my side to the bar-window. I am sure nobody went into the passage while they were there, or I must have seen them go in - there is a back way to the house through the yard. When I got to Kensington they had been stopped. Raven and Curry were not in the same house as Fearby and Whitton.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you hear any other gig come up when Fearby and Whitton's came - A. No; the other three came up close one after the other. I asked Fearby, If I should take his horse out of the gig? he said No. I made the same offer to all the others, and they said No. It was a darkish windy night, it did not rain; I could see the door of the house, all the time they were there nobody went in at the street door to the passage. Egham races makes very little difference to our business. The window of the parlour where they sat looks into the street; I did not see it open.</p>
               <p>MRS. CURTIS re-examined. There is only one window to the parlour that was closed.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Curtis, and remember the company coming into the parlour on the night of the robbery. I waited on them, there were ten of them, they were all in the parlour when I began to wait on them. Fearby and Whitton had brandy and water, they sat at a table with another man, who is not here, he was drinking something else; the other seven all had something. I was frequently in the room, and heard them all talking to one another; they sang while I was in the room, two of them sang, I do not recollect whether the rest did. Whitton came to the bar and paid the mistress as they were going away; and one, who is absent, gave me some money, which he wanted to change. Curry gave me 1 s. for two glasses of rum and water. Raven gave me a crown-piece for change which I gave mistress. Three waggoners slept in the garret that night, all in one room; I show-them up to bed all at one time, and left a candle with them. I went up to their room after the robbery was discovered - they were there then, and appeared to be asleep - their candle was put out. I did not notice my master's bed-room door when I lit them up. The ten men went away about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. If different parties came you would shew them into that room - A. Yes. If two or three parties came respectably dressed, I should shew them into that room. I went up with the waggoners all at once - (I think it was half an hour before the party went). If my master's bed-room door had been open then, I think I must have observed it - if there had been a light in the room I must. I went up to the waggoners' room about quarter of an hour after the men went away, I do not think it was more - I went up alone, to see if the men were in bed; nobody sent me up. My mistress went up before me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Curry and Raven drank together, nobody drank with them - A. They were not talking to the people at the other tables, but with themselves. I have seen two or three different parties in that room together.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went in pursuit with my son and a young man on this night. Mr. Curtis and his hostler followed. I first saw Curry and Raven opposite the Goat, public house, opposite the palace gates. The patrol had turned their gig round - he brought them to me - I took them out of the gig into the Goat, public-house, and assisted in searching them; but found none of the property. I left them in custody, and went to the Marquis of Granby, where two gigs stood, and there found Fearby, Leicester, Whitton, and one, who has escaped, (he gave the name of White); they were in the same room together, and the only persons in the room. I took them all into custody - one of them was coming towards the door; I insisted that none of them should go till they were searched. Fearby asked what authority I had; I said I was an officer, that there had been a robbery at a public-house, at Hounslow, and a hue and cry raised; they appeared rather to dispute my searching them. I found none of the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You saw two gigs at the door and the persons inside were drinking liquor there - A. Yes. I saw the gigs there as I went to the Goat, and on returning from the Goat, I found them in the road - I was going into the Marquis of Granby at first, but Staines said,</p>
               <p>"Here is one going on," and then I went and took Curry and Raven, and made all the haste I possibly could back to the Marquis of Granby, fearing the party should have heard what had passed. I saw nobody in the two gigs. I believe the hostler stood there. I was an hour and a half there, and left White and all in safe custody. I searched them all minutely.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Curry and Raven were going towards London - A. Yes. I searched the gigs.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You pursued as soon as you got information - A. Yes. I only caught sight of three gigs. I am deaf, and only understood Curtis that there were three - but he says he told me four.</p>

            . I am horse patrol at Hounslow. I went on horseback with Cook - and when I came to Kensington, saw three gigs standing at the Marquis of Granby, public-house; before I could get up, one separated from the other two - Curry and Raven were in that gig. I ran we took them to the Three Tuns, public house - searched up, stopped the gig, took them into custody - called Cook; them, but found nothing. I went back to the Marquis of Granby, in about five minutes - the two gigs still stood there. I followed Cook through the bar into the parlour, and found Fearby, Leicester, Whitton, and White, there. I did not know any of them before - we secured and searched them, but found nothing. Cook told them, we took them for robbing the White Lion, public-house, at Hounslow, where they had been before. Fearby said, he considered we were officers, and was very willing to be searched. We went back from there to the other prisoners, at the Three Tuns, and there a gentleman gave me a watch. Curtis does not claim it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How far beyond the Marquis of Granby did you get, before you turned the gig back - A. About one hundred yards. I hollowed out to Cook, who was nearly opposite the Marquis of Granby; he came to me. He is deaf - but he had others with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Any person on the watch could have given the alarm - A. Yes, but the prisoners were in the parlour, at the back of the bar, and at the back of the house.</p>
               <p>FEARBY'S Defence. The road between Hounslow and Kensington, is so interspersed with cross-roads, that nothing would be more natural for me, (if I had committed the robbery), than to have gone out of the regular road, much less would it be likely for me to have stopped half an hour, with my horse and gig, at the Marquis of Granby. I was minutely searched; the bar-room I was in, and my gig were also searched. I was not kept in confinement, but kept that night in the public-house. After four hours, the officer said one man had escaped; the door was open, and I might have gone out as well. I dined at the house that day - and when we left, two persons were in the parlour, and had been for half an hour. In the evening, I went out to see if my horse and gig were safe, and ordered a glass of rum and water. We had some conversation respecting the races. Mrs. Curtis asked, if there were many people there; I said Yes. She said she thought so, as so many people had come to her house. Several more people came in, and a song was sung, and many joined in the chorus - it is said there were ten people in the room, but I think there were many more. He says one of the three men has slept at the house, fifteen years; how can he be so positive, when he has only been there a year and a half? It is plain they do not know when the robbery was done, or they would not have searched the waggoners. The house is exposed to every passenger, situated directly on the main road to the West of England - and particularly on that day when there was a prize fight, as well as the races. How easily might any person in the tap room have gone into the parlour, without the knowledge of any of the witnesses? the parlour door was wide open.</p>
               <p>The other prisoners made no defence.</p>

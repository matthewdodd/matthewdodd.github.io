I called for a pint of beer; in a few minutes the prisoner came in, he called for a pint of beer. I had my bundle alongside of me; I was looking out of the window into the coach yard. He saw me very busy looking out of the window. He had an opportunity of taking my bundle; he went out with it. When I turned my head he was gone, and the bundle was gone. The landlord found him, and my bundle at his lodgings.</p>

            . I am son to the landlord of the Magpie and Stump. I was not in the house when the things were taken; I came in after the young man had lost his bundle. They gave me a description; I guessed by the description, who he was. I went down to a house in Plow Court, and found him.</p>
               <p>Q.What is he - A. A tailor, I believe. I went into the house; I found the prisoner sitting in the room, and the bundle laying at the door, at the step of the stairs. I told him, I wanted him to go along with me. He got up directly. I asked him to bring his bundle with him; he said it did not belong to him. I told him, he should have known that an hour and a half ago. I brought him home to my father, and fetched Mr. Fletcher, the officer, to him. The prisoner was rather intoxicated at the time.</p>
               <p>FLETCHER. I produce the bundle. I took the prisoner in custody.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are all my things. I recollect the man sitting alongside of me.</p>

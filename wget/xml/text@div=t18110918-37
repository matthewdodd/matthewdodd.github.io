               <p>Q. Do you rent the whole house. - A. No, only the shop and parlour, my landlord's name is Spencer, he lives in the first floor. On the 5th of September I and my wife went out at between eight and nine o'clock, and returned at one. We found our premises had been broken open.</p>
               <p>Q.What property was gone. - A. A great quantity of remnants of cloth, callico, and ribbons. We found the major part of them on the Saturday following, some at the prisoner's lodgings, 22 Queen Street, Seven Dials. We found four bundles at four different places, and a tea-caddie at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. What other places. - A. One at a chandler's shop in Queen Street, one at a cheesemonger's in the same street, one at a milk cellar in Nottingham Court, and another at a baker's in Wild Street.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find at the prisoner's. - A. We found two pieces of cloth in a box, I was with the officer and saw them found.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner the key of that room or box. - A. She had the key of both, she was present at the time the things were found. These are the pieces of cloth that were found in the box; we likewise found this apron in a drawer, the drawer was locked and the prisoner had the key. That was all the things that were found at that time, we found more things at her apartment the same evening when we went again: we found this shawl under a green baize, the covering of a table, and this piece of callico that my wife cut out for the little boy, that was under the green baize, the covering of another table, and we found a pair of pockets in the dirty clothes; I know them all to be my property, I had seen them the same day in my shop. The prisoner told us where the other things were.</p>

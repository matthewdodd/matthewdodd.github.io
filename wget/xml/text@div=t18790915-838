I am a widow and housekeeper, at the Great Britain Life Office, 101, Cheapside—the prisoner came to the house about 3.45 on 9th August and asked if Mr. Makeham, the secretary, was gone—I said, "Yes, I don't think he has been here to-day"—she said, "I am his niece, Miss Makeham, do you know whether he has got my letter?"—I said, "What letter, Miss? did it come by post to-day?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "What post?"—she said, "The first post this morning"—I said, "Bid you mark it private?"—she said, "Yes"—if marked private it would not be opened—I asked her to step down into Mr. Makeham's room—she said her sister was on the point of death, and she wanted to find her uncle to change a cheque which she had in her pocket, and she asked if any of the clerks lived near, as they knew her well—I said, "No, they live in the suburbs"—she said, "Do you think the station-master would give me a railway ticket?"—I said, "No, not without paying"—she said, "Oh no, of course not"—I said, "Is it money you want, Miss?"—she said, "Yes,"</p>

Is not she a good woman? I am so grateful to her. I came to cash my quarter's cheque, but was too late. If you are not at the Abbey I will be at your office on Monday.

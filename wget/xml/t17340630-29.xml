Presently 3 Men came along, and one of them took it up, and said, Damn it, we'll have this Saddle. I started up and catch'd hold of it, and said, Prithee Friend let the Saddle alone, but he pull'd it from me. I follow'd them above 40 Yards before I overtook them, and then they had not got the Saddle. The Prisoner said my Name is Barnet, one every Body knows me. I went home with 2 of them, and then they said they told me the Prisoner threw it over the Ditch.</p>

I took it on my Back, and he follow'd us. We had not gone far before he took up a Saddle. The Lad in the Ditch catch'd at it, but the Prisoner brought it away, and soon after threw it into a Ditch. The Lad follow'd us and ask'd for the Saddle. Then, says the Prisoner, It's time for me to leave you, and so he went away, and we were taken up on this Account and sent to New-Prison, where we lay all Night. The Prisoner had said his Name was Barnet, and he appearing to be a Butcher by his Clothes, we enquir'd for him, and found he <rs id="t17340630-29-deflabel143" type="occupation">kept a Chandler's shop</rs>

            . The Prisoner overtook me with the Bed, and ask'd whether I was going. What's that to you says I. I suppose you have stole it, says he, and I'll see whither you carry it. I pitch'd it on a Post to rest my self, and it fell upon the Ground, and he got upon it - My Brother came presently after, and a Cooper passing by at the same time, the Prisoner cry'd Hoa! Every Body knows me, my Name is Barnet. Then my Brother took up the Bed, and the Prisoner follow'd us about 6 Yards, where I saw a Man in a <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173406300020"></xptr> Ditch, and the Prisoner took up a Saddle, laid it across his Shoulder, and said, We'll have this Saddle. He carry'd it 40 or 50 Yards and threw it into into a Ditch, and soon after the Lad came up and said, where's my Saddle. We told him the Prisoner had thrown it into a Ditch. Then, says the Prisoner, It will be my best way to turn back again, and so he went away; the Lad follow'd us home, and to satisfy him we went back again with him, to look for the Saddle, but could not find it:</p>
               <p>Brooks. When I first came up to them, they said they had not got the Saddle, but did not tell me the Man had thrown it into the Ditch, till they came home.</p>
               <p>Several Witnesses appear'd for the Prisoner, and depos'd they had known him many Years. and that he was a very honest Fellow. but a little Maggotty when he got drunk.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a black</hi>). I live at No. 25, Hatfield-street, Stamford-street, Blackfriars. I was in Hatfield-street about 7 in the evening, and received a blow with a life preserver on the side of my head—I saw no weapon, but feel satisfied that a fist could not have done it—I was perfectly sober—I was struck from behind, and fell immediately—I heard no foot-steps, but I had seen two men on the opposite side of the street—the pri<lb></lb>soner, on my oath, is one of them—they crossed over to the same side as I was, but behind me, and I was struck in a second—when I fell my coat was unbuttoned, and my gold chain torn from my neck, by one of the two persons I had seen cross the road—the prisoner then took my grocery, handed it to the man who had my chain, and ran off—the prisoner was attempting to run off too, but I jumped on my legs and seized him, and called "Police," and "Murder"—the police came, and I gave him in charge—he never got out of my possession—my head bled very much.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my uncle, in Hatfield-street—on 3rd January I saw Mr. Brice go down the street—I saw two persons on the other side of the way—the prisoner is one of the men—they crossed to the same side as Mr. Brice—the other man hit him a blow, and he fell down—the other man snatched his gold chain off, and then the prisoner took Mr. Brice's parcel, which he had in his hand, but I did not see what he did with it, and then the other one ran away, and Mr. Brice kept hold of the prisoner, and held him till the policeman came—I am sure this is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Lowther Jackson, a tailpr, in Three Colt-street, Limehouse. On the 24th of May, between three and four o'clock, the two prisoners came into the shop with oranges—they were there from five to seven minutes—one of them had a covered basket, and the other an open basket—after they were gone, I missed a pair of trowsers, which had been not far from where the prisoners were—I went after the prisoners, and saw them in the Commercial-road—I charged them with it—they said they did not know any thing of it—I asked if they had been down Limehouse, selling oranges, they said No—I said I could swear to Barnett—he called me a liar—I am positive Barnett was one of the persons in the shop—I cannot speak positively about Lyons.</p>

               <p>asked her the price of the pears; she said, "Three a penny"—my sister, Leah Isaacs, was with me—it was a little after 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I had 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>-worth of the pears, and I asked Barnett if she had not got any better pears than those—she said, yes, if I liked to walk inside—I went in, and she showed me some large pears for baking—I said, "They are not fit for eating; I will have some outside"—I went out, and had another 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth, and I opened my purse, and took a sixpence out to pay for the pears, and I placed the purse close to the basket; and while I was putting the pears in the basket, the girl Phillips put her hand on the purse, and ran away with it into the house—I took hold of her, and she gave the parse to Mrs. Barnett—I let go the girl, and took hold of Mrs. Barnett's hand—she got it from me, and put her hand into her pocket, and said it was only a halfpenny, it was not the purse—I said, "If you don't give me my purse, I will send for a policeman"—she and I had a struggle—I said, "I will send for a policeman," and I sent my sister—during that time I was making a noise, and Barnett was making a noise—several women came in, and took the girl Phillips out, and Mrs. Barnett ran up stairs—she came down in a few minutes with a candle in her hand, and said, "Well, if you think you have lost your purse, I will light a candle, and you shall look for it"—the candle was unlighted, when she brought it down—the policeman came, and I gave both the prisoners in charge—I saw the purse pass from the girl Phillips's hand to the woman Barnett's hand, I am quite sure—a candle was not necessary at that time, it was daylight—supposing my purse had been on the ground I should have seen it.</p>

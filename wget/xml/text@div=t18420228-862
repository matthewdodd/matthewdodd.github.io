                  </hi>. I am a wine and spirit merchant, and live in Bishopsgate-street; my son, George Barker, is in partnership with me. On the 12th of February, my attention was called to my servant following the prisoner, who had carried away this bottle—he brought him back with the bottle—it contained four gallons of French brandy, which had just been taken out of a hogshead for convenience, and the remainder is there now—I can swear to the bottle, it has my name on it, and I have no doubt about the brandy—it would be worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it had remained in the docks for some years, and the duty would by that means be diminished.</p>

Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening of the 12th of February, I saw the prisoner come towards this bottle, which was on my master's premises—he took it up, and walked out at the door with it—it contained four gallons of pale brandy—I am certain it was my master's property—I took the prisoner back.</p>

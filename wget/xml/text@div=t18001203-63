             sworn. - I am coachman to Mr. Maitland; I know the prisoner at the bar; he brought me down five quarters of oats, on the 4th of August last, and one sack of bran; there should have been ten sacks, but there were but nine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you mean to say that there wanted another sack to make the five quarters? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon delivery of the oats, what passed between you and the prisoner at the bar? - A. I got on the cart to put the oats back, and I discovered there were only nine sacks of oats; he said he knew there was not; that he had let a person have one upon the road, but he would give me another the next time; I told him, I thought that was very wrong; he said, he would be sure to bring another; that he had let his master's customer have a sack; in consequence of that, I did not tell my master;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180012030041"></xptr>upon the 29th of the same month, he brought me some more oats down to Woodford-hall - five quarters more; I stood at the stable-door, and he said, coachman, I have not got the sack of oats now; I asked him why; he said, he had not brought it, and hoped I would not tell his master, as he had not done any such thing before, and that he was sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Q. From the 4th of August, to the 29th, you never saw any thing more of the prisoner? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowys. Q. When did you inform his master of this deficiency of one sack of oats? - A. I think it was in September, when I went to claim  it.</p>
               <p>Q. The man was not charged at all till November by his own master, therefore it could not be in September? - A. I cannot charge my memory with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you can recollect this, that the man had the misfortune to get drunk, and had lost it, and would make it good the next time? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you give your information to Mr. Roberts, who had sent your corn? - A. I gave the information to Mr. Roberts the first time I came to town.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I submit this case is not made out at all.</p>
               <p>Court. There are three places in which the crime may have been committed, either in the city of London, the county of Middlesex, or the county of Essex; in which place the crime has been committed, there certainly is no evidence; if you take the whole of this man's evidence together, it precludes pretty nearly the city of London; for, he says, the prisoner told him he let a friend have the oats upon the road, and therefore he leaves it completely open; if the offence was committed in Essex, we are trying a fact of which we have no jurisdiction. <rs id="t18001203-63-verdict343" type="verdictDescription">

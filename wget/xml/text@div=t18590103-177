                  </hi>. I was formerly Inspector of police of the G division—I was employed last month to watch a house in Graham-buildings, Twister's-alley—On 21st December, I went to that house with Inspector Briant, Serjeant Brannan, and Elliott, about half-past 6 o'clock—I had watched the house all the week previously—I saw a youth named Upton go into the house—I followed him in soon afterwards—I went into a room on the left hand on the ground floor—the street door was ajar, and the door of the room also, but instead of the door opening into the room as I expected, I pulled it, and shut myself in the passage till I broke out—after opening the door, I went into the room with the three constables—I saw the three prisoners there with the youth already alluded to—William Elliott was standing with his back to a bed and his face towards me, and he put his left hand out as if throwing something, and I heard something knock against a basket which stood inside the door—at that time Briant seized him, a struggle ensued, and I saw a white lump drop from between them on the floor, and William Elliott used every effort to stamp on it, which he did before Mr. Briant could remove it—Briant pulled him away, and pushed him into another part of the room, and put him in custody of Serjeant Brannan and Elliott—Briant said "He has broken it"—and I saw Briant pick up the fragments of a plaster of Paris mould—I looked in the basket, and found this rag containing six counterfeit shillings, wrapped up separately, and folded this way—three of them are of the date of 1853, two of 1842, and one of 1820—when we went into the room, the two women were standing close to the fire, which was a very large one—the place was excessively hot—I went to the cupboard, and found two files with white metal in their teeth—a paper containing plaster of Paris in powder, some pieces of tin, a small portion of plaster on them, and in a tub which stood inside the door, I found this basin containing plaster of Paris, and three or four lumps of soft plaster—it had been recently mixed with water—it will be soft till dried with great heat—I said to William Elliott, "Well Mr. Elliott, I received instructions from the Mint to look after you—I believe you are dealing in counterfeit coin"—Margaret Elliott then said to him, "I told you the other night when you was doing this, that there would be a b—y buss some day"—and William Elliott said, "Mr. George Carroll is at the bottom of this—I have not been long at it—I can't be much worse off than I am"—we took the three prisoners away in custody, and took possession of the things that were there, and produce them to-day.</p>

I am inspector of coin to the Royal Mint—these are several particles of a plaster of Paris mould, containing the obverse and reverse sides of a shilling of the date of 1853—the good piece of coin is put on some flat surface, either glass or tin—a case is put round it, to keep the plaster in the space, and then the plaster is poured in, and when cold, it is taken off—they then make a channel, and place it in sand, and the metal is poured in, and by that means, you have an impression of a shilling—you pull the shilling out, and there is a large piece which is attached to it—that is broken off, and with a file, the piece is made to represent a good shilling, and it is then electrotyped—I can't say whether this piece of plaster had been a mould—if it had, it has not been used—here is the impress of this good shilling—here is no bad money from it—this one shilling is good—these others are bad; four of them are from one mould—these files are used for making good the milling at the edge of the coin—this plaster of Paris is what the moulds are made of.</p>

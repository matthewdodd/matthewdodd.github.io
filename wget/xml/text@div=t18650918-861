                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, of 1, Chiltern-view-terrace, near Uxbridge—I have seen this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is a mill; the Leet, a stream of water, runs along here, and there is a footpath by the Bide of it—here is the high-road from West Drayton going towards Uxbridge—the little girl, Elizabeth Lydia Bacheller, was my niece; she had been staying with me six weeks; she came down for a change, and was shortly expected to be taken back again—she was four years old and a few days—on 21st August I had been working at Langlcy-park, and was coming home at quarter or half-past 7—she has several times come out to meet me—I know the prisoner; he lives in Uxbridge, and is a dealer in old clothes—he keeps a pony and cart—as I crossed the high-road, I heard a horse and cart coming from West Drayton towards Uxbridge—I looked round, and saw the prisoner driving it as fast as the pony could gallop—it was a large pony, and the prisoner was flogging it—he was very near to me—from the place where I saw him it is an open straight road, and is twenty-four or twenty-five feet broad at the nearest part, at the end of the terraee—he passed about two strides from me—Messer was walking with me, and I said, 'Out of the way; here they come flogging away,' and put my arm out as a guard, by which means we both avoided it, and the cart went behind us—I imme<lb></lb>diately looked round, and saw the horse's legs just striking the child, which threw her on her back, and the off-wheel passed over the lower part of her neck or chest—from the near-side of the cart was about fourteen or fifteen feet—he was near the middle of the road, but, if anything, deviating to the off-side—I saw nothing else on the road; he had the whole command of the road—it was quite light; I do not know whether the sun had set—Messer picked the child up—it never moved afterwards—I did not know at the time that it was the child that was stopping at my house—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner, two or three minutes afterwards, coming with his cart—a man was sitting with him, and there were two children behind—the prisoner was drunk—the child had been in very good health; never better.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you draw the prisoner's attention to your friend and yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he did not pull the rein to get out of our way: he went on straight—we were not meeting the cart—we were crossing the road—he was going towards the tavern—as we crossed the road I saw the prisoner coming on my right hand—we quickened our pace two or three steps to get out of his way—we said nothing to him—there is one flight of steps common to all the houses on the terrace, which is elevated from the road—there are piers to each house—a person coming out of No. 1 would walk along the terrace to the steps, and down the steps into the road—this was Drayton race day—the road is twenty-four feet ten inches wide at the terrace, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> where the accident occurred it is wider.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber—I was with Mr. Howard, and heard a horse and cart coining at a tremendous rate—the horse was galloping, and the man was flogging it—I had some difficulty to get out of the way, and Mr. Howard gave me a push—the road is straight for 200 or 300 yards at that spot—there is another crossing close by the tavern to go to Uxbridge New Town—I did not see the child before the horse struck it: which doubled it up, and the wheel went over it—I picked it up, but it never moved: blood poured out of its mouth and nose and one eye—I held it in my arms till the prisoner came back—he seemed <hi rend="italic">beerey</hi>, but my attention was upon the child—I have measured the road: it is eighteen feet from the near side of the road to where the wheel of his cart was—the road is twenty-four feet wide.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I live at 4, Chiltern-view Villas—I know the deceased—I was standing on the steps leading from the terrace into the road at a quarter to 7 o'clock, and saw her go out from Mr. Howard's house—she crossed the road towards the footpath on the opposite side, which she reached, and walked along the kerb till she got to some railings, and then she got on the path—I then saw Mr. Howard coming from the Mill-road with Mr. Messer—the child turned back a little way and then she attempted to cross in the same direction that her uncle was crossing—I then saw the prisoner in his cart coming in a direction from Corley, very fast, and saw the horse strike the child with one of his legs, knock her down, and the wheel went over her chest or throat—the prisoner was flogging the horse—I saw the child picked up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see Mr. Howard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till afterwards, but I saw him before the child crossed the road—the child did not leave the footpath till her uncle had crossed—she went back a little way, and then got on the path, which is four inches elevated—she was picked up eighteen feet from the footway—I saw her going as quick as she could, Attracted by the sight of her uncle, and in a minute the cart went over her—I knew her—I live next door but one—when I saw her danger I called out, but could not stop her.</p>

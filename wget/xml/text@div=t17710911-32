Jones went from the counter towards the door; in going along, I perceived her move her arm; I suspected she had something under her cloak; I followed her and brought her in from the door, and took from under her arm, the remnants of worked muslin; they laid on the counter ready to put up in a rapper (the muslin produced and deposed to.)</p>

I was behind the counter, they came in and asked for some low price linen; I believe Styles asked for them; there was none she liked, Jones's child was on the counter, she went to the door with the child; Mr. Presten brought her in from the door and took two pieces from under her gown, and two or three pieces fell on the floor; I went for a constable and took them to the Compter.</p>

            . I live at Temple Bar; they came into my shop; I suspected them, and I watched them into a great many shops, at last into Mr. Foot's, and we took these muslins from under their cloaks, one of them said to the other it was a very unfortunate accident or they should have had something; there were five of them, three waited at a distance, these came to them as they came out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shops did you watch them into?</p>
               <p>Ham. I believe at least fifteen.</p>
               <p>Q. From what hour?</p>
               <p>Ham. From three o'clock till six.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the same two people go into every shop?</p>
               <p>Ham. I believe these two always went in; the others stood out, I think.</p>

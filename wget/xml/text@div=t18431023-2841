                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Green, and lire in Basing<lb></lb>hall-street. On Tuesday night, the 26th of Sept., I went to the Adelaide Gallery—the prisoner sat on my right-hand side—I afterwards went down stairs to another room—a constable spoke to me, I then searched my pocket, and missed my purse, containing a half-crown and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., also a hand<lb></lb>kerchief and silver knife.</p>

PATNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it where the music was going on that the prisoner sat by you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, in the microscope-room—I had not felt my purse safe since I had been in the gallery—I wai there two hours—I did not pay myself to go there—I know it was safe when I left home—we walked there—I have not seen my purse since.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I was at the gallery in plain clothes—I saw the prisoner, and watched her up into the microscope-room—I saw her place her hand under a lady's dress, and keep it there till she got to the top of the stairs—I went to the lady as soon as she got into the room, and asked if she had lost any thing—she said, "No," without feeling—I watched the prisoner till she went into a room below, and saw her go into a small dark room—I placed myself so that she could not see me—I saw her lift up seve<lb></lb>ral ladies' dresses, and place her hand to their pockets—in a few minutes the prosecutrix came into the room—I saw the prisoner distinctly lift up her dress, and place her hand to her pocket, snatch her hand out again, and walk out of the room—I directly said to the prosecutrix, "You have lost some<lb></lb>thing"—she felt, and said, "I have lost my purse"—I ran after the pri<lb></lb>soner, and secured her, with a purse in her left hand, containing about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a half-crown, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. loose in her right hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The purse you found was not the one the lady lost? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—she said it was not hers—I have given it to the prisoner's husband—the prisoner said she was taking the money from her purse at the time I apprehended her, and was going to pay for some glass—I have seen her be-before—I have every reason to believe she is the identical person who was taken from the Adelaide Gallery twelve months ago, for picking pockets—I found her with the purse in her hand in the large room which the little dark room leads from—I saw her put her hand to the prosecutrix's pocket in the dark room, but I stood where a light was thrown on her, opposite the doorway, and saw it distinctly—in fact, it is all one room but partitioned off—there were a great many people there, and plenty of opportunity of throwing a purse away.</p>

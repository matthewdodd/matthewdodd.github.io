                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 105.) I was on duty at London<lb></lb>wall on the 16th of Dec.—I saw the prisoner with this coat on his back—I followed him and asked him where he brought it from—he said, from his father, No. 3, Pump-court, in the Borough, and he was going to take it to his brother at Mile-end gate—he said his father's name was James Burns or Thomas Burns—I went to Pump-court, and there was no such person—I did not go to Mile-end gate, because he told me afterwards there was no inch person—he took the coat off in going along, and when he got to the station-house door he dropped it and ran away—I pursued and took him again.</p>

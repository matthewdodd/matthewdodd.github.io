I kept my money in a small box in the room where he worked - there was one crown, and three shilling pieces; I had seen them safe on Monday, the 15th of November, about half-past twelve o'clock; my wife came into the room about two, for some money, and it was all gone; she charged him with the theft: he denied it; the constable was sent for - he was searched, and the same crown piece was found upon him, with three shillings, and two sixpences. I know it by its being black on the dragon side; he had shown it to me at the distance of the table, before the constable came. No other person had been in the room.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took charge of the prisoner, and found one crown, three shilling, three sixpences, and 2 1/2 d. in copper, on him; Sanson did not claim it at first, because it had been made brighter while they had sent for me. I said the matter looked very black against him, and he said, "Well, I suppose I must give the money up."</p>

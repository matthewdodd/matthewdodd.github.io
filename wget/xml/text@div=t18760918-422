                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner</hi>). I have pleaded guilty to this offence—upon the 15th August, I was driving a van-William was with me—I was sent from Crutchet Friars, down to Goodman's Yard-at Goodman's Yard, I saw Murphy and Ridley, opposite the Vine, Ridley sitting down, and Murphy standing up-Murphy asked me what I was going to load—I said tobacco—he said "Will you do anything? you can do with a few shillings, and I know I can"—I said "I don't know what I am going to load"—I saw Ridley, and I said "Have you left the Great Western?"—he said "I have left about three weeks"—I then went into the warehouse to see if there was room to draw in; but there was not and I came out again—Murphy asked me what I was going to load—I said four hogsheads and a case—he said "We can do the case a trick"—I refused, Murphy made the remark, but Ridley was standing beside him-Murphy asked if I would do a hogshead open—I said "No, it could not be done"-Murphy referred to Ridley about opening a hogshead somewhere down Victoria Docks-Ridley said "Yes "-Murphy asked me if I was frightened at the money—he said "If you are, I live at No. 4, Signlong Court"—If you come down this way to-morrow and call there, you will find the money there, or I will meet you wherever you like to say "-one of the foremen called out—I put the van under the hydraulic inside the warehouse, and put six bales into my van—when I went on the platform I asked if the hogshead and bales were all he said "No"—I then stood outside-Murphy asked again whether I would have the hogshead done—I said no, I was not going to load a case, I was going to load a bale—he said "We can do a bale; you can send the boy for the <hi rend="italic">deck</hi> "(<hi rend="italic">that is the declaration</hi>) "and while he has gone we can do it, and he will be none the wiser"—I said no, I would not have the bale touched <hi rend="italic">on</hi> any consideration—he said "Have a hogshead done; if you load the hogshead, on the near side, three will go into the bottom, the fourth on the top, and the sheet over them, I can do that, we can have a drag to follow you up to Paddington; you can drive up Oxford Street,</p>

Murphy before—I had been working with Ridley at the Friars, before he left the Great Western.</p>

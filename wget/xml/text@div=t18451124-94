                  </hi>. I am an Excise-officer, and live in Apollo-buildings, Walworth—this handkerchief is my property, and was in my pocket, on Friday morning, the 21st of Nov.—I went into the Flower Pot—I had had it in my possession half-an-hour before—I was in the Flower Pot when it was produced to me by the constable.</p>

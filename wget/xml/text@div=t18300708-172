               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You knew his Hebrew name? A. Yes, Aaron is Hebrew, but I did not know it was Cohen; I have known him for years - there were five or six hundred people in the street; there is a great deal of jostling and hustling about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not come to you of his own accord, and ask you if you had presumed to say he had taken the trousers, and if so, to give him in charge? A. No; I did not tell the Lord Mayor so; when I spoke to him I could not take him, because I had a lot of goods, but I told him I certainly would have him taken after I sold my goods; he then went away, but came back again, and we had an altercation for about a quarter of an hour - he was taken next day in the lane; it will not help my business to transport him; he would certainly make one person less in the market; I only go there when I have a lot of old things to sell.</p>
               <p>LIPMAN LEVY. I am the prosecutrix's nephew, and assist in the business. I saw the prisoner take these trousers off the board - he looked at them, and my aunt asked him 6s. for them; he said he would see if there was any thing else to suit him, and while he was examining them, some beasts came by, which made a great confusion - a crowd came against my stall, and when they had passed, I looked round, and saw that the trousers were gone, and so was Cohen; my aunt went and fetched him back in about a quarter of an hour, and said he had the trousers; he said he had not - they were contending for about five minutes, and then he went away; we did not attempt to stop him -I saw him afterwards walking up and down; I could not find a constable - I did not leave the stall to look for one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If you thought he had stolen things, why not take him? A. I could not leave the stall it was so long - my aunt could not mind it all; I never saw the prisoner before, and never heard my aunt say she had seen him; the cattle going to market created great confusion.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prosecutrix came to me after the fair was over, and said a man had stolen her trousers; I asked who it was - she said Cohen; I said, "Why if he has got them he will bring them back," for it is common in the market to take things away for four or five hours; we are always in attendance at the market, and have these complaints eight or nine times a day; I left word at the prisoner's house for him to come to the watch-house, which he did; he said he might have looked at the things, but never took them away; he insisted on going to the Compter, and said if I did not take him, he would take me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not his friends offer her the value of the trousers, but he said it was a gross imposition, and he would go to the Compter and not pay one farthing? A. Certainly he did.</p>

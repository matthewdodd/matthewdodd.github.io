                  </hi> (City Policeman 98). On 26th September, about twenty minutes to five, I was with Green in Wood Street—I saw the three prisoners in company—Paddon was carrying a bag over his shoulder—we followed them into Wood Street, and ultimately into Ironmonger Lane—they went down Ironmonger Lane, and Paddon handed the bag he was carrying to Thompson—Paddon then went into Mullen's hotel, kept by Mrs. Mackie—he came out and spoke to Crawley and Thompson—Crawley then went into the house with Paddon—they came out, Crawley leading the way—they went towards Gresham Street—Paddon was carry<lb></lb>ing this sample case (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on his back—Thompson followed a few yards behind—I and Green rushed across the road and attempted to secure the three prisoners—Paddon tried to throw the case on my head, but did not succeed—I secured Paddon—the other two ran away towards Cheapside—a cry of "Stop thief!" was raised, and Green followed and brought Craw<lb></lb>ley back—they were taken to the station and searched—6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was found on one, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the other—the case was found to contain samples—on 28th September, about two o'clock in the morning, I went in company with Green to a brothel in the Curtain Road, Shoreditch—in the back parlour we found Thompson in bed with a female—I took him into custody—I told him I was an officer, and should take him into custody for being concerned, with two others already in custody, in stealing a traveller's case from Mullen's hotel, Ironmonger Lane—he said he did not know anything about it—he was taken to the station and charged—the charge was read to him—he said he had nothing to say to it—I had followed Thompson and the other two prisoners on that occasion for about half an hour—I had seen Thompson before—I know him by sight—I found the case belonged to Mr. Moir.</p>

                  </hi> (City Detective Officer 280). I was in company with Whitney on the afternoon of 26th September—I saw the three prisoners in Friday Street, and watched them into Ironmonger Lane—I saw Paddon go into Mullen's hotel, return, and speak to the other two, and give Thomp<lb></lb>son the sack he was carrying—he went in again with Crawley—they re<lb></lb>turned, Paddon carrying this case on his shoulder—Thompson was walking up and down outside the door—Crawley came out first, Paddon following, carrying the case—Thompson was behind—at the corner of Ironmonger Lane, in Gresham Street, we endeavoured to stop the three prisoners—Crawley and Thompson got away—I pursued Crawley—he was stopped by a man in Church Passage—I brought him back—Thompson got away—on the morning of 28th I went with Whitney to a brothel in Bateman's Row, Shoreditch—we there found Thompson—we took him into custody—I have no doubt whatever that he was the man who was in company with the other prisoners on this occasion—I had seen him before and knew him.</p>

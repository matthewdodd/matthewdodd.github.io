                  </hi>. I live at Stamford-place, Hatfield-street, Surrey, On the 5th of Aug. I had been to the police-office with my wife on a charge against Mrs. Truebody, who is I believe the sister of the prisoner's wife—she was bound to keep the peace—I returned to Stamford-place—I saw Mn, Hart—the prisoner was not there—my father was there—he had been having some words with Mrs. Hart—there was some abuse of my father, and I went for Kidney the policeman—I returned with him—as we came out of Stamford-street, to cross to Stamford-place, Mrs. Hart crossed to go to Upper Ground-street—in two minutes she returned with the prisoner Hart and her own brother Finn—the policeman was in uniform—Finn struck me at the top of Stamford-place, as I was standing by the officer, without any words having passed between us—I did not strike him again—I was knocked senseless—I was struck on the left side—I reeled with it—then Hart struck me a blow—I saw Parsons—he was called by the officer to assist him—he came, and he was attacked by Hart—I was at that time in a state of stupefaction, bat I saw Hart strike Parsons—I saw Parsons on the ground, and Hart on the top of him, and Hart's wife likewise—Parsons was dragged away from then senseless by some people—there were twelve or fourteen people assembled—when Parsons was dragged away, Hart attacked me a second time, and we struggled together, to Hatfield-street—he threw me—I got up—He threw me again, and kicked me—I got up, and got hold of him, and beings longer-armed man than he is, I succeeded in holding him off, and fat recovered myself—by this time the crowd had increased—there were from thirty to fifty persons, I should think—I held Hart at arm's length, and Mrs. Truebody, his sister-in-law, came and tried to rescue him—by palling him we came more closely in contact—Finn, at this time, struggled with the policeman, and Finn came and kicked me—the policeman tore him from me—Hart and I struggled together for three or four minutes—Hart then tad this knife in his hand—I think it was given him—I had not seen it in his hand—I had not then said anything about giving him in charge—the police<lb></lb>man had told me to hold him till more assistance came—I then saw the knife in his hand, and I felt a sharp instrument go into my arm, bat I did not think he was stabbing me, till he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> it down my left eye, down my cheek—he found I did not let him go, and he cut me across my fore<lb></lb>finger into the bone—that cut caused me to release him—he got from me, but did not get more than ten yards—I seized him again—he was shutting the knife np at the time, and put it into his jacket-pocket—I succeeded in retaining him after all—we struggled again heavily together—I succeeded in throwing hi down—he did not get away—the policeman came, and I gave him into charge—we then proceeded about a hundred yards—his wife, Mrs. Hart then came, and attacked me a second time—she bit me through the finger the officer let Hart go, to come to my assistance, and Hart escaped—I did not see him afterwards taken.</p>

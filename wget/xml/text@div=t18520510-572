                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Horsemonger-lane Gaol. I saw the prisoner there on 11th April—I saw him daily while he was in the gaol—he has been removed from there a week—I believe him to have been perfectly insane at the time of his committal, and I saw no alteration in his conduct since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's uncle. I consider that for the last fire years he has been a lunatic—symptoms of insanity were first observed by his family immediately after his return from South America—that was in the year '48—he said he had lost all his energy; he had got no inside left, and that he always required something in his hands to support or balance him—in March, 1849, I conveyed him to Bethlehem Lunatic Asylum—he remained there till Dec. of the same year, and was then discharged as uncured—he was then taken home by an aunt—she persuaded his mother to take him out, and said she would make an experiment by keeping him at her house, to see if she could not do something for him—I saw him frequently at Bethlehem, and afterwards at his aunt's, almost daily; certainly every week—the state of his mind seemed to get worse; and after a week or two his aunt was very glad to get rid of him, and his mother procured an order for his admission into the County Lunatic Asylum, at Wandsworth—he went there in Feb., 1850, and remained about twelve months—I think he was discharged in Feb., 1851—he was discharged uncured—from then up to the time of this unfortunate occurrence he lived with his mother—I have been in the habit of seeing him almost weekly during that time—his mother was my sister—I was constantly urging her to put him again in confinement; that he was not fit to be at large—on the very Tuesday previous to this occurrence he came over to me for a small allowance which I was in the habit of making him; and then his manner was so very strange, that I sent a message the following day to my sister, to urge her by all means to put him in confinement—I was satisfied something would occur; she sent me word that she would do so; and it was arranged that he was to be placed in confinement the very night this took place—I have not the least doubt that he is insane at the present time—I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he attended by any medical man after his discharge, in Feb. 1851, from the County Lunatic Asylum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not—I saw him on the Tuesday, previous to this occurrence—I have frequently seen him since he has been in prison—I last saw him last Friday—I have had conver<lb></lb>sation with him there—I consider that he has never had lucid intervals since he came from America—when I saw him last Friday, in Newgate, he was more composed and sedate than I had seen him for years—I had seen him at Horsemonger-lane, on the Thursday previous, in the presence of Mr. Keene, the governor, when he was in one of his bad fits—he was sullen, and did not care about seeing me, and wanted to leave the room immediately—when I saw him in Newgate it was not in the presence of any medical man—it was in the presence of Mr. Cope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you been in the habit of seeing him frequently, since, in prison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen him five or six times—he will answer any questions you put to him, but he will never find a subject of conversation himself, or sustain a conversation—he has not for years mentioned any</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100138"></xptr>
               <p>subject himself—the question I put to him in Newgate was, "I suppose you know what you are here for?"—"Oh yes," he said, but in a very indifferent manner, "it is a dreadful deed, and I suppose I must suffer for it; I must throw myself on their mercy"—that was rational enough—I asked him also if he recollected the last time I saw him, and where—he said, "Yes; one day last week;" but he could not recollect the day—he was never addicted to drink, previous to this malady he was one of the most steady industrious young men that could possibly be—he was the chief support of his mother and family—his over anxiety and assiduity in business, I am satisfied, brought it on—I should say he appeared to understand perfectly well the charge I alluded to in my conversation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpet bag and hassock manufacturer, and live at I, Durham-place, Lambeth-road. The prisoner and his mother resided in my house eleven months, up to the time of this unfortunate occurrence—I was in the habit of seeing the prisoner daily—at times he was much worse than at others, but generally speaking I never thought there was any harm in him—I never thought he would do an act of this description—at times he had very curious ways with him, and did not appear at all like a man in his mind—at other times he did—he would sometimes come home and stand at the street door, and talk to it for half an hour at a time—three or four days before he committed this act, he had been out to fetch something for his dinner, and when he came to the door he fancied that <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Count had been insulting him, and he put down his provisions, took off his coat, and said he would fight <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Count the champion of England—I have not seen him since the murder.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am governor of Newgate.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you consider, or not, from what you have seen of him, and the con<lb></lb>versations you have had with him, that he is, or not, in a state to answer whether he is Guilty or Not Guilty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think he is in a condition to understand the meaning of those answers; when the question is put to him whether he is Guilty, or Not Guilty, I really do not think he understands the nature of it—I found that opinion upon my observation of him since he has been in my custody.</p>

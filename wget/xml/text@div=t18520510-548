                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Grundy-street, Poplar; I have a wife and three children. On Saturday night, 24th April, I closed my house after 12 o'clock—I had then an iron chest in the back parlour, containing 215<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and about-3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in halfpence, and two or three florins—the coppers were in the lid of a large tin grocer's tea canister—I came down next morning between half past 6 and 25 minutes to 7, merely to see the time, not to get up, and on looking at the shop clock, I cast my eye through the glass in the parlour door, and saw the back parlour window open, and the two back doors—I went to the front door, but could not see a policeman—I went up stairs and dressed myself—I had been awake about a quarter of an hour before I went down, but did not hear any noise, nor yet during the night—I waited about a quarter of an hour before the policeman came by—I did not even open the doors till he came, so that there should be nothing disturbed—I then found the chest was gone altogether—it was twenty-four inches square each way, across, depth, and length, and the chest itself weighed about 2 cwt. without the contents—I could not lift it myself—there are two back doors—they were both open—one leads from the bakehouse into the back yard, and the other closes the back yard up, and then there is a long yard, ninety feet long—the bakehouse has a window, that is never fastened—a person coming in at the bakehouse window might have opened the doors, and got into the back parlour—that was the way they came in, but not the way they went out—my people come in at the</p>

On Sunday morning, 25th April, I went to the prosecutor's house about 9 o'clock—I traced footmarks from the back part of the house across a large garden ground at the side of the fence to some new buildings leading into Grove-street—there were a great number of footsteps; the distance was from 150 to 200 yards—they were the marks of two persons, going towards the premises and returning from them—I traced them to the back gate of the prosecutor's premises—the ground be<lb></lb>tween there and the new buildings was garden ground, recently dug up—there was a fence on the western side of the field—the footsteps were in that direction, as if they had made, as well as they could, to the fence, and then kept under the shelter of the fence to the termination of it—the fence sepa<lb></lb>rated the garden ground from some ground which is intended to be built on—the footsteps went partly along the fence on the garden side—I was pre<lb></lb>sent, and assisted to draw this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is correct—the garden ground is here described as Mr. Lake's garden ground, and the fence and unfinished houses are there marked—there is a cart put down at a certain spot; I did not see a cart there, but I saw the tracks of a cart there—at the turning of the fence I observed a somewhat square mark on the ground, about eighteen inches by eleven or twelve inches, as if something very heavy had rested there, and six yards from there I saw marks of a cart's wheels—the space between the termination of the footmarks and where the cart stood was covered with lime rubbish—I traced the track of the cart wheel into Grove-street, and then into North-street, in a direction towards Bow-common-lane—as soon as I got into North-street I lost the track among a number of other cart tracks; it was then going in the direction of Bow-common-lane—I afterwards went with Huxtap, a constable, to the place where I first saw the track of the wheels, and he and I traced them again as far as orth-street—I afterwards went with him to Holmes's yard, in Bow-common-lane, and saw a cart there which he identified as the cart he had seen—I saw the name of "William Holmes, cow keeper, Bow-common-lane," on it; it is about a mile and a quarter from the unfinished houses, and nearly a mile from where I lost the track—I went to that yard in consequence of information from Huxtap—it is near the canal bridge—I think it is called <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Jonson's-bridge—it was about 10 on the Sunday morning, when I got there—I went again on the Monday morning, about 11, saw Holmes, and asked him if that was his cart, pointing to it—he said it was his cart—I said, "Did you lend it to anybody yesterday morning?"—he said he had neither lent it or let it—I said, "Where was it at 6 yesterday morning?"—he said, "Where it is now"—I said I should be able to prove to the contrary; I do not think he made any reply to that—I told him I was a sergeant of police, and that there had been a heavy robbery committed, and that the stolen property was conveyed away in his cart, and unless he could give me a more satisfactory</p>

               <p>account of it than that, I should take him into custody—he said if the cart was out it was without his knowledge; it might have been taken out and brought back again without his knowledge, as the gates were not fastened—I said, "What time did you get up to milk, yesterday morning?"—he said, "Six o'clock"—I said, "What time did you go out?"—he said, "Seven"—I then said, "If the cart was as you say, it would be impossible for you to come out as you did without seeing whether the cart was there or no; you must have passed within two feet of the shafts of the cart," and I said, "If the cart was taken out without your knowledge, it would be impossible for it to be put back without your knowledge"—there are gates to the yard, and the cart was opposite the gates at the further end of the yard—a person coming out at the back, door, and going to the barn where the cows were, would have to pass within two feet of the shafts, unless he tried to avoid it—I then took him to the station—we went through North-street, and I pointed out the tracks of the wheels to him; he said he knew nothing about it—he was examined next day before Mr. Yardley, and remanded—after he was remanded he sent for me, and said, "I am very sorry for the lies I told you, I feel myself in a very awkward position; I will tell you the truth: I did lend the cart to <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Jacobs; Jacobs and another man came to me about 5 yesterday morning, and asked me to lend them a horse and cart, as they wanted to go out for a ride; I told them I had not a horse; they asked me if I would lend them a cart, and they would get a horse"—he said Jacobs returned with the cart at a quarter before 7, without any horse—he said they took the cart away, and he did not know the other man—I have known Jacobs some years; he is known as <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Jacobs—on the Monday evening I met Jacobs in Northampton-street, in the custody of sergeant Smith—I asked him if he knew a person of the name of Holmes, a cowkeeper, in Bow-common-lane—he said, "No"—I said, "Did you borrow a cart of him yes<lb></lb>terday morning?"—he said, "No"—I said, "He is in custody, and he says you did"—he said he knew nothing about it—after the charge was taken at the station, and he was about to be locked up, he said, "Where is Holmes? can I see him?"—I said, "No, you cannot; for he is either in the van or about to start"—I knew Woolnough when he worked for Mr. Humphries—on the night of Sunday, 26th, I was watching his house and saw him go in—I had previously been to the door and inquired—on Monday evening I went to the house and searched it—I found it in a very destitute state, and his wife assured me I should find nothing there—there was no food in the cupboard; there were chairs to sit on—by "destitute," I mean without food—I afterwards saw Woolnough in Puddifoot's custody on Bow-common—on Monday, about 7, I asked him how he accounted for the money he had in his possession, his family being in such a destitute state (the constable who had taken him had found money on him)—he said he had saved it while in Mr. Humphries' employ—I asked him when he was in Poplar last; he said, "Last Saturday"—when I examined Holmes's cart, there was a <hi rend="italic">dent</hi> on the top rail as if something heavy had been placed on it, and about an inch and a half below that there was a piece chipped off the panel about an inch and a half long, and from that there was a graze as if something heavy or sharp, or the corner of something, had grazed down to the bottom of the cart; that was in the front of the cart, inside, down into the body of the cart—in my judgment, the corner of the iron chest described was a very likely thing to have caused that graze.</p>

               <p>part at the bottom of the cart; I do not think that anything two feet square could be under it; the front of the cart was not two feet high, it was a very small spring cart—I did not look very particularly into the cart; the name on it was "William Holmes, cowkeeper, Bow-common-lane"—I did not write it down—I afterwards saw that cart in the prisoner Holmes' yard in Hams's pre<lb></lb>sence—I also saw a third man—when I first saw him he was coming from the back of the unfinished houses; he was going from me, and was about fifty or sixty yards off—I did not see his face, he was about the same height and size as Holmes—I observed that he had on a fustian jacket, and fustian trowsers, and the trowsers were rather lighter than the jacket—I have not since seen Holmes dressed in such a dress—I noticed that the man walked rather lame with one of his feet, he had a peculiarity of throwing his left foot out as it were, as he walked—I afterwards noticed Holmes as he was going to the station, and I saw that he threw one of his feet out, and walked a little lame, and it was then my impression, and not till then, that he was the man, and I still think so.</p>

On Monday evening, 26th April, I went to the shop kept by Jacobs, at the corner of Hinton-street, Bethnal-green—it is a general shop—a leaving shop, where people go and leave articles instead of at a pawnbroker's—you see bundles all round as you would at a pawnbroker's—people leave their bundles in pledge for a day or a week, and have food or money—it is what is commonly called a <hi rend="italic">"Dolly shop"</hi>—Jacobs was called down stairs, and I told him that a robbery had been committed in Poplar, to the extent of 215<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that two men were seen there who I believed could be identified—he said, "Where do you want me to go to"—I said, "I don't know, either to Poplar or Stepney"—some little time afterwards he said, "Has any one been taken for it?"—I said, "I believe a man of the name of Holmes has been taken this morning"—I then went with him to the station—he was told the charge by the sergeant taking it, and made no answer—I afterwards took off his shoes, and went to a garden that was pointed out to me, at the rear of the prosecutor's house—Hams, Puddifoot, the prosecutor, and a man named Lake, who the garden belongs to, were with me at the time—I compared the shoes with some footmarks, which I saw there—I first put the shoe beside the mark, and finding as I went on a very great many, I dropped the shoes into the holes, and they fitted exactly—some of them were very deep—the mark which the shoe made by the side of the original impression resembled it in every particular—the shoes are quite plain—there are no nails or anything peculiar about them—I compared both the shoes—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there were a very great many marks, the whole distance of the garden—I could see nothing peculiar in the impressions—the ground was quite dry—it had been recently dug up—there was no mark corresponding with these nails in the heel—they would not make any impression, nor was there anything corresponding with this broken mark—that did not make any mark on the ground that I observed—I do not know that I ever compared foot marks before—I thought the</p>

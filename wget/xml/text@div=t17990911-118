               <p>MARY FAIRFAX sworn. - Examined by Mr. Cullen. Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming to the shop of Mrs. Oliver, in Fleet-street, in August last? - A. Yes; it is a kind of a toy-shop and silversmith's-shop; a lady came in to buy a pair of scissars, they came to one shilling and sixpence, and she put down a guinea; I went to Mrs. Else's to get change, I got a half-guinea, a seven-shilling-piece, a half-crown, and one shilling; I laid down the half-guinea before her, and it rung very well at first, but when she rung it again, it rung like a farthing; a constable was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the bad half-guinea? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mrs. ELSE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live in Fleet-street: I gave the last witness change for a guinea, I gave her a half guinea, a seven-shilling-piece, and some silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the half-guinea was a good one? - A. Yes, all the money was good; the half-guinea was brought back to me as a bad one; I went back with it, and said it was not the half-guinea I had given, and gave charge of the prisoner to a constable.</p>

             sworn. - I went to Mrs. Oliver's with Mrs. Else: I knew the prisoner before; I said, in the hearing of the prisoner, I can account very well how the half-guinea is changed, I have detected this lady twice in the same thing; she said, me, Sir; and I said, yes; and I told her if she did not give me the half-guinea immediately I would send for a constable; I accordingly sent for a constable, and when he came, I saw the good half-guinea, and the bad one was gone; it was an old half-guinea in the place of the new counterfeit; I did not see it changed.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Cullen. I am a constable: I searched the prisoner; when I was called in, the prisoner at the bar put down a good half-guinea; Mrs. Else said, there was a bad one somewhere, which I could not find, but she gave it me afterwards; it was concealed in her mouth. (Produces the two half-guineas, and the silver).(Mr. Caleb-Valentine Powell proved the half-guinea to be counterfeit).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The young woman brought me change, I did not much like the half-guinea; I refused it, and they carried it back, and the gentlewoman said she did not send that half-guinea.</p>

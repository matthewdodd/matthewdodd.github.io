            . On Sunday night, the 15th of February, I met the prisoner in Bunhill-row; she asked me to go home with her; I said I wanted no connexion with her - she took hold of me by the collar, and dragged me into a house in <placeName id="t18290409-206-crimeloc1174">Draper's-buildings</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say at the office that you had a cut in your head, and was very much intoxicated? A. I was intoxicated, and was sick with their knocking me about; I did tell the officer I had had a cut in my head -I offered to stop the charge, because I was afraid of losing my place.</p>

            . I am a watch-house-keeper. I took the prisoner between one and two o'clock in the morning; I took half a crown and 5s. from her hand - she held it tight; the prosecutor wanted to make it up - he had been drinking, but not much; he offered me money to let the charge go - he said there was a half-crown and some shillings; he did not know 
exactly what, and that his master always marked the money.</p>


               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me the money to sleep with him, and then when he was sick he got better; he asked for it back again, and I would not give it to him - he said he would swear a robbery against me.</p>

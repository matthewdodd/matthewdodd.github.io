                  </hi>. I keep a shop in Gray's-inn-lane, and make drawing-instruments. On the 31st of July, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the back of my passage, which is in a line with my street-door—I saw the prisoner leaving the shop by the street door—I was suspicious, and looked round the shop—I missed three drawing-pens which were in an unfinished state, and had been placed on a small ledge within the counter—I went to the shop-door, but the prisoner was out of sight—in about two hours an officer brought the prisoner past my shop—there was a pawnbroker's lad with him, who produced one pen, and asked me if it was one I had lost—I said yes—I then asked the prisoner about the other two—he said, "What other two?"—I said, "You took three off there (pointing where they had been)—he said he had not been in the shop—he was taken to the station, and these other two pens found in the sleeve of his coat—I can swear to them.</p>

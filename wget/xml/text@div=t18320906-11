            . I am a Policeman. On the 27th of July, about nine o'clock at night, I was on duty at Old Brentford, and saw the prisoner several times from that to twelve, and from twelve to half-past twelve - I saw him with other bad characters, and in a different coat to what he were before; I followed them up the town, then returned, and told my inspector, and asked if he would allow me to follow them, but he would not, and exactly at three, I saw him and the same men return again; they went by me, and I saw the prisoner had something inside his coat - I collared him, and asked what he had got; he said nothing belonging to me - I took him to the station-house, searched him there, and found the veal part in his pockets, and part in his hat in a towel; he was about two miles from the prosecutor's house.</p>

            . I live in the parish of Isleworth, about a mile and a half from Brentford - it is my dwelling-house - I went to bed about eleven o'clock, and saw every thing secure; I got up at six o'clock in the morning of the 28th, and found a pane of glass taken out of my window, and the window opened; they had got in, and cut a calf from top to bottom - they had opened the door, and gone out there; I am not a butcher - this was a calf of my own fatting; I missed about 16 lbs. of veal; they had hacked and cut from every joint; I missed a towel; I am quite sure I shut the window, and fastened it myself the night before - this is the towel; the veal is not here - it corresponded exactly with mine.</p>

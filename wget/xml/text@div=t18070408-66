               <p>Q. Upon looking into her box did you see these three articles. - A. Yes, she asked me if I would forgive her, as I had the articles back. I refused to do that; I said I must appeal to the laws of my country.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to live with this gentleman; I wrote a letter to a friend the place did not suit me; he opened my letter. I had no box in his house; I know nothing at all of these things.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is true she had no box, it was her mistresses' box which she had lent her; I found the things in that box with her wearing apparel.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you know whether at the time the box was delivered to her, there was any thing in the box. - A. That I cannot swear to; the box was delivered to her by Mrs. Stoddart.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Previous to this robbery, had there been any elephants teeth in their warehouse - A. Yes, that had been allotted for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of the 15th of March, did you secure the warehouse - A. Yes, between three and four in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How early in the morning did you hear of the warehouse being broken open - A. About half past seven in the morning; when I went into the warehouse I found a light coming through a hole in the door, there was a bit of paper stuck over the hole, it did not totally exclude the light coming in; it was not on the door the day before; when the hole was made, a person could put his arm in, and undo the bar of the door; I missed nine elephants teeth when I got in in the morning; it was day-light then.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it - A. Wednesday evening I fastened the door; on Thursday morning I discovered the elephants teeth had been stolen.</p>

            . I am an ivory-turner, No. 30,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050030"></xptr>Houndsditch. In the month of March last, the prisoner came to my shop on Saturday morning, I think the 18th; it is three weeks ago to-morrow. About a quarter past eight in the morning, he came and asked whether I would buy any ivory. I told him I could not tell, if I saw it I could tell. He said, there were nine elephant's teeth, about an 100 lb. I asked him whether I could see them. He seemed to intimate, that I might see them; he said they were cut in pieces, they had been smuggled, and that was done for the convenience of getting them on shore. I believe that is the substance of what passed in the morning. He left me; I then wrote a note, and sent it to Mr. Sinclair by my boy. In the afternoon of that Saturday he called again; he called again on Tuesday afternoon, and brought this piece of ivory with him, it was in a bag, or in a canvas wrapper wrapped round it; it was tied with a string, this is the piece, I have had it ever since. He said here is a piece of stuff; I said I should like to see the whole. He said he could let me see the whole, if I bought this piece and paid him for it, he would bring me another piece, until I had got the whole. He put down the particulars on a piece of paper in my shop; the weight of the four teeth, two hundred and six pound. He asked three shillings a pound for this piece, if I was to buy it; the weight of this piece is about thirty pound. I told him I had a suspicion it was stolen. I said I must detain it; he said I had used him very ill, and I had brought him into a dilimma. I said public justice was of more importance to me than buying a piece of stuff under price. I have known him fourteen or fifteen years, I entertained a better opinion of him: I had no idea of his being a thief; I said Messrs. Sinclairs wished to find out the person that broke open the house; if he would disclose that, they might make him an evidence.</p>

            . I am a commercial broker. I lotted these elephant's teeth for Messrs. Sinclairs; the allotment was on the Saturday preceeding the loss.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember making any particular observation of teeth upon lot 6 - A. Yes, one tooth in lot 6 had been originally in lot 3; and upon examination I put it into lot 6; there was a blemish in the tooth that would depreciate the value of the other teeth.</p>
               <p>Q. Take that tooth into your hand; do you believe that tooth to have been in lot 3, and was put into lot 6 - A. I do; there is a blemish in it, that is the tooth that was in lot 6, and had been in lot 3.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I called on Mr. Harwood with this piece of an elephant's tooth; I asked him three shillings a pound for it; he detained it, and said he had suspicion it had been stolen. I had called upon him before; I said I was sorry he had brought me into trouble. I told him I could take it to the man I bought it of.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

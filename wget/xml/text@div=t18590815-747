                  </hi>. I am a silk dyer, and live in Hackney-road—on the night of 25th July I was at the Black Swan public-house, Spitalfields, between eleven and twelve o'clock—I heard a noise and came out of the house and crossed the road to see what was the matter—the prisoner made a rush at me, and I did the best I could to defend myself—he hit me a blow and knocked me on the ground, and when on the ground he stabbed me; I got seven cuts—after he stabbed me he ran away—I had not given him any provocation whatever—I was taken to a surgeon—I was two weeks suffering from my wounds.</p>

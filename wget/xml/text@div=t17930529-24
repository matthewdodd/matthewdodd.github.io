               <p>I lost a watch and seals the 1st of May; the inside case gilt and the outside covered with tortoiseshell; I was in <placeName id="t17930529-24-crimeloc129">Covent-garden</placeName>

               <p>- STIRLING sworn.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Moore came into my house I heard him say that he had lost his money, and feeling about his breeches, says he, and I have lost my watch; when I came into the room the post boy that drove the chaise was in the parlour with Mr. Moore, and this man at the bar; I went to look at the chaise to see if I could find either money or watch, nothing was found there at all; the post boy followed out of the parlour to the chaise, and I said to him, you stop, for it will be necessary for you to clear yourself as well as the man; instead of which he immediately put the steps of the chaise up, shut to the door, mounted his horse and drove off as hard as he could; I then came into the parlour and searched Mr. Moore first, and I found in his pocket only eighteen pence and three-pence halfpenny, that was all the money he had, the watch he had not, and then I searched the prisoner, and found three shillings or three shillings and sixpence, I found nothing else in his pockets, but between the flesh of his thigh and his breeches there I felt the watch, and I desired him to give it me out, which he did. (The watch produced and deposed to by Mr. Moore.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was out of place, and I was told of one at Maidenhead, and I went down, and when I came to enquire for it, it did not suit them to keep any other than that they had got; I saw a chaise at the Sun, at Maidenhead; the chaise belonged to Slough, I was going to speak to the boy, I was going into the yard, and the gentleman asked me if I belonged to the chaise? I told him, no; says he, call the boy that belongs to it; I went into the yard and I saw the boy speak to him, and the boy and the gentleman came out, and what the agreement was I don't know, but the gentleman told him to give me a glass of liquor I went in and had it, it was a glass of rum; afterwards the boy and I had another, the gentleman told us to have it, the gentleman got into the chaise, and I was going to get on the box of the chaise, and he desired me to get inside; we came to Slough, and the same chaise went on with a pair of fresh horses; the gentleman told me to put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290044"></xptr>on his great coat, and I picked up this watch in the bottom of the chaise; whether it belonged to this gentleman or any other I did not know, therefore I was willing to keep it till it was advertised, or I was recompenced for it.</p>
               <p>Court. You heard the gentleman talk about losing his watch? - No, not till we got to the Hotel, the gentleman then said he lost a gold watch, and this was a watch in a green case, and whether it did belong to him or no I did not know.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You say you was a good deal in liquor? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain you did not drop the watch at the bottom of the chaise? - I am pretty confident I did not; I am not quite.</p>

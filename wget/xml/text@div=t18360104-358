                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live a Chobham, in Surrey. On Wednesday, the 23rd of December, at three o'clock in the morning, I was at Covent-garden, selling holly—the prisoner purchase six bundles—they came to half a crown—he gave me a half-crown, and went away with the holly—I took notice or the half-crown directly—I had not mixed it with other money—while I was looking at it, Dawes the porter came up—he said, "That is bad"—we went after the prisoner, and took him—I gave the same half-crown to the porter—I was not very near when the prisoner talked to Dawes about it—he said he did not deny but that it was a bad one—I had two good half-crowns, but I did not mix this with them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter a Covent-garden. On the 23rd of December, Giles gave me a counterfeit half-crown—I asked whom he took it of—he said, "Of a man, for six bundles of holly, and he is gone that way"—I said, "Come with me"—I took the prisoner by the collar—I said, "what do you mean by this, giving my master bad money?"—he said, "I know that I gave him a bad one, here is a good one for it"—I said, "I will not let you go, I know you must have some more," and while I was taking him over to a policeman, he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> some money into his mouth—I tried to get it from him, but he swallowed it—when the po<lb></lb>liceman got him to the Piazza, against the Tavistock Hotel, he kicked me on the ancle—I knocked him down, and tried to get the money from him, but I could not, he swallowed it—the counterfeit half-crown, and the good half-crown which the prisoner gave me, I gave to the policeman—two base half-crowns dropped from him, which the policeman picked up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I said I gave him a half-crown, and was not aware it was a bad one; but I said, "Here is another for it." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You said you gave him a bad one.</p>

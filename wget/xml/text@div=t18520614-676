                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, R</hi> 38). On 23rd May I went to Mr. Larkan's—I spoke to this prisoner, and told her she was suspected of robbing her master of tea and sugar—she said, "I have not robbed my master; I have done nothing of the sort; I have not seen any tea or sugar"—I told her she must be searched; she must turn out her pockets—she immediately went behind the screen, and was fumbling by the side of her dress—I told her to take her hand away, which she did, and I took from her pocket this piece of lump sugar, six ounces—I said, "You have something else;" and she pulled up her dress, and in another pocket were these two parcels of tea—she said she was very sorry she had taken it, and she hoped her master would forgive her—I took her to the station, and when there she gave me a key—she said it was the key of her box, in her room—I asked where she lived—she said, "With Mrs. Birch, in the back room up stairs"—I went there, and found a box, which I unlocked with this key—I found it contained, amongst other things, this jar full of sugar; this pint pot, containing a dozen metal tea<lb></lb>spoons; two German silver table spoons, and eight knives and forks, of the same pattern, and the same name on them, as the others were—I went back to the station, and told her what I had found—she then said the box did not belong to her; it belonged to an old woman.</p>

I was present when this prisoner was accused—she was employed by me for charring—after she had her pockets turned out, she begged of me to forgive her—she said she was very sorry, and would not do it again—these table spoons have a private mark on them—I had seen this mark—I am satisfied they are my spoons—these other</p>

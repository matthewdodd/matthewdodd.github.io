               <p>Q. Where had you parted with her? - A. In the fields; I went towards the Wells, I missed it before I got more than two or three yards from her; I missed a seven-shilling piece, a silver pen, a pencase, and a pair of nut-crackers; they were all in my jacket-pocket; I then laid hold of her; I told her she had got my property; she said, she knew nothing of it; she found I would not let go of her, and called another woman to her, pretending to give the woman a penny to setch a penny candle; I did not see what she gave her, but I suspected she handed my property to her; I gave charge of her to the patrole, and took her to Pentonville watch-house; the other woman got away; the prisoner was searched, but nothing found.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you usually carry seven-shilling pieces in your jacket-pocket? - A. I had put it in my pencase to prevent my losing it.</p>

             sworn. - I am patrole of the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell, that part of the parish called Petonville; the prisoner was brought to me by another patrole; I took her and the prosecutor both to the watch-house; I asked him what he had to alledge against her; he told me, he had been connected with her in the fields at the back of Sadler's-Wells, and she had robbed him of a seven-shilling piece, a silver pen, a brass ink-stand, and iron nut-crackers; I searched her, but found nothing upon but a bad seven-shilling piece, that she said she had had ever since the 24th of June.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mann.) The seven-shilling piece that you lost was a good one? - A. Yes.</p>

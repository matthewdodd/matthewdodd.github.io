                  </hi>. I am gardener to Mr. William Farrell, of Isleworth—I have been lately receiving a large quantity of bricks from Mr. Westbrook; the prisoner's horses and carts were employed to draw them—on 21st Jan.,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301310020"></xptr>
               <p>between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning, in consequence of suspicions, I counted a cart load of bricks in the presence of the driver—there ought to have been 500—it contained 408 within a brick or two; I cannot say for certain—I sent for the master of the brickfield, and then informed Mr. Farrell—I do not know who the prisoner was employed by—I believe the number of bricks to be carted altogether was 230,000—it was my duty to receive the bricks and give receipts for them—there were five carts, but I counted no other load but this—I never saw the prisoner on the premises until 22nd Jan.</p>

                  </hi> How do you know that the prisoner was employed to cart the bricks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because the tickets were signed in his name—I did not employ him, nor was I present at the time of his employment—I do not know his writing—the other people that were employed were Fielder, Birchett, and Gilbert; they are not here, they have carted a great many bricks—I did not notice whether the prisoner's name was on the cart which contained the 408 bricks, but his men were with it.</p>

                  </hi>. On 21st Jan., I drove a cartload of bricks to Mr. Farrell's—I do not know the man's name who loaded them, they were taken out of the field in a cart—on our way to Mr. Farrell's we stopped at Lampton, because my horse got knocked up—that is where the prisoner lives (it is about four miles from Mr. Westbrook's to Mr. Farrell's); the bricks remained at the prisoner's all night, and we drove them on in the morning—I do not know anything of any bricks on the prisoner's premises at Lampton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know how it was that there were 100 bricks short? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were on the biggest horse's cart, we took them off the other cart and put them on there, as near as we could guess; and if the gardener had counted those in the other two carts he would have found that the bricks were all right—I said that before the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

On the 2d of September, the prisoner came and asked if we wanted an errand lad - he staid about five minutes; as soon as he was gone I missed a small parcel from the counter, which contained these articles. I had seen them safe half an hour before. I saw them afterwards in the possession of the constable.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you know any thing of him before? A. No; I spoke to him while he was in the shop, but did not see him take any thing from the counter; he might have taken them while I was taking my tea in the back office - I did not see him come in.</p>

            . I live in Chandos-street. The prisoner came to my house on the 5th of September - he offered these articles for sale - they were wrapped up in a brown paper - he said he had found them - I detained him; he afterwards told the officer that a young man left them with him, and borrowed half a crown on them, and said if he did not fetch them by Monday he might sell them.</p>

               <p>DAVID DAWES re-examined. Q. Is it usual to be in the office when you are left in charge of the shop? A. The porter generally attends the shop, but he was gone to take his tea in the back part of the shop; a person might have come in without his seeing them - he had been there about a quarter of an hour.</p>

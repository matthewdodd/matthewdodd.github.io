                  </hi>. I am a painter and undertaker, of Newington-causeway. On the morning of 5th June I met a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> coming across the London-road—on the back of it was a paper, "For sale"—I saw Fenton and Collins drawing the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, I had seen them before—I informed the policeman—I went after Collins.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 167). I met Fox, and from what he told me I went into West-square, and saw Fenton—he said, "You b----r, if you come near me I will serve you out"—I followed him to Union-street, and saw him go into the passage of No. 3—he was taken in a water-closet near there.(George Nowland, a hawker, gave Collins a good character.)</p>

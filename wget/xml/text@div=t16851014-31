            </rs>. The Evidence for the King deposed, that the Quarrel at first was occasioned between the Prisoner and one Cook, which Cook the said Prisoner drew upon, making at him divers Blows, Cook returning them with his Cane. Hickes coming in at the instant, enquiring the occasion, the Prisoner alighting from his Horse, made a Pass, and run Hickes into the Hip; of which Wound in a quarter of an Hour he died. The Prisoners Defence in his behalf was, That Mr. Cook made many Blows at the Prisoner before he returned any Blows, and at length drew his Scimiter in his own defence, crying, What, will you knock me from my Horse? When presently divers coming in with drawn Swords, as they were together Hickes was seen to drop of the aforesaid Wound. Two Chirurgeons probing the Wound, gave their Judgments, that the Wound was given by the Prisoner's Scimiter, being exactly of the Dimention of the said Scimiter; but a third Chirurgeon likewise probing the Wound, gave his Judgment the Wound was given by a Rapier, it being triangular, and that he saw a Rapier bloody which was found by the Wounded Hickes; which two more were of Opinion the Wound was given by a Rapier, as appear'd by an Impression made through the Breeches which the wounded Hickes then wore; but an honourable Gentleman, a Justice of Peace (who with other Justices had took the Examination of the Chirurgeon who gave his Judgment, the Wound was given by the Rapier) deposed, That the said Chirurgeon before him said, he did verily believe the Wound was given by the Scimiter. The Prisoner brought divers to attest his Reputation and civil Demeanour; and was thereupon brought in <rs id="t16851014-31-verdict152" type="verdictDescription">

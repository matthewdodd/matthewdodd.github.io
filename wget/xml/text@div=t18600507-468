I am the son of Mrs. Samuels, of 30, Gloucester-place—I live at Montley Bank, in Cheshire—On Thursday, 15th March, I was at my mother's house—the prisoner was her servant, on trial—I discharged him on the evening of the loth, with my mother's concurrence—in consequence of his behaviour to me, I ordered him to leave the room—Matthews, the butler, was present—the prisoner was very violent, and used excessively violent language to me—I turned him out at the street-door—he said, "I will do for Matthews"—he used very violent language, both to me and to the butler—in consequence of his saying that about the butler I turned him out—he kept on ringing and knocking at the door—I told him if he did not leave off knocking, I would send for the police—I did so, and gave him in charger—he ran away as hard as he could—the policeman caught him—the next day he was brought up and fined.</p>

On 27th March, I was on duty, in plain clothes, in the neighbourhood of Gloucester-place—between 8 and 9 in the evening, I saw the prisoner standing with his right shoulder against the area rails, at the corner of Gloucester-place and Crawford-street; that is three clear houses from Mrs. Samuels' house—he remained a quarter of an hour walking to and fro—he was on the opposite side to the house—he did not pass it that night—the nearest he went to it, that night, was within three doors—on 29th, two nights after that, I again saw him in Gloucester-place—the first night he had a carpet-bag doubled up under his left arm—it appeared to me to be quite empty—I saw him on 29th, at twenty minutes to 9, standing opposite the house—I saw him remain there about ten minutes, or rather more—I went away to send another constable that was with me to watch him—he lost sight of him after a few minutes.</p>

I supjiose—on 30th March, at half-past 6 in the morning, 1 fancied I heard the door go; at 7 o'clock I heard the water-closet door go again, when the milk came; at a quarter-past 7 I went to the door and said, "Who's there I" there was no answer—I forced the door open, and there I saw the prisoner with this mask (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on his face, and this pistol (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hand, within a foot of my face—he said, "I will blow your brains out"—I gave one rush, seized him by the throat with my right hand, caught hold of his right arm, which he had the pistol by, got him down on the seat of the closet and pulled the mask off with my teeth, my hands being engaged holding him—there was a carpet-bag on the floor of the closet; seeing him with that, I said, "You villain, are you come for some more of my plate?"—he said, "I am not come for any plate; I only want to shoot you"—I said, u Drop the pistol, sir"—he said, "I will shoot you in the leg"—he was at that time holding the pistol downwards towards the ground, as my hand pressed his hand down—my hand was on his wrist—he said, "If you leave go of my hand, I will give you the pistol"—I did not leave go—I was there about eight minutes in the closet with him, by myself—I called fur assistance—some labourers opposite, I cannot say exactly who, went for the police—a, policeman came up, and I gave him in charge—that was the end of our interview—there were two occasions when he had the pistol pointed at me—he had his finger on the trigger—it was half-cocked—I could see the cap shine—his finger was the same as mine is now—I cannot say exactly whether he pressed it at all—he had his finger on the trigger, like this, when I seized him at the door, and he never altered it from the first—I did not observe any motion of the finger—he said to the constable, when I gave him in charge, that he intended to do for me—the water-closet is underneath the area steps, in front of the door that leads to the plate closet—there is a bed-room adjoining, in which I and the footman slept.</p>

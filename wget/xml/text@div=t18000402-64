            , the inspector of two boiling-houses on the spot, that I got intelligence of the horse, he is here; I do positively, in the face of this honourable Court, swear the hide and the legs are mine; I bred the horse, he was foaled upon my premises; he was six years old this grass, he had a blaze that was rather wide, it came down to a very narrow point within a small distance of the bottom of the note; three of the legs were remarkable, the off leg behind had a remarkable crease in the front of his foot, which proved what is called a gravy heel; there were a number of lumps upon the front of the foot, close to the hoof; he had had a fever which had contracted each fore foot with the pain, as it was represented by the farrier, and his hoof had got very long in consequence of it; I am more particular to the other two marks than to the white heel.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was about a week after you lost the horse that you saw these legs and the hide? - A. A week to day.</p>
               <p>Q. A blaze on the forehead is no uncommon mark? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear to the legs? - A. Yes; if they had been among five hundred legs I could have picked them out.</p>

             sworn. - I bought the horse that I afterwards saw the hide of, of the prisoner, on the 25th of March, between eight and nine in the morning, I did not know him before; I met with him coming along the road close by where I live, at Kingsland, he was leading the horse, it was a black, lame, blind, stone-horse; I saw it was a crippled blind horse, and I thought it was only sit for killing; I asked him if he would fell it, Mr. Marsh gives me so much in the pound for all I can get him; I asked the prisoner if he would sell it; he said, yes; he asked me two guineas for it; I told him I would give him thirty-five shillings for it; when I was paying for it, I asked the prisoner where he brought it from; he told me from Mr. Oldfield's, at the Bell at Edmonton, he was leading it with a penny cord, it was not a proper halter; he said he had broke his halter being tied behind a load of bay; after I had paid him for it, he said, give me a note of your name to take home to my master, and then, says he, he will know where to find you, if you have not given the full value for it, and put one shilling spent at the bottom of the note; with that I did, and called for half a pint of anniseed with it; then he left me; I did not see him again till I took him on Wednesday last; he had a kind of a gravy heel on the fore part of his leg, and a white blaze down his forehead; I sold him to Mr. Marsh immediately, for two pounds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You sold it to Mr. Marsh for two pounds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell my Lord, just now, that he allowed you so much in the pound? - A. That is what I sold it for.</p>
               <p>Q. What business are you? - A. I keep carts and horses for moving goods and rubbish.</p>
               <p>Q.This horse was traced into your possession? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were charged with having stole the horse yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you fixed upon the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; and by the description I gave Mr. Ramsden, he knew the person; I was coming our<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020062"></xptr>of my yard after setting my people to work; it was about fifty or sixty yards from my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him to your house? - A. No; we went to a public-house, and there I wrote the note.</p>
               <p>Q.You did not ask him how he came by it till after you had paid him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had no suspicion, from seeing a cord instead of a halter? - A. No, he told such a good story; because if it was tied behind a load of bay, being lame, if it gave a snatch, it would break the halter.</p>

               <p>Q. How far do you live from Mr. Archer's? - A. Not quite half a mile; he asked me two pounds for it, he would not take less; I bought it of him; it staid all day in the yard for our inspector to see it; when he had seen it, I sent that and another black horse up to the slaughter-house; the inspector's name is Daniel Hartshorn; the next day, Wednesday, the horse was slaughtered; we always bring the hides from the slaughtering-house to the place where I live; the hide of this horse was brought down; I shewed it to Mr. Ramsden, and he claimed it; Mr. Ramsden had picked out the legs from among others before he saw the hide.</p>

On the 1st of April I went to the shed where they kill, and got intelligence that a person had been enquiring about such a horse; and I immediately went over to Mr. Ramsden: (reads his entry;) "March 25, 1800. A black stone-horse, six years old, fifteen hands high, blaze down his face, near heel behind white, long tail, from

               <p>Q.(To Ramsden.) Had you been at the slaughter-house before you saw Hartshorn? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Marsh. I was not in the way; when I came home at night, my man told me a person had been enquiring about a black blind stone-horse; and that he had said there was no such horse; I told him there were three, and immediately sent the inspector to enquire who this gentleman was that had been making the enquiry.</p>
               <p>Ramsden. The prisoner has been a labourer to me, and drove this horse at water-cart last summer for me; he lives within two hundred yards of my house; from the description Archer gave, I knew he was the man, and I apprehended him last Wednesday.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

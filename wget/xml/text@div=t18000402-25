               <p>Bell. A. Yes, but the cheese was found in Middlesex.</p>
               <p>Leicester. I heard the alarm that the cheese was gone; I pursued the man, but could not see him; I ran down Rosemary-lane, and met the prisoner coming up; I asked him if he had seen a man run that way, that was lame, with a cheese; I observed, at that time, that he was lame; he said he did not; he went to go away, and I said he must be the man; I asked him if he would tell me where it was; he said he could not; one Mr. Isaacs came up and told him to give the cheese up if he had the cheese, and if not he would send for a constable; he told Mr. Isaacs he would deliver the cheese up if they would not do any thing with him; I went with him to his lodgings in Rosemary-lane, and there we found the cheese; the prisoner said to a woman that was there, give the cheese up to them, and she did; Mr. Isaacs took the cheese to the Police-office.</p>

             sworn. - On the 15th of March last I was going through Rosemary-lane; I heard an alarm that the last witness had lost a cheese out of his cart; I afterwards saw the prisoner and the witness in Rosemary-lane; he said he had not got the cheese; I thought he looked very suspicious, as if he wanted to get away; I told him it would be better for him to give it up; I went with him to Mrs. Keese's house, she is here; she was the person that delivered the cheese; she denied, at first, that she had the cheese; I told her she had better deliver it up, or I would get an officer and search the house; accordingly she spoke to a girl, and told her to bring it out of the back-room, which she did; the prisoner was present at the time; I then took him before the Magistrates at Lambeth-street.</p>
               <p>MARY KEEFE sworn. - The prisoner knocked at my door; he had a cheese under his arm; and he asked me to weigh the cheese for him; I keep a rag-shop; I weighed the cheese for him, and he said, stop a bit; I did not see him when he went; but I missed him; and he left the cheese; then some people came, and demanded it; and upon my oath, I never denied having the cheese. (The cheese produced, and deposed to by Mr. Bell.)</p>

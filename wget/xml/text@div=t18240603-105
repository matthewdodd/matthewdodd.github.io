            . I am a constable - I was near the place on duty about half-past four o'clock, and saw the prisoner, with another boy, go behind Mr. Nash - they were there not more than two minutes; I then saw the prisoner's arm move, and suspected he had taken something; he went away, and had got about three yards from Mr. Nash when I caught him, and asked what he had got in his hand; he said nothing - I took his hand from under his apron and found this handkerchief; he was going to put it into his breeches; he said he had it from the other boy who was gone. I went to Mr. Nash, who claimed it.</p>

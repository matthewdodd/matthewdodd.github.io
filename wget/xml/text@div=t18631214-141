                  </hi>. I am a machinist, and live at Enfield lock—on 2d No<lb></lb>vember, I was at the Green Man beer shop about 9 o'clock, and saw the prisoner and three others sitting on the left-hand side of the taproom door I heard something drop under where the prisoner sat—Cooper, a policeman, called for a light, and examined the prisoner's seat, under which he picked up this pistol and gimlet—he was then charged with committing a burglary, at the Rev. Mr. Blake's, with three others—they all said they knew nothing about it—a rush was made to the door, and the prisoner and two others escaped—one was taken in custody—it was just before the rush that I heard these things drop.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you say that I rushed to the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; with a quart pot in your hand—you did not keep your seat when the others rushed to the door—you were the second man that rushed to the door, the tall man was the first—I stood close by the constable—there was a table on each side, and I stood between them—one table was behind me—I had my face towards you—you were sitting on the corner of the table behind the door—I saw the constable pick up the pistol; I stood close by him—I saw it in his hand the moment he picked it up—I saw him stoop down and bring it up in his hand from just under where you sat—there was about four feet between the two tables—the room is perhaps ten feet wide—there is a form right round it—the tables are not three feet wide—one may be two feet six, and the other less—the policeman did not crawl under the table, he reached between the table and the form.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer living near Chingford—I was at the Green Man on 2d November about 7 o'clock, and saw the prisoner and three others sitting there—Cooper and Kirby, the constables, came in, and said they should apprehend them for a burglary at the Rev. Mr. Blake's—Kirby spoke to a tall man named Butcher, and the prisoner got up and wanted to go out—Cooper said, "No, you shall not go out of here, give me the stick"—he said, "No; if you can take it from me you may"—I then heard some<lb></lb>thing drop down against the prisoner's feet, and saw Cooper pick it up—he said, "Look out, here is a pistol"—he also picked up a candle—the prisoner was standing on the left side of the door.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 420). On 2d December, about five minutes to 9, I went to the Green Man at Chingford—I saw Ashton—I went into the taproom—I saw the prisoner in company with three others—I heard Kirby tell them he should apprehend the four of them for a burglary at the Rev. Mr. Blake's—they said they knew nothing about it—he said, "I shall take you"—in a minute or two I heard something drop—I looked on the ground and picked up a candle wrapped up in paper—I asked for a candle, which was given to me, looked under the seat, picked up a pistol, and a gimlet between the prisoner's legs—they made a rush to the door, and the prisoner and two others escaped—one was apprehended—I picked up a dark lantern and a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> in the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> This happened on 2d November and you gave no evidence till 8th December. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> They merely took evidence enough to justify a remand, so that I was not examined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> None of the people could identify me. I was there two weeks before, and they said nothing. The policeman was not there when I was taken, but he came on 21st and gave evidence that was quite contrary to what they gave on 8th. They contradicted one another in everything they said. I never had the pistol in my possession—none of the witnesses say that they saw it in my possession, or saw me drop it. A candle on a table is not like gas which illuminates a room all over.</p>

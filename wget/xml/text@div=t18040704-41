               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner in your shop? - A. Not before Saturday, the 26th of May, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon; she came into the shop, and requested me to shew her some light printed cottons for a gown; in consequence of which, I took some printed cottons down, and the second that I took down was the piece I now hold in my hand; I shewed her four others afterwards, making in the whole six pieces; she offered me two shillings and nine-pence for one of them, which I could not take; having occasion to turn my back, she had an opportunity of secreting one of them under her cloak, she had a large red cloak on which hung down to her heels.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her do it? - A. No; she had a singular manner, which created a suspicion in my mind that she had some evil intention; she told me she should not take the gown away with her if she had bought it, but should leave sixpence in part till the evening; I told her I could not put a gown by for her, or any one else, upon such terms, that it was not customary for us so to do; she turned upon her heels, and, in a kind of shuffling ran towards the door, said there were plenty of people that would do it; I then looked among the pieces upon the counter, and missed this piece; she turned round the corner of Stanhope-street, I followed her into White-horse-yard; I desired her to come back with me, and she came back very willingly to the shop; she immediately put her arm under her cloak, and threw the piece of print on the counter before my face, I was close to her, and therefore there could be no mistake; she then went upon her knees, and said, for God Almighty's sake, or for the love of God, pray forgive me, I will never do so again; for the sake of my two children, for I am fatherless and motherless, and have nothing to depend upon but my labour.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A. Thirty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went in with intent to buy a gown, I never looked at more than one print, we did not agree, and I went away, and the gentleman came after me; I went back with him immediately, I am perfectly innocent.</p>
               <p>GUILTY, aged 18.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Perseverance-place, St. George's—the prisoner had been stopping with me some three weeks before this happened—he had stopped away two nights out of the three weeks—on the night of 31st January, about 10 o'clock, he came from his boarding-house door and followed behind me in the highway—he said, "Give me the scarf that is on your neck, I want it?"—I said, "I want it to get some tea with"—he said "No; I will give you some money to get some tea;" and said that if I would not give it to him he would rip my guts—he hit me several times, knocked me down, and kicked me—I called Margaret Gibbons, and asked her to go down the highway with me as I was frightened to go by myself he went across the road and asked me to go down to his boarding-house with him—we went as far as the door of it, when he said, "Come down that street?" but I would not—he said, "What do you want that woman in your company for?"—I said, "She is coming down the Highway along with me, a little bit"—I went into a public-house with him, and then me and Margaret were coming home together, to sleep together, and he followed us through Bluegate-fields, and hit me several times, and stabbed me—he had a knife in his hand and kept striking me with it, but said nothing—it was a small penknife which I used to use in cutting cotton or embroidery; he took it out of a work bag I had—after he had stabbed me several times on my head and arms he ran away, and the policeman caught him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It was a knife which I made her a present of, eight years ago; she wanted it back, and I would not give it to her; I was cutting up some hard tobacco with it, and I raised my fist to strike her, forgetting that the knife was in my hand, and that is how it happened: what she says it true, but it was not done intentionally. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He was not cutting tobacco.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Bluegate-fields, Shadwell—I was standing at the corner of Bluegate-fields when the prisoner went by with the prosecutrix—she said, "I want to speak to you," and said something to me which the prisoner did not hear—she and the prisoner afterwards went into a public-house and had a quartern of gin—the prisoner had a large sheath-knife, and I wished to take it from him; a man took it from him and said, "You do not want to commit murder in this neighbourhood"—he said, "No; but I am going to jump on board of my ship at 3 o'clock in the morning"—the knife was put behind the bar, and we left the public-house—I then said to the prisoner, "I wish you would leave our company"—he said, "No; I will not"—I told him that the prosecutrix was coming home to sleep with me, because she was in danger, and when we were in a dark place, near the church, he struck her several times, and she cried out to me, "Oh! I am stabbed"—she fell, and he ran away—I cried out "Police!" and he was apprehended—she had five very small stabs on her shoulder, which the doctor did not see at the station—they bled, and the doctor saw them afterwards.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">HARDY</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 483). On the night of 31st January, I was on duty in Bluegate-fields, and heard the last witness cry out "Murder," and "Police"—I ran to the spot, and saw the prosecutrix lying on the pavement and the prisoner running away—I ran over, took him, and said, "I want you for an assault"—he said, "All right, policeman, I will go with you; I have done it—he was not drunk—nothing was found on him—I looked about for a knife, but could not find one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon, of High-street, Shad<lb></lb>well—on the night of 31st January, I was called to the police-station, and saw the prosecutriz—I found a large, contusion on the top of her head, and an incised wound, two and a half inches long, extending to the bone, about an inch from the contusion, which had been done by a fall, and the wound by a stab—there was also a stab on her left thumb, and her face was swollen—I asked her if she had any other wounds, and she said "No;" but when she was undressed, I saw two or three stabs on her shoulder, and a large scratch as if it had been done with some pointed instrument—none of the wounds were severe—they were bleeding freely—either a small knife, or the small point of a large knife would inflict them—the wound on the head was not serious,—they are not, in that class of people, what we generally call danger<lb></lb>ous wounds—<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read as follows:</hi> "I was drinking all day.

I was just talking about going away next day. I was cutting up tobacco two or three feet behind them. I asked her if she was going home, she made some reply, and I hit her with the knife in my hand; it shut on my hand, and fell. If I had been in my right senses I would not have touched her at all.</p>

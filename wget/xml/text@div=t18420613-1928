The prisoner took a furnished apartment of mine? there was a man with her whom she represented as her husband, but he afterwards said he was not—that man has been acquitted—as well as I remember, the prisoner was at my house on the night of the 29th of May but she did not sleep there every night—when I let my room to them these articles were in it—the prisoner left on the 5th of June, and I missed a pair of sheets that day—I had not seen them from the time I let the room, which was on the 30th of April—I did not see the prisoner again till she was in custody, but she had called at my house in my absence.</p>

            . I am a basket maker, and live in Johnson's-court. I heard the cry of Stop thief! ran down stairs, and heard footsteps running towards Gough-square. I got into the square and the prisoner was stopped. He said I am no thief! I have plenty of money, without thieving. He put his hand in his pocket, and pulled out a handful of silver, and at that moment the prosecutor came up, and said</p>
               <p>"That is the man who robbed me of my watch."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking home, across the square, three or four ran by me, and one charged me with stealing a watch. I stopped immediately.</p>

             (Police-constable G 175). On the 20th of August I was sent for by Mr. Hawkins, and took the prisoner in his counting-house; Mr. Hawkins said, "William, I have every reason to suppose you have been robbing me;" he said, "I have not indeed, master;" Mr. Hawkins said, "If you have not been robbing me, you know I have been robbed; and perhaps you know who has been robbing me;" he said,"That's another thing;" I then took the prisoner into custody; I went with the serjeant to No. 58, Lower Whitecross-street - I did not find any thing then, but I saw the serjeant take from a box some duplicates in a paper; I afterwards searched the room again, and found this spike-borer, three sacks, a spade, and these two spoons - they were in the front room two pair.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you keep books? A. No; we buy and sell for ready money, and I sold them to the prisoner on a Sunday; on the Saturday following<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180091"></xptr>he came and bought another pair, and said these were too small for him, and he had pawned them for 8s.; he came backwards and forwards once or twice; I did not know his name - his wife came to me several times about a fortnight before the last Session; I attend without any interest; I wanted to identify the trousers at the office, but the attorney would not let me - he said he should want me in another place; these could not be made for the prosecutor - they are not large enough for him, he could not get them on; I cannot undertake to say that these stains of blood were on them, but they have my initials, which I put on them when I gave them out to the translator.</p>
               <p>MR. HAWKINS. I cut my finger about five months ago, and at that time I had these trousers on; I went to get my watch out and blooded my fob - this is the mark of it; I missed these trousers about the 11th of May - the prisoner was then in my service.</p>

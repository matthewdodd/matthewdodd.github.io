            . I now belong to the ship Tuscan. On the 4th of May the ship Mary, to which I then belonged, came into <placeName id="t18200517-63-crimeloc364">Pool, in the Pelican-tier</placeName>

I saw the prisoner on board another vessel; and having known him two years before, I asked him on board the Mary. While we were below at supper, he saw me wind my watch up and put it in the hammock; he sat with his back against the hammock. When supper was over, all hands were called to put a rope off deck; I went up first, the rest followed; the prisoner came up last. When the rope was put off deck, I put him ashore at King James's Stairs; and directly after landing him, I missed the watch from my hammock. I got Brown, an officer, and found the prisoner, about half past ten o'clock, in Parson's-street, and asked him for my watch; he said he had not got it. Brown collared him, and he instantly pulled it from his pocket, and gave it me.</p>

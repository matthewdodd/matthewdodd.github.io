               <p>it to be bad; she took it the same day for services rendered; there was nothing found on the prisoner to show that she was engaged in the pursuit of passing bad money; it may he said that she threw the stamps and half crown away, but she lost them; it is not likely that she would throw them away after paying for them; a person not being aware that she had got any bad money, might utter it without guilty knowledge; the Court is therefore reasonably called upon to give the prisoner the benefit of the doubt, as no case is made out as to the first being bad, or of her being possessed of the same.</p>

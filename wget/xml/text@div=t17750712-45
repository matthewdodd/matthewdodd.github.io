At nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and leaned upon my coat as it hung upon the pails, there were in my pocket, a key a pair of gloves, and a clasp knife. When I went to put my coat on, I could not find it; I was enquiring for the prisoner, as if I had seen him in the ground the night before; I saw him about twelve o'clock the next day, at Brompton, where I went with a constable in search of him; the constable took him into custody, and charged him with the coat; he denied being at the public house the evening before. The constable felt a key on the outside of his pocket, and pulled it out; the key has my master's name upon it, I found my gloves and knife with it; the prisoner told me, if I would not hurt him, he would tell me where the coat was; I told him, perhaps I might be favourable to him: I found the coat at Mr. Gees.</p>

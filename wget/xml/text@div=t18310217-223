            , JUN. I am thirteen years old. I was left at home by my mother one morning, two or three months ago; the prisoner came into the room we live in, and asked me to go to my aunt's to know if she had mixed the bread up - I went, and as I was coming back I met my little brother, whom she had sent out; she then sent me out again for some flour, and said the bread was too wet - my father was out, and my mother was at Tottenham.</p>

            . I am in the employ of a pawnbroker, in Ratcliff-highway. I have a sheet, pawned on the 30th of November, by the prisoner, in the name of Smith - she was in the habit of pawning at our shop by the name of Smith, New Gravel-lane, which is fifty or sixty yards from Tent-street.</p>

            . I know this sheet is my husband's; it was kept in a box under the bed - I missed it on the night I came home from Tottenham; I do not know the day - it was in November or December, I think in December; I had never given the prisoner, or any one else, permission to pawn it; she and her husband live on very bad terms.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Now, take care what you are saying, it affects the prisoner very much - are you quite sure you had not given her the sheet to pawn? A. Yes; we did owe some rent at that time - her husband has not excused it; we still owe about 12s. 6d.; we have two rooms there - we have never found the blanket; 1s. 6d. was lent on the sheet - when I went into the room to get it out of the box it was gone; I looked well about, and then I went into one of their rooms - I said, "Mrs. Manley, I have lost a sheet;" and she hooted out of another room,"Oh, you will find it again" - but I think she was in liquor; her husband then said, "That is all you get for going into their room when she was ill."</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you in the habit of drinking with her? A. No.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170128"></xptr>COURT. Q. Now, are you quite certain about the sheet? A. I am quite certain, if it were the last word I had to speak, that I never gave her the sheet to pawn - I frequently heard her husband say he could have her transported.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went to her one morning, and said I had an article in pawn, and I did not know how to get it out; she said, "I have nothing but a sheet;" she brought it to me wrapped up in her shawl, that the children might not see it. Witness. She never pawned any thing of mine, with my knowledge, but a footman, and then I sent my boy with her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean, upon the solemn oath you have taken, to say that you did not deliver that sheet to her to pawn? A. No, my Lord, I did not, if it were the last word I had to speak; that is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth - her husband came to the window while they were quarrelling, and said, "Mr. Kemmish, if you will fetch an officer I will tell you where your property is."</p>
               <p>JURY to DANIEL KEMMISH, SEN. Q. Where did the prisoner's husband produce the duplicate from? A. I was at work at the window and he said to me, "Mr. Kemmish fetch an officer, and I will discover to you your stolen property" I fetched an officer, and when I took him in the yard her husband gave me the duplicate.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean that when you fetched the officer you did not know who was the thief? A. No, my Lord; I made all the haste I could, for fear he should alter his mind - he was in a passion with his wife, and I was afraid he would not give me up the duplicate - I did not know he had a duplicate, but he said he would make a discovery to me, and I judged he had one - I knew my wife had sent the footman to pawn; it was pawned to get something for my family to eat - the prisoner offered her service to take it; I never heard from my wife that she gave her the sheet to pawn; I do not believe she did, for she was at Tottenham when it was stolen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to ask her for rent - she said she had no money; I said I wanted to fetch an article out, and she lent me this sheet - my husband used me ill, and he persuaded her to prosecute me; she had lent me 2s., and we quarrelled about it.</p>
               <p>LOUISA KEMMISH. If I was dying at this moment I know nothing of the sheet being pawned, nor did I lend it to her.</p>

I met the prosecutrix yesterday at the public-house over the way, and she told me she had lent the prisoner the sheet, but was afraid to tell her husband of it - she was so drunk she was obliged to be brought out of the house; I was there six hours with her - she said the money was spent in liquor between them.</p>

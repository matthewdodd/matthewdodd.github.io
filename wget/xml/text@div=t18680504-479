I live at 1, Norfolk Place, Greenwich—I am a private constable, in the employment of the prosecutor—he is a contractor for the sewers at Deptford and Greenwich—in consequence of information I received from the foreman Phillips, I went to some houses here being built in Queen Street, Deptford—they were in carcase—I saw three planks there belonging to the prosecutor, I believe—I asked the prisoner who brought them there—he said a bricklayer, who had been at work for him in the sewers—he did not say where—I sent the foreman to know if he could bring the bricklayer at once, to bring them face to face—after he had gone, the</p>

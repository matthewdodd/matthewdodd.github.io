                  </hi>. I live in Southampton-place, Euston-square, and am a pianoforte-maker. The prisoner was introduced to me in July, at a com<lb></lb>mission-agent—he told me he had got a customer at Brighton for a rosewood cottage-piano—I told him the price was 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he was to have 10 percent, commission; it was to be sold for ready money—I sent it down to Brighton on 18th Aug., and he said he would send me the money on the following Saturday—about a fortnight afterwards I received this letter from him—I have seen his writing, and know this to be his writing—(<hi rend="italic">This letter stated that the parties would not pay cash, and requested the witness to draw on the prisoner at three months</hi>)—I answered it the day I received it, and saw the prisoner next day—I told him I could not take his acceptance—I asked him where he had sold it; he would not tell me—I proposed to draw on the parties to whom he had sold it—he said it would make it very unpleasant to him—I saw him several times after that—I received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mrs. Miller—I had not heard the circumstance under which it had been sold till afterwards.</p>

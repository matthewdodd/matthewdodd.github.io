                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Myers, of Hounds-ditch—he lives next door to Mr. Hurley. On the 9th of November, I was down in the kitchen, at half-past six o'clock in the evening, and saw something rolled along the window—I looked up and saw two men undoing a bale of goods—the prisoner was one of them—I had a distinct view of him—I had occasion to be sent out, and I saw the prisoner take a bundle out of the bale—I went to Mr. Hurley's and gave information immediately—I believe some property was gone—I saw the prisoner again at the Mansion-house, and knew him to be the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Thomas Hurley, next door to Mr. Myers. Lidyear came'to me, about half-past six o'clock, and I saw the bale was cut open, and one piece taken out—I met Mr. Evans, and made inquiries of him—I went after the prisoner—he was standing resting himself—I saw him run away—I followed, and he was taken, but nothing was found on him—he was near enough to hear what I said to Evans—I said, "Did you see a man running with a piece of cloth?"—he said, "Yes, that is the man"—this is my master's cloth—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

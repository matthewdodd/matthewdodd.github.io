                  </hi>. I am twelve years old.

I looked in the till, and saw one shilling and no other; it was a bad one—I took it out and bit it, and pot it into my pocket—next day, the 13th, another boy came for a pennyworth of tobacco—he gave me a bad shilling—I kept it in my hand till I got to the door—I saw the prisoner standing—he ran off, and I pursued him—he ran down a court which is no thoroughfare, and I took hold of him—I said, "You have sent me a bad shilling"—he said he had not—I took him back, and William North was then outside my door, and he said, "That is the man that gave me the shilling"—I gave the prisoner to the police-man, and the two shillings.</p>

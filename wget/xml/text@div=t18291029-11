               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Did you see a basket there? A. A basket stood there; I do not know who it belonged to: Daniel had his face to the child, who was about a yard from them - he made a blow at the other, who reeled back against the child, who he could not see; Daniel has lost one eye - the carter could not see the child fall; her being knocked down was quite accidental.</p>

            . I am a boot-maker, and live in Paul-street, Finsbury. I was crossing, and saw the prisoner Daniel sparring with a shorter person, who either from a blow, or to avoid one, staggered against two children, one of whom fell, and the fore wheel went over her; they appeared to be sparring in anger - one was striking the other; the hind wheel also went over the child - there were seven or eight children looking at them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What reason had you to think they were in anger? A.They appeared so; a basket stood on the curb - I did not see any walnuts taken from it; I did not know that any blows were struck - they were holding up their hands, and the shorter one was retreating from the aim; Daniel struck a blow, but whether it hit the other I do not know.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Roberts. I was in Bishopsgate-street, and saw some apples in the road- the prisoner George picked them up, and asked Daniel how much they had lost; he said 3d., and that he had a basket of his, and he would have it - George said he should not; Daniel went to get a knife, to cut it from another it was fastened to - George went to push him down, and in the scuffle, George knocked two children down; one was taken to the surgeon's - Daniel tried to pick it up, before the second wheel went over it, but could not, he was so confused; he was attempting to strike George, who held up his hand to prevent the blow - but I cannot say he attempted to strike.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.He could not see the child? A. No; it was done in an instant.</p>

            . I am a painter. I was standing at the bottom of Sun-street, and saw some apples laying in the street; George picked them up, and dared Daniel to kick them down again - he said he would cut the string of his basket, and got a knife, but did not cut it; they seemed to be striking one another - I was about half a rod off, but could not see for the crowd; I saw Daniel raise up - two children were coming by; George knocked the child under the wheel - he did not see the child; he knocked it down with his back: it was thrown under the wheel by Daniel - I thought it appeared as if he was reaching after the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Reeves &amp; Turner, of 100, Chancery Lane, second-hand booksellers—I have known the prisoner one or two years—he has been in the habit of coming to my shop occasion<lb></lb>ally—I bought this book of him, it is hew and uncut—here is the entry in my book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in my own writing, but was not made at the time—it is the second volume of "Sickel's American Reports"—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—it Was previous to 17th October; my entry is dated the 17th—I would not have bought an odd volume of a stranger—my boy says that he was in the shop at the time—there were no labels pasted in it when I bought it—this is my label pasted in the corner—I have no doubt that was put in when it was sent to the Law Society to see whether they would buy it—I see a mark in the inside of the cover, there appears to have been a label there—the book was put on the shelf in the ordinary way, for sale—the Librarian of Gray's Inn called there and said something to me, in cones<lb></lb>quence of which I sent it to Stevens &amp; Sons—I do not know the date, but it must have been before the 11th December—the prisoner called on me between the 11th and 21st December, and said he had received a letter from the people down the street—I knew that he meant Stevens and Sons—he was very indignant, and said that I had no business to send the book to them, how could he tell he had sold it to me without he saw it—he had asked me where it was, and I told him it had gone back—I mentioned the name of it, the second volume of "Sickel's Reports."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> All I can say is that the book I bought was bought some time before 17th October, and I am only guided to that fact by the entry in this book—I knew the prisoner to be a reviewer and an author—it is not an uncommon thing for leading men when they have done with books to sell them—during the time I have known the prisoner he has been in the habit of buying and selling books at our place—I am a very small book buyer in the law department—I was here in another case last Session—I bought about thirty books, all odd volumes (<hi rend="italic">See</hi> "Reg <hi rend="italic">v</hi> Westall, "p.287)—I have a branch business in the Strand, managed by my partner; they buy odd volumes there also—I did not notice that there had been a book label inside at the time I bought the book—I have had a good many dealings in the six months since October—the conversation between me and the prisoner was in December, four months ago—it does not appear in writing from whom I bought this odd volume; I do not keep any book of that kind—in point of fact, save and except a question of memory, I have nothing to refer to as to whom I bought the book of—I took no memorandum of the conversation when the prisoner called on me—I think my boy was there—the prisoner was very indignant, but he did not deny selling it to me—he did not mention Stevens &amp; Sons, I did; he may have said "I have received an extraordinary letter from Messrs. Stevens," I don't know—he did not say what had become of it; he did not produce any letter—I have no doubt he asked me what the name of the book was; I do not remember what he said—he did not say that he had mislaid the letter, and wanted to know what the name of the book was—he said that he had called about a letter he had received from Stevens &amp; Sons, and asked me what the name of the book was—he had not the letter in his hand—I told him that the name was "Sickel's Reports, "2nd volume—it was then that he said to me "Where is the book 1"—I said that I had returned it—he said "You</p>

               <p>should not have gent it back, "but he did not add "while the matter was under enquiry"—I swear that, because it is not likely, as that would have been confessing that he stole the book—he said "Have you ascertained that I sold you any such book?"and I said "Yes, to the best of my belief I bought it of you"—he did not say "Then you are wrong in your belief;" he avoided an answer; if he had denied it I would have gone down to the Benchers of the Temple—I don't recollect what answer he made—I think he said something about going to Stevens &amp; Sons—I don't remember what I said to that—I said nothing about writing—I don't remember what I did say—I knew that the prisoner was a barrister and an author<lb></lb>after I had sent to Stevens &amp; Sons I looked at the Law List, and found that he had chambers at No.1, Mitre Court—I went there and found that he had chambers there, and that his letters were left there—if I remember right, the prisoner said before the Magistrate that he would not trouble his friends to bail him—I heard him say, that he could never mix in the society he had been formerly used to till this horrible charge had been cleared away from him—I make no entry at the time I buy a book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Some gentleman, I think, happened to be in the shop who knew the prisoner, and that is how I first knew his name—I chatted with him just as you might with a bookseller—I have been in business twenty<lb></lb>four yean—I have not the remotest doubt that I purchased the book of Mr. Weightman—I never bought any similar book of him—I gave evidence at the Police Court; the prisoner did not ask me any questions—on 17th October the book was entered by name, so that I know I had it in stock at that time—I am not able to say within what time before that I had pur<lb></lb>chased it, it might be a week or a month.</p>

I am in Reeves &amp; Turner's service—the pri<lb></lb>soner came there frequently; I did not know him by name at first, but afterwards I knew him as Mr. Weightman—this second volume of "Sickel's Reports" has Reeves &amp; Turner's label in the corner—I first saw it in Mr. Turner's hands on the day it was published; the prisoner and another gentleman were in the shop; I did not pay any attention to what passed, but the prisoner was trying to sell it, and Mr. Turner purchased it—I do not remember hearing the price named—the prisoner then went out—Mr. Turner took the book to the back of the shop, and I saw it on the table—I don't know that I did anything with it that day, but next day I took it up and looked at it—I don't know how long it remained there, but I remember it going to the Law Society—labels are sometimes put in by me, and sometimes by Mr. Turner—this writing on the back, "Sickel's Reports," is Mr. Turner's—I remember it going to the Law Institution and being returned—I remember the prisoner coming to the shop some day before Christmas—(at that time I had delivered it to Stevens &amp; Sons, on 10th December, I believe, but I am not certain; from what Mr. Turner told me)—I did not hear him say anything, he was at the back of the shop—Mr.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I first saw the book it was in Mr. Turner's hand—two people were in the shop—I can't say who the other was—"Sickel's Reports" was written on it at the time the catalogue was made, probably in November—we don't have a catalogue every month—there is nothing cer<lb></lb>tain to tell me when "Sickel's Reports" was written on it—there is a large shop, and at the back Mr. Turner sits when he is haying his meals—I was sitting in the front shop when I saw the book in Mr. Turner's hands, and Mr. Turner was standing at the back of the table in the front shop, at the side of the window from Chancery Lane—I do all the business except pur<lb></lb>chases—I attend to the customers, and if Mr. Turner is busy it is my duty to attend to the business—since this a great many people have been in the shop, buying and selling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Stevens &amp; Sons, Law booksellers, of Chancery Lane—we import three copies of "Sickel's Reports" from America, one for Gray's Inn, one for Lincoln's Inn, and one for the Inner Temple—they come Over in sheets—the second volume arrived on October 8th, and the Gray's Inn copy was sent in sheets the same day; the other two copies were sent to Kelly's to be bound, and some of our adver<lb></lb>tisements were sent with them to put into the interior—when they were returned it was the duty of some person at Stevens's to put in a label, and insert a book-plate for the Inner Temple—on the books being returned by the binder they would be packed up in the ordinary way for delivery, and the porters would take them—on 7th December our account was sent in to the Inner Temple, and we charged-for the second volume of "Sickel's Reports; "enquiries were made about it, and in a few days afterwards the book was brought to me by Johnson from Mr. Turner's—the first page appears as if there had been a book-plate—at the corner here is a label of Reeves &amp; Turner, a larger one—it does not appear as if there had been another label, that would not be visible under the larger one—in this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) "Sickel's Reports" is charged on October 8th as delivered at the library—it would take two or three days to bind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The sheets arrive by book post; the invoice would come by letter post—when the books arrived they would be unpacked—I should see that they agree with the invoice, and send them to the library—I then make an entry in the arrival-book, which is here—the entry in the porters' delivery-book will show on what day the book was delivered at the Inner Temple Library—the porter keeps the book, he is here and so is the book—he delivered a parcel there—I have nothing to show that the second volume of "Sickel's Reports" was delivered at the Inner Temple Library.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am able to say that they were actually received on the 8th—the porter Thorpe's book would contain the parcels sent out for delivery—in the ordinary course of things, the books would be sent out as soon as they came back from the binder's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sub-librarian at the Inner Temple—Mr. Martin was absent in October, up to the 21st—I was there the whole of October—on 7th December I received this invoice, and pro<lb></lb>ceeded to examine it with the books which had been delivered; I found that they were all right, with the exception of "Sickel's Reports"—I find by my own writing that the "Maritime Oases" were delivered on October 11th, and the "Central Criminal Court Sessions Papers" on October 14th—none are entered on the 12th—here is no entry of the 2nd Vol. of "Sickel's Reports"—that is the only book missing—there were workmen employed at the library during October.</p>

Q.</hi> If the 2nd Vol of "Sickel's Reports" had been deli<lb></lb>vered on 12th October would it appear in this book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there would be an entry, "12th October, 2nd Vol.'Sickel's Reports, '" if it came to my hands, and there is no such entry—Stevens &amp; Sons would put the Arms of the Temple in it—that is the rule.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Stevens and Sons, of 119, Chancery Lane—we import "Sickel's Reports" from America—we only import three copies for the three libraries of Gray's Inn, Lincoln's Inn, and the Inner Temple—my attention was called to the fact that the Inner Temple copy was missing—I received information, and it was afterwards brought to me—in the ordinary course our label would be in it—I see a mark here where there appears to have been a book-plate—when I get the information I wrote, on 10th December, to the prisoner, and kept a copy in my own writing—that was sent by a messenger, who is here, to the prisoner, at 1, Mitre Court—I received no answer—I then sent another copy of the letter, with the additional words "Your immediate answer will oblige"—that was sent by a porter named Friend, in the ordinary way, and I after<lb></lb>wards got this reply, dated 17th December, from the prisoner—after that I wrote another letter on the 18th, this is a copy of it on the back—(<hi rend="italic">Letters read:</hi> "119, Chancery Lane, Dec.10th, 1872.

Sir,—We beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 17th instant.

On the 2d of June, about two o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the shop, she was going towards the door, nobody but myself was in the shop, nor any customer. I did not see her till she was leaving the shop, I did not miss anything; no shawls were on the counter, but some were in the window within reach of a person who might come into the shop, they could not be taken from the outside; I heard footsteps at the door, looked round and saw the prisoner going out, I ran to the door, looked at the window, and missed a shawl off a board, where it had been put by itself. It rained hard, I stopped to get my hat, and pursued after her into Oxford-street, turned round, and saw her standing at the entrance of the Union public-house, seven or eight doors off. I went up to her, she had her apron up, I asked what she had in it? She said something, I do not recollect what. I pulled her apron down, and found a gown in it, and under the gown was this shawl, which I know to be my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280036"></xptr>master's. I had placed it on the window twice that morning, it has our mark on it, and cost 3 l.</p>

On the 27th of September, about ten o'clock at night, I fastened up my shop; between twelve and one, I was alarmed, and got up and found the shutter bar broken, and a shutter taken down, and a square of glass broken. The prisoner was in custody. I cannot say that any thing was gone. A parcel of eggs stood just by the glass, which was whole the day before. I believe one of the prisoner's hands was bloody - there was blood on the window. The bar had been wrenched off one end, then twisted round and broken off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. You do not know how the blood came - A. I suppose from the prisoner's hand.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 27th of September I was on duty in Wild-street, between twelve and one o'clock, and saw a loose shutter standing against the next house to Dobson's. The prisoner stood with his back against No. 3, from where the shutter was taken down. I asked what he was after; he said he lived there, and that he had called his sister, and she was coming down. He moved a little from the window, and I noticed the pane of glass broken, and some blood on the glass. I instantly collared him, and said,</p>
               <p>"You villain, you are breaking into this house." He made a little resistance. I called the watch, who came up while I was wrestling with him. We took him to the watch-house, and there I noticed one finger of his right hand had been recently cut; and there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230022"></xptr>were marks of blood on his clothes. A basket of eggs stood close by the window.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Before you came up, did you not see somebody striking him - A. No; he appeared to have had a little to drink. I did not notice that his eye was cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say at the office that the cut in his eye was inflicted by your fist, and not with any weapon - A. No; he said he was waiting for his sister, not for assistance.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard the cry of watch, and about five minutes before that, I heard glass break; I thought it was in Prince's-street, and went there. On hearing the cry, I went to Wild-street, and found the prisoner in custody of Howard, who was struggling with him. The shutter was down, and the bar broken, and a quantity of glass out. He was trying to get from Howard. He threw away two or three eggs - all of them broke except one, which I took to Marlborough-street, and it broke in my pocket. There was blood on the egg, and on the shells - his finger was cut and bleeding.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you came up, which way was his face - A. Towards the house; he threw the eggs out of his hand behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the crush against the window such as might be made by falling against it - A. Yes. I saw nobody go down the street. I think there was a scratch on his temple, but no blood on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at the Ben Johnson intoxicated, and hearing a noise, I ran over the way, and was pushed against the glass, which broke, and I called for assistance, and was knocking for the people of the house, when the patrol came up; I said I was waiting for assistance, which he mistook for sister, and said,</p>
               <p>"Your sister does not live here." He cut me in the eye, which bled profusely; the cut in the hand has been there six months.</p>

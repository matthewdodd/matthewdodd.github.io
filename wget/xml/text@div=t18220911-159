            . I am an officer. On the 4th of September, between five and six o'clock in the morning, I and Read were going through Shepherd's Bush Common, and the prisoner passed us coming towards London. We both jumped out of the cart; Reid took the bundle from the prisoner, and asked him what was in it; he said he did not know. I put my hands into his outside pockets, and found a chicken in each; they appeared recently killed, and were quite warm; their necks were twisted. We took him to the King's Arms, Hampton-bottom, and found four chickens in each coat pocket, including the two found before, and in his hat were two more. We found nine in the bundle, and a speckled hen. We asked how he came by them; he said he should refer that to a future day. On the Monday week we learnt that Mr. Robins had lost poultry; the servant claimed the hen, and described the chickens accurately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How did they eat - Q. Pretty well, the Magistrate said we had better get rid of them; he thought the hen and two chickens sufficient to keep. He told the Magistrate he should be able to produce the person of whom he bought them.</p>

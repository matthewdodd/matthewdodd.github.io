The prisoner came in on the 10th of November, for half an ounce of coffee - I heard the noise of a pair of scales - I turned to the counter, and missed these - she was just gone - I sent our lad out who brought her back; I asked her about them, and she said "What scales?" - she had none; but I took them from her.</p>

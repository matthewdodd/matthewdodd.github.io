                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Attewill; we live in Shoreditch. The prisoner was in my service—on the 3rd of May I went out for a bit of dinner—I left my velvet in the plush-box—when I came back, she said she had cleaned under the treadles, and the plush-box had fallen down—I said, "Never mind, that is nothing"—I went to work, and found the door of the plush-box had been opened, and my velvet was cut—I said, "I am ruined; my work is cut; do you know anything of it?"—she said, "I do not"—I sent her for my father, who came—he looked at it, and said, "It is no stranger, it is a weaver or a weaveress has cut it"—he went to my master, and he desired him to go for a policeman—when the policeman came the prisoner was going down stairs—I asked her what for—she said, for some water—I went down stairs, and found the velvet in the closet, down stairs, which I followed her into.</p>

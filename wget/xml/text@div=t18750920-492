                  </hi>. I am assistant to Charles Meeking and others—Alfred Brown, is a member of the firm—I am employed in the woollen department in Hatton Garden, where tailors' materials are sold—the prisoner has been in the habit of dealing there for those materials for from four to six years, and for five or six months' past my attention has been directed to him—on 16th March, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I saw him in the woollen department; he went to the department where coatings are kept, which is further inside—I went behind a stack of goods, and saw him take a remnant from under the counter, and put it on a recess behind him; he was behind the counter—after looking round him he took it from behind him and put it in his bag, which he closed and remained standing there—there was no one near, and he was not served till five minutes after<lb></lb>wards—I told the clerk and the shop walker, and the next morning I told Mr. Brown—no steps were taken, but it was in consequence of that that I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200030"></xptr>
               <p>observed him particularly when he came again on 11th August—he spoke to Mr. Phillips, who was near me, and then walked on into the coating department, and into the tweed room—I followed him and watched him—I thought I saw him taking a remnant from under the counter and stepped forward quickly and saw the remnant half in the bag and half out—by a quick movement of his hand it was pushed entirely into the bag—he then took out a saucer or a piece of earthenware, put it back and closed the bag again—no one was near him—I moved nearer to him and said "Is anyone serving you!"—he said "No, not yet"—I asked him what he wanted—he said "A blue serge, some twill, and canvas," and we went upstairs to the department where they are kept—he was served with six yards of blue serge and received this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)—we then went to another department where he was served with some twill and canvas which came to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the total amount of his bill was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the money was paid—the cash boy brought back the receipt, but I did not see whether it was given to him to him—he did not say a word about anything in his bag or ask to have it put on the bill and charged to him—none of the articles mentioned on the bill would have been purchased in the department where he put the piece of stuff in his bag—he paid the money at the counter—he then asked me to find him a nice sheet of paper if I could—I went to fetch it, spoke to somebody, and did not go back—the prisoner was called to the counting-house, and I stood outside—I partly heard what took place—Mr. Brown was there, and the prisoner, and star, a policeman—Mr. Brown said "We have reason to believe that there is cloth in that bag, which is stolen, let me look"—the prisoner at once opened the bag, took out the cloth, and put it on the counter and said "If you think that is yours"—I identified it as the remnant which had been under the counter—Mr. Brown said "I must give you in custody," or something to that effect—the prisoner said "Good God, you won't do that," or something like that—he was taken to the station—there were two yards of cloth worth about 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner is a member of the firm of Opperman &amp; Co., tailors, of 88, High Holborn—that business has, I believe, been carried on for twenty-five years—he has been in the habit of spending large sums of money with our firm, and came there two or three times a week between March and August—I cannot say who served him on 16th August, or what articles he bought, but I believe he bought something in the tweed depart<lb></lb>ment—the transaction would not appear with a name to it in any book, and I have no means of tracing it—I said before the Magistrate "I do not know now that the cloth is not paid for"—when he asked for the paper the goods were lying naked on the counter, preparatory to being folded up—Phillips brought him to the counting-house; he took his bag with him and left the goods on the counter—after he was given in custody he said to Mr. Brown "May I speak to you?" and Mr. Brown declined to have anything to say to him—he said "I have nothing to do but to give you in custody," and walked away—this is the bag (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)—remnants are not bought by measurement; they are valued at so much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We have a very large quantity of materials there, and should not miss a remnant—when he had been served on 11th August I asked him if he wanted anything else—he said "No, I think that is all I want to-day, Mr. Clark."</p>

            . I am a patrole. I did not see the prosecutor until I brought the prisoner to the watchhouse, whom I apprehended because he answered the description I received of a person who had robbed a gentleman of his watch. When I took him to the watchhouse the prosecutor immediately said, that is the man who robbed me of my watch. The prisoner denied any knowledge of the transaction.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Drury lane. At a little before eleven o'clock on the night of the 21st of June, on hearing a cry of watch; I went to Smith's rents in Charles-street, and found the prosecutor at the door of the top house in the court. By his request, I searched the house, whilst he remained at the door, but found nobody answering the description I received. I afterwards gave Furzeman the description I had received, which led to the apprehension of the prisoner.</p>

He said it was a boy, about thirteen or fourteen years of age who stole his watch, and he had on a pair of corderoy breeches and a dark jacket and waistcoat; which description the prisoner then answered.</p>

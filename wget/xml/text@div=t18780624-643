I serve in Mrs. Allpike's tobacconist shop, at 183, High Street, Stratford—about 8.30, on 28th May, the prisoner came and asked for a penny smoke—he gave me a shilling—I bent it—it was bad—I showed it to my mistress—she came and asked the prisoner where he got it from—he said from Billingsgate Market, and took it and wrapped it in his handkerchief and went away—he gave me a good shil<lb></lb>ling fur the tobacco and I gave him 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, change—my mistress is not able to come here.</p>

I am a tobacconist of 393, High Street, Stratford—about nine o'clock, on 28th May, the prisoner came and asked for a penny worth of tobacco—he tendered a counterfeit shilling, Which was afterwards broken—I bent it between my teeth and said "What do you call this?"—he put it in his mouth, pretended to be surprised, and said either that he took it from a jute girl or a Jew man, I am not sure which—he afterwards said he took it at a barrow in Billingsgate Market.</p>

About nine, on 28th May, I went to the last witness's shop—I heard the prisoner call for some tobacco—I was in plain clothes—he put down a shilling—Mr. payne took it up and bent it and said "It is a bad one"—the prisoner said "All right, I have, got another," and gave, I believe, sixpence—the prisoner broke the shilling and said "I have got no other bad money and I have got my change" and was rather cross—as he was walking out I told him I was a constable—I asked him if he had any more bad money—I took the broken shilling from him—he said "I have got no more"—I told him I should take him into custody—Mr. Payne went with me to the police<lb></lb>office and charged him—I asked him where he got the bad shilling—he said "From a boy for wheeling a barrow at the jute works in High Street, Stratford"—I searched him and found fivepence.</p>

               <p>What business do you follow? - A shoemaker; I keep a shoemaker's shop; the prisoner Johnson came to my house, the morning of the 3d of October, and asked me if I would buy any mode; I said, yes; and he called in another man; this other man said, this mode was in Frying-pan-alley;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250203"></xptr> and the person he left it with lent him four shillings upon it; and he said, if I would send the four shillings by Mr. Johnson, I should have the buying of it; and says he, if you are doubtless of the money, I will remain with you, while Johnson fetches it; and he did remain with me; he went up stairs; Johnson went and fetched the mode, and brought another man with him; this other man had some mode in a handkerchief; and he went up and agreed for 30 s; and they sent for some liquor; and one of the men seemed to be in liquor; I asked them how they came by it; and they said, they had it from a friend that constantly came by; I asked them again, after sitting there some time, one of them starts up, and says, it has been cut out of a loom; that was one of the men that is not here; they went away; the next day Mr. Armstrong came to my house, and told me the Justice wanted me; I went there, and the Justice asked me, if I had bought any mode, to which I said, yes; and he told me it had been stolen; and he said, it should be sent for; this is the mode which I delivered up to Armstrong.</p>

               <p>What did they come for? - I do not know indeed; I was gone down stairs when they came in; I cannot be sure this was one; I have seen several very much like him since; I know nothing of Abraham's buying a piece of mode.</p>

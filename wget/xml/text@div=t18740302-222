                  </hi>. I am a miller at Riversdale, Lewisham—the prisoner was my foreman, and had been in my employment about eight months—his duties were to serve goods and do any orders that I might give him when I was absent from home collecting, and during the dinner hour when the clerk was absent it was his duty to serve customers, and if he received money it was his duty to hand it over to the clerk and enter it on the counterfoil of the ticket book—he would give a receipt for all monies he received and enter the amount on the counterfoil—had communicated with the the policeman Elcombe, and on the 6th February the prisoner was there on duty to serve customers at meal times—I find one entry on the counterfoil of the 6th February that refers to a peck of flour, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187403020043"></xptr>
               <p>that was paid over to the clerk, and the entry is in this book—that is the only amount I find on that date—the work is so arranged that during the dinner hour the mill does not require to be looked after, plenty of wheat is shot over and during the dinner hour he would have to serve the customers—the scales are close to the counting-house, and the book lies there to enter all receipts in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had a good character with the prisoner, but I have only known him during the eight months he was with me—I gave him into custody to Elcombe—I heard him say that he never robbed me—he also said he must have paid the money over to the clerk, or else had forgotten it and got it in his pocket—the mill was going during the dinner-hour—the prisoner was the only person there then to attend to it—if the wheat shifted, or the stone shifted, it would be his duty to run and see that they were replaced—there was a mistake as to the money when the prisoner kept the book; I found it necessary to keep a clerk—I could not keep the accounts right during the time the prisoner was there—I don't know that I accused one of the men of robbing me of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and it was not afterwards found in an open desk—I deny that circumstance—I have had a clerk about six weeks—I had a conversation with the father of the clerk—I don't remember telling him that the prisoner was a very respectable man, and gave me every satisfaction, but that I wanted a clerk to look after accounts—I told him I had suspicion of him—the clerk is here—some customers would go away without asking for a ticket at all, but it should be entered in the book all the same; my orders are that everything is to be entered, and the ticket given to customers—I can't say that customers have not gone away without a ticket, but I never knew it done—the prisoner told me at one time that he would rather not keep the accounts—he kept 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I saw the girl go from the mill with half a peck of flour, and he never paid the money over, and on the Monday morning he said "I think I have forgot this; when I got home I found this in my waistcoat pocket"—I found a balance of money over when the prisoner kept the accounts; that is, he had given mo money which he had no right to give me.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187403020044"></xptr>
               <p>—the prisoner said "I don't know that I ever robbed you in my life"—Mr. Wallis said "Yes, some money was paid to you yesterday which you have not handed over to me," and he said "I must have paid it to Ted, or else I have it in my pocket now"—when we got outside he said "I don't rightly understand it now"—I told him I sent in a man for some barley meal and he has paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—he said "I remember now a man coming for the barley meal, he gave me half-a-sovereign and I gave him the change out of my pocket, and if I have not paid <hi rend="italic">Ted</hi> I have got it in my pocket now"—when he got to the station he took a bag out of his pocket and turned out the money into my hand, two sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and amongst the silver was the marked half-crown, which I showed him at the time—he then said "Well, I really don't know what I did receive"—it was the half-crown I had previously marked and given to James.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Atkinson; he is an artist, we live at Bethnal-green. The prisoner came into my service on 12th Nov., and she remained till 8th Feb., but she gave me warning—I asked her to let me see her boxes—she did not make any difficulty—they were kept in her own bedroom—I did not examine them before I called the policeman—I had began to examine them—my husband was pre<lb></lb>sent when I found the stockings, which are marked, a neck-tie, and a flannel; I said they were mine—the prisoner said she did not care a d—n, and she began to tear them from me, and said they were marked with her mother's maiden name, and I should not have them—the stockings are marked with the first letter of my maiden name—I got a policeman became the prisoner was so violent—I gave her into custody—the policeman found a shift, a napkin, a piece of dimity, and a baby's cloth shawl—I could swear to them all—this napkin is my own work—I made it—this shift is mine, and it is one I made—I missed it about six weeks after she came—it has been marked, but the mark is taken out—these are the stockings; I marked them myself before I was married—this is the neck-tie.</p>

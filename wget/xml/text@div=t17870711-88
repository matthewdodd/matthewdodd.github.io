             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in King-street, Westminster; the prisoner and his wife lodged at my house, and had done so not quite two months, but within a day or two.</p>
               <p>Do you remember where they were on the 5th of this month? - I went out of an errand at ten o'clock on Wednesday night, and when I came back I wished her a good night; they had the shop and a back kitchen and a garret.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110122"></xptr>Where did they sleep? - In the back kitchen even with the shop.</p>
               <p>Did they sit usually in the shop? - Sometimes in one place and sometimes in another; I generally saw her there in the summer time; there is no fire place in the shop; I never saw her after that time, either dead or alive.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner that night? - No, Sir, I never saw him at all; I used to be afraid to see him, he behaved so exceeding rudely to me, and used such language; they sold milk; the next morning the people came knocking for milk between seven and eight; I was dressing myself.</p>
               <p>Was Carter at home then? - No, I bid them knock and call loud, for Mrs. Carter was deaf.</p>
               <p>Was she in fact deaf? - Very deaf; a young woman said she had knocked and called and nobody heard, and the doors were all open, and nobody there; I run down stairs; now says I, this Carter is so great a villain, that he has done this to bring me into some trouble or something, and I said I will lock up the doors; the key of the street-door was gone, and the key out of the glass-door in the passage; I troubled my head no more about it; and somebody said, did you look, when the house was shut up, to find the woman; I said I had no such thought; the gentlewoman and me went down and looked, but there was nothing but her clothes she had on the night before, spread all over the bed; a nankeen gown which she had on, which was washed almost white, and her stays and apron; the gown was spread all over the bed; I thought no more about it.</p>
               <p>Had any body been in the bed? - There had been nobody in it.</p>
               <p>When did you first see Carter after this? - I went up stairs and went to work as usual, and after eight at night Carter came home; he looked up at the window in King-street; the pavement is raised, and the windows are very low; he said G - d d - n you madam, and b - st you to hell, will you please to come and let me in? I went down and let him in; he said, G - d eternally d - n and b - st your eyes and limbs, you shall not pass the passage, you b - h, without my leave.</p>
               <p>Was he in liquor? - I cannot say; says I, Mr. Carter, is this a recompence for all the trouble I have had with your place this day; I said no more to him, he called to know if his wife was up stairs in the garret with a lodger which he had; the lodger said no; he went down and opened the shop; he cursed and swore, and blasted; at last I was going of an errand, and Mr. Swift's cook, in Parliament-street, came to know why they had not brought the milk; and the cook said to me, do you think, Mrs. Currie, he has not been using her ill? I said, I do not know when he uses her well.</p>
               <p>How came she to ask at that time? - Because he always did use her ill, it was a common thing.</p>
               <p>Is she here? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What reason had she for asking? - I do not know, only his general behaviour; his expressions were very bad, he wanted to have children by her; I wish you would excuse me saying what she said.</p>
               <p>Court. You had better tell us what he said? - He said she was an old dry b - h, and he had no notion of spending his substance with such an old dry bitch as she was, and he wanted a young woman to have some children by.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing about her being absent from home? - No.</p>
               <p>Was she older than him? - I do not know his age; she was fifty-seven this month; a first cousin came and produced her register; I went out of an errand; and as soon as I came in, I met him going out with something under his coat; I said, Mr. Carter, you are going again; shut up your shop, and take the key of the street door, for I will not sit up for you; so says he to me (my dear, which was the first word of the kind I ever heard him say before) I shall be back in ten minutes; I set up till eleven o'clock; so I called the watchman and said; I will give you sixpence if you will mind this shop window,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110123"></xptr>for Mr. Carter is not come home, and God knows when he will; I went up two pair of stairs, and chattted there till half past eleven; and he knocked, and a young woman that is here let him in; I saw no more of him till the next morning; the next morning between seven and eight, he came to the door with milk, he looked up and said, Mrs. Currie, I wish you would call Mrs. Gray down to mind the shop, while I go out with my milk; Mrs. Gray lodged in his garret; he said, is she coming; she does not answer me, says I, turning myself round; she is coming down stairs; I got my breakfast, and troubled my head no more about it; when I came back I went to the kitchen door, and that was between eleven and twelve; I then said to him, Mr. Carter, have you heard any thing of your wife? he said, no, d - n her, nor never shall any more; for she is hanged or drowned somewhere; I repeated the question, how can you think so? says he, I am sure she is hanged or drowned somewhere, she will never be seen here alive any more, for here are her keys, her pockets, and all her money; he said so three times over; says I, what should she go away for? there are her clothes all on the bed; says he, she had a brown camblet gown on; says I, Mr. Carter, I hope you found every thing safe, and have lost nothing? no, by G-d, says he, if I had, you would have heard of me before now, for I found every thing as I left it; I went up stairs, and sat down to dinner; when Mrs. Gray came up, says she, I cannot sit below any longer; for she had found Mrs. Carter's shoes; then a young woman ran down stairs, and found her in the tub; I went down and secured him.</p>
               <p>Where did this tub stand? - Under the stairs, that you could not get a pail in it, under the stairs of the first floor, the water runs into it there.</p>
               <p>What sort of tub is it? - It had been a beer tub.</p>
               <p>Did it stand upon the ground? - No, Sir, it is raised from the ground, I suppose the best part of two feet, and the back of it rests against the wall, on the one side of it; and the other side you cannot get a pail in, if you would give ever so much; I never measured it, but I take it that is the heighth; there was a cock to draw out the water.</p>
               <p>How high was the stairs over it? - Quite close, it was jammed under the stairs; there was the impression of the tub on the stairs; it was so close, there was not room enough to have emptied a pail of water at top.</p>
               <p>Where do you sleep? - In the one pair of stairs forwards.</p>
               <p>Does the door of your room open directly to the staircase? - No, Sir, it had been taken out of another house, and when the door is shut, you can have no communication at all with this staircase; there are three steps to go up and three to go down, before you can come to this staircase, and a little landing-place; then you come to the top of the stairs, and under the stairs stands the butt; I sleep in that room; on the Wednesday night I went to bed between ten and eleven; I always go to bed at ten.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any noise that night? - No, Sir, I could not, for the coaches make such a noise in King-street, it is impossible.</p>
               <p>You did not see

             that night at all? No Sir.</p>
               <p>Did he ever stay out all night before? - No, Sir, not all night; but at all hours; he was an irregular disorderly man; he frequently staid out till day-light in the morning.</p>
               <p>Did you ever know his wife out all night? - Yes, she was gone away once through his ill-usage, four days, which made this not alarm us so much as it would have done; she came back again about eight on the Saturday night; when she went away that time, Mr. Carter did not call any body to mind the shop then; he said he could do by himself; he did not want any b - hes about him.</p>
               <p>Had she a brown camblet gown belonging to her? - Yes, Sir, it was found in a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110124"></xptr>box behind where he sat, when I took him.</p>
               <p>When the body was found what had she on? - I did not see her after ten on Wednesday night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I will ask you one or two questions? - If you please Sir, twenty.</p>
               <p>From the circumstance of this poor woman's being absent before, you did not think so much of this? - We had often thought that he would kill her, and we thought of taking him up upon suspicion.</p>
               <p>However, it happened that she did return home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have as bad an opinion of him, as you have of any thing living? - I have; I have often said, that a blessing attended every thing, for Mrs. Carter was deaf and could not hear him, for if she could he would drive her mad.</p>
               <p>He used you with a great deal of ill language? - Yes, Sir, there he stands to answer for himself, he knows he has.</p>
               <p>You told my Lord that this butt was raised so high that a pail might be put under it? - Mr. Littlefair, the surgeon, charged me not to have it broke up, because he said it was impossible for any body to put themselves in; it is about twenty-four inches over; it is a common beer butt.</p>
               <p>When you saw her the last time, had her window shutters been put up? - No, Sir, a man saw her put them up, and wished her a good night; the door was pulled to and fastened; whoever went out pulled it after them.</p>
               <p>You are not deaf? - No, nor dumb neither.</p>
               <p>That we have had a specimen of! - I have spoke nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Are you deaf? - No, that you are sure I am not.</p>
               <p>You sleep on the first floor? - In the fore room forwards.</p>
               <p>What may be the depth of your house? - I never measured it; I am no architect.</p>
               <p>Is it a deep house or a shallow one? - It is a shallow one.</p>
               <p>Is it a single house or a double one? - A double one.</p>
               <p>This is in King's-street, Westminster? - It certainly is.</p>
               <p>This poor old woman was very deaf? - She was.</p>
               <p>Did she talk loud? - She never talked at all; she only nodded her head at you.</p>
               <p>How long had she been in the course of that dumb way? - During all the time I knew her; she used to nod her head frequently.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to be understood, that during the two months you never heard her speak? - Oh, speak, that is another part of the story.</p>

               <p>Which of the two things that you have stated is true, that you have heard her speak, or that you have not? - I have heard her speak several times.</p>
               <p>Did she use to speak loud, or did she not? - She did not, nor never answered him when he was abusing her; the street door was shut, and on the spring lock; they had pulled it to after them.</p>
               <p>Had you been at the water-tub after the time you had seen her, or had you drawn water from it? - No, I had not; I had a pitcher of water; the water was running away, and there was no current for it to go; I called Polly; says I, my dear, you take in washing, somebody has broke the spiggot; it was bent and broke, and the water was running away; that was on Thursday morning.</p>
               <p>How many lodgers had you in your house at that time? - Nobody but an old gentlewoman and her niece, which is here, in a two pair of stairs fore room; I went to bed at ten; my husband is a very old man, seventy years of age, and he will not sit up for any body; my husband was at home.</p>
               <p>How high is the cieling from that place where the water tub stands? - The cieling of the stairs is so close that it has made an impression.</p>
               <p>Now a man standing upon the spigot,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110125"></xptr>how is the cieling above it; I mean the cieling of the passage near the stair-case; the stair-case joins to the passage? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is the height of the cieling in the passage? - The butt made an impression in the lath and plaister to make room for it.</p>
               <p>There is such a vast number of coaches there, you could not hear any noise? - Why you know there is, and last night they had been moving beer, so that there was no getting any sleep for them.</p>

               <p>When did you see Carter? - The first I saw of Carter was on the Thursday evening.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him then? - Not in the least, he only asked me if his wife was up stairs in my room, I told him no; he went down stairs, and made no answer to me; he was only on the stairs, he was not in my room at all.</p>
               <p>He came up stairs, and asked you, and came down again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him again on the Thursday night at all? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you see him on the Friday? - Yes, between seven and eight on the Friday morning, he was in his house then; and so he called me down stairs to look after his shop while he went out; he desired me to fill him some water for his breakfast against he came home, and I told him there was no water in the house.</p>
               <p>What answer did he make to that? - He immediately said I will go and fetch you some, and he did so.</p>
               <p>Did he make any observation of there being no water in the house? - No, not in the least.</p>
               <p>How did you know there was no water? - Because I went to see at the time I went to fill him some water.</p>
               <p>What state, did you find the spigot or cock of the water-tub? - It was broke.</p>
               <p>Did you make any enquiry how it had been broke, or say any thing about it? - I did not, I had no business with it.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him it was broke? - No, Sir, I told him there was no water; I did not apprehend about it's being broke; I asked him what was become of his wife, and whether he had seen her; and he said no, she be d - d, I am sure she is either hanged or drowned.</p>
               <p>When did you ask him when he had seen her? - About eleven on the Friday morning.</p>
               <p>How long have you lodged in the house? - About five or six weeks, I am not sure which.</p>
               <p>Had Mrs. Carter ever absconded herself before? - Yes, for four days.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to have any conversation with Carter about his wife when she went away before for four days? - Yes, we all in the house asked him after her.</p>
               <p>What did he say then the first time? - He said I do not know where she is, I suppose she is with an acquaintance, we shall hear from her again, and when I said Mr. Carter, you ought to look after her; he said no, not I; says he, d - n her, I shall not look after her, we shall hear of her again.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110126"></xptr>Was Carter at home? - Yes, I was present; he said he was innocent; Mrs. Currle, she went and said directly, you dirty scoundrel, you have drowned her, you put her in.</p>
               <p>What answer did he make when she first said that? - He said he was innocent of it.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing more? - No, Sir, not in particular that I know off.</p>
               <p>I with you to recollect as well as you can, all he said when that was first said? - That is all I heard him say.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect the particular expressions he made use of? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he say how he supposed she had gone there, or any thing? - No, Sir, I did not hear him say a word about it.</p>
               <p>What sort of place was the water tub in? - It stood under the stairs; the stairs was a little off the top of the water tub.</p>
               <p>In what manner did the prisoner use his wife ill? - I never heard him beat her, but by words he used to treat her very ill indeed; I do not know that he beat her; he was a very soul mouthed man to every body; I understood he abused every body in the house; he abused every body I believe that he was acquainted with.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing further? - No, Sir, not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Did you see the body of the deceased immediately after she was found? - No, Sir, not till she lay on the floor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What had this poor woman on when she was taken out of the tub? - She had a shift and an under coat, a pair of stockings, and a handkerchief tied round her head; but I do not know whether it was to her chin or not; I believe she had not been in bed that night.</p>
               <p>When this man applied to you to get him some breakfast, he expected it from this water? - I suppose so, I went to draw some water, and found there was none; the spigot was broke to pieces, and I told there was no water in the tub; and he said he would go out and get some; I never saw these people before, I was exceedingly fond of she, she was very deaf, I was a good deal with her, she spoke very low, that you could hardly hear her speak; she was a monstrous low spirited woman; when she returned after the absence of four days, she said she had been with an acquaintance, but I did not ask her where.</p>
               <p>Did she give any reason for going away? - No, Sir, she was a person of a monstrous few words.</p>
               <p>Had you any talk with her about the probability of her being reduced to the work-house? - No, Sir, she answered the questions as short as she could.</p>
               <p>Did she appear melancholy? - No, Sir, monstrous low spirited.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was very foul mouthed, and a very irregular man? - He was very seldom at home of evenings.</p>
               <p>I suppose he must be in liquor, or else he would not come home so? - We always heard him in the house; it is a common staircase from this tub up to my garrett.</p>
               <p>You heard in the course of this night no noise or screaming; - Not the least; the tub continues in the place still.</p>
               <p>You was afraid before when she was absent, that some accident had happened to her? - Yes, I was, and asked him about her.</p>

               <p>When did you see the deceased last before she was missing? - On Wednesday evening, about half past ten.</p>
               <p>Where did you see her then? - Sitting in the shop.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect how she was dressed? - In a nankeen gown.</p>
               <p>When had you seen Carter before that? - I do not recollect that I saw him all that day.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect seeing Mrs. Carter the day before? - Yes, I saw her about eleven in the day.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to recollect whether she had the same gown on in the morning that she had on at night? - No, she had a brown camblet gown on then.</p>
               <p>In the morning she had a brown camblet gown on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110127"></xptr>When did you first see Carter? - On Thursday evening, about half past eight.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him that evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he come to you? - Yes, he came up stairs, and asked me where his wife was; I told him I had neither heard nor seen her that day.</p>
               <p>What answer did he make to that? - He went down stairs cursing and swearing to himself.</p>
               <p>But did not you hear something that he said? - He swore that if he ever saw her any more, he would chop off her arms and legs, with many shocking oaths.</p>
               <p>Then when you had told him you had not seen her, he seemed angry? - He cursed and swore, and repeated these words; but whether he was angry or not, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>After that, did you see him any more till the Thursday night? - Yes, I went down to Mrs. Currie, and I asked her if she had heard any thing of Mrs. Carter, and Mr. Carter heard me, and he said, his wife and him had been going to be parted a great while, and now they were parted, he would marry me to-morrow, with all his heart; that was to me.</p>
               <p>Did he explain what he meant, that now they were parted? - He said nothing more; I then went out, he went out after that, I let him in about half past eleven; when he first came in, he rather stood still, he did not say any thing; I asked him if he would shut up his shop; he said yes; I staid with him while he shut his shop up; he went into the back-room and fetched out a candle that had been lighted the night before, very little burnt; and as I stood in the passage, I saw a shoe lay that she had on, on Thursday night; I picked it up, and gave it to Mr. Carter; he answered, it is a woman's shoe, and I looked at it, and I gave it to him, and I said, it is Mrs. Carter's shoe, and he took it and threw it into the kitchen; nothing more passed then on that subject, he looked so very different in his appearance from what he used, that I asked him if he had been in sleep, and he answered no, he never slept when from home; he was not very much in liquor; he was rather in liquor, at half past eight; he was very much sobered when he came in at eleven, for the shortness of the time; nothing passed further than I wished him a good night, and asked if I should bolt the outer door; he said no, leave it to me; and I went up stairs, and looked out of the front window, and saw Mr. Carter stand at the door for some time, and walking in the street; nothing more passed that morning.</p>
               <p>I believe it was you that found the deceased? - Yes, I was the first that saw Mrs. Carter in the tub.</p>
               <p>How came you to look in the tub? - Mrs. Gray that was below with Mr. Carter, by saying I had seen the stuff shoe, she said Mrs. Carter must be in the house, she could not go out without her shoes; Mr. Carter, the forepart of the day, had frequently said, that to be sure she was either hanged or drowned, she could not think where she should be concealed but in the water tub; I looked and saw Mrs. Carter laying in the tub.</p>
               <p>Did you take the candle? - I did.</p>
               <p>Now describe particularly in what manner you found her? - She was laying bent rather on the right side, with her head and her feet bent round together.</p>
               <p>Was her head lowest, or her feet? - I cannot justly say which was lowest, I could see nothing but her back; they both appeared to me of a lowness; the tub was moved immediately on discovering her.</p>
               <p>Could you then discover more particularly whether her head or feet were lowest? - I did not go to look at her afterwards, I was so alarmed at the sight of her, but her back was uppermost, I am very clear in that; I looked at her a second time, she lay as it were across the tub, rather bent on her right side, and her knees, and feet, and head round; her back was uppermost; I saw the cock of the tub broke on the Thursday morning; I then

                  </persName>
             some water out of the tub, and the cock was not in the state it was on Wednesday; there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110128"></xptr>water, I drew ten or eleven pails out, on the Thursday morning, between nine and ten; it was a wooden cock, not a spigot.</p>
               <p>What did you observe of the cock? - The broad part of it was pushed down quite in, so that I could not stop it any way to stop the water; it was pressed down, as if something on the outside had pressed it down; the tub had been leaking for some time, the hole had been mended with some putty, and that was beat off.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts was the hole? - At the outside on the front, not quite fronting.</p>
               <p>Was there any hoops on the tub? - It was hooped all the way up with iron hoops, it stood upon a stand under the reach of of the stairs very near the wall.</p>
               <p>Was there any step near it? - No step at all, for we never put any thing in at the top of the tub, the water came into the tub.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How near did you find the shoe to the tub? - By the side of the tub, close to it, rather under it; the cock was in the front of the tub, and where I found the shoe was by the side going in at the kitchen door, I did not see the fellow to it; I did not go into the kitchen, to the best of my recollection; when Mr. Carter chucked it into the kitchen, I think he said, there lays the fellow of it; this tub was the only supply we had of water, excepting some that came into the kitchen for Mrs. Carter's use; I had occasion to go to this tub in the morning, and many times in the course of the day; the prisoner was a very foul-mouthed man, a good deal addicted to drinking, kept very late hours; the last time I saw Mrs. Carter, was at half past ten on Wednesday evening; she was then going to shut her shutters, and I asked her how she did, and she said very well, and I saw her no more; he was seldom or ever at home in the evening, his wife always let him in; I never knew him take the key of the street-door with him.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing her about dinner time on the day of the Wednesday? - Not about dinner time; I saw her between eleven and twelve, she had then her camblet gown on, as she always had the fore-part of the day; I saw her, now I come to my recollection, at four o'clock; she came up with the milk, she had her nankeen gown on then; I have lived in the house three years and seven months; I never knew the people till they came into the house; I had no acquaintance with the deceased any further than passing or repassing, for she was a very close reserved woman, very slow of speech, and quite hard of hearing.</p>
               <p>Did she appear a dispirited woman? - Why I do not know; I believe nothing more than her trouble with her husband; she appeared always low; she had on, when found, a shift, an under petticoat, and a pair of black worsted stockings, a cap, and handkerchief over it; when I saw her at half past ten, she had on a mob cap; I cannot say whether laced or plain, with a white ribbon round her head, she never went to bed till her husband came in, there was a candle in the passage which had been lighted but a very short time.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, that this woman, if he staid out all night, never went to bed? - Never, because she has told me so herself, that she was hard of hearing, and could not, if she laid down, hear him knock; and I have seen her myself waiting for him as late as one o'clock.</p>

               <p>I am an assistant to a surgeon; I examined the body.</p>
               <p>From the appearance of the body, what appeared to be the cause of the death? - There was no violence that I could find out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110129"></xptr>What appeared to you then to be the cause of the death? - I could not rightly say, that I saw any thing about her that could have caused her death.</p>
               <p>How long have you been assistant to a surgeon? - Some time.</p>
               <p>How long? - About a year and three or four months.</p>
               <p>Have you knowledge enough to judge, from the appearance of the body, what that woman's death was occasioned by? - It was occasioned by drowning, my opinion is; I found her in that state, there were no other marks of violence except that alone.</p>
               <p>Was there an appearance that she had died by drowning? - It is very hard for me to suppose that.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen any drowned person before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then was the appearance of the body such, that in your opinion, it was caused by ill usage or drowning? - In my opinion it was not caused by ill usage, otherwise than by drowning; she might have been drowned, she might have been stifled in the tub, and must have been, because I could not find any marks of violence.</p>
               <p>Then you have no knowledge that enables you to form a judgement yourself, from the inspection of the body, what occasioned the death; has any other surgeon ever seen the body? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you open the body? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Why did not you? - I saw no more marks of violence than a little putrifaction under her neck, which must have proceeded from her position; in the inside of the right arm, I saw a little putrifaction, but I could not distinguish the marks of fingers.</p>
               <p>That might equally happen, whether she put herself into the tub or any body else put her in? - Yes, she seemed to be in a state as if drowned, with her hands clinched, and her legs contracted, and her neck also contracted; As far as I could judge she appeared to me to be drowned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You saw the situation of the tub in its erect state? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the cieling over? - Yes, it is about two feet over the top, if it be that, that is the most.</p>
               <p>Do you conceive that if anybody alive had been forced into that tub by any other person, that it could have happened without some external bruises that would have presented themselves to your observation? - That is according to the resistance that must have been made; she was naturally a very weak woman.</p>

               <p>My question is, from the very small aperture that there was from the heighth of it from the floor, do you conceive it is possible for her to be forced in against her will, without marks of external bruises? - I think it is.</p>

               <p>What fort of woman was the deceased? - A little woman, if I must speak the truth, I think she was low spirited, and rather melancholy.</p>
               <p>She was very deaf? - Yes, that was the reason I did not like to correspond with her much.</p>
               <p>Had you at any time any conversation with her, with respect to her situation? - No Sir, no farther than her trouble.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not think that conversation is evidence; it must be evidence both ways or none; it would not be evidence against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you at any time had conversations with her, leading you to form that opinion? - No Sir, but only as I thought by her behaviour, she was very melancholy, and a woman that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110130"></xptr>seemed to me as if she would go into despair.</p>
               <p>Did you build that opinion on any expressions of hers to you? - She used to have the water from our place when she had no convenience of her own; I used to watch her to the water tub, through her being so low spirited, for I was afraid of her making away with herself; she was once by the water tub crying sadly; I asked her what was the matter, and she said she did not know what was the matter with her, she believed she should make away with herself; that is the truth; she has been a low spirited woman ever since I knew her.</p>
               <p>This man was an irregular strange sort of a man? - I never saw any harm by him in my life, but a hard working man.</p>
               <p>He was a foul mouthed fellow? - When he was in liquor, never otherwise.</p>
               <p>The woman had a deal of trouble on her mind? - She seemed so, and said so.</p>

I say that as an honest man on my oath; the answer I made her was, Mrs. Carter do not talk so, you should rather take the protection which the law gives you, if he uses you ill; I do not remember she made any answer to that.</p>

               <p>I have been acquainted with this poor woman between two and three years; I remember her coming to my house the time my husband has been speaking of, and I asked her how she did, and how Mr. Carter behaved to her, and she said, much after the old way; she did not know what she could do, but she thought she should make away with herself; she was always dull ever since I knew her; I never had much conversation with her.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mrs. Harfield. Do you suppose that Mrs. Carter could easily have got into that tub without a chair or something? - No Sir, I should not have supposed that she could have got in without some support; there was a chair near.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My wife had been gone away four or five times before; and once was absent four days, so when they asked me I did not mind it.</p>

            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoner, you have on this occasion escaped an imminent danger of your life; I am perfectly satisfied with the verdict of the jury, which is according to the real truth of the case; it is a right caution where there is a defect of evidence; and the belief of my mind is, that you were not the immediate and actual cause of your wife's death, but the brutality of your character and conduct, has been the means<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110131"></xptr>of bringing you into that miserable situation in which you stood to day; and you have that weight on your conscience, which though short of the guilt of murder, ought to make you think very seriously during the remainder of your life: The only question the jury had to try was, whether you occasioned your wife's death yourself, or was the means of her being the cause of her own death; the circumstances perhaps in the sight of him that will judge you hereafter, do not greatly differ; and I hope that the danger it has brought upon yourself will produce such a change in your mind, as to wipe off that guilt which you certainly lie under at present.</p>

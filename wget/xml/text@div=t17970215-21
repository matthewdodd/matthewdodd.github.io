               <p>Q. Do you remember the day of the week? - A. I don't upon my word; a girl gave me the information, that he had something in his lap, he was quartered at my house; he went out about seven o'clock in the evening, and came in again in a few minutes; I had him stopped, and sent for a constable to take him to Bow-street, and had him examined; we found nothing upon him; I missed the articles in the indictment out of the room where he lodged, but not from his his bed, there were two beds in one room; when we returned from Bow-street, I said, I was certain he had them; if he would give them me, I would say no more about it; he told me where he had sold them, to Mrs. Gest, about a mile and an half from our house; I went and saw the things at Mrs. Gest's; I knew them to be mine, (produces them); the pillows are hemmed and patched, the blankets I know by often seeing them, one of them is a patched one; the bed quilt was a gown of my own, I made it into a curtain, and then into a bed quilt, I know it by the figure; the officer at Queen's -square, Westminster, took them into his possession, he is not here, he delivered them to me; I have kept them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this soldier been in your apartments? - A. About three months.</p>

             sworn. - I only know the prisoner as having bought the things of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married woman? - A. Yes, my husband is a lath-render; I saw the prisoner offering something for safe at a shop near me, I heard them bid money; he crossed the way and went to another shop, and they bid him money, but what I cannot tell; then I crossed the way to him, and asked him what he had to sell; he said, this blanket; I asked him if it was his own; he said; yes; he said, if I would take it to my own place he would let me see it; I keep a small house for my family; he said the price of it was two shillings, which I gave him for this blanket; about three days after, in the evening, he called again, and asked me if I would buy two pillows and a blanket; I said I was loath to part with my money, as I was near lying in; I had but one and twenty pence halfpenny, which I gave him for them; about three days after that, he came with a bed quilt, which I gave him two shillings and six-pence for; it was very old.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man you bought the things of? - A. Yes; the same night the soldier came with the landlady, I gave the things up to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the things, and see whether they are the same you bought? - A. Yes, I am positive of it; one was a bed quilt; I cut it in two, and made curtains of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was coming down the Strand, about six weeks ago, I bought these things of a man, and gave him four shillings for them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his serjeant, who gave him a good-character.</p>

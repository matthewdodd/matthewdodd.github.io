On the 9th of March, about eleven o'clock in the morning, Attfield gave me information - the prisoners were then in custody; I went on the roof, and all the lead was stripped from the trap-door - the space is about five feet six inches, by three feet four inches; Attfield brought it on the 11th, and we compared it to the place - it fitted by two nails, which had been driven through into a board, which I have here - I have not a doubt of its belonging to that place; the prisoners were in the asylum for nine or ten weeks, as helpers and stokers - I saw them there on the 9th of March.</p>

            . I am a constable of Worship-street. I stopped the prisoners about half-past nine o'clock that morning, about one hundred and fifty yards from the asylum - they were both carrying a load, which appeared very heavy, wrapped in a jacket and a pair of trousers; they turned into Cowhell-alley - one went into a Chimney-sweeper's there, and I pushed the other in, and with great difficulty took them to the office - they had got this lead; I went to the asylum, and on the 11th I saw the lead compared to the roof; it fitted the vacancy exactly - I observed this board; the holes in the lead corresponded with it - I have not a doubt the lead was taken from there; they said they brought the lead from home, but refused to say where.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH GRAY. I am an assistant to the superintendent of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070104"></xptr>the asylum. I saw the prisoners there on the 9th of March, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning - they have lived there ever since the 20th of December; the officer came to the asylum, about half-past eleven o'clock - I went to Worship-street, and saw the lead; I saw it compared with the roof; it fitted the vacancy exactly - I have not a doubt of its being taken from there.</p>
               <p>CHARLES SCOTCHMER. I am a Policeman. Attfield called me to assist in securing the prisoners - the lead was then in the chimney-sweeper's house; we tied one of each of their hands together - one of them tried to untie it; he said,"What are you going to do with us? you can do nothing; where is the prosecutor? where is the man that owns it?" the lead was in two parcels, and weighs 105lbs. - I saw it applied to the roof; it completely fitted the vacancy.</p>
               <p>Reeves put in a written Defence, stating that he was desired by an inmate at the asylum, who he did not know, to take the lead out for him; that he met Jay, and got him to assist.</p>
               <p>Jay's Defence. I went out, and was coming back - I met Reeves, who asked me to go with him; I asked him several times how he came by the lead - he never gave me any satisfaction.</p>

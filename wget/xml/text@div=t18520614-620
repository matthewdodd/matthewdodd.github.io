I was on duty at Bromley, on 3rd May, last year—about 12 o'clock at night there were some persons fighting in the High-street, Bromley—I went to them for the purpose of preventing it, and dispersing the crowd—Paul, another constable, was with me—a man named Howlett attacked me, and knocked me down, and I was kicked and struck several times—blood flowed from my head, from the injuries I received from Howlett—when I was down I was held for some time—I got up and was knocked down again—I had got my staff out after Howlett struck me; it was taken from me by the prisoner and his brother, William Sullivan—I was standing up at that time—I laid hold of Howlett with my left hand, and the prisoner struck me with the staff on my head, and knocked me down insensible—when I recovered I was in the surgeon's shop—I was off duty for five or six weeks—I am suffering now from the effects of the blows—the prisoner was taken about three weeks ago—I had not seen him before—his brother and Howlett were tried at a former session.</p>

I accompanied Curtis to quell the disturbance—there were some men fighting—we endeavoured to disperse the crowd—while we were so engaged I saw Howlett strike Curtis on the head, with some kind of instrument, I cannot say what—I am sure it was with some instrument—I saw blood come on Curtis's face—I went to take hold of Howlett, when the prisoner struck me, and knocked me down, and I was held down by the mob that was surrounding us—there were some women there—they took part in holding me down—I succeeded at last in getting up, and sprang my rattle—I saw the prisoner wrench the staff out of Curtis's hand, and strike him several blows on the head—he was completely stunned, and was knocked down quite helpless—he was taken away—the prisoner struck me with Curtis's staff across the hand, and I lost my staff—his brother then wrenched the staff out of his hand, and struck the constable, Redding, with it—I called out for a cutlass—I got it from Redding, who came up on my springing my rattle—I struck with the cutlass, and to the best of my recol<lb></lb>lection I struck William Sullivan on the wrist with it—the mob then dis<lb></lb>persed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a divisional surgeon of police. On 4th May, about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was called to see two police officers, who were injured—I saw Curtis—I examined bis head; it had been previously strapped up by my uncle, who lives in the neighbourhood—on removing the strapping, about three days afterwards, I saw a jagged wound in the upper part of the frontal bone, on the right side of the head, about an inch and a quarter in length—in my opinion it was an injury done by some instrument sharper than a staff, but not a sharp knife—it might have been a stone or a pewter pot—I do not think such a staff as this would do it—I found a great many bruises about the head of Curtis—I did not find any other wound that would have bled at the time that was inflicted—he had but one wound, and I think that was not from a staff.</p>

I am a surgeon, and am uncle to the last witness—I was called to see Curtis, about 12 o'clock on this night—I found I him in a state not recovered from fainting—there was evidence of concussion of the brain—I found a wound on the head about an inch and a half long, on the upper part—I should say it was a dangerous wound—I saw him several times afterwards, with my nephew; but I transferred him to his care, as he is the divisional surgeon—he still complains of the injury—the wound may have been inflicted by a blunt instrument—I should say a pewter pot was a very likely instrument to do it with, more likely than a constable's staff.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in West Smithfield, and am a poulterer. I have a stable in Three Fox-yard, Long-lane—I had a set of harness, a pair of reins, and a bridle there, which I saw safe in the morning of the 14th of October—I did not miss them until the following morning; but on the night of the 14th I saw the prisoner and another man, at a quarter past ten o'clock, with some harness, and among it I saw a pony-saddle, which I believe to be mine, from the brass work; but I had no suspicion at that time, not knowing the stable had been broken open—the other man had all the harness on his back, about three or four hundred yards from my stable—I am sure the prisoner was with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's servant. I was at the stable at a quarter before seven o'clock, on the night of the 14th—I locked the stable door, and the gate of the yard—I was called by the policeman, at twenty minutes past eleven o'clock and found the lock of the gate had been picked, and the lock of the stable wrenched out of the stable—the harness was gone—I saw a garter just outside the stable door—there is no thoroughfare by the stable—there is a gate which locks the stable yard in.</p>

I went to the prosecutor's stable, on the Thursday morn<lb></lb>ing, between eight and nine o'clock, on the 15th of October—there is a king of yard before the stable—the first thing I saw, was garter with the name of William Condon on it—I took up the garter—the stable door had been broken open—there is a yard before the stable, and a gate to it—that gate had a staple driven into it when I saw it.</p>

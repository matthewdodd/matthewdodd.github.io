                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer and appraiser, and live at No. 68, Beresford-street, Walworth—I was introduced to the prisoner for the first time in the middle of Aug., for the purpose of selling some property belonging to him at Kingsland—I put up the whole of the property for sale in Oct.; the property was less than the mortgage on it by about two-thirds—it was bought in—the Minerva Life Office was one of the mortgagees—I after wards received instructions from the Minerva office to sell it for the best price I could get, by private contract—I proceeded to do so by public advertisements in the best manner I could—the largest offer I got was 2550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in the mean time the prisoner left the neighbourhood, and was not to be found or heard of—I made many inquiries for him—I think he left about a month before Christmas; the sale was effected in Dec. after he left—the Minerva, office sent me a letter that they would accept of this offer, and the sale was completed in Dec.—I did not see any more of the prisoner till the 19th of Feb., when he came into my kitchen—about half-past 10 o'clock in the morning of that day, he presented himself in my kitchen—I said, "Good morning, Mr. Cleary; I am glad to see you; walk in; take a seat and sit down"—he walked in in front of my table, where I had home papers—I had asked him in, and shut the door, and we were alone together—he walked up to the table where I was sitting—he said, "I have come to ask you a few questions relative to the property you have sold"—I said, "If you will take a neat, and not talk too fast, I will give you an answer to any question you ask me"—he said, "Why did not you make 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. More of that property?" I told him I could not—he said, "You might have done so if you had liked"—I said, "You have done me a great deal of injustice to represent to Mr. Watson that I could have made 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more of this property"—(Mr. Watson is one of the directors who had lent him the money, and he is the solicitor for the Minerva company)—I made an observation that I had acted very straightforward in every matter in submitting to him the proposala of my clients, and I was about to say, "The longest day of my life I will never serve you again," and he put his right hand to the left breast pocket of his coat, and from that pocket he took a pistol; he presented the pistol towards my chest—I should think he was not more than three feet from me; within three feet, across the table—I stood up, and threw my arms up as high as I could hold them—I shifted to the front of a recess s—there is a broad shelf in the place, between the fireplace and the wall next the window—I shifted myself towards the square corner of the room next the window—he shifted his aim of the pistol towards me, and I heard the report of the pistol—immediately the first pistol was fired, I turned to run to go to the door to go out, but before I could hardly turn round, he immediately drew a second pistol from the same pocket, presented the pisto at me, and made the observation, "I have got another one ready for you; I will do for you"—I sprang round, and threw the door open, and ran up the front entrance; the kitchen opens into the front entrance which</p>

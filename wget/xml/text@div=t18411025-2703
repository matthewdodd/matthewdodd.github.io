                  </hi>. I am in the service of John Mounter, a grocer, in Upper Marylebone-street. Lucas was in his service as errand-boy—in cones<lb></lb>quence of missing money from the till, I marked a pounds'-worth of silver, some half-crowns, shillings, sixpences, and a fourpenny-piece—on the 18th of October I put part into the till in the morning, and part in the evening—Lucas was in the shop in the course of the day, and had an opportunity of taking the money—in the afternoon after I had put the second lot of marked money into the till, Chittenden came in—he had come in several times before, but I had not seen him that day—he asked for a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of sugar—Lucas served him—I was at the end of the shop—Lucas gave Chittenden change of some sort—I could not. see what—about two hours after, I went and found Chittenden in the street—I fetched him to our house, and accused him of having robbed the till—he pulled out these three shillings, and said Lucas had given them to him to mind—Lucas was called down stairs while Chittenden was there—the policeman accused him of robbing his master—he said he had done no such thing, and began to cry and then he confessed he had taken part of it.</p>

About ten o'clock on the 18th of October, I was told Mrs. Mounter wanted a policeman, as she had been robbed—she said, "Come down, one of the boys is down stairs, I don't want the one in the shop to know"—I went down—Chittenden and an<lb></lb>other boy named Potter, were there—these three shillings were on the table—I said, "Is this your money?"—Chittenden said, "No, it is what William gave me to mind till he came out, and then we were going to the Queen's Theatre"—Lucas was not present—I said, "Where is Lucas?"—Mrs. Mounter said, "He is in the shop"—he came down—Chittenden said, "You gave me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said "I did not"—he then began crying, and turned, and said, "Well, I did give it you."</p>

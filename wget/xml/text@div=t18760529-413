I have pleaded guilty to stealing these things from my master, namely, combs, Alberts, spectacles, chains, and solitaires—I have known Edwards for some time, first with seeing him up and down Hounsditch—I have been in Hounsditch some years now, and originally carried on business there about four years since in fancy toys and had a shop—Edwards did not came to that shop; I knew him then—I have been in the prosecutors' employ about three years—that black bag that I was carrying was Edwards'; he handed it to me outside the coffee house on 18th May, at about 3.30 in the day—all these goods were in it at the time—I sold them to him in the coffee-house; not all on that day—the goods that were in the bag were the proceeds of about nine days—the other goods I had brought to him about a week before—he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the whole of those that were in the bag, and he paid some on the 18th when I gave him the last lot, and he had got the black bag with him then, and I saw him put them in the black bag, and he brought the bag outside the coffee house and handed it to me because we could not agree about the price—he wanted me to take 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. off the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I would not, and he gave me the bag to take away altogether—I walked away with it</p>

               <p>and he ran after me and said he would give me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he did, and I handed him the bag—he asked me questions about where I got the goods—he knew where I was employed—he used to buy goods there, and he had seen me there acting as salesman—I used to serve him with the same sort of goods as those I sold to him—I should know the price of such things—the police came to me at my master's premises and took me in custody.</p>

Harwitz and Son's stock in Bishopsgate Street—I was not there—I had frequented the coffee-shop for more than four or five years—the pipes were not sold at the coffee-shop, I used to see the. prisoner at the same coffee-shop—I did not remain there for more than an hour at a time—I went at all hours of the day—I had not had the little business a week when this happened—it was a different Hue of business altogether—I told Edwards I was letting out traps in the livery stable line, and if he saw a wagonette at a sale cheap, he was to tell me—I have on some occasions been present at Whyte &amp; Ridsdale's when Mr. Ridsdale has sold goods to Edwards—I remember his selling him a job lot—I didn't <hi rend="italic">see</hi> any receipt given; I cannot say—it was the practice to give invoices and receipts cut in a particular form when discount was to be allowed—they were called gusset shape, and they were given when cash payments for goods came up to a certain sum—it was done by cutting a piece out of the invoice—another shopman was there besides me—Mr. Allam and I were present behind the counter when he sold articles to Edwards—there was 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and two coins taken from me; only—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given to me by Edwards—I believe Mr. Hughes is still carrying on business, not in Hounsditch, but still at the east end of the town.</p>

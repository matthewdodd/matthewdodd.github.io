                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, Marlborough-place, Albany-rod, Camberwell, with my mother, Diana Oliver. On Wednesday, 23rd May, the prisoner came to our house—he took a bed room, and the use of a sitting room, which he was to have occasionally to himself—he took them by the week—he only stayed two days—he left without giving any notice—I was out when he left for a few minutes, and when I returned he was gone, and I missed my writing desk from the piano in the sitting room—when I went out I had left the prisoner sitting at the piano—the desk had a gold seal inside, and it was full of letters—I also missed the whole of the plate which had been in the plate basket—I had seen it safe about half an hour before in the back parlour—it contained eight tea spoons, two table spoons, one ladle, two. dessert spoons, one mustard spoon, two pairs of sugar tongs, all silver, and three forks and one table spoon plated—I immediately gave information to the police, and on the following Wednesday, the policeman, Frazer, came to my house—I went with him to No. 19, Southampton-street—I knocked at the door, and asked if they had a foreigner lodging there—they shut me into a room, and while I was at the window I saw the prisoner going out of the door down the garden in front of the house which led into the street—he was brought back by Frazer, immediately, to the gate, and he asked me if that was the man, and I said, "Yes"—when at the station, the prisoner said he had taken the desk and burnt the letters, and he had pawned the plate—he said he had pawned the seal—the policeman brought the desk from the house and produced it—this is it—it is mine, and the one I lost all the plate was my mother's—her name is Diana, she is a widow—the prisoner brought a box to our house, which was locked—the robbery was committed on Saturday morning—the prisoner hired the apartments on Wednesday, and he came on Thursday morning, the 24th.</p>

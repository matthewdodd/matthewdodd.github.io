                  </hi>. I am the creditors' assignee in this bankruptcy, and was appointed on the 24th July—I live at Richmond—the prisoner was carrying on the business of an old clothes dealer—a short time before he became bankrupt he brought an action against me and lost it, and conse<lb></lb>quently was indebted to me to the amount of the costs, 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—on the 24th of July I went to Richmond and saw the defendant, and told him I came to take possession of the premises and relieve the present messenger by putting another man in—he said there was nothing for me to take—I remained there about two hours—there were but a very few things to be seen in the house, and they were in the shop, except one or two articles of furniture—I went again on the following Saturday and commenced to search the house, and discovered a secret room—before that I told them I had an idea there must have been some things concealed, and if he would tell me it would be very much better; but he persisted there was nothing more than was to be seen—I next felt the partition in the top part of the house, which he said separated it from the next house, and that there was nothing there—I cut the paper away with my knife, and, seeing there was something inside, knocked the door down and found the various articles, which appeared to have been hastily thrown in—I took possession of these things—he remarked, "My God! you have ruined me "—he said they belonged to Mr. Nathan previous to my breaking open the door—they were similar things to what he had in his shop, because there were labels on some showing the price—there was some bedding in the house—a bed was in this room, but no mattress—these things were sold by my instructions, and realised about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was the 24th July? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't know, Wednesday or Thursday—the messenger who was to be relieved is ill and could not attend to-day—I understood he has been ill six weeks—I have made no efforts to find out whether he is in a fit state to attend here—the messenger I put in his place is not here either—the defendant gave me every facility for seeing the premises except that room—he said I should have to pay for the wall if I damaged it—he did not say there was nothing there belonging to me—I meant, by telling him it would be better to show me all, that it would save me unnecessary trouble—I don't know if I should have prosecuted him—I did not say I should not—I do not recollect saying before the Magistrate that the prisoner told me the partition belonged to the next house; if I did not I ought to have said so—he told me Nadan, his son-in-law, had a bill of sale over them—he put a document into my hand, but I would not read it—when I asked him to let me go over the house he said, "With pleasure"—my servant and two other men went with me on the 24th July—neither of them are here—the assets under the bank<lb></lb>ruptcy in the original petition were about 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the assets from the sale of these goods are in the hands of the Court—there is no dispute about them—I have not heard that the goods were not his property—I have not heard if there is a civil action pending on the subject.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Taylor, auctioneer, of Richmond<lb></lb>on Saturday, 27th July, 1867, I went with Mr. Gurney to defendant's house to take an inventory of the goods—I was present when the discovery was made—on the top of the stairs was a comparatively empty room—to the right hand there was what was found to be a room, and which contained nearly the whole of the goods—Mr. Gurney tried the wall, which appeared like the rest of the room, and told Bartram be believed there was a con<lb></lb>cealed</p>

               <p>room—Bartram denied it—Mr. Gurney discovered that there was a door, and put his shoulder to it and opened it—there was no appearance of a fastening outside the door—these goods afterwards realised 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner exclaimed, "My God! you have ruined me."</p>

On the 20th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, Satchell fetched me to the house, and said he suspected some one was robbing it. I went with him and some others, and found the prisoner walking backwards and forwards before the house. I sent some men up, and they found Pig, (who was convicted the following Session) in the building. The instant he was secured I called out for them to detain the prisoner - we took them to the watch-house. We found a piece of lead thrown down, and another piece rolled up ready to be thrown down. The prisoner said at the watch-house that they had both been there on Monday previous, and taken lead, which they had sold and shared the money between them. He said he borrowed an apron at a public-house in Gray's Inn-lane to conceal it in. He was too ill to be tried last Session.</p>

            . On the 20th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was standing at my door, and saw the prisoner lurking about the building - I watched him for about an hour; he remarked to several persons who passed that it was a dirty place. I went to the back of my house, heard a noise on the roof, and heard something fall through the building. I ran forward, and passed the prisoner, who made the same observation to me about the place. I saw Pig on the roof, and ran and informed Wilson. As we were walking towards the buildings the prisoner walked quickly towards us, and I said,</p>
               <p>"There is the man who was lurking about." I left him in Wilson's custody, and went on the roof - Pig was secured in the chimney. The prisoner said at the watch-house that they had both been there on the Monday, took lead off, and sold it to a man in Portpool-lane for 8 1/2 d. An apron was found in his pocket, and a piece of paper with these words on it,</p>
               <p>"It is time to be off." He said he gave it that night to Pig, meaning it was time to go and rob the building.</p>

            . I was sent for, took the prisoner, and found Pig under the roof by the side of the chimney. He cried,</p>
               <p>"Stop the old man below, he brought me here." The lead was fixed on the building. I matched it next morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A person on the premises engaged me to go with him; he said he had been assisting a plumber and wanted to fetch some cuttings. I lent him my apron, and he desired me to come into the building. I said,</p>
               <p>"Why should I come in? I think you are after no good - it is an untimely hour." The gentlemen stopped me, and they brought Pig down, who had been stealing lead as I suspected.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Benjamin Bridges, who keeps the Ink Horns public-house, in Nicholl-street, Bethnal-green. The prisoner had been five months in our service—she had asked for a holiday at the end of April, and was refused, but went away about two o'clock in the day, and did not return till two o'clock the next morning—we did not choose to let her in—she was dismissed, and came for her boxes on the Wednes<lb></lb>day following—I did not see her pack all her things into the box, but there were some things in it—I had suspicion, and spoke to a policeman, who found these things.</p>

CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who lived in your house be<lb></lb>sides <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not any one—the prisoner slept in a small bed-room on the first-floor—it was on Easter Monday that she went away—my husband would not let her in—she did not come again before the Wednesday—in the meantime her room was locked—my husband had the key—I have no reason to believe my husband flirted with her—I spoke to the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184005110049"></xptr>
               <p>about her flirting with some young men—I do not know when that was—perhaps about a month before her going away—I did not go and visit her at the station-house, nor did my husband, that I know of—she came on the Wednesday morning, and said she would come in half-an-hour for her box, but she did not come again till the Thursday—I went into her room when she took her boxes—I had looked in her large box before I went into the room with her—I did not see the small box till she fetched it away—I did not see her take that one away—it could be concealed, as it was a very small one—she might be there about half an hour when she came for her box—my husband was not at home when she came—he came in while she was there—he had imparted to me something, and that led to my speaking to the policeman—my husband wished to know where she took her boxes—she did not offer to let me look into her boxes before she took them, and I did not ask to do so—I did not charge her with any thing—my husband told her to come for her wages next day—the value of these napkins is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know whether the whole of these things might have been rolled up and put into a person's pocket—I have never expressed myself as being a little jealous—I believe there was a fortnight's wages due to her when she left—I had paid her 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the last payment—her wages was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—she has not received the fortnight's wages—she had given me notice that she intended to quit my service—she would have left a fortnight after I shut her out—I never begged of her to stop—I told her she might go if she pleased.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any truth in your husband flirting with this woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, Sir, not the slightest—she has subpoenaed my husband here—these articles are mine—one of these copper coins is a farthing—I do not know what the other is—they were kept in a drawer in my bed-room, and this piece of jet was with them—these are a pair of silk stockings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know this piece of jet? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the shape of it—I put no value on it—one of these copper coins has a female with a pair of scales on one side, and on the other two faces—I believe it is William and Mary.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 60.) I followed the prisoner on the 22nd of April to No. 26, Vincent-street, Bethnal-green, and found these things in her boxes—the two coins and the jet were in a small box in the large one—I opened the small box with a knife—it was locked.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who went to point oat what boxes you were to examine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Bridges—he asked her where her box was—she pointed, and said, "There it is"—I laid hold of the corner of the box, and pulled it a little forward—the prisoner lifted up the lid, and took something out—MR. Bridges owned the napkin, and then we came to a small box—he said to me, "Open that, policeman"—I got a knife and opened it, and found the two coins and the piece of jet there.</p>

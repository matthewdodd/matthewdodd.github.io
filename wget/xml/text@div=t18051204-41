             sworn. I am an officer belonging to the Hatton-Garden office. On the 22nd of November I was walking up Holborn; I saw the prisoner at the bar with something under his jacket; he looked at me; I thought he had some knowledge of me; I questioned him with what he had got; he seemed very unwilling to tell me; at last he said only his working tools; I asked him what trade he was, he said he was a watchmaker; I told him they were large implements for a watchmaker. I found this pot and this bag containing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040043"></xptr>tools, he told me that he received the pot from a publican at Wapping to repair.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it when you took him? - A. Between the hours of one and two; not being satisfied with his account, I took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bought the pot and gave two shillings for it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my pot, I will swear to it.</p>

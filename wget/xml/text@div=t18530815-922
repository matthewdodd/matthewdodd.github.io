                  </hi>. I am a house painter, of No. 7, Brandon-street, Lock's-fields. On Monday morning, 11th July, about half-past 2 o'clock, I was on Blackfriars-bridge, going towards the Surrey side—I was sober—the prisoner crossed over from the left to the right side, came up to me, and said, Where are you going, old fellow?"—I said, "What is that to do with you? Mind your own business"—he instantly began to hustle me, put his hand into my right pocket, and took out the contents, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., three penny pieces, two halfpence, and a farthing—he made off towards the Surrey side, and I went after him, and saw him caught by a policeman—I was within a very few yards of him, and never lost sight of him—I did not tell the policeman how much I had lost, but the prisoner was searched, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., three penny pieces, two halfpence, a farthing, and a latch-key, were found on him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 85). I was on duty at the Surrey side of Blackfriars-bridge, heard a call of "Stop thief!" and stopped the prisoner, who was running—he said, "It was not me"—I said, "You must come back"—in about half a minute Callard came up and said he had robbed him—I took the prisoner to the station, searched him, and found on him one shilling, three pence, two halfpence, and one farthing—he was sober, and so was Callard—there was only Callard and the prisoner on that side of the bridge that I could see.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It was not daylight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was light enough for me to see that there were no other persons—I heard the cry about a minute before, and then saw the prosecutor and prisoner running—I could see no signs of drink on them—the prosecutor said he had lost 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but afterwards he said there was a farthing also—the prisoner was running fast; he did not tell me he was late, and was going home—he gave the name of George Clark, which I understand is not correct, and said he lived at Norwich.</p>

Archer came behind her, and received it from her. I heard a sixpence fall. I let go of her, followed and took Archer - I took her to the watch-house, returned to the spot, and found a sovereign and 14 s. 6 d., about a quarter of an hour after. Cook was taken in ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Cook passed her hand behind you - A. No; across mine. We found 5 s. 9 d. on Archer. I lost no pence. I cannot say that she received it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What money had you before you met them - A. A sovereign and about 20 s.; the sovereign and 14 s. 6 d. were found about fourteen yards from where the sixpence was dropped. I might not have had more than that.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the "Sutherland Arms," in St. Martin's-lane, in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields—the prisoner came to my house on the 19th of Sept., about half-past ten, or twenty minutes to eleven o'clock in the evening—he applied for a bed, and paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—he slept there, and the next morning he paid another 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to have the same bed and the same room again; and five minutes after he was gone my wife went up stairs and found my bed-room door locked, and the key gone—she called me—I forced the door open, and missed from the drawer my gold-watch, seals, and chain—these now produced are them—they are worth more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker and silversmith, and live in Totten<lb></lb>ham-court-road—on Monday, the 21st of Sept., I saw the prisoner in my shop—he was showing my shopman a duplicate, and said he had been pawning a watch which he had fitted a key to, and he wanted to sell the duplicate—I asked where he lived, and went with him to the pawnbroker's and got this watch—I took an officer with me and gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is this the watch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the prosecutor said it was jewelled in eight holes, but I find there are ten holes jewelled—it is jewelled in the winding-up fusee, which none but a watchmaker would know—it would cost 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to do that—this watch would cost about forty guineas—I got it from the prisoner's hand at the pawnbroker's.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a public house, in Agar-street, Strand. On 14th Nov., the prisoner came there, and asked for a quartern of gin—he tendered me a bad florin—I noticed that it was bad—he said a gentleman at the top of the street gave it him to fetch the gin—I said I would see this gentleman, and I went with the prisoner to the top of the street—I waited there a few minutes—I could not see a gentleman, and I gave the prisoner into custody—I gave the florin to the policeman—the prisoner was taken before the Magistrate, and remanded till the Thursday—there was nothing against him, and he was discharged.</p>

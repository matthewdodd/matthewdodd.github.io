The prosecutor had hold of the prisoner's arm, and gave her in charge for stealing this purse, containing two half-crowns—I took her to the station—the prosecutor had the half-crowns in his hand—he described where he had lost the purse, and I went there about five in the morning, and found the purse in the road near where he had described—there were no shillings found—the prisoner said at the station that the money belonged to her.</p>

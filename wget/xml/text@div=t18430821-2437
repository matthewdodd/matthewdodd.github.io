                  </hi>. I live in Weymouth-street, New-road. On the 14th of July I was at work at Mr. Howe's, at Chiswick—I left at half-past one o'clock, and left my watch by accident in the water-closet—I was away till about five—I then missed my watch—I returned, and inquired of the prisoner and all the persons on the premises about it—the prisoner was working in the garden—I asked him if he had seen it—he said "No"—I am quite sure I told the prisoner I had lost it—this is my watch, seal, and key.</p>

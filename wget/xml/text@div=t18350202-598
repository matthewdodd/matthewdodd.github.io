On the 23rd of January, at half-past seven o'clock in the evening, Wright came in for half an ounce of tobacco—I was present—he gave my wife a shilling, which was put into the till—she gave him change, and he left the shop—she directly said she thought it was a bad shilling—it was taken out of the till again—there was no other shilling there—I looked at the shilling and pursued the prisoner—I saw him a few doors from my shop—he went up to Hodges—they stood together about a minute, and then walked on together towards Shoreditch—I watched them walking together for 150 yards—they then separated—Wright came over to the opposite side, where I was—Hodges then called out, <hi rend="italic">"Jem, Jem"</hi>—I seized Wright, and told a policeman who was there to go and take Hodges, and he went—I called to him that it was for bad money—two good sixpences were found on Wright, and fourpence-halfpenny in copper—the tobacco he bought at my shop came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and my wife gave him a sixpence, and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—this is the counterfeit shilling.</p>

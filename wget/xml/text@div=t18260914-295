On the 2d of August, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was on Clerkenwell-green, going to my club; I saw Prudon, who stooped and picked up, or pretended to pick up, a shilling; he asked if it was mine; I said, No - I had only two half-crowns to pay my club money - he then asked me to have something to drink, and we went into the <placeName id="t18260914-295-crimeloc1672">General Graham public-house</placeName>

            . I am pot-boy at this house. I remember the prisoners being there - they generally come into the house of an evening to drink - I saw Cox first - they were with Mr. Yeates - I do not know who came in first - I did not hear the betting going on, but Yeates gave me the watch to hold - he did not tell me to do any thing with it - my mistress was busy at the bar and knew nothing of it - I did not speak to her about the watch, but I gave it back, because she called me, as she wanted me; I gave it to Yeates, and said I would have nothing to do with it - my master and mistress had always told me to have nothing to do with things in the tap-room - I then went and sat down on a seat, and soon afterwards there was a bustle to the door - I rather think the prisoners were there - the prosecutor did not complain that he had lost his watch till after all was done, and he came in - Cox came in afterwards in a disguise with a smock-frock on - he had before a blue coat on and was very clean - Yeates did not give me the watch to take to my mistress - I do not know that any of the persons about were bad characters - there was a rush to the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had Cox a smock-frock on at first? A. No. I have known him in the tap-room before, and in company with Prudon.</p>

            . I assist my cousin in the bar at the General Graham public-house. I saw the prosecutor and Prudon come in and call for a pint of beer, which I drew - an oyster man then came in; I thought I heard them quarrelling, and I called the boy to come away - I have been there two years, and have seen the prisoners there frequently; there were more than a dozen in the tap-room; I did not hear of the watch being stolen till after they were all gone; I saw Cox rush to the door; some one collared him, but I do not know who; I called out that there was going to be a row, I would send for an officer and clear the house.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Castle Baynard Ward. Yeates told me, on the Sunday, that he had lost his watch - he described the persons - I said I thought I knew them; I went with the night constable to several houses till we got to the General Graham, where we found Prudon; we took him to the lock-up place, and told him what it was for; he denied all knowledge of the prosecutor or of the transaction; the watch was delivered to the prosecutor at the door of the Distillers' Arms public-house, Saffron-hill; Prudon admitted before, the Magistrate, that he had the watch in his hand, but said he held it for a bet of 5s., and would not give it up.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>PRUDON'S Defence. When I returned the man his box, he said he had got his money all right; the prosecutor said he would lay 5s. he had not got it right; he then bethought himself that he had but 6d., but he had got a beautiful watch; and gave it to the pot-boy to hold; the mistress then called the boy away; he said to me "You hold it and if I win I will give you 6d. for it;" the man then opened the box, and there was another 6d. under the tobacco; the prosecutor lost the bet, and he would not give up the watch - the other man then snatched the watch and ran off.</p>
               <p>COX'S Defence. I went to have some beer; I heard a row, and turned round and saw a mob - I heard the prosecutor say, "I will lay my watch against 5s.;" he put the watch into the pot-boy's hand, and the landlady called"John, come away, have nothing to do with it;" I did not stop to see the remainder of the business - I drank my beer and came away.</p>

            . I am a chimney-sweeper, and live at No. 5, Silver-street, Clerkenwell. I was at the General Graham on this night; I saw Prudon and the prosecutor come in and ask for a pint of porter; Prudon asked the prosecutor to give him a bit of tobacco - he said he had not got any - then another person lent him a bit, and went out, and the prosecutor took the box and played some trick with it - Prudon gave it back to the man - and after a little while the prosecutor told him he had not got what ought to be in the box; the man rattled it and said he was sure it was all right; the prosecutor said he would lay him a wager of it - that he had got no money, but had got a good watch, and would lay that against 5s.; the watch was put into the boy's hand; the housekeeper would not let him hold the stakes; he then asked Prudon to hold it, and he would give him 6d. if he won - Prudon took it to hold; the box was then opened; I did not see what was in it, but directly the prosecutor ran out to get an officer; the others remained there drinking their porter.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who was at the door? A. There were some persons there; I was drinking with Rose; there were a great many people at the door; I have known Prudon four years, he is quite a good sort of man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor complain of losing his watch. A. He ran out after the man who won the watch - he said if he could see the man he would leave it at the bar for the money; I remember the pot-boy returning the watch, because the lady would not let him hold it; Prudon gave it to the man who won the wager; the prosecutor put it on the table, and then took it up and put it into Prudon's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that Cox did not run off with the watch? A. I do not know Cox; I do not know who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140127"></xptr>took it; he gave the watch to the man who won it; and he went away almost immediately; he did not stop; there were other persons there; the man might stay a minute or two in the house; I cannot say who took the watch; he gave it to the man who won the wager.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not Cox? A. I cannot swear a thing I do not know.</p>

I have known the prisoner three months; we lived together, but not in the same room.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Is not the prisoner your landlady's daughter? A. Yes; we do not sleep together - we had gone out between twelve and one o'clock, to see the Lord Mayor's show - we had walked about all the time; she had not complained of being tired or hungry - she went to a pawnbroker's to pawn her bracelets, to buy some boots, to put on, but they would not take them in - we had been to a friends's to tea - we had a glass of gin each, but were not drunk.</p>

            . I am street-keeper of St. Martin's-lane. I saw a crowd, and went to clear it away; I saw the prisoner pulling the prosecutrix about, and endeavouring to get her to go home; the prisoner said some woman had robbed her friend of her finger-rings, earrings, and an eye-glass; I asked her why she did not secure the party - she then said it was some man; I then began to have some suspicion of her, and said,"I shall take your friend to the station," and when we got there, I said to the prisoner, "I don't like this, I shall search you;" the prisoner then turned to a gentleman there, and said,"Will you fasten this bracelet on my wrist;" the gentleman did so, and while he did it, she dropped this glove, and its contents; I took it up, and found in it the ear-rings and finger-rings - she tried to put her foot on the glove, but I prevented her.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was with the prosecutrix, and a gentleman and lady were going through St. Martin's-court - the lady was jealous of the prosecutrix, and struck her; I turned back, and found her beating my frined - I asked her where her ear-rings were, and a gentleman took them up and gave them into her hand; she pulled off her glove to put them into her ears, but was too tipsy to do it - she was then taken to the watch-house, and there the glove and ear-rings were found, but I had not touched them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Thomas Bryer, a draper, No. 44, King William-street. On 4th April, the prisoner and another woman came and asked to look at some shawls—they went in the shawl-room, selected one large square shawl and paid a deposit of a shilling on it—they then left the shop and came again the next day, on Tuesday, 5th April—the prisoner told me she had lost the bill which we had given her and she wished to change the shawl which they had bought for a long one—I took them into the shawl-room and left them there—they came down in about five minutes afterwards—they followed Mr. Clark out of the room, and after staying some little time they left—Mr. Clark made a communication to me and I followed them—I came up to them and I said, "I want you to go back to the shop with me there is a mistake about the shawl"—they seemed confused, and I said, "Which of you has got the shawl?" the younger woman who was with the prisoner went away, and the prisoner said, "She has got the shawl." I went after the younger woman and brought her back to where the prisoner was standing—I told them they must go back to the shop—they wished me to let them go—we walked on till we came to the corner of Eastcheap, and as I was looking to find an officer the younger woman went into a public-house and I lost her—the prisoner still remained and I took her back to our warehouse—when the prisoner and the other woman and I were all standing together, I saw these shawls under a cart which was there—I seized the shawls and then the younger woman escaped—I should think either of the women could</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Thomas Bryer—I remember the prisoner and another woman coming to the shop on 5th April—they were brought into the shawl-room—they came to exchange a shawl which they had paid a shilling deposit on the day before—they selected a long shawl and paid two shillings more on it—the prisoner tried on one shawl just outside the shawl-room—the other woman was in the show-room—I went outside and the prisoner came and tried one on—she had a shawl on herself except during the time she tried the shawl on—when I came out of the shawl-room they lingered for a minute, and I looked back to see what they were doing—on going back my suspicion was excited by finding that one shawl was missing which had been lying just at the entrance of the show-room on the top of a heap of ten or twelve shawls—I then missed another shawl which had been on the table near where the younger woman was left when the prisoner went out of the room—I came down and made some communication to the last witness—these are the shawls, they are the property of my master.</p>

The Prisoner was extraordinary gay and genteel, and complemented away his Wine to the Cook, and went very often to the Sink under Pretence of making Water; while the Cook was busied in dressing a Duck for some Company in another Room, which being near ready, before she had Occasion for Spoons to the Sauce, the Prisoner went away: When he was gone, the Spoons were miss'd immediately; and the abovemention'd Circumstances gave Mr. Rogers Reason to suspect the Prisoner, and forthwith sent away his Servants with a Description of him to all the Taverns about, who heard of him twice that Night. At last the Prosecutor became inform'd of a Coffee House he us'd, to which he went, and got him in Track and in Essex Street apprehended him, and charg'd him with the Fact; at which Time he humbly begged the Prosecutor to go with him into a House, to prevent being insulted by the Populace, and he would make him Satisfaction; which was complied with, when the Prisoner confess'd the Fact, and sent one of the Witnesses with a Note to a Woman whom he call'd his Friend. to recover the Goods which he had sold to a Goldsmith; which she did, and the Spoons were brought to them. The Goldsmith deposed, the Prisoner (but he could not be positive to the Man) brought the Spoons to him to sell, by Candle-light, very well dress'd, and told him he was his Neighbour and a Gentleman, but short of Money, and being willing to conceal his Misfortunes, brought the Spoons to him in the Dusk of the Evening. Upon this the Goldsmith bought them, and gave him 5 s. and 4 d. an Ounce. The Prisoner in his Defence said, A young Man of his Acquaintance came to him at the aforesaid Coffee-House, and told him his Mother was dead, and had left him some Plate, and desir'd him (being better acquainted with the World) to sell those Spoons for him; which he refus'd, but directed him to the said Goldsmith, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171601130002"></xptr> whom he went and sold them: That after this, being taken up for some Spoons that were stole, he call'd to Mind the Marks of those he directed his Friend to sell, and believing they might be the same, discover'd where they were. There was no Appearance to the Prisoner's Reputation, nor to the Confirmation of his Story, and the Evidence against him was very full; upon which the Jury found him <rs id="t17160113-3-verdict19" type="verdictDescription">

It appear'd, the Prisoner (as was his usual Method) came into the Prosecutor's Kitchin, and call'd for a Gill of Wine, so gay, that he was taken particular Notice of but not in the least suspected for a Thief. After he was gone, the Spoons were lost out of the Table Drawer; and Mr. Dunton being inform'd some Days after, that the Prisoner was in a Neighbour's House apprehended for such a Fact, went to him with the Drawer that serv'd him the Gill of Wine, who knew him again very well; and charging the Prisoner with the Theft, he confess'd it at last, and told where they were stopp'd. One Mrs. Riley depos'd, a little Man like the Prisoner (but she was not certain of him) brought her the Spoons to sell; but she questioning him how he came by them, he ran away and left the Spoons behind him. Her Daughter depos'd the same, but was positive to the Man. The Prisoner denied the Fact, and endeavour'd to make his Defence by taking Advantage in Point of Time; and brought two Witnesses, who swore Mr. Dunton's Boy gave out, that he saw the Spoons in the Drawer at 7 a Clock that Night, while they were in the Room (which was after the Prisoner was gone) upon which Mr. Dunton would have prosecuted them, had not the Prisoner been discover'd; but this being of no use towards clearing him of the Fact, and discovering his Innocence, the Jury found him <rs id="t17160113-3-verdict23" type="verdictDescription">

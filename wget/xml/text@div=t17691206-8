            . I had a warrant to apprehend the prisoner and another. I took the prisoner as he was coming out of the warehouse with this china-ware upon him, some in his coat pockets. Going along, I thought he had something in his breeches. I searched him before the Alderman in Guildhall, and found the rest in his breeches. I took him coming out of the company's warehouse in Seething-lane. One of the King's officers that is now here, said to me, Smith was gone, and would have prevented my taking him. I told him I would report him; the prisoner was got out of the warehouse, but not got into the street. (The china-ware produced in court, it was blue and white.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Rudock. There is abundance of china-ware of all sorts in that warehouse. I cannot speak with certainty that there were such as these.</p>

               <p>I brought that china from on board the ship called the Sea-horse at Deptford, about six that morning, and came up to Iron-gate by water, because I would not lose my call. I brought it into the yard, and left it in an old chest, and hid some of it in my breeches, because the officer should not find it upon me.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Rose-street, Long-Acre. I went with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060009"></xptr> prisoner on board a ship. I think it is called the Sea-horse. She lay at Deptford. We went on board as near as I can recollect between six and seven in the morning. He bought some china. I did not think it worth my white to buy any. I did not think it worth my notice. I saw nothing that I liked. He bought as much as came to fourteen or fifteen shillings. This was the 10th of last month.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of china were they?</p>
               <p>Bunning. There were some cups and some basons, odds and ends he called them; to the best of my remembrance they were blue and white. After that he went one way and I another. I waited for a boat to carry me on shore on the other si de the water; he went up the river in order to get to his work to save his call.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when he made the bargain?</p>
               <p>Bunning. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of each?</p>
               <p>Bunning. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ring them?</p>
               <p>Bunning. That I cannot say. I saw him examine some of them, he put them into two or three pockets, they were packed in some India paper; he took a boat and went up; he lives in Falcon-court on the other side the water. I called upon him that morning about five or a quarter after, there, and we walked together part of the way, and the remainder part when we came near the place we took boat and went on board.</p>
               <p>Q. to Rudock. What time do you call over your men at the warehouses?</p>
               <p>Rudock. We call about eight in the morning this time of the year.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bunning. How long was you on board?</p>
               <p>Bunning. I believe I might be on board about half an hour or better.</p>

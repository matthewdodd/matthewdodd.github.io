I was setting at my shop door on Saturday the 2d of November. The prisoner and the deceased stood at Mr. Monk's door; the prisoner called several times for a pot of beer. I can't tell how they came together. Mrs. Monk was then standing at the door; the prisoner seemed to be in liquor, and the deceased much more so, which was the reason, I believe, that Mrs. Monk would not let them have any liquor, for there was no beer brought. The deceased went away, the prisoner followed him, and just opposite my door said to him, What are you going away, won't you be your pint; and then he said, you have got no money in your pocket, or to that effect. The deceased turned round and took six-pence out of his right hand pocket, and held it out in his hand, and said, yes, I have money. The prisoner came towards him, and the deceased drew his hand back as he saw the prisoner coming, and the sixpence fell upon the ground; the prisoner attempted to pick it up; a little scuffle ensued, and the deceased was thrown down; the prisoner took up the six-pence from the ground, and went back to the public-house door, where they had been standing before, and he called for a pot of beer again. I did not see any beer brought; the deceased got up; he went to the prisoner, and asked him for the six-pence; the prisoner said, as no beer was brought, he would put the six-pence in his pocket; and he took his whip, and went into the road to the cart he was the driver of, which stood with bricks in the road; the deceased passed him to the near side of the horses; he went to the head board of the cart, to look at the number and name, as I imagined; the prisoner came round to him whilst he was looking at the head-board; some words passed between them (but what I can't tell) for about two or three minutes: then the prisoner hit one of the horses, and set them a going; the deceased turned round to the third horse, and caught hold of his bridle; I believe they call it got hold; the cart kept going on, and the deceased kept hold of the bridle, endeavouring to stop the horses, and he went on near thirty yards that way; at last I saw the deceased drop from the hold he had; he fell upon his back, and the wheel went over the lower part of his body; the prisoner went on with his cart, and somebody stopt it, I believe; I saw it standing in the road at some distance.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prisoner behave upon that occasion?</p>
               <p>Fenton. He did not seem to take much notice; he was to much in liquor, I suppose he did not know the consequence.</p>
               <p>- Lockston. I saw him hang by the side of the horses, and I saw him drop; he lost his hold some how or other, and fell down upon his back, and the wheel went over his belly.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the prisoner, when he saw the man drop, stop the horses?</p>
               <p>Lockston. I can't say; the horses were stopt about twenty yards off; I can't say who stopt them.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the horses toss'd up their heads or not?</p>
               <p>Lockston. I can't say.</p>
               <p>- Monk. They came to my house; they called for beer, but they were both in liquor, and so I said I would not draw any. The prisoner went away; the deceased went after him, I thought it was to take the number of his cart. I saw the team go over him, but I did not see him till he dropt.</p>
               <p>- Clark. I live at Leightonstone; I was opposite the cart at the time; I was at one Mrs. Crouch's; and I saw the deceased take hold of the reins of the horse; I did not see him go five yards before he fell; I saw the wheel go over his body.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040032"></xptr>- Landefall. I belong to the bank; I saw this accident. On the 2d of November I was coming by the Infirmary, I observed a cart standing at a public-house door, loaded with bricks; I walked on a little further about twenty yards perhaps; then I saw the cart come on, and a person hanging to the shaft horse on the near side by the bridle; he went on a few yards farther in that manner; he was pulling the horse very hard; the horse shook his head; he let go his hold, and fell under the wheel; he turned like, and the wheel went over him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner strike his horses?</p>
               <p>- Landefall. I did not. After this happened I walked on, and the deceased was taken up and carried to the hospital. When the people charged him with having killed the man, he put his hand in his pocket, and said, Why I will be two-pence to his three-halfpence; I told him so. He was very drunk, and stood very still.</p>
               <p>- Toller. I am surgeon-beadle at the hospital; the deceased was brought into the infirmary, and died soon after.</p>

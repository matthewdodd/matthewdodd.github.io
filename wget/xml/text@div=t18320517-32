I took the prisoner, and went to his mother's, where he lodged - I opened a box there with a key which I took from him; I found in it a duplicate of a ring and one of a handkerchief, and three others.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH TURNER. I live with a pawnbroker. I have a ring, pawned at our house, in the name of Williams - I did not take it in; this is the counter duplicate.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MURDOCK. I am a pawnbroker. I have a handkerchief, pawned on the 21st of February, by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did you take it in? A. Yes; I had not known the prisoner before - I have a doubt whether he is the person, but I believe he is.</p>
               <p>MR. WHITMORE. This is my ring - it has my initials on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Did not the prisoner's mother come for his linen? A. I have understood she has done so.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Mrs. Williams - A. Yes, she was a customer of mine then; she lived in Charles street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know on the 9th of September of any goods delivered by him to her - A. I know by written documents in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there delivered to the prisoner on the 9th of September - A. Bread and flour to take to my customers; in this ledger is the entry made at the time. I copied it from him.</p>
               <p>Q. You made the entry in that book from the account which the prisoner delivered to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. I suppose some of your trade is on credit and some ready cash - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. If they have the money they return you the money - A. Yes; and when they come without the money they return it unpaid, and I make an entry in the book in their presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Read the entry - A.</p>
               <p>"A quartern of flour, half a quartern loaf, and a penny roll."</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other Mrs. Williams - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you that he had not received the one shilling and nine pence of Mrs. Williams - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he before he left your service made any discovery of this transaction - A. I often discovered him in an error.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is this - whether before he had left your service, you had discovered that he had recieved this money from Mrs. Williams - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 8th of October he left your service - how long was it after the prisoner had left you that you saw Mrs. Williams - A. In the course of three or four days. I told her that I had one shilling and nine pence against her, and then was the first time that I knew the money had been paid; about a fortnight afterwards I met the prisoner in the street, he said he lived with a Mr. Morris; I told him that he had taken money that he had not accounted for, I should have him apprehended for taking my money and not accounting for it; I saw him after that on the 1st of November, when I was taken up on a bench warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you took out any warrant, or made any charge before a magistrate before this 1st of November - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. There was an indictment against you for an assault - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300055"></xptr>Q. Before the 1st of November had he made any accusation against you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time he lived with you had you differed - A. One morning I could not get him up.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what took place that morning did he at any time tell you that he would make any complaint against you - A. Never</p>
               <p>Q. Then the first time that you knew he had made a complaint against you before a magistrate was on the 1st of November - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ever taken you before a magistrate before the bench warrant - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came before the magistrate, I suppose the nature of his accusation was his claim - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time make any communication of this transaction - A. I did; it stood over for a future day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. You and he had some difference while he was with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had not threatened to bring you before the magistrate, you would never have preferred this charge - A. He never threatened me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he quit your house with the marks of your brutality upon his person - upon your oath, did not he quit your house with his hair torn up by the roots, and black marks on his face - I do not ask you whether you inflicted them - did not you see them - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he quit your service with any marks of violence - A. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Morris was a baker living about an hundred yards from your shop, from time to time had not you seen the boy going round with bread - A. I saw him but once.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that your wife saw him at Mr. Morris's - A. She told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons in the course of the day had this boy to deliver flour, bread, and rolls to - A. Near about twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. And the boy was to account to you upon memory for the delivery of flour, quartern loaves, half quartern loaves, and rolls - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, of course, he must say he received the money from some one - to a young lad can any thing be more easy than to make a mistake - A. I do not wish to say that he did it knowingly.</p>

These trousers belong to my son Lewis, and are marked with his name; he had taken them off, on the evening of the 28th, and I threw them on a table in a little sitting-room.</p>
               <p>RICHARD POWELL. On the evening of the 29th of December, I was at the Ship and Stars, and saw the prisoner come down the stairs, and go into the yard - I told Mrs. Hore to go up stairs, which she did, and found the pillow of the bed I had slept in was turned back, and Middleton's box was open - she came down and told me, but the prisoner was then gone; about an hour after, I went into the yard, and saw the prisoner coming over the back boards, behind the privy - I collared him, brought him into the house, and found these three razors, the trousers, and a waistcoat of my own, all in his hat.</p>
               <p>JOHN MIDDLETON. These are my razors. I lodged at the house; they were in a small box on my table.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the privy, and found these things in a corner of the yard.</p>

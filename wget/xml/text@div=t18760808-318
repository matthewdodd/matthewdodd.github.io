                  </hi>. I live at 27a, Cavendish Street, New North Road, and am a glass lapidary—between 4 and 5 o'clock on the 12th June I was outside the Jolly Anglers by the river Lea—the Middlesex side—a short distance above Lea Bridge I saw four men pass me while I was sitting there—they were going up towards Tottenham—three of them were the present prisoners—one of the four said to some boatmen "Come and see a game that you never saw before"—Kingsland had a bag across his shoulder similar to this produced—neither of them spoke to me—one of them had something under his coat as if hidden—I did not see what it was then—I saw the deceased and another man (Turner) on the other side of the river—I had not known the deceased before—I saw four on my side of the river because there was one that is not here now—Turner asked the boatmen on my side of the river which way the others had gone, and they directed him "higher up, round the corner"—the river takes a bend there—I then fol<lb></lb>lowed Lloyd, Williams, and Kingsland—they went as far as the boat-house when I saw the man with the bag put it down on the ground and take out some rope in pieces and tie it, and one of the men with him hired a boat of Topley and took the boat across the river—Topley took Williams across to the Essex side—Williams had one end of the rope and he was landed and Topley turned back—I saw Turner on the Essex side when Williams landed and the deceased—Williams tied the rope round the deceased's waist—Kings<lb></lb>land, the man with the rope on my side, the Middlesex side, gave the signal by holding up a very small cat, quite a kitten—nothing was said on the Essex side—the man was shoved backwards into the water by Williams, and he scrambled back on to the bank again, and he was pushed in again by the same man-Lloyd and Kingsland pulled the rope three—fifths across the river, when it broke—the deceased was on his back with his head under the water—he sank and never came to the surface again—Lloyd and Kingsland walked away directly—Turner went away—in half an hour and ten minutes a man recovered the body with a boat-hook—there were several boats put out—while the rope was being tied in joints one of the prisoners said "He will be drowned," and the other made a foul expression and said "A good job too; his old woman won't miss</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M. WILLIAMS</hi>. I should say the public-house where I was sitting was barely a quarter of a mile from the scene of the occurrence—it was there I heard the observation made about coming to see something they had never seen before—I did not follow on until after the two men appeared on the opposite side—I then followed on to see what was going to happen—I saw the boat brought, and the rope taken across on the other side—I saw the deceased stand still while the rope was put round him—when the rope was fixed he stood quite clear of the brink of the water, the other persons on the other side having hold of the rope—deceased could not see the other prisoners on the other side of the river holding the rope, because he had his back to them—he was not allowed to look round—the rope was ferried across before he was tied—I believe he could see it ferried across—the signal was given—something was said—I cannot recollect the words—the cat was on the other side, not attached to the rope—Lloyd had the cat—they did not go and fetch the drags; the drags were brought—I saw somebody trying to help the man out with a scull-neither of the prisoners came back—I was not able to swim—if I had been, I should have been one of the first to help—I should say the width of the river Lea there is near upon 100 feet.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. AVORY</hi>. It was Lloyd who held up the cat—I know the difference between Lloyd and Kingsland—Kingsland had the rope at the time Lloyd held up the cat—he had hold of the loose end of—the rope that was hanging down, I don't know by which hand—Kingsland had hold of the rope at the same time, I swear that, at the time the cat was held up—the something that was said as a signal was on my side of the river; nothing was said on the opposite side—I did not say before the Magistrate "Kingsland held the cat up, and called out, all right!"—no one called out "all right"—I might have said so—the boat was there very shortly after—I don't know that it was the same boat that had taken the rope across—I swear that neither Lloyd nor Kingsland came back or had anything to do with the drags, or handing the rope to any other man—they did not bring the drags.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M. WILLIAMS</hi>. I said "Some one held up a cat with a handker<lb></lb>chief round its neck, and called out 'Is it all right?'—there was no answer to that, when a man on the bank with deceased put his hand on deceased's throat and put his foot behind the deceased, and threw him into the water."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> At the police-court, Turner was defended by a solicitor—I was not asked there whether either of the prisoners went for the drags, whoever it was; I am sure one of the two men held up the cat—the event occurred near the boat-house, where a number of boats are let out—Williams was ferried across by Topley, the boatman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Marval, who keeps a boat-house on the river Lea—on the 12th June, about 5.30, two or three men came, and one of them asked me to lend them a boat, or ferry one of them across—it was Williams—I only recognise Williams—he said they had got a wager on the measurement of the river—I ferried him across from the Middlesex side to the Essex side, with one end of the rope in his hand—Williams tied or placed the rope round the deceased man's waist, under the arm pits—Turner and Williams were on the Essex side at that time—Turner was several yards from Williams when he was tying the rope round Turner called to the men on the Middlesex side to know if they were ready, and I heard them shout out something, but what they said I cannot say—Turner said "Go," and Williams shoved the deceased man into the water—I was coming back with the boat from the Essex side to the Mid<lb></lb>dlesex side at the time—when Williams shoved him in the first time he fell on his hands and knees, and as he scrambled up Williams shoved him in again—they <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> him a little better than half across, the rope broke, and the man sunk—the men on the Middlesex side <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> him from the Essex side—he was on his back in the water; he splashed about—his face was under the water the whole of the time they were pulling him across—my back was towards those on the Middlesex side when I was coming back—I am sure I saw a cat—I cannot say which of the <hi rend="italic">men</hi> had got it—Williams came back and tried to get the man out with our drags—the depth of the water is about 10 feet; it gradually runs down from where he was pushed in—you can go out 9 feet before you come into 5 feet of water—I don't suppose it is more than half an inch at the edge.</p>

When the signal "All right! go" was given I was in my boat between the two shores, close to the Middlesex side—I could not hear everything that was said—that is all I heard—if they had got him the other side and the rope had not broken ho would have been all right—the width is 98 ft.—there wore several drags there in a few minutes—the prisoners did not fetch them, but the lookers on—I did not see what became of the prisoners—they had not gone for the drags—I saw other people bring the drags there, if the prisoners had gone for them the people down below would have known—I have said that "the deceased seemed quite willing that the rope should be tied round him."</p>

I am a boat builder, living at Pleasant Place, Lea Bridge—on the afternoon of the 12th June, a man was ferried across with a rope to the Even side—one end of the rope remained on the Middlesex side—I saw the deceased on the other side, and the rope tied round him, and he was pushed in—he got out again and was pushed in again—after that he was pulled half way across when the rope broke and ho never came up again—some attempt was made to save him by the man in the boat.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in St. Luke's, and am door-keeper at a mission hall—on Monday, the 12th June I was on the Essex side of the River Lea, and saw Turner there and a man tying the rope round the deceased's waist, and while tying the rope I heard Turner say "When you are ready I will start you." When they finished tying the rope I hoard a shout on the other side, and heard Turner say "Off you go"—I cannot say what the shout was—I then saw the same man who had been tying the rope push him into the water—he pushed him twice; he tried to get out the first time—I followed Turner, who went away after the man sank, towards Lea Road—I spoke to a police-constable, and he was given into custody.</p>

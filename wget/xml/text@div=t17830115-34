               <p>Are you sure that the person you stopped was the same? - Yes, I am sure of it, I am quite sure of him; he was only two or three seconds out of my sight; he did not run at all, he walked on pretty fast; and the corner was near my house.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was going a boxing, and waiting for a person to get up, I saw the prosecutor come running, and he said, Stop thief! I saw the prisoner and another man come along the street, talking together, as I thought; the prisoner was next to the wall, and the short man in a brown coat, was on the outside, on the prisoner's left hand; I saw the cloaths drop, but which dropped them I cannot pretend to say; I am sure it was one of the two, but which I cannot say; when the cloaths were dropped, the prisoner at the bar was three or four yards from the man; when I first saw them, they were together, and I think they were talking to one another; they were walking the same way.</p>
               <p>Did you see them speak to one another? As I thought; they were as far off, as to the middle of the yard.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot tell whether these men were together or not? - They were near to one another.</p>
               <p>So might any two men that were walking in the street: but can you swear that they were walking together? - I stopped the prisoner, and he said, what are you going to do with me, I am not the man that you want; and the man in the brown coat, he began to run, and run away; this man stood still.</p>
               <p>Court to Elbill. When did you first get sight of the man that had the cloaths? - As soon as I came to the door.</p>
               <p>In what situation were the cloaths? - Wrapped up under his arm.</p>
               <p>How long a view of him had you before he dropped the cloaths? - I take it about a minute.</p>
               <p>Was there any body walking with him? There was that man in the brown cloaths, but he had not the cloaths; the prisoner had the cloaths; I did not see them speak together; the other ran away before I took the prisoner: the prisoner did not run, he walked to the side of the houses, and dropped the cloaths by the side of the houses; they were by the side of each other.</p>
               <p>Court to Onions. Which was nearest to the man, the prosecutor or you? - Me.</p>
               <p>And you could not see which dropped the cloaths? - No, my lord, I could not.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was going of an errand; I heard the cry of, Stop thief! and I saw these cloaths picked up, about eight or ten yards off; I saw a man in brown, running on, and they took me: at the magistrates, the prosecutor said, he saw a man in a brown coat with the cloaths.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. What are you? - I <rs id="t17830115-34-deflabel211" type="occupation">deal in cloaths</rs>

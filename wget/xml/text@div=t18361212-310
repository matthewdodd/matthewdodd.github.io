                  </hi>. I am the nephew of Thomas Shearman, and am thirteen years old—I had been in the habit of being at my uncle's house—I remember meeting the two prisoners about three weeks ago—I knew them by sight a little—they asked me if I knew any of my friends whom I thought that they could rob—after some persuasion, I told them about my uncle—this took place in a house in St. Giles's-street—Noble and Dubes took me there—Noble said I had better go to my uncle's on Wed<lb></lb>nesday—I agreed to do so—I slept in their place that night—I went to my uncle's on Wednesday—Dubes said at first I had better go on Saturday, but Noble said on Wednesday—I went about half-past five o'clock to a public-house in the next street to my uncle's—we remained there about five minutes—when they came out Noble stood at the top of the street, and Dubes came and stood opposite to my uncle's door, and he told me to go up and get the box (I had told them that there was something in a box—the door was on the jar, and) I went in, and went up and got the box, and brought it down, and Dubes took it from me—I got it from the side of the bed in my uncle's room—Noble was at the top of the street, within sight—Dubes carried the box as far as Blackfriars-bridge, and then, Noble carried it—while Dubes carried it, Noble and I walked on the other side of the way—Noble said they had better not go through the City with it, they might be known and stopped—we were going to take it to Moore's house—we took it to St. Giles's, where we had slept, and Dubes broke it open with a piece of iron that they use for a poker—there were two girls in the room at the time—there were some spoons, I believe, wrapped up in a paper, but Dubes put them into his pocket, and the milk-pot too, and Noble put the gold into his pocket—he took it up so quick that I could not see what it was—there were sovereigns—I saw nothing else—there were three watches, a gold one, a silver one, and a metal one, and we had one a-piece—I had the gold one and Noble the silver one—after that they told the girls to burn the paper and the box, and we went down and took a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and rode a little below Leather-lane, and we got out, Noble and Dubes went into Mr. Alexander's, which is one the right-hand side down Field-lane, with the plate—I stood opposite the door, and Mr. Alexander stood at the door—and then a woman came and looked our—and then Mr. Alexander came and looked out, and then he went into</p>

The Prisoner deny'd the Fact, and said that the Prosecutor told her, that after the losing the Money, he went to a cunning Man, at the Golden Ball in Ratcliff High Way, and he had told him that a brown Woman had it, and it must be she; and that the Cunning Man told him, that the Money was not yet dispos'd of, and thereupon he told her, if she would own it, and give him the Money, he would take no farther Notice of it.

I locked the door; the window I fastened with a stick, that it might not slide back.

As soon as the prisoner saw me, he ran away; I overtook him in the space of twenty yards; he cannot run fast; he is a cripple. When I took him, I asked him where he had got that gown; he said, he found it; he gave it to the girl to pawn. I told him, I should take him to the office. Going along, he said, a young woman gave it him; he did not know who she was.</p>

               <p>Q. And did nothing to support yourself - A. No, sir. I knew the prisoner about a fortnight before he sent me with this gown to pawn. On the 1st of June he gave me this gown to pawn, and told me to ask seven shillings upon it. I stopped in the pawnbrokers five or ten minutes. Mr. Gillmore asked me where I got this gown. I came away from the pawnbroker's with Mr. Gillmore, and as I was returning I met Martin; I pointed him out to Gillmore. Martin walked away as fast as he could. I am sure I got the gown of Martin.</p>

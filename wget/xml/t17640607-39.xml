I remember the prisoner being at our house: my mistress and I came into the house together; she at one door, and I at another; I saw the prisoner with these cloaths; she was sitting in a box in the tap-room, (this was about four o'clock) tucking the things up, under her petticoats, and one of my young mistresses hanging sleeves hung down below her cloaths: I took the things from near the ground, under the bottom of her petticoats, (mentioning the things by name); one of the gowns belongs to me, the other things are the property of my master; they were taken from a table in the little parlour; I had seen them there about half an hour before. I asked her how she came to do such a thing? she put her hands together, and cry'd very much, and said, indeed I have not got any thing. I said, for what reason did you take them? she said, she took them for want.</p>

               <p>I had a pennyworth of beer, the sun was very hot: these things lay there; there was a great beast came in out of the yard, and tumbled them down from the bench: they were in the tap-room when I came in.</p>

               <p>Q. What day was it you lost your things? - A. I cannot tell exactly, it is this day three weeks; I live at <placeName id="t18040215-74-crimeloc417">No. 2, Cockpit-alley, Great Wild-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was she sober? - A. O yes, very sober; so simple that I could not draw a word out of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your things? - A. Yes, I took them away from her; I found every thing on her but the apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your bonnet on her? - A. Yes, and the cloak; my cap she gave me out of her pocket; my apron she said she had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say? - A. I could not make any thing of her, she seemed quite stupid.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are your things? - A. The cloak and bonnet I have on, I have no other, and this is the cap.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. You remember you catched me at the pawnbroker's shop; she came in a hurry, and tore the bonnet off my head; I said, will five shillings satisfy you; a man said he had five, but he would give seven, and she said she would not hurt a hair of my head.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Christie.) Did you say that you would not hurt a hair of her head? - A. Yes; I told her I only wanted her to come back and see if my work was safe.</p>

She has been a lodger in my house six months, I always found her honest, but she is always insane once a month, and has been confined for the same thing once before; a very honest woman when she is right in her head, and when she is so for a day then she comes too; it is owing to trouble that she had from a husband that is dead.</p>

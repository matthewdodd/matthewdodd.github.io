On the 27th of July, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon, Collingridge paid me a 20l. and a 5l. Bank note, three sovereigns, and 1s. 3d., for gold which I had sold him; when I went to bed I missed the Bank notes - I have no knowledge how I lost them; I am certain I neither paid them away nor gave them to any body.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.May you not have lost them out of your pocket? A. I missed them at eleven o'clock; I had walked home after receiving them, and cannot say I did not drop them from my pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What pocket did you put them into? A. My fob, I suppose, as I generally do.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Dexter, a pawnbroker, of Whitechapel. I have known the prisoner fourteen years. On Saturday evening, the 8th of August, he came to redeem some apparel and plate, amounting to about 4l., some of which had been pledged about a year, and was forfeited, but we let him have them; he paid me this 20l. note - I have written on it, "W. Webb, 4, Three Colt-lane:" Mr. Dexter took it from him, and gave it to me to write the name instantly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you know where he lived? A. I knew he lived in Dog row: he frequently pawned things - I had a very good opinion of him: he must know I knew where to find him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did he give you that as his then present address? A. Yes; I expected I should find him there -I saw him about three weeks after, and the next day Moore applied about the note.</p>

            . I was fetched to Dexter's shop, and apprehended the prisoner there, on the 28th of September; I asked him how he became possessed of the note - he replied that a man in Whitechapel, who owed him 5l. had given him the 20l. note, and he went to Dexter's to get it changed; I asked the man's name and address, and he refused to tell me either - he said the man had owed him the money nearly twenty years, and he met him accidentally; he afterwards said the man lived in some part of Devonshire.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner eight years; he rented a house of me in Colt-lane, and quitted it last May; he had given notice on the prior quarter, but left before quarter day, without my knowledge, and owed me 13l. 3s. 9d., for three quarters rent - he did not live there on the 8th of August; I was then in possession of the house - he had left it open.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that distress had caused him to leave the house, and contending that if he had stolen the note, he should not have passed it where he was so well known, and have called there three weeks after - and that not having a settled residence, he gave his address where he had last lived.</p>

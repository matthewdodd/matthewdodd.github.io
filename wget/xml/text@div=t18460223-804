                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable P</hi> 190.) On Thursday night, the 12th of Feb., I was watching the house of Mrs. Pope, and about eleven o'clock I saw Fanny Goldsmith come from her house, towards Camberwell—I stopped her when she got about 100 yards, and asked what she had got under her cloak—she said, "Some coals and wood"—I said, "Then you must go back with me to the house"—she produced two bags containing coals—she said she had them unknown to any one, and if I would let her go, she would take them back—I took her back, and Mrs. Pope gave her in charge—as I was taking her to the station she dropped a bag—I said, "You have dropped something"—she said, "I do not know anything about it"—it was a bag containing candles and soap—there was another policeman there, but there was no one else who could have dropped it—I took her to the station, and returned to Mrs. Pope's—the prisoner Mary Ann was there, and Mrs. Pope gave her in charge—I was taking her to the station—she said she knew no<lb></lb>thing about the things that were taken—she went a little further, and then said, "I suppose we shall both be transported"—I then went with Mr. Campbell to Fauny Goldsmith's house—I found there several articles of stolen property, and some duplicates—these are them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the P division of police. I was at the station on Thursday night, the 12th of Feb.—the prisoner Fanny was brought in—I asked where she resided, she gave her address at No. 11, George-street, Camberwell, in the back parlour—she gave up some keys, and said the large key was the key of the parlour door; I should find nothing there but what was her own—I went and found a great quantity of things,</p>

               <p>here is a candlestick, some remnants of carpet, a printed book, a roasting-jack, a china-pot, a pot of jam, a jug, and a butter print—the officer who was with me found some duplicates—I found some sugar, some candles, and some coffee, I went back to the station and told Fanny the next morning what I bad found—Isaid, "You said I should find nothing but what was your own"—she said, "I have done very wrong; I was wrong to do it, but distress for want of mans to pay my rent induced me; my child is innocent."</p>

I had a party, and Fanny was there, assisting her daughter in the kitchen—I had only employed her on that, and on one former occasion, but I have known her to be there on Sunday evenings, to see her daughter—these are my articles—I do not know when I lost them—I know I had some of them since Mary Ann has been with me—I kept the grocery goods and candles in a kitchen cupboard—it is usually locked and my daughter keeps the key and gives out the things—on the 12th of Feb. the cupboard was open most of the day—Fanny was at the house that day—she left at night and the policeman brought her back.</p>

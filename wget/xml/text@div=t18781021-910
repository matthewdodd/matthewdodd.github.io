                  </hi>. I am employed in the small arms department of the Tower, and live at 10, Barclay Terrace, Leytonstone, exactly opposite the prosecutor—on 11th August, about 9.30 p.m, my daughter spoke to me, and knowing that Mr. and Mrs. Marsden were away I watched, and saw a light moving on the stairs—I sent for Mr. Bland, who had the keys, and who lives two doors from me—we knew by the shadows that more than one person was in the house—Mr. Metcalfe came up, and Mr. Bland and my son—I posted myself at the back, and saw a light at the upper back window extinguished, and heard steps going down to the kitchen, the window of which was open; they had got in there—they came to the window, but I could not see how many there were—somebody called out "You had better surrender; if you resist you will be fired upon"—some one said that they had gone to the front; I ran to the front; they pulled the door open on the chain, and then I heard the report of a pistol—I went to the back, and found that Mr. Bland had been knocked down by a man who has escaped—he said "Take hold of him, I will go after the other"—I saw another man being chased round the back garden—if you get over the wall there yon get into a vacant plot; of ground called Mornington Road and Wellesley Road—I saw the man dodging about there across the garden, and he made a spring at the wall—I ran to the side door to intercept him, but he did not get over, and I ran to the front and spoke to a neighbour—I then went with Kitchen to the police-station, and the prisoner was brought there without a hat; he said "What am I here for? search me"—a short time afterwards a person brought a hat and said "You have lost your hat, is this it?"—he took it in his hand, hesitated a moment, and put it on—he answers in form and build and height to the man who was dodging about in the garden, but I did not see his face—it was a bright moonlight night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. About 10 minutes elapsed from the time the alarm was given at 9.30 to the time the man sprang out at the window—Kitchen was arrested immediately—I got to the station about 10, and the prisoner was brought in in a quarter of an hour, and the hat a quarter of an hour after him—as I went to the station I saw a light hawker's cart at the end of Barclay Road, and a young man in it who came to the station the same evening when the two men were in custody—I think only four persons were in the back garden, and not more than eight or nine in front with my wife and daughters—the pistol shot called a number of persons out.</p>

On Sunday night 11th August, about 9.30, I was returning home—I received information, went to the back of Mr. Marsdens house, and stationed myself eight or ten paces from the kitchen window, which was open, with a pistol—I heard a noise inside, two men came to the window, I called out to them to come out, otherwise we were determined to have them—there was a little hesitation, and I heard parties going to the</p>

               <p>front door—I attempted to close the window, but could only close it six or eight inches—they came back from the front door to the back door, to the kitchen window—I stepped back a little and waited, and one of them shouted out, "Now, old fellow, make room, we are coming"—I said, "All right, come along"—the window was opened and two men with hats on looked out and made a dash to go down the garden; I immediately closed with them with my friend, and received a stinging blow, and down we went into the shrubbery; we had a struggle there, but the man got up and got away—I had fired the pistol before I received the blow—I know the law' better now than I did then—I had an ordinary hat on—the man want down the garden without his hat and attempted to get over the wall, but I pulled him back—I had only one hand to hold him and he got into my garden—I then looked for my hat but could not find it—I went to the front of the. house and saw the prisoner without a hat, in Goher's custody—I went back and found my hat where I had the struggle, and another hat within a foot or two of it, I gave it to the policeman—the prisoner is the man I saw in custody to the best of my knowledge—it was not the wounded man—the man who got away from my grasp was middle-sized, pale, with a roundish face, rather dark hair, and dressed in dark clothes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>.

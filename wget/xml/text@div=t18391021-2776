                  </hi>. I live in Summer's-court, Stepney Causeway. I occupy the whole house, and sleep in a room down stairs—the prisoner lived next door with her father and mother. On Saturday, the 5th of Oc<lb></lb>tober, when I came home at twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner was in the house nursing my child—I took the child from her—she went out, and I shut the door, and between one and two o'clock I heard a noise in the house, but did not know who it was—having a little dog, I took no notice of it—between three and four o'clock in the morning, as I came to the street-door, I caught the prisoner coming out of the window of the down stairs room—there was five-pence farthing found on the side of her father's scraper on the Sunday morning—a halfpenny of the money I can swear to—I was awoke by hearing a noise—my wife turned round, and said, "How cold it is," and I found the window open—I saw the prisoner go towards the window—I ran out at the door, and caught her coming out of the win<lb></lb>dow—she said it was not her—it was a man who had run up the court—she immediately went and knocked at her father's door—her father came down and took her out of my arms—I called a policeman, who took her soon after—I had secured my window with a gimlet, which went right through the two sashes, but a nail outside would push it in, to open it—I know this halfpenny by its being burnt—I swear it is one of those I lost—I had put a four-penny piece and other money in my hat on the table, which was moved from one part of the table to another.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. On the night in ques<lb></lb>tion I awoke between three and four o'clock, I turned round, and saying how cold it was, I saw somebody moving, and go towards the window, but I did not know who it was till I heard her scream out, when my husband secured her—she said, "It is not me, it is a man who has gone down the court"—I should know her from a hundred—I could tell by her voice that it was the prisoner—I know it was a female in the room, by her clothes—I picked up 5 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. by her father's scraper, at five o'clock that morning—my husband had put some money in his hat on the table that night.</p>

Early in the morn<lb></lb>ing in question I heard a knocking at the door in James-place—I went to the spot, and saw the prosecutor with the prisoner in his arms, at her father's door—I saw her dragged from his arms inside, and the door was closed—in consequence of what the prosecutor said, I knocked at the door—the father opened it, and I took the prisoner into custody—she said she did not take the money, but it was a man who came out of the win<lb></lb>dow, and ran up the court—I said, "There was no man run up the court"—I took her to the station-house, but found nothing on her.</p>

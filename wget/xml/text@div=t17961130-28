            , at Harrow.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Rolse's Christian name? - A. Ralph; Rolse was upon the poney, he drove, and I was in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get out of the cart? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you get out of the cart? - A. Rolse on the poney called to me, I got out with a fork in my hand, and the prisoner came directly to me with a pistol in each hand, he told me, if I did not lay the fork down, he would blow my guts out; then I told him I would not, I was afraid to strike him, being near the outside of the road; I fell back on the ground, directly he jumped over me, and stood across me while I was down, and told me he would immediately blow my guts out, if I did not deliver my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the pistols then in his hands? - A. Yes, one in each; I could not get the money out of my pocket, he said, he would blow my guts out if I did not deliver the money immediately; as soon as Rolse came back again, I gave him the money, three guineas and a half in gold, and five shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it then? - A. In a canvas bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver it to him? - A. Yes; Rolse was close to my assistance; I said, Rolse, he has got my money, but he has not hurt me; directly the prisoner tired at me, I had just got up then, I have the powder on my coat now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner hit you? - A. No, he singed my coat.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was Rolse from you at that instant? - A. He was close to me then; the prisoner turned to look the contrary was to which Rolse was coming, and we were all three together the moment he fired; the first blow that Rolse gave him, shook the pistol, and hurt his hand, the next blow, he knocked him down; we could not take him then because he was so strong.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you take him at last? - A. Rolse took up the horse-pistol he had dropped, and hit him three or four times; I said, hold, hold, the money dropped out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any man come to your assistance? - A. Yes, a man came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure him? - A. Yes; we all three took him to a public-house, and he was brought to town.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He has mentioned a great many things that were not done, I never fired the pistol.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The prisoner would have me ask you whether he fired at you or not? - A. He could not but fire once, the powder is on my coat now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never offered to blow the man's belly out, I told him I would not hurt him.</p>
               <p>Witness. He told me afterwards, he did not mean to hurt me, but only to frighten me.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. On the 12th of November, I was with Amour; as I was going from London to Harrow, near <placeName id="t17961130-28-crimeloc146">Chelseareach</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you hear or see any thing done? - A. No, not till I got back; when I came back, he took his leg from off Amour, and looked towards London; Amour said, he has got my money, but he has not hurt me; the prisoner at the bar turned round, and fired directly at Amour, I was near enough to knock him down when he fired; I hit at his head, and he held the pistol up to save himself; I knocked him on the hand, and the money dropped out of his hand; I hit him again two or three times, and Amour said, hold, hold, and then we took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, the blow that the man struck me on the right arm, caused the pistol to go off; I fired no pistol in my life; I never hurt any body, nor bought a pistol in my life time; that was the person that the pistol went off at, and the pistol dropped directly; I never offered to fire at them; I dropped the pistol and purse, they knocked me down, I lost the use of my arm, they laid on me with a dung fork as hard as they could, I begged for mercy, I was all over blood, one of them then said, don't hit him any more; they both got me up, I never offered to touch either of them, they took me to a public-house; I begged of them to wipe my face, the blood was caked on my eyes; I said, for God Almighty's sake, let me go as I am, I have not hurt you, I have not got your money; in the public-house, there came more farmers, I sat upon the bench bleeding a great deal, one came with his first, and knocked me along the bench; I then begged them not to strike me, for I had had enough before; some few minutes before that, they put me in the cart, and took me out again, a man in a brown coat, said, I would blow your brains out for a farthing, he took his first and and struck me on my side, and nothing but corrupted blood comes from me night and day, upwards and downwards; that did not do, I was hand-cussed in the cart, and that gentleman tied my two hands, he beat me on the back till I had not a free place upon me; I have been in the infirmary, and could never sit up in my bed; after I was in the cart, I never offered to stir the least in the world.</p>

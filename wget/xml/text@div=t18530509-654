                  </hi>. On 28th April, the prisoner Turner came to my father's shop for half an ounce of tobacco, which came to three halfpence; he gave me a shilling—I said, "This is bad;" be said, "Is it?" I said, "Yes, and you know it," and gave it back to him—he then asked for a pennyworth of tobacco, and paid me with a good penny, and went out—I saw Weyland looking in at the window.</p>

On 28th April, about 1 o'clock, I was on duty, and saw the prisoners in Bermondsey; they stopped frequently and conversed together—they turned into Arbour-place, Rotherhithe, and stopped at Mr. Johnson's shop—they then spoke together; Wayland walked On about ten yards, and Turner went into the shop—Weyland kept looking in at the window—Turner came out, but just before that Weyland moved away from the window—I went into the shop and saw Miss Johnson, who told me something, and I went after Weyland and took him—finding his right hand closed, I asked what he had in it; he said, "Nothing;" we forced his hand open, and found two pieces of paper, in each of which was a counterfeit shilling—I handed him over to another constable, went after Turner, took him, and found a bad shilling on him—I told him I took him for being concerned with another young man in attempting to pass bad money—he said he had not seen any other young man.</p>

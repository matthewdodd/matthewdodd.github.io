               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been left any papers of Mr. Hawkins, the husband of the prisoner, in the care of your father. - A. There had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at the bar apply for leave to inspect these papers. - A. Yes. About six months back she applied, she was allowed to come and look at them from time to time; the two first times she came there was a person to watch her; after that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170078"></xptr>there was not. I suppose she came seventy or eighty times.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they placed in a garret by which she would have to go near any quantity of books, papers, and parchment. - A. There were books and spars in the garret, and in the lost there were papers and parchment.; she would have to pass by the door of the garret where the books were, but she had not to go through, the door was not locked, nor was the door of the lost locked where the papers and parchments were.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing that you had discovered, did you go with Dorrington, the officer, to the Plough in Carey street. - A. I did, on the 4th of July; the son was drinking in the tap room. When I went there he requested me to walk in his own apartment, the first floor, in which he informed me there were books of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. In that room in which he took you, did you find any books belonging to you. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Q. Had the son ever access to that lost for the purpose of searching. - A. He had been there about a dozen times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to tell my learned friend that the son has been there a dozen times, perhaps he has been there more. - A. I think more.</p>
               <p>Q. He has run away. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with this woman. - A. I have heard of her from my infancy, but not personally acquainted with her.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that box, examine it all over, and tell me whether it is the box. - A. I think it is, it was just such a box as that I helped her down stairs.</p>

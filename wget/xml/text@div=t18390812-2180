                  </hi>. I am barman to William Carruthers, who keeps the Mason's Arms in Upper Berkeley-street. On the 11th of June the pri<lb></lb>soner came to my employer's house, from half-past four to five o'clock in the afternoon, to inquire the price of stout—I told her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she or<lb></lb>dered me to send half-a-dozen to Mrs. Daniell, 5, George-street, Portman<lb></lb>square—I did not know that Mrs. Daniell lived there, but I knew a Mrs. Daniell in Seymour-street—she tendered me a cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for which I gave her change—she desired the stout should be very mild, as it was for the wet-nurse—I gave her two £5 notes—I cannot say whether I gave her the rest in gold, or how—I deducted for the stout—next morning I gave the cheque to Mr. Carruthers—I had kept it in the desk with other cash—I am sure I gave him the cheque I received from the prisoner—I had no other cheque at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Dixon, of Lower Eaton-street, Russell-square. On 13th Aug., E. Larner, jun., came to our shop, about half past 5 o'clock; she asked for a tea kettle, I showed her a three pint one—it was not large enough; I showed her a three quart one, and told her the price was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. she said it was too high—she looked round the shop a long time, and asked the price of a coffee pot—I showed her a small one, the price was 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; she said it was very cheap, and after a long consideration she said she would have it—I then offered her the coffee pot and the largest tea kettle for half a crown—while this took place Vaughan came in for a can; I told him to wait while I served the female—the female took the coffee pot, and paid me half a crown; I gave her change, a shilling, a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and the rest in coppers—I put the half crown in the till where there was no other silver—she went away with the coffee pot, and I then showed Vaughan some cans; he said they were too high, and his good lady in Eaton-place would call—I gave him a card of the shop, and he went away—this is the coffee pot that I sold to the younger female—I noticed that the half crown she gave me was very shiny, and there were two marks on it—it was afterwards passed to a female, and I received it again at 10 o'clock the next morning—(that female is not in a state to attend the Court)—I recognised the half crown again by the marks on it—I gave it to the policeman—this is it.</p>

I saw the elder female and Vaughan. in Banelagh-street, about 20 minutes before 6 o'clock in the afternoon—I watched them, and saw them meet the younger female, who had a coffee pot with her, at the bottom of Eaton-lane—they talked together, and then proceeded together to Victoria-square—the two females then went into an ironmonger's shop, and Vaughan crossed the road and looked into the shop—I saw the two females come out of the shop, Vaughan joined them, and they all went into the Bag of Nails public house—I saw them in the bar—they left together, and went to Victoria-square, and stood at the corner of Albert-street—Vaughan took a tub and a coffee pot from the younger female, and she and Vaughan proceeded to the King's Head—the elder prisoner stood about ten yards off—the younger female came out of the public house and joined the elder female, and they went to Mr. Groves's.</p>

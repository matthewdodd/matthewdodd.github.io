                  </hi>. I was left in charge of Lady Clinton's house, on Hampton Court green. On the morning of 2nd Jan. I heard a noise, when I was in bed, between 4 and 5 o'clock—it sounded like the unfastening of a door bolt—I missed the lead in the afternoon of the same day—it was over the front door—it is a little sort of colonnade, with about five or six columns extending along the front of the house—it is covered with lead—only a small piece was gone—I saw it safe about a day or two before—it belonged to Lady Frances Isabella Clinton.</p>

On Friday night, 2nd Jan., I received some information from last witness—she pointed out some particular place to me—I went to Mr. Cooper's the next morning—I got a piece of lead from him—I called in a plumber on the Monday afternoon, and took the lead that I got from Mr. Cooper to the colonnade—it fitted—there were nail holes in the lead, and there were corresponding nails and holes on the colonnade—I am quite certain it fitted—I produce the lead—there is a piece of wood attached to it that fits the woodwork at the top of the colonnade.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a rag merchant. The two prisoners came together with the lead produced, on Friday evening between 7 and 8 o'clock—they had been before in the day, about 12 or 1 o'clock, and bought some goods of me, which I have entered in this book—I bought rags and bones of them—Williams</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185702020102"></xptr>
               <p>asked me the price of lead—I said I would give him 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a hundred weight—he said he expected Cordery would bring some, but it would be nothing to do with him—I was then at our shop in Thames-street, at Kingston—Cordery was with Williams, but I believe he was outside, and did not hear him—I stated before the magistrate that Cordery was with Williams—he was with him, but I do not know whether he was outside or inside—I do not know whether he heard the conversation or not; my impression is that he did—they came again in the evening, both of them—Williams was at the shop, and said that Cordery was at the warehouse with the lead—I went down to the warehouse to weigh it—Cordery was there with the lead in a donkey cart—the shop is about five minutes' walk from the warehouse—I weighed the lead, and took the weight and went up to the shop to pay for it—while I was coming up, Cordery asked me if I had a bit of rag, as the donkey was bleeding—I gave him a bit of rag, and he went out, and presently he came back and took the money, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in my presence—my father gave it to him—Williams was not there—I have it entered here (<hi rend="italic">producing a book</hi>)—it was entered the same day that the transaction took place—I have entered it in the name of Williams, as I always book to Williams what I buy of him—I did not think there was anything dishonest about it—I have got down, "paid Cordery"—I put that there at the time—there is "18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—that means, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a hundred weight—I knew Cordery before—I had been in the habit of buying of them for a long time—Williams had not returned before Cordery took up the money—he came in afterwards—I did not hear him say anything more—in a former entry his name is down as "John Williams"—sometimes I entered it as "John Williams," and sometimes as "Mr. Williams"—I am quite sure that Williams told me he had nothing to do with it, but that it was Cordery's matter entirely—that is the piece of lead produced, which I gave up to the officer—Williams was not present at all at the time Cordery made the bargain for the lead—Williams was at the shop, and Cordery at the warehouse—they both go about the country gathering marine stores, and selling them to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Williams. Q.</hi> When I came to your place, what time was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some time in the middle of the day—when you asked me the price of lead, you told me you had a little lead and brass—it might have been mixed up with the bones I bought of you—when you came over to me the second time you did not ask me if I had bought any lead, you said Cordery had gone down; I knew you meant to the warehouse—you said you had come after some pairs of scissors Which my father had promised you, and my father gave them to you as a Christmas box for your daughter—the warehouse is on the water side, the shop is on the right hand from the bridge, and the warehouse on the left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Williams's Defence.</hi> After we had bought the brass we went to the King's Arms tap, and had something to drink; we called for some meat, and they went for some; Ringham said he had some lead to sell, and wanted 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and Cordery went out, and I suppose he had it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cordery's Defence.</hi> I saw Ringham, and went out with him to the cor<lb></lb>ner of the Green, and there was the lead; Ringham said he wanted 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it; I said, "That is worth it, and I will give you 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, is it right?" he said, "Yes," and I took it to Mr. Cooper's.</p>

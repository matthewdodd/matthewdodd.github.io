            . I am a publican and farmer - I live at Brick wall, in Herts. On Thursday, the 18th of October, the prisoner and another person came to my house, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, and brought two mares and a gelding - the mares were both black - the other man gave me orders about the mares - he told me to turn them to grass till Saturday morning - I believe the prisoner was within hearing - while I was in the stable I asked the other man if he was disposed to sell one of the mares, not the one in question.</p>
               <p>Q. When they went away, who mounted the gelding? A. The prisoner - the other went away first, a little before him - they had not paid for the keep of the mares - I called after them to say so, and the other man said he would come on Saturday, and pay it altogeter, but he did not come - on Sunday evening, about six o'clock, the prisoner came, and said his master, being detained late at market on Friday night, could not come down that night, but would come on Monday night or Tuesday morning, but he did not come; I asked the prisoner if he intended to go back that night - he said he thought of doing so. as he had to meet his master the next morning in Smithfield - after he had some refreshment, I asked if he was authorised to sell or exchange the mares; he said, Yes; I told him his master talked about 18l. for the other mare (not for this). but perhaps he might take less, it being out of condition; I asked if he was authorised to sell or exchange either of them - he said he was, or words to that effect; I proposed to try the other mare, (which was claimed by Mr. Mash) the following morning, but on the following morning I told him I suspected they were stolen - I had had an officer there all night; the prisoner had slept in my house that night, in the same room with the officer, and myostler, but I had not told him the man was an officer, and he did not know it. I said to him next morning, in the officer's presence, "I strongly suspect these horses are stolen, and before you leave here, you must go before a Magistrate;" as he had not come for the mares at the time appointed, I thought it my duty to go to the Magistrate, to ask what I was to do - he rather objected to go to the Magistrate; he said, "I never stole a horse in my life, and I am afraid you want to put me in the watch-house;" he said, "My master has got a relation who lives at Dyer's farm, and he will come forward and say the horses are not stolen." The horses were afterwards owned, one by Mr. Mash, and the other by Mr. Starkey; I delivered Mr. Starkey's to his servant. Knowing there was a person of the description he gave me, I let him go, but called him back when he got twenty or thirty yards, and we went before Mr. Faithful, the Magistrate; he took some depositions down in writing. The mares had not then been claimed.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, before you went before the Magistrate, did he say any thing to you about where the mares came from? A. I asked him, and he said they came from Brentwood fair, which was held on the Monday, to Royston fair on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that he and his companion came from Brentwood fair? A. He said one mare was bought at Brentwood fair, and the other at Royston; he was discharged by the Magistrate, and did not come back for the mares; neither he, nor any other person came for them - they were left with me, and afterwards claimed by Mash and Mr. Starkey's servant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This is the second trial we have had about these mares? A. Yes - he was indicted for stealing the other, and acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. You used the term "Master" - did not Holden, who came with him, appear more respectable dressed than the prisoner? A. He was certainly more respectable than the prisoner, but not very respectable; the prisoner treated him as if he was his master all through.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you consider him as acting as the servant? A. Not exactly so - I asked him about his master, but, from a conversation which took place, I asked him if he was authorised to sell it, thinking he was concerned; they came to the gateway together - Holden came to the stable first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Holden say one or other of them would come back? A. I think his words were "Take them to grass till Saturday morning, and we will come and take them." The prisoner was within hearing when I asked Holden if he would sell it - I afterwards asked the prisoner if he was authorised to sell it; Holden did not come back: I had been before the Magistrate about the mares, before the prisoner came back, and made it known that I suspected they were stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner tell you he had been to several fairs, where Holden had chapped and sold horses? A. I think he said he had been with him about three months; he did not say he had been to several fairs - he said he had been with him three months, and his employment was to ride and run horses for him, as well as for other dealers; I remember his saying his father lived at a cottage at Hackney-wick; he said that before the Magistrate, and he was taken up there, I believe, but I was not present.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. You say, when they first came, the other acted more as master? A. Yes, but my opinion was afterwards changed; I did not make my suspicions public - I only went to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell other people besides the Magistrate, that you thought the horses were stolen? A. I did: he told the Magistrate one mare was bought at Brentwood fair, and the other at Royston - and I believe he said so to me, as we went to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. After he was discharged did he give any other account? A. Not to my knowledge - he left me very soon afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060044"></xptr>JOHN VANN. I keep the White Lion public-house, Hackney-wick. I have known the prisoner four years and a half, perfectly well - I know John Holden and John Hilt- Hilt had lived with me twelve months, as ostler, and left me in September; I never knew he was a horse-dealer, and I have only heard that Holden was a horse-dealer; I do not know what business he was. During the time Hilt was in my service he attended to the the tap-room when he had time to spare; Newman and Holden occasionally came in, and they seemed very friendly together; I have seen the prisoner on the road to Hackney-marsh since Hilt left me; I suppose Holden to be about twenty-three or twenty-four years old.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you have seen hundreds on the road to the marsh? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a horse-patrol, at Hackney, and have been so six months. I know the prisoner, also Holden and Hilt - Holden lived in North-street, Cambridge-heath, and Newman in Wick-lane, about half a mile from Holden - I have seen both of them frequently together with the prisoner; Hilt has been a waiter; he was not a horse-dealer, nor a stable-keeper; I know they were all three acquainted - I have been looking for Newman, Holden, and Hilt, neither of whom I could find. Newman was apprehended by another person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have not been able to find Holden? A. No; he is a thin man - he does not go respectably dressed: he has absconded. The prisoner's father's cottage is in Wick-lane - it was Goddard who took him up: his father has a family.</p>

            . I live on a small income, at Hitchen, in Herts. I know the prisoner perfectly well; I saw him at Hitchen in October, but I cannot say on what day; it was near the middle, I think, and on a Thursday, to the best of my recollection; he was with a person taller than himself; I followed them into the stables of the Cock public-house, at Hitchen; they had two black mares and a poney; the other man asked me if I would buy one of the mares; the prisoner was in the stable with him, and must have heard it - my answer was, that I did not want a horse of any kind; the taller man pressed me very much to make a chap with him, if I had any horse likely to suit him; I said I had got a poney which I should be glad to part with, and would sell him, but I would not chap - he proposed going to my premises, to look at the poney, which I objected to, and sent for it, but we did not deal; I did not see them leave the town.</p>

            . I am a horse-patrol. I apprehended the prisoner about the 12th of November, at his father's cottage, Wick-lane. I had been looking for him for a week or more, and could not find him. I told him I apprehended him for felony, and asked what he had done with the horses which were stolen out of the marsh; he said he would tell me every thing. I said, "Mind, I don't hold out any promise," and cautioned him; he then said he went in company with Hilt in the green lanes, where be received the two horses, and took them to Enfield-highway - that he gave his right name, and might have sold the horses over and over again if he chose.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you ever asked him what name he went by? A. I knew his name was George Newman, but his nickname was Crummy Newman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say they rode off the marsh? A. Yes; we had a deal of conversation; he said he was in bed, and was called up, and accompanied Hilt and Holden into the marsh, and helped them to catch the two mares.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell one word of this on the last trial? A. I do not think I did. I expected to have been asked these questions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say, if he had any intention of stealing them, he might have sold them? A. He did - I believe. I had been looking for him frequently, past his father's house, and had been to the house and enquired of his mother - I suppose it was; she knew I was an officer very well. I found him at the house afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Monday, the 15th of October, Holden, my master, came to my father's house at five o'clock in the morning, and asked me to take two horses to the Red Lion public-house, Enfield-high way, and he would give me half a crown; he told me to come towards the White Hart public-house, and when I got there, these two horses were there, and Hilt; he gave me half a crown to pay the turnpike and my expences, and the rest for myself; he told me to take the horses, wait there till he came, and tell the horse-keeper to feed them, and he would pay. Hilt came with me as far as Lee-bridge-road; the ostler asked me whose they were - I said Holden's, my master, of Hackney. On the same evening, Holden came down with another horse, and told me to stop all night with him; next morning he asked me to go to Royston fair, and he would pay me for it; we went on Tuesday night, and on Wednesday he changed one away for a horse. On Thursday he left these horses at Batten's - he paid for every thing; he bought another horse about a mile and a half from Battens', and rode home; he left me that night, and on Friday night sent to me to go to Batten's, and tell him he should not come for them till Monday night, or Tuesday morning, which I did, and was taken before a Magistrate; he gave me 13s. for what I did for him.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

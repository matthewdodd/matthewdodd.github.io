            What had you to do at this house? - The person at the Charing-Cross Inn gave me directions to this house, and I shewed the watchman my directions, and he told me to keep up the court, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150016"></xptr>would follow me. I went to Mrs. Hannow to enquire for lodgings.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hire any? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. What were the things in? - In two bundles.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - Between ten and eleven at night; after I got into the lodgings, the prisoner, he came and pulled me from the window, and swore that he would be the death of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts in the house did you put the bundles? - I paid the woman, Mrs. Hannow, a shilling for my night's lodging; and I asked her, if I was to shut the room door, she said, no, there were two or three other girls to come into the same room. I went into the room with a candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you by yourself there? - Yes. I was undressed, and in bed, when they robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put the bundles? - By the bedside; after that a young woman came up, and took my bundles from my bedside, and took my pockets from under my head, and took a guinea out of my pocket; there were two more women with her.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any man with them? - Yes, that gentleman that stands at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were three girls in the room, and the prisoner at the bar? - Yes. I asked them, what they were doing with my pockets, and they said, d-n your eyes, you b-ch, I will be the death of you, he said, if I would not hold my d-nation tongue, he would put a handkerchief down my throat; after that, the prisoner at the bar, and the women pushed me down stairs, and throwed a pail of water over me. I had put my petticoat on, and I had my gown in my hand, and I throwed that over me, and I saw the same watchman that recommended me to the lodging, I asked him which was the way to the watch-house, he stood at the end of the court; I asked him, if he would be so kind as to recommend me to the watch-house? he said, yes, keep straight down; I kept straight down, and got to the watch-house, and I saw some gentlemen there; an old gentleman, the officer of the night, I desired them to go with me to Charing-Cross; I told them what had happened, he went with me to the Charing-Cross Inn, and they were not up.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go to the Charing-Cross Inn for? - The constable went to know, whether there was such a person as me there the overnight; they did not get up, we went again in the morning. I staid with them in the watch-house till the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You talked of two bundles at first. Do you know what became of these bundles? - The girls took them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the girls since? - No, only one, I think I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the man again? - I did not see him till four or five days after that.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see him again? - The gentleman, the officer, brought him over.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to bed, of course, you had a candle in your room? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am one of the beadles of the parish of St. Martin's in the fields. On the 2d of January, on Thursday morning, two officers belonging to Westminster brought the prosecutrix to me, and informed me in what manner she had been robbed, and where; in consequence of that I took her into Johnson's-court, she pointed out the court and shewed me the second house, that is where Mrs. Hannow lives; there are three houses. I went into almost every room of the three houses, she pointed out the house with a little hesitation whether it was the first or second, I went into all the three on that side; she confined herself to one side, and I took her into all the rooms and shewed her all the women that were at home then; she did not seem to know any of their faces at all; I came back again to the first house, and went up again to the two pair of stairs room in the first house, and then she signified that was the room she was robbed in; we had been in the house before; the first time she signified that was the room but not to a certainty; then we went back, and she fignified that was the room; I then asked her respecting to the man; she then told me that it was a man with a round hat, and described the man; it exactly corresponded with the description she has given now; I went and made an inquiration after the prisoner at the bar, from the description she had given me, I had seen the prisoner in that sort of dress many times, I did not know that he lived in Johnson's-court; in consequence of making an coquiry after him in the forenoon and did not find him, in the afternoon I went into Chandos-street, into a public house, the prisoner came to me and told me that he had heard that there was an information against him for a very disagreeable circumstance, and told me that in consequence of that he would surrender himself up; in consequence of that, between six and seven in the evening I took him before Mr. Addington, the prosecutrix not being there that night, we were not examined, but were ordered to attend on the Monday following, at the re-examination, this was on Thursday night the day after the robbery.</p>


               <p>Q. Then on Monday following he did attend? - Yes, and the prosecutrix saw him, and swore that was the man, in consequence of that he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the man lodge, do you know? - Upon my word I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have found nothing at all about him? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of the things that this woman lost? - I have not, I have made first enquiry at several pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner at the bar? - I understand him to be belonging to a recruiting party.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Mr. Const. You do not mean to say that he had altered his dress, he wore his blue coat over his other being cold weather? - Nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. When she came to you she described the man having such regimentals? - She did.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of which, as soon as he reasonably could he found you out? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And then he desired to go before a magistrate, and you took him to Bow-street? - Exactly so.</p>

               <p>Q. When he went there he was dressed as usual? - I think he was.</p>

               <p>Court. Had you, at different times, seen the other persons that were in recruiting parties? - He always dressed different from the rest; the jacket he wore was more smart; they did nor all wear a red coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other of the recruiting parties dressed in red besides this man? In short how came you to suspect this man? - By the prosecutrix telling me that he wore a feather in his hat, and a jacket trimmed in a different manner to what soldiers jackets generally are; I don't know that she described it as a jacket.</p>

After that the headle came to my house to enquire for him, and I asked what was the matter? he said he did not know. When Barrett came in, I said to him, Barrett, the beadle has been here, there is something the matter; says he, I will go down to Charing Cross and see what it is, and he went away, and he came back again in the course of three quarters of an hour; this might be about twelve o'clock, and he told me that he had heard some scandalous affair of him, and he wanted to know where the officer was to be found; then I being ill, my wife went with him where the officer was.</p>

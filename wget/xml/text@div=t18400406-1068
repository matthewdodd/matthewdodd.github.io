                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of the G division. When Henry was brought to the station-house, I saw him in the lock-up place, I took this handkerchief off his neck, and asked where he got it—he said he bought it in Petticoat-lane about three weeks ago—I received this notched chisel from the sergeant at the station-house—it was left in charge there by Cousins—these chisels can be bought with or without bandies—this cor<lb></lb>responds with the one found on Fellowes in the handle, the maker's name, and in every respect except being a size smaller—there it nothing extra<lb></lb>ordinary in them—they appear to have been handled by a person who did not understand using them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Hampton-street, Gray's Inn-lane. On Monday night, the 17th of February, I passed through Mecklenburg-square, a little after eight o'clock, as I was coming home—before I came to Heath<lb></lb>cote-street I observed a man on the left-hand side in Mecklenburg-street, loitering about, and when I came to Heathcote-street I saw two men on the left-hand side—No. 12 is on that side—they appeared in company together—the lesser one stood at the edge of the pavement, with his hands in his pocket—they did not appear to wish any body to see they were acquainted together, but they appeared from their manner to be acquainted—I had suspicion of them, and turned round and looked at them—there is</p>

               <p>no thoroughfare through Heathcote-street—Fellowes is just the height and size of the one who stood on the edge of the pavement with his hands in his pocket—his face is very familiar to me, but I cannot tell where I have seen him—the other man was walking down towards me when I first saw him, as if coming out of Heathcote-street—he walked to the end of Heathcote-street, then turned round, and walked back again, past the one who stood at the edge of the pavement—that was Henry—I had seen him several times in the street before—he has every appearance of being the man—I believe it was him—I had seen him about before—I had suspicion, and stopped to look at him for about five minutes.</p>

The prisoner Fellowes lodged with me four or five weeks before Monday, the 17th of February—he did not come home to sleep that night—he had slept at my house for three successive nights before that—on the Tuesday, the night after the robbery he slept at my house—he came home in liquor that night—he was in my debt before the Monday, and in distressed circumstances—he had deposited a shirt with me for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which he owed me—my lodging is 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a night—when he came on the Tuesday night he paid 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of the debt, and I returned him his shirt—I had had it from the 11th to the 18th of February as security.</p>

I received this largest chisel from White at the prosecutor's house on the morning of the 18th—I saw the pieces of the knife-box—they were fastened to the lid by the lock—this chisel has the appearance of being the one which made the marks on the box—this one was found in the house—I examined the shutters—they had marks of force on them—the chisel found in the house corresponds with the marks on the shutter, and I have no doubt made them.</p>

On the 24th of December, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked if I had a dark drab coat to fit him - he looked at several, none would suit, and he went away; on the Saturday night following, he came and asked for a waistcoat which he had looked at before, and offered me money for; I looked for the waistcoat, and could not find it - on the Monday following, I went to several pawnbrokers, and found it had been pawned - this is it; I can swear it had been in my house on the morning when the prisoner came, as I had taken it out of a box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.What time was I there? A. It was about one or two o'clock; you said "Make haste, for my dinner is ready;" I could not say that if the property was restored. I would look over it - for the pawnbroker gave me the waistcoat; when I got there the pawnbroker said the man is here, and he asked the prisoner if that was the waistcoat the pawned, and he said it was, and that he had bought it in the North six months ago; I did not go out with the prisoner to endeavour to find any man; I told the pawnbroker I wished he would send for an officer, but he refused - I took the prisoner to my house and sent for one.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Baker, the pawnbroker. On the 24th of December, we received this waistcoat - I think in the morning; the prisoner brought it; there is no mark on it - the prosecutor came to our shop and produced a pattern; I recollected having taken such a one in of the prisoner who was in our shop at the time - he paid for it and the prosecutor took it.</p>
               <p>JOHN GUDGE. I am an officer. I took the prisoner for stealing a waistcoat; I went to the pawnbroker's, and when I returned, I said to the prisoner, "Have you any more tickets?" he said No; I took off his hat, and found fifty-nine duplicates in the lining; this is the waistcoat I received from the prosecutor.</p>

            . I gave the same waistcoat to the officer, which I got from the pawnbroker's - this is it - he paid for it, and I believe he was taking some things out at the time - he took a coat or something in; he said he bought it of a Jew.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 24th of December I wanted a great coat, and went out to purchase it, about nine o'clock; I met a Jew, of whom I had bought things before, and asked him if he had one; he said he had not, but he had a waistcoat, of which I had before asked him about; he asked me 10s. for this waistcoat; I said I had but one sovereign and 3s., and I would not give more than 7s. for the waistcoat: he then proposed that we should go to Mr. Baker's shop, where he said we could pawn it for 6s.; I went there, but they would not lend more than 4s. on it: on the 30th, I went to redeem some articles, and Mr. Baker asked if I had a waistcoat of that pattern; I said I had - the prosecutor then came to me and said, it would be a serions piece of business if I did not return the waistcoat; I redeemed it, and then said I would go and find the man; he said be would be glad if I would go to his shop, which I did, and I was there an hour before the officer came: in September last I was down in the North, and bought a number of clothes of a Jew, which I pawned, as they were articles which would not sell in London, and that accounts for my having so many duplicates; I would have found the man, if the prosecutor would have gone with me; he is a Jew salesman, and it is my firm belief that he is acquainted with him; I pawned the waistcoat between nine and ten o'clock in the morning; it was two when I was at the prosecutor's.</p>

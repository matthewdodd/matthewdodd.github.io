On the 24th of June I had been out with him drinking - he was out of place; I went home with him to another man's lodging - I pulled off my coat and my boots, laid down on the bed, and went to sleep; it was then about one o'clock in the morning - I was sober; I had a purse in my fob, containing three sovereigns - I awoke between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; I found my clothes were all unbuttoned, and my braces undone, which I had not done myself - I felt, and thought I had lost some silver from my pocket; I then felt my fob, and thought the three sovereigns were safe, but I found afterwards that they were three shillings - I did not give any alarm, but asked the man who keeps the room permission to go to the water-closet; the prisoner said he would show me the way - when I was there I examined my purse, and found they were only shillings in it; I went up again, but said nothing to the prisoner; we then went out together, and the first officer I met I gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Had not the prisoner asked you to go to give bail? A. No; he asked me to go with him to a Frenchman, to speak on behalf of two women and a man, for robbing a man at a public-house; I had drank with the prisoner the night before - we began about ten or eleven o'clock, and left off about twelve; I was not drunk - I did not ask him to take care of my money; I was capable of taking care if it myself.</p>

             (Police-constable C 95). The prosecutor charged the prisoner with stealing three sovereigns from him; he denied all knowledge of it, but as the prosecutor persisted that he had, I took him to the station - he then said he had taken them for safety, and he had left them at a person's house, where he went to procure bail; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050107"></xptr>searched the house which he described, but could not find it - I then went back to the prisoner, and made him strip; I found this money concealed in the lining of the back of his waistcoat - he then said he took it, but did not know where he had put it.</p>

He was intoxicated: he asked me to have something to drink; we went to a public-house, and had three glasses of liquor - we then went to another public-house, and drank there till half-past one o'clock in the morning; we then went to a person's house, where he laid down, and was ill.</p>

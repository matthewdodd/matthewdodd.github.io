                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live in Southampton-court, Russell<lb></lb>square. On the 14th of Jan., about 12 o'clock at night, I went into the Prince of Wales public-house, London-road—I had been drinking a little before that—very shortly after I had gone in, the two prisoners came in—I had just finished drinking something—I observed that Smith had some court-plaster over her forehead-—I said, "You have an awful wound there, how did you</p>

               <p>come by it?"—she immediately asked if I would give her some gin—I said I would, and she called for it—Rees was alongside of her, and partook of the gin—after having the gin I was about going off, when they followed me out of the house and requested me to go home with them for a few minutes and sit down—I complied—I went with them to Nelson-place, which was very near—a chair was brought and I sat down—Smith asked me to stand some gin—I put my hand into my right hand trowsers pocket, in which I had several pieces of silver, and gave her some money to fetch the gin—Rees went for it—on her return, Smith asked me to drink, and Rees poured it out—I refused to take any—I thought, from the shabby appearance of the apartment, that the liquor might have been drugged, and became rather alarmed—as soon as Smith saw that I refused to take any, she seized hold of me, and called to Rees to come and hold me—she used some oath or im<lb></lb>precation, calling her something of a fine woman for not coming to hold me—Smith then took a knife from the table and swore she would cut the b—b—'s throat or have his money—Rees came forward and laid hold of my right hand—Smith had hold of me by the left arm—I held my hand in my left side breeches pocket, in which were four sovereigns (it all happened in much less time than I can tell you) she drew my pocket out—she had hold of my left hand, with the knife in her hand, and she <hi rend="italic">whipped</hi> my pocket right out in front where my flap is—thinking she was going to cut it off with the knife I caught hold of the pocket—thinking some man might come to her assistance, I made no further resistance, but let go my hold—on that Smith drew the money out of my pocket—I saw the edges of the sovereigns glisten in her hand as she drew her hand from the pocket—she immediately walked to the back door, saying, "I am going this knife way"—I did not observe what became of the knif—it was a snall table knife—I immediately went to the front door and went in search of a policeman—Rees never uttered a word, but remained in the place—I left her there when I came out—I found police<lb></lb>constable L 93, and made a complaint to him—I returned with him to the house, but there was nobody there—we knocked, but got no answer—we then went round to the Prince of Wales—I went in first and saw Smith there in front of the bar, drinking—I went up to her, seized her by the shoulders, pushed her to the door, and told the policeman that she was the girl who had robbed me—she was then taken into custody—I afterwards saw her searched—I had not given either of the prisoners any money besides what I gave for the gin—I had been drinking a little at the time this occurred, but not a great deal—I knew perfectly what I was about.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But was there any attempt to cut your throat while she was getting hold of your pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only by menaces and the weapon in her hand—my hands were held, one by one woman and one by the other—there was no attempt to cut at my throat, or to cut through my pocket—Rees was on one side of me at this time, holding my right hand—I had my left hand in my left-hand side breeches pocket—no more buttons were undone than there are now, one but<lb></lb>ton that my hand might go into my pocket—she ripped the next button-hole off the button, and drew the pocket out and seized hold of it.</p>

On the night of the 14th of Jan., about twelve o'clock, I was applied to by the last witness—I went to the house, No. 4, Nelson-place, with him—I knew the prisoners, and knew they lived there—I knocked at the door and received no answer—the prosecutor told me what had occurred, in consequence of which I went with him to the Prince of Wales public-house, which is a short distance from Nelson-place—when I got there I saw the prisoners inside, standing at the bar—I told the prosecutor to go in, and see if he could identify the persons who had robbed him—he did so, and called me inside the door to take them into custody—he desired me to take Smith into custody, and I did so—there are two doors to the pub<lb></lb>lic-house—as soon as she saw the prosecutor she tried to escape by the other door—I took her in charge—I saw something in her hand then—I took her hand in mine, and kept it closed till we got to the station—at the station-house she delivered 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver from the hand that I had hold of, and three sovereingns from her mouth—5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper was found on her by the searcher at the station—I was not present—when I took the money from her hand she said what money she had got the gentleman gave her—the prosecutor was the worse for drink, but quite capable of know<lb></lb>ing what he was doing—Smith was rather the worse for drink, and Rees was rather worse than Smith—I took Rees into custody the next day, at the po<lb></lb>lice-court, by the order of the Magistrate.</p>

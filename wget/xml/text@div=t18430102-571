                  </hi>. I keep the Red Lion public-house, Walworth-road. The prisoner was my barman. On the 27th of Dec. I marked four shillings, and handed them to Mr. Pulman, and next day, Wednesday, the 28th, about eleven o'clock, I went out, and remained out till three—on my return, I re<lb></lb>ceived from my foreman a bag containing twelve shillings, in which were three of the shillings I had marked and given to Pulman—I saw Mr. Pulman in the evening, and in consequence of what I heard from him, I gave the prisoner into custody—he was searched in my parlour, and one shilling found on him, which I had previously marked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About nine o'clock on Thurs<lb></lb>day morning, the 14th of April, I was at the Lamb public-house, in Kingsland-road—I saw the prisoner Mitchell drive up in a cart which was loaded with sacks, apparently containing potatoes—the other two prisoners were inside the house—when Mitchell drove up they went out—some conversation passed between the three—the cart was then driven into the yard, and the gates were shut—in about ten minutes they all three came into the house together—they then said, "Let us go and do it now," and they all three went out—I had some suspicion, went out, and looked through the chinks in the gates into the yard—I saw Mitchell and Phil<lb></lb>lips in the cart, untying the sacks and taking some potatoes out into a high basket, which is here—Burberry was standing by the side of the cart with this flat basket on his head, into which the other prisoners emptied their basket—he then carried it into the stable—I saw one of my brother-constables pass, gave him information, and we took the prisoners into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Puxley Farm, Edmonton; Mitchell was in my employ as carter. On the 14th of April I sent him with a load of potatoes to deliver to Mr. Davis, a cow<lb></lb>keeper, in London—the potatoes now produced exactly resemble those I sent—they are what we call waste.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Can you swear to them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are things we cannot swear to—to all appearance they are the same—they are for pigs and cows—the worth of those produced is 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have no doubt they were taken at different times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mitchell. Q.</hi> Did you miss any thing out of the sacks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I was not likely to miss them—the customers had complained that there was short weight every day for a week previous.</p>

On the 14th of April I was passing by the Lamb public-house, at Kingsland, and was called by Sin<lb></lb>clair to assist in taking the prisoners—I saw Mitchell and Phillips driving two horses in a cart out of the Lamb-yard into the road—I went into</p>

               <p>the tap-room, and saw Burberry there—I asked him for the key of the stable—he hesitated and said he did not think he was bound to give it to me—after some hesitation he did give it to me—I went into the stable and found the two baskets produced in the stall, and in the manger a quantity of loose potatoes of the same description—I afterwards put them into a sack, and they nearly filled it—in another part of the stable I found a sack nearly full, and another nearly half full—I asked Burberry how he came in possession of them—he said they had been left for him at different times—I asked by whom—he said he did not know—I took him into custody.</p>

I am a private in the Scots Fusilers—on 80th Sep<lb></lb>tember, I was in the Nag's Head, Lower Hill, with Nicholls—I was quite sober—about 9.30 the landlord requested us all to leave and I went out first—when I got outside I was struck in the face and knocked down—I did not see who struck me—I had seen the prisoners in the public-house—I had no sooner got up than I was knocked down again, I did not see who by, I was kicked all over my body and head, I could not see who kicked me—the worst kick was on the back of my ear—I could not see with my right eye and my mouth was swollen—I became insensible, was carried to the barracks, and the doctor sent for.</p>

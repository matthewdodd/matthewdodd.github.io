                  </hi>. I am a draper, at 16, Manchester-street, King's Cross—on the night of 26th September, about half-past 12, I was in my kitchen and I heard some one come in at the front door with a latch key—I then heard some one walking overhead, in the room above, and I ran up stairs without my boots—there was a lamp on the staircase, which was alight—it threw a light all along the passage and into the parlour—when I got to the top of the stairs, on to the landing, I saw the prisoner and another man come out of the parlour—the prisoner had two shirts, a pair of trousers, and some handkerchiefs on his arm, and his companion had a piece of cloth and a coat—I thought they were my two sons at first, and I said, "What are you taking the things out for,"—the prisoner turned round and said, "All right, governor"—I said, "It seems all wrong," and I caught him by the collar, just by the street door—I distinctly saw his features—we struggled together</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186310260039"></xptr>
               <p>for some time—they opened the door in the struggle, and got outside—I still held the prisoner—his companion took the piece of cloth which was rolled on a flat board, and struck me violently on the head several times, in fact be broke a few inches of the board off—he held it in both hands, and par<lb></lb>tially stunned me—my wife then came up to the door, and he ran away—I still kept hold of the prisoner—his coat gave way at the sleeve, he gave me a violent push, I slipped, and he ran away—I jumped on my feet as soon as possible, and followed him—he went down Liverpool-street—I was only a few yards behind him—I raised a cry of "Stop thief" all the way down—I lost sight of him for about a second, when he turned the corner of Abbey-street, and then I saw him caught by a fire-escape man—a constable came up at the same time, and I gave him into custody—I have not the slightest doubt that the prisoner is the man who was in my house—it was a moon<lb></lb>light night, and I saw his features plainly.</p>

On the night of the 27th September, I was in the neighbourhood of Derby-street, heard a cry, ran and found the prisoner stopped by a fire-escape man—I did not see him stopped—Mr. Landrey was there, and he gave the prisoner into my custody for entering his house—I asked the prisoner what he had got in his hand—he said, "Nothing"—I saw this key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) projecting through his fingers—I took it from him and tried it, and it fitted the prosecutor's street door—I got these shirts (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the prosecutor.</p>

I live at 42, Gordon Square—On 14th May I went to the prisoner's shop in St. Martin's Lane and purchased twelve flower-glasses price 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>„ and twelve custard cups 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I paid for them by a cheque, but whether at the time, or subsequently, I cannot say—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my cheque—it was subsequently returned to me through my bankers—(<hi rend="italic">Read;</hi> "Pay Dobson &amp;Co. £3 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.)—this is the receipt—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "60, St. Martin's Lane, May 15th—Bought of Dobson and Co. twelve flower-glasses 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., twelve custard cups 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a printer, of St. Martin's Lane—I have been in that establishment a great number of years—I became ac-quainted with the prisoner in the latter part of 1870—I do not know his family—in March, 1871, he made a communication to me about the state of his finances, and he brought an agreement from a house in New York, Tiffany's—he suggested that he had no friend, and asked me to take this matter up for him, finding the money, and giving him a salary of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week, and he would take the trouble off my hands, as I did not understand the nature of glass, and it was ultimately arranged that I was to advance him a sum to carry out the management—I said, "What sum?" he said, "1, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1, 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I agreed to do that—that was Tiffany's contract; there was no written agreement—he was to go into the business as my manager at a salary of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week, which was regularly paid to him—he had no authority whatever to endorse cheques for me; he was to attend to the glass business entirely, and had nothing to do with the financial part—it was his duty to account immediately he received money—supposing he received a cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he would have paid it to the cashier; he had no right whatever to use it himself—he had no right to make this endorse-ment—this "Jas.

               <p>his father—the house in St. James's Street was one of good repute and standing—I believe I stated that I thought he had not been fairly dealt with, believing his representations to be true—I believe I stated that I would start him again in business—he did not consult me as to where he should find premises—I was carrying on the business of a printer in St. Martin's Lane, and I gave the prisoner room to carry on the glass business there—I did not offer to let my own premises to him, nor did he take them of me as my tenant in March, 1871—he did not ask me to lend him money to carry on the business at 61, St. Martin's Lane—I did not lend him 1, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a lump, but in various advances—that 1, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not partly owing for carrying on the business in St. Martin's Lane—I began to advance money for the business in St. Martin's Lane about Christmas, 1871—I began to pay him 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, I think, in March, 1871—the business in St. Martin's Lane started at Christmas, 1871, not before—I did not arrange with him to carry on the business at St. Martin's Lane at an interest of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent.—I did not arrange with him that his drawings should be 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week—I never heard of such a thing—he was to take a weekly salary—I think it was in May, 1872, that I first discovered that certain sums he had received had not found their way to the business—he engaged all the servants, with my approval—the business was "W. S. Dobson &amp; Co."—Mr. Heritage was not my attorney then; he first became my attorney about June or July, 1872—I did not come to a fresh arrangement with the pri<lb></lb>soner after I learned of what I call the defalcations; it was precisely the same as before; we only had one arrangement—I got this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) signed by Dobson in July—I had not seen Mr. Heritage before I got it signed—I told you I saw Mr. Heritage in June; this is dated 5th July; I don't think I saw Mr. Heritage before that—I saw him every day—I met him occasionally at a chop-house, but I had not spoken to him about preparing a deed till after that—to the best of my recollection, it was afterwards—I cannot say whether I instructed him before or after I got this document—after I found that Dobson had taken money which had not found its way into the business, I did not tell him that I must now have security for the money I had advanced—I did not know the particulars of the defalcations before the prisoner wrote them down—the bookkeeper told me that there were defalcations, and then I spoke to the prisoner, and he made a confession—before this was signed I had made a rough draft of it all—this is my composition—he was not so much distressed as I was when I spoke to him about the defalcations—he felt his position—I did not then sit down to compose the rough draft; there was not a night between the rough draft and its signing by the prisoner<lb></lb>there was an interval of twelve hours; but when he made his confession I went home very ill, and in the morning I said "You had better make a clean breast of it what you have taken, and write me a note"—he said "I can't do it, governor; will you do it I" and I wrote what I thought was a proper letter for one man to write to another, and gave it to my clerk to make a fair copy—I went out, and when I came in he signed it, and said "Governor, you have given it to me warm"—I possibly did not mention before the Magistrate about his asking me to do it; but that is the fact—I did not prepare the rough draft without the slightest communication with him, he asked me to do it himself, it was his wish—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a fair copy by the clerk of the document prepared, and he signed it—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "July 5, 1872—I, W.

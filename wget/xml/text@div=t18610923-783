                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, F</hi> 36). I was on duty in Little Queen-street, Holborn, on Friday morning, 2d August—about a quarter to 3 I was called by Wakeham to assist him in taking the prisoner to the hospital—when the prisoner was brought into the surgery he was set down in a chair, and I heard Wakeham ask him "Where is your wife," or "Is you wife at home?"—I think those were the words—he tried to speak but he could not, and he nodded his head in the direction of Newton-street—he nodded his head on the right side, sideways (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—that was in the direction towards Newton-street—Wakeham then asked him if he had cut his wife, and he nodded his head, as much as to say "yes," as I understood him—he nodded like that, forwards; not in the same way as before—upon that I left the hospital with Wakeham and went to No. 3, Newton-street—Watts, another constable, who had gone with us, remained in the hospital with the prisoner—when Wakeham and I got to Newton-street, we went into the front room first floor—the street door was open—the room door was shut, but not locked; the key was on the outside—I put my hand on the knob and opened the door—I turned on my bull's eye, and saw the woman lying dead, with her throat out—Wakeham went at once for the doctor—I remained in the room until the doctor came—I touched the body before the doctor came—I took hold of the left arm, and it was quite warm; it was lying on her side, resting on her leg—after I had felt the arm I put it on the leg again or close by it—I think I put it where it was before, but I cannot be certain exactly—I did not move the body in any degree before the doctor came—I staid there until the doctor came—another constable was there; he did not move the body—there was a candlestick in the room on the table—the table was almost in the centre of the room—the candle was burnt out; the grease had run on to the table and was fixed.</p>

On the morning of 2d August I went with Wakeham and Wensley to King's College Hospital with the prisoner—he was there put into a chair—I saw him put to leg to Wakeham, touch him on the side, and put his band towards him making a motion for him to come to him—I then heard Wakeham say, "Where is your wife?—the prisoner motioned towards Newton-street—he put his hand to his throat and motioned towards Newton-street, that is, he turned round and with his head motioned towards home with his hand, and nodded his head at the same time (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—Wakeham then said to him, "Have you cut your wife?"—he nodded with his head once, in that manner, as much as to say yes—upon that Wakeham and Wensley went to Newton-street and I remained with the prisoner—after they had gone I asked the prisoner if he had served his wife as he had served himself—he nodded with his head that way—I staid with him till Mr. Fortescue, the, house-surgeon, arrived, and after assisting the prisoner to bed I went to 3, Newton-street—I found Wensley there—I picked up a razor from the floor—when Mr. Paynter, the surgeon, came I pointed out to him the place where I had picked it up—when I picked it up I did not observe any mark on the floor where it had been; I saw no particular mark except the pool of blood—I should think the</p>

               <p>the window—there was a chair on the left aide of the body, between it and the wall—there was a large wicker basket underneath the body, such as they hawk poultry in about the street; it was nearly a yard in its longest diameter and upwards of a foot in depth—the body was lying in a sitting position upon the wicker basket—the bottom of the basket was not upper<lb></lb>most, the posterior part of the deceased had sunk down somewhat into the basket; she was in a sort of sitting position, but the large handle of the basket prevented the body from sinking down entirely into the basket—the handle went quite across the shorter diameter of the basket in an arch—she was not under the handle, she was as it were sitting upon half the basket—there was an old fashioned window-seat to the window, and the head of the deceased was hanging over it—the body was resting upon the basket in a sitting position, with the back of the body against the window-seat; and the head was hanging far back over the window-seat; underneath the left shoulder, on the window-seat, was an over-set flower-pot, the earth being scattered on the window-seat—her legs were drawn up underneath her, drawn up close to the basket—both the hands were lying in her lap—the blood from the body had run on to the window-seat, from thence on to the floor in a pool of blood, not running sufficiently far towards the fire-place to be apparent, being hid by her clothes; it was entirely under her. except what was on the window-seat—the window-shutter at her right side was very much splashed with blood, as from a cut artery having flowed against it—a large stream of blood had flowed upon the window-shutter on her right, as if blood had spirted from an artery—there can be no doubt that at the time the blood had so spirted from the artery, the body was in the position in which I found it—the thumb and three first fingers of the left hand were deeply cut on their inner sides by a sharp instrument—from their position I think that could have been occasioned by grasping a sharp instrument—it was a wound that might have been made at one cut, the fingers and thumb being flexed (<hi rend="italic">pointing out its position to the Jury upon his own hand</hi>)—it might be caused by a grasp, if the fingers were flexed the cut on the three fingers and thumb would be in a straight line—there was a large cut on the throat of the deceased eight inches long—it commenced nearly at the centre of the back of the neck and proceeded downwards and forwards across the right side of the neck, across the throat downwards to the centre of the left collar bone (<hi rend="italic">pointing out its position</hi>)—it was a very deep wound; it had cut nearly all the muscles—I cannot give its depth by measurement; it had first severed the skin and some muscles, it had then cot off the top of the transverse process of the third neck bone—that is a prominence of bone which projects on either side from one of the back bones, it was the top of the transverse process of the third cervical vertebra—that was towards the commencement of the cut; it had cut through the muscles and arteries at the aide of the neck, and had then severed the thyroid cartil<lb></lb>lage, Adam's apple as it is commonly called—the carotid arteries lie there, and all the large arteries and veins—in the case of the deceased the cartilage was ossified; it had cut positively through it—it is above the wind-pipe, the wind-pipe begins below the thyroid cartilage—the wound then became shallower to its termination—death would have followed very soon after the infliction of the wound—when a person's carotid artery is cut through, I cannot possibly say how soon death would ensue—in my judgment it would be within a very few minutes—cases has been recorded of persons being capable of exertion after the carotid artery was cut through; I can imagine that a person might walk a few feet, stagger a few feet I might say—there</p>

               <p>were no Indications of that in this ease—there were do marks of footsteps of blood at the feet of the deceased—I saw the cap of a man on the window eat, at the right side of the head of the deceased, I think it was lying partly on the side of the head and partly under—I removed it—at some distance from the feet of the woman there was a chair standing very near the fire-place—one of the constables, I believe Watts, pointed out to me the spot where he had picked up the razor—I saw a mark on the floor in that spot; it was a mark of blood supposed to have been made by the razor; it was within an inch or two of a large pool of blood—the spot pointed oat to me where the razor was picked up was a few inches from the leg of the chair, and two of my own full paces from the skirt of the deceased's dress—that would be about two yards; not the nearest part of the pool of blood, but where the razor was lying—there was a pool of blood flowing in a direction from that chair, and in the direction towards the deceased's feet—it flowed so in consequence of the declivity of the floor—I could tell that that pool of blood had flowed from the chair towards the deceased, and not from her, because the end of the pool flowed into a large crack in the floor—I did not measure the distance of the hole in the floor from the skirt of the deceased's dress, but I believe it was a full yard—that would be about half way between where the razor was picked up, and where the woman's dress extended to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> you saw the position of the body of the deceased and the nature of the wound—in your opinion, as a surgeon and medical man, taking into consideration the circumstances you have described, could the deceased have inflicted those wounds herself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should be sorry to swear it was impossible, but it is most highly improbable—it would require very great force to cut through the transverse process of the vertebras and the thyroid cartilage—the flap of the wound towards its left lowermost extremity had the skin torn up from the tissues beneath to the extent of about an inch in depth, by about three inches in length—it is rather difficult to explain—the upper flap of the wound was torn up from the tissues beneath—if the flat part of the blade of an instrument was carried underneath the skin it might tear it up from the tissues beneath; that is to say if the cutting edge was not carried vertical to the skin, but the flat pushed against the skin and pushed underneath, as it were, that would tear up the skin from the tissues beneath—that would indicate that the weapon had not been drawn cleanly through towards the end of the cut—there were also splashes of blood on the window-shutter—I have no doubt that the wound was inflicted where the body was lying—I did not examine the prisoner, not so as to give evidence about him—I have no doubt that the blood on the window-shutter had shutter immediately after the infliction of the wound—by immediately I mean directly—I have no doubt the body fell where the wound was inflicted—there were marks of bruises about the face—there was a bruise on the left jaw bone, and the inner side of the upper lip was out as if from having been knocked against the teeth—that out was quite a recent one; the body was quite warm when I saw it, even the fingers were warm—I did not see the wound made by the teeth on the lip at that time; it was at the post mortem examination that I discovered that—it had not cicatrised, it had been made recently before death.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the window shut or open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Open; and there was a mating space where the flowerpot that was overset might have stood—it was a fine night—the cut on the hand must have been occasioned by a very sharp instrument, it was so clean—it had one edge—one cut would do it—the cat on the thumb would have been upwards—I observed the direction of the outs, and closely examined them, thinking it might be important to observe hem—it is my belief that an instrument with one edge, and with out stroke might have made the cuts—I added the words, "and being with<lb></lb>drawn," because I do not think that simple pressure directly down upon the edge would have produced so clean a cut; not simply taking hold of a sharp instrument and pressing it—no other instrument was found—a closed razor was found in the room, but that was not bloody—a very blunt carving knife was also found on the table, which stood in the centre of the room—that was not such an instrument as could have inflicted the wound.</p>

CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you at the station when this charge was made by the prisoner against his wife for having wounded him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she was in custody of a police-constable—the charge he made against her was for assaulting and wounding him with some instrument, at that time, that she had just wounded him—there was a little blood on the arm, and I believe he was sent to King's College Hospital, which we do in all cases of that nature—after the charge was made she was searched, and nothing was found on her—she denied the charge at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at the Queen and Prince Albert public-house in Holborn—I have known the prisoner seven or eight years—on 2d August, he came to our house about 1 o'clock in the morning—he appeared at that time to have been having some drink—he said, "I want a pint of four half-and-half"—after he was served with it he put his hand in his left trousers pocket, pulled out some copper money, and said, "Another <hi rend="italic">b----row</hi>—I said, "What is the matter?"—he said, "I have lost more money"—I said, u Have you got a hole in your pocket,"—he said, "No; good night, I'm b----if I don't do it"—he had another half-pint, and then left, and came in again half an hour afterwards—I don't know whether he had anything more to drink then—I was talking to three gentlemen at the time he came in—he said nothing to me when he came back—that was the last I saw of him.</p>

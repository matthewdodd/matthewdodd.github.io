I am fifteen years of age—I remember the night of 22d September—at that time I had no home; I am now in the House of Occu<lb></lb>pation—I did not know the prisoner Taylor before, but I saw him that morning—I saw Richards, he was coming from London, and Dwyer and Reynolds took hold of each of his arms, and they went into the Blue-eyed Maid—I am sure they are the two women—Taylor was outside the public-house with another man, and he asked me to lend him a farthing, which I did—he then gave Dwyer 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the two women and Richards went in the public-house—they then came out of the public-house and crossed the road, and Taylor followed them across—I followed them and stood at the corner of a court—I saw Reynolds take the prosecutor op the court, Dwyer stopped behind and called Taylor—he went and put his knee to his back; they threw him down, and snatched his watch, and ran away.</p>

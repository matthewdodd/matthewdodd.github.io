               <p>—I have some slight knowledge of McCasey—I met him once in Oxford-street—on 23d January, I met him opposite the Mansion House, and walked about with him for some time—we went to Newport-street, and thence to Portugal-street, where we arrived at a quarter to 11 at night—he was by my side, and some one came and took me by my arms—McCasey then thrust his bands into my pockets and took out a pocket-book, with a great many documents and several letters—they also took my cape—Marriott is not the person who held my arms; I passed him near Drury-lane Theatre, but nothing took place between him and McCasey—last Thursday week I went, with a sergeant, to a pawnbroker's shop, and got my cape—I received two of my bills again a fortnight last Saturday—I lost three—they were given up to mo by order of the Magistrate—here is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I received it from Matthews.</p>

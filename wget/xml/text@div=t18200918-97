               <p>"This young man has robbed me of my watch." I had hold of Low at the time. He said directly that he had not got it. Beaumont said</p>
               <p>"You have, for I saw it in your hand after you took it from him." He took him in custody. Fox ran away when I secured Low, but the beadle met and stopped him.</p>

I immediately came up, collared Low, and said he had stolen the old gentleman's watch; he denied it. I saw it in his left hand, and saw him put it behind him, he let it fall, and I picked it up. Fox walked away with the other. I saw them all three pressing on the old gentleman.</p>

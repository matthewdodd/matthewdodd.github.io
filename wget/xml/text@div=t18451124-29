                  </hi>. I am a milliner, and lodge at 16, Little Port-land-street. On the 12th of Nov., about nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Regent-street—I saw the defendant in here—I had been in company with his once before—he had not been with me to my house—on this occasion he accompanied me to my house—he remained with me about half an hour—he bad intercourse with me—he then left the house with me, and went with me to Mortimer-street, about ten minutes' walk from my house—he bad not given me any remuneration in the house—he gave me a sovereign in Mortimer-street—he did not say anything at the time he gave it me—I took it and gave it him back, because it was not good—I told him it was not good—he put it back into his pocket, and took three others out of his pocket, held them in his hand towards me, and said, "You can take either of those"—I could see what was in his hand—I told him they were bad—he said he had not any more money, and he put the three sovereigns into his pocket—I called a policeman in two or three minutes, and gave him in charge—I accompanied him and the policeman towards the station-house—on the way to the station the prisoner offered me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which he got from a policeman—he offered me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. first, I would not take it, and then he gave me two more—I then said I did not wish to give him in charge—the policeman said I should be obliged to give him in charge.</p>

I was called by last witness, on the night in question, to take the defendant into custody—she said, in his hearing, it was for offering her a counterfeit sovereign, and having three more in his pocket—we all three proceeded towards the station—at we were going along we met Saunders, another policeman, who appeared to be known to the defendant—he borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Saunders—he did not give that to the young woman in my presence—when we arrived at the station, Mr. Rawley, the inspector was there—he knew the defendant as Mr. Powell, connected with the Solicitor of the Mint—the charge was made, and something was said about searching him—the defendant said there was no occasion for that, he would deliver up what money he had in his possession—he put his hand into his pocket, and produced what it contained—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some coin produced by Rawley</hi>)—here are four sovereigns, two half-crowns, four shillings, and two sixpences, all counterfeit—he produced the four sovereigns and one shilling from his left-hand pocket, and the other from his right—I afterwards searched him, but found nothing on him but some copper money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the division of police. On Wednes<lb></lb>day night, the 12th of Nov., about half-past ten o'clock, the defendant was brought to the station—when he came into the station he made hit way towards the desk, where I was sitting, and placed himself in a position to speak to me—I did not know him 'at first—he then retreated into a room adjoining the desk, and, seeing who it was, I followed him—directly we got into the room he said, "This woman has given me in charge for passing. counterfeit sovereign"—I made no reply, but walked out and asked the constable the nature of the charge—that was in the defendant's presence—the con<lb></lb>stable told me it was for giving the girl a bad sovereign, and having three others in his pocket—Johnson directly said yes, but she did not wish to charge him, as he had satisfied her—I directed Edwards to search the defendant—he said it was not necessary, and produced the sovereigns—in the course of conversation he said this counterfeit coin was the subject of investigation before a Magistrate; that it came into his hands in the coarse of his business, and that a mistake had occurred in changing his clothes—in consequence of that, and the girl refusing to give him in charge, he was allowed to depart—he came to the station next morning, he wanted to know if any report would be made of it to the Commissioners of Police—I declined to tell him—the case was reported to the Commissioners—I saw the defendant at the station about half an hour, and left him there waiting—he came back at two o'clock—I had at that time received directions from the Commissioners, in consequence of which I detained him, and he was taken to the Police-court.</p>

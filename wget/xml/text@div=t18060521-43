After I had dined a customer came in to pay me a bill, he wanted change for a five pound note, I felt in my pocket, and I found that I I had not got any change, directly it struck me that this boy had not been to Mr. Pedders with this seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this. - A. I think it must be before three, because we were down at Whitechapel before four; when the boy came from breakfast I ordered him to wipe the windows, it struck me that I should have to go into the city, I thought no more of the seven pounds after that till I wanted to give this gentleman change; I says boy, give me that seven pounds, says he, I have not got it sir, I laid it on the counter,

               <p>Q. On his being searched you found nothing on him but a few shillings. - A. Nothing else.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never wronged any body of a farthing, I have dealt with this gentleman four or five years, for new hats; for him to say that I had his money, I never saw it; when that gentleman came to see me I was very glad to see him, I asked him where he came from, he said he came to see me, I owed him seven pounds, I said seven pounds for what, he said do not you recollect that you owe me seven pounds, I said again for what, for if I want money, I can have it lent me in the neighbourhood, he says come along with me, when I came out of doors there was his brother and two other gentlemen; when we came to Lambeth-street he told me that I had robbed him; I never in my life did hurt a worm, nor was I ever dishonest to any body of a farthing, I was fit to faint, they shoved me into a public house and tore my clothes to pieces.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The first word that I said to him was you are determined to make me come to see you, you have repeatedly asked me, but I am much surprised at your conduct and the cause of it, how could you think of taking my seven pounds this morning, says he what seven pounds, I says seven pounds you took from out of my shop, says he how could you think of me taking seven pounds, I said I could not help thinking of your taking it when I have so clear evidence against you; there is no doubt you took it out of a joke, and I would wish to pass it off as such, says he I have not got your seven pounds, I says I shall take you to the police office immediatly, I called in Mr. Pedder and another friend; I did not stop a moment hardly.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

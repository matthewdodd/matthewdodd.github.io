I am 15 in July, and am the daughter of John Hyram, of 11, Abbey-street, Bethnal Green-road—on Saturday, 13th May, about 10 at night, I was walking along Church-street—I had a pair of boots under my cloak, and a bag under my arm, containing a bottle of gin and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—two boys rushed on me and tried to snatch the bag—I did not let it go at first, but the biggest one pulled it off my arm, and the little one punched me in the mouth and knocked me down—they had followed me from the corner right up to the turning—my attention was attracted to them because I thought they were going to pick a woman's pocket—the little one put his hand over my mouth to prevent me halloing, after he had knocked me down—they then ran off—I ran after them, but lost sight of them—I saw them again at the police-station, and recognised them there as the same persons—I had no doubt about them—I had just bought the gin for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Groves, a boot and shoe maker, of Bacon-street—we occupy one of Mr. Lock's houses—the last witness works for me—I was out on this Saturday night to make purchases—when I came back I found the prisoner Lock there, with the boy—that was just on 10o'clock—the boys went away from my place at ten minutes after 10—I have known Lock two years—I have seen him hard at work every day under the place where we live—I have always heard that he bears a very good character—I am sure this was on the Saturday night—I heard of it on the Sunday morning.</p>

                  </hi> I am a timber-merchant, in Bacon-street, Spitalfields—I have been there sixteen years in business for myself, and have lived there fur about thirty years—Lock is my nephew—he has been in my service eight or nine years—his parents are both dead—I can answer for his being an honest boy, or I should not have kept him—I have often sent him to the bank, and he has brought money back—I am sure he was at work on this particular Saturday—I should think it was 9 o'clock when I went out that night—he was in my place then—I am his bail.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you see him next? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>. At the station-house the following Sunday afternoon—he very often leaves me about half-past 7—he has his tea at my place—that is the last meal he has there—he never came back to supper—I know Ebenezer Lewis—I have seen him go</p>

               <p>in and out of ray house—I know he works for Mr. Groves—I have seen my nephew and him speaking together—I have never seen them walking together—I heard of this from my wife about 2 o'clock on the Sunday—she asked me whether I had seen my nephew—I said, "No"—she said, "Well, you are not likely, he is locked up"—he was in the habit of coming to my house to breakfast on the Sunday, and we were surprised that he had not come—I said,—I will go up and see the poor fellow"—I saw the sergeant on duty, and I asked him if he had a person there named Lock, and what he was charged with—I saw the charge-sheet, and said, "Well, you are mistaken this time, for he is quite incapable of committing such an act"—I bailed him—I was before the Magistrate on the Monday morning—I did not give evidence—Lewis told me how this occurred—T told him to be up at the police court to meet me—my solicitor was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Portobello public-house—on the night of this occurrence, about 10 o'clock, the little girl Mary Hyram came into my house crying—she had a pair of boots to bring home to me—I said, "What is the matter, my dear?"—she said she could hardly tell me, somebody had knocked her down—I said, "Come into the bar-parlour; what will you have to drink?"—somebody came in at the door, and said, "We have got him, "and the little girl came out of the bar, and accused some of my customers—I said, "You must mind what you are about, accusing these children; they have come in with their mugs for beer"—I did not supply her with the gin.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see her with any bag or gin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, she was very excited indeed, not a limb on her was steady—she could not see any boys in custody—the boy was in custody outside with the detective—she only saw the children at the bar—her words were, "There they are, there they are, "and she pointed to some of the boys and girls that were coming in—there were two or three boys in the bar, and some grown-up persons as well—she would not take anything to drink—my door opens with a swing—the door was so closed that she could not see the boy in custody.</p>

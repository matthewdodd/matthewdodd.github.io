               <p>I brought this man up from the country about six wears ago, when first I was called to the bar, he lived with me two years, I parted with him with very great reluctance to settle his father's accounts; he lived with his father sometime, he has been out of my service four years, but he has been in some degree the object of my attention, having brought him first up to town, I was naturally desirous his interest should be promoted; he lived with Mr. Tancred, and lodged with the prosecutor, and I always understood he lived with the greatest sobriety; since this business happened, I understand he is in an extreme bad state of health; and if he is acquitted in this instance, I certainly shall do every thing in my power to put him into such a situation, that he shall not be tempted to do any thing of the kind again.</p>

            . chap. 24. there is a specific penalty imposed on persons who shall pawn the goods of others, without the consent of the proprietor: that is clearly the case of the prisoner; he, without the consent of the proprietor, pawned the goods: the Act of Parliament has provided the penalty of twenty shillings, and certainly as the legislature annexed that penalty to the offence, it shewed at that time it was not to be considered as a felony; I shall submit therefore to your Lordship, in point of law, he cannot be convicted on this indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. This is a question in some measure to be left to the Jury, with direction in point of law; it has very frequently occurred to my own mind, what difficulties must arise from the Act of Parliament which I have now before me, upon that particular kind of felony, of which we have a great many instances here; and I take it, (for otherwise it seems extremely difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile the law) I take the distinction to be this, that where things are taken with a felonious intention, and afterwards pawned, then the circumstance of pawning does not make the act less penal, it remains a felony, and requires no Act of Parliament to make it so; it is one way of disposing of stolen property; but where there is no offence but that of pawning without the consent of the owner, with an intention of restoring the property, it seems to me that if any offence can be within this Act of Parliament, it must be that offence; therefore I shall leave it to the Jury, to declare whether they believe that he intended to steal these things, and convert them to his own use; in that case I should be of opinion, that it would be a felony, and in the other, not a felony; for it would be a very strange construction that that which was meant to be the subject of this Act of Parliament was a felony; and it has been universally held that all Acts of Parliament inflicting lesser penalties, repeal greater ones.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hunter. During the time these things were first pawned, his father died, and he was intitled to have some part of the property, that is a fact within my own knowledge; and he was in expectation of some money, by which he could redeem those things.</p>

On 21st April, after mid<lb></lb>night, I was on duty and saw Donovan inside the rails at the end of Whitehall Place—Lowry was on the other side of the rails—I asked Donovan what he did over there—he said he had got over to ease himself—I told him he had no business there, and he went away—I got over the rails, looked at the house, No. 10, and found a pane of glass broken, the window-catch pushed away, and the window open—I put my lamp inside, and saw paper strewed about the room, and then went to No. 12 and found the window broken open in the same way—I caught sight of the prisoners in Parliament Street, and kept some little distance behind them to the foot of Westminster Bridge—I asked them to come back with me—they kept looking at each other as though one meant to run one way, and one another—I secured Donovan, and Lowry went over into Lambeth—I took him on the 28th—I took Donovan to the station—he pulled off two vests, a pair of trousers, and a pair of boots, and three towels—some towels had been taken from No. 10 and 12, and left on the ledge outside—the boots Donovan is now wear<lb></lb>ing he said belonged to him—they were left at No. 12—I found this box of matches on a writing desk at No. 12.</p>

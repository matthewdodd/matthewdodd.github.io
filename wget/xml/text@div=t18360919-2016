               <p>[Mr. Bodkin, on the prisoner's behalf, here stated it at it was his wish at once to admit his guilt, there being now sufficient legal proof to make out the case; and that he had only abstained from taking that course before, from an anxiety to explain the circumstances of the transaction.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury,—I cannot offer to address you upon a case, the facts of which admit of no doubt, without at the same time, expressing to you, in the outset, my apology for having subjected you to the trouble of hearing the formal proofs to establish it. I was aware, gentlemen, it must be established—indeed, I have never denied the accusation; and it was my full intention to have saved my Lord and yourselves the pain of recording a verdict which would subject your fellow-being to the forfeiture of his life; and my feelings, moreover, influenced me in coming to that determination, from the desire I had to spare my relations and friends (which are many and near) the in<lb></lb>creased misery that must arise to, and befall them, from a complete investi<lb></lb>gation and disclosure of all the circumstances connected with the act itself. It has been by the direction of my legal advisers that I have taken my present course; but for them, I should have pleaded "Guilty" to the charge: but I found, if I did so, that I should be precluded from address<lb></lb>ing you, and thereby shut out from giving you and the world some expla<lb></lb>nation of the causes which led me to the committal of such a crime, and thus of impressing upon your minds that necessity, and not inclination, in<lb></lb>stigated it; which, though a poor one, has afforded me some consolation, I am fully aware that necessity is no legal excuse for error; but Gentle<lb></lb>men, it is not to be forgotten, that so constituted is man, that he cannot be perfect, and that, but for human imperfection, legal and social restraints would be altogether unnecessary. Few men have philosophy enough to suffer disgrace, when the means, either real or imaginary, are in their power to avert it—particularly if they suppose those means can be used without injury to others. I was thus placed; my pecuniary difficulties were immense; their non-settlement must have plunged me into a prison; my professional avocations must not only have been suspended, but my pros<lb></lb>pects of advancement, by the loss of my conncexions, must have been de<lb></lb>stroyed; my poor unhappy wife—yes, I have indeed a wife, and an infant child too—must have shared my ruin; and the days of my poor, aged, and venerable parent must have been shortened. Great as these accumulated misfortunes would have been to one brought up as I was, in the bosom of a large, united, and respected family, and in the enjoyment of their devoted affections, they would not have induced me to commit an act, had I con<lb></lb>ceived injury to any one, much less to a beloved brother, would have followed. My firm intention and design was to have replaced the stock—and this assertion and assurance I make in the presence of my God, who can bear my conscience witness as to its truth. I proved also, by payment from time to time the amount of the dividends to my brother's credit, at his banker's, that it was a temporary use only I was making of the money, If I had intended the act as one of dishonesty, I should not have con<lb></lb>tinued daily in my office, for a period of seven moths, transacting my business—should I not have flown with the £7000. and sought refuge and security in a foreign land? Gentlemen, I did not only not fly with the money, while undiscovered for seven months, but I remained also for days</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183609190008"></xptr>
               <p>after suspicion arose, and then again after the discovery was fully made which, if it were necessary, could be testified. Gentlemen, the mind of a man, steeled by the love of crime, looks to his life and liberty when either are in danger—I looked, although I now perceive through a false medium, to the sustaining of character—I did this act with the sole view of sustain<lb></lb>ing my character—by the discovery my character was blasted, and the protection of my person was no longer with me a consideration—I flew not—I submitted to be taken. The details which led to my embarrass<lb></lb>ments, and those which would show the application of the money I ob<lb></lb>tained, would occupy a time in elucidation which I should be unwarranted in trespassing upon; but I will, with your leave, give you some general heads, which will show you the sincerity of my assertion, that it was necessity, and an anxiety to sustain my character, which prompted me. I was admitted an attorney in the year 1830, having served my clerkship, and been brought up and educated in the country—on my admission, I com<lb></lb>menced business in London—I entered into partnership, and had reason to expect that the business would be prosperous and lucrative. In this full confidence much capital was embarked in it, and, for the purpose of acquir<lb></lb>ing a good business, some expense was incurred for the purpose of main<lb></lb>taining that respectability of appearance without which business con<lb></lb>nexions do not acquire confidence. My partnership was unfortunate, to the extent of about £1500, my losses otherwise considerable, and I found, in time, my expenditure overbalance my income: besides which, I lost by the insolvency of a friend, for whom I had become security, nearly £600 and this at a period I could least sustain it, which involved me in further difficulties, and in order to meet them, or at least in a great measure, I obtained advances from my father; but my shame and backwardness to discover the real, the whole state of my case, prevented a kind and indul<lb></lb>gent parent, like a misled physician, the opportunity of effecting a perfect cure, by entirely extricating me, which his liberality of disposition would have inclined him to do, had he know the whole truth. My hops of being able to disengage myself from what remained caused this reserve—this disinclination to tell all—this want of candour; but those hopes proved false—my remaining difficulties I warded off until my own means might be sufficient to meet them, by giving notes and bills; when these became due I was unable to honour them—renewals took place, and upon those renewals being again dishonoured, proceedings at law were takes and judgment obtained, which to satisfy, I was obliged from time to time to borrow money, and give fresh securities and large premiums, until at length, in the latter end of the last year, I found myself in debt to the extent of nearly £5000—all brought on by accumulated pecu<lb></lb>niary difficulties, arising, not from any extravagance of living, or the com<lb></lb>mission of any excesses; but purely from struggling against the stream, to keep up that professional respectability which I considered indispensable—a very great proportion of this debt being, in fact, accumulated by the pur<lb></lb>chase of pecuniary accommodation. Had I not so miscalculated, but sub<lb></lb>mitted at once to misfortune, I should have averted this my present more serious calamity. In 1832 my brother was married, and a sum of money was invested in the purchase of Consols, to the amount of £7000 and up<lb></lb>wards. Mr. Watkins, Mr. Fountaine, and myself, were the trustees. On account of my being resident in London, I was in the habit of receiving the dividends for some time. My brother went abroad, and it was arranged that, during his absence, his bankers should receive and place them to his account; and, for this purpose, a power of attorney was given to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183609190009"></xptr>
               <p>bankers by the trustees, myself being one. The bankers continued to act upon this power till July, 1835; and before the following January divi<lb></lb>dend became due, my pecuniary difficulties had become so great, so insur<lb></lb>mountable that my mind was in a state of distraction, and my bodily health also suffered in consequence, and which brought forth the continued observations of all my friends; and it having been suggested to me that the discount trade was very lucrative, and that if I had capital I could realize a handsome income, and in a short time an independence, and my own individual unhappy experience in the rate of profit that might he so realized, confirmed the truth of the suggestion; I conceived the plan of appropriating my brother's money for a time, thus to extricate myself, and with the residue to commence the discount trade, in order to replace the stock. I do assure you. Gentlemen, that, at that moment, my infatuation was so great, by the false confidence I had in my ability to carry on the new line of business, that I anticipated a very large return of capital, in a comparatively short time, so as to replace the stock; and that in the interval I should be able to continue the payment of the dividends punc<lb></lb>tually. I had not then the least conception that the Bank of England could suffer, or had any thing to do with the money; but that its being in my name, though with others, it was a family matter, and that I could satisfy my brother, on his return to England, that, in what I had done, I had merely acted from temporary pressure, and that when he should be con<lb></lb>vinced—as I fully expected to be able to convince him—of my ability to replace the stock, he would be fully satisfied. How lamentably I was deceived, the result has shown. Having obtained the money, I at once discharged my then present debts on bills and judgments, amounting (together with the accumulations of interest, and compound interest, and heavy premium for accommodation, together with costs upon divers of the debts) to upwards of £4700. My business debt, and several old partner<lb></lb>ship accounts, I paid to upwards of £100, and in the months of Decem<lb></lb>ber, January, and February, I discounted nearly thirty bills, varying each in amount from £50 to £250, and making together a sum of nearly £2000. Thus I show, without calculating my contingent expenses, or my household expenses, (which, by the prudence and good management of a discreet and affectionate, but now unhappy, wife, were very small,) a disposition of nearly £7000 within three months. Promptly were the premiums paid for the discounts, and I was silly enough to imagine that those who paid for dis<lb></lb>counts would pay bills punctually, which is only another proof of my want of experience in business, and false confidence in my own abilities; and, consequently, with the cash I received for bills which were really good I discounted fresh ones. The £7080 odd which I realized by the stock, together with the premiums I received, and the small sum of 144<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which was received from my law business during seven months, and which is proof of the very depressed state in which it was, were the means by which I made the outlay; so that when I was taken into custody, I was almost without a pound. If, my Lord and Gentlemen, I had obtained this money for the love of plunder, I could not stand before you, and hope for your commiseration; but fallen as I am in my own estimation, and fallen also as I must be in yours, still I do with confidence look to your humanity to bear patiently with me, while I detail to you this story of human infirmity. My means but not my objects were unjust—my intention was to pay my debts honestly, to keep up my respectability, to avoid a gaol and disgrace, and to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183609190010"></xptr>
               <p>replace, by my exertions, my brother's property; and the best proof I can give of my intentions having ultimately been to replace the stock is, the fact of my having paid into the hands of my brother's bankers, to his ac<lb></lb>count, the amount of the tow half-yearly dividends, as they became due in January and July of this year, amounting together to nearly £240. My brother is aware—he is convinced, that my intention was to replace the stock, and my distress is only the more intense, as I know his kind heart bleeds by my disgrace. Of the Bank of England I feel it my duty to speak—to that body I feel very grateful for the kind manner in which they consented, when I was first taken up, to allow me as much time as possi<lb></lb>ble before trial. In prosecuting this case, they have acted, no doubt from a sense of public duty—and I have no right to indeed I do not, complain—I am only anxious to convince your Lordship, and you, Gentlemen, as also the Bank, that while I am not denying the facts, I am sincere is assuring you that a fraud on the Bank was never contemplated by me he the remotest degree, that I was actuated by no dishonest motives, and my firm intention was re-investment. Do not let it be here supposed, for a moment, that I would by any explanation of my motives, seek to justify the criminal act—this is not my desire—this I know to be impossible—I too well know that improper means are not justified by the end, and that the act itself, whatever the intention, the result remains the same in the sight of God and man. The distracted state of mind I have suffered—the days and nights I have spent in anxiety, tormented by agonizing thoughts, by the stings of a self-accusing conscience, by the but too well founded fears of undergoing the sentence of an earthly tribunal—and above all, the still greater dread of being perchance suddenly cut off in the midst of my sins, and suffering, unprepared, the more awful sentence of the Great Judge of all—these sensations, I say, would have been more than sufficient to convince me of this fact, had it required any argument or proof to do so the only desire I have, is to impress upon your minds that no fraudulent design, or dishonest motive, instigated the act; and I confidently trust, that from the facts now laid before you, and the arguments adduced, you do feel convinced of this circumstance. This address has been unavoidably long, and its imperfections I hope will be attributed to the agitation of mind I feel, and the awful situation in which I stand. Could I have addressed you by my Counsel, no doubt the statement which is that imperfectly conveyed to you, would have been more clear, and the peculiar circumstances which actuated me, would have been in stronger and more powerful terms argued and reasoned upon, so as to have thoroughly con<lb></lb>vinced you, that in action only, and not in motive, I was blamable—I am in this matter (as my fate has been in all others) unfortunate—for a few days' delay, I believe, would have given me the privilege and advan<lb></lb>tage of that legal assistance which, by law, I am not now entitled to have In the full confidence, however, that you, my Lord and Gentlemen, will make all allowances for my feelings and manner, and that you will, not with<lb></lb>standing the verdict which must pass against me, accompany that verdict with such a recommendation of mercy as my peculiar situation and cir<lb></lb>cumstances induced me to crave of you; I will conclude my address in few words. I earnestly entreat you to consider well before you decide upon the fate of a fellow-creature—let your best feelings come forth and have some weight in your determination—forget not that I have a wife, a poor unhappy partner, in misery, who is innocent of my offence; aye, and remained utterly ignorant of it, as well as every circumstance connected</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183609190011"></xptr>
               <p>with it, and the extreme difficulties which drove me to it, until after my capture, when she was suddenly, and without warning, plunged into wretchedness. Forget not that upon your verdict, in a measure, depends whether she remains a wife or become a widow—whether my infant, my innocent child, is to become fatherless—bear in your minds also, and engrave it upon you hearts, that I have two respected and venerated parents, one of whom may be looked upon, from illness and afflictions, as almost on the verge of time and eternity, and that the downfall of his un<lb></lb>happy son might, indeed, be the means of hastening his death—of bringing his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave—Oh! add not to my sin and suffering this agonizing reflection—think that these unhappy parents, as well as a family, which has ever been highly esteemed and beloved, and a large circle of relations, are anxiously and painfully waiting your recommendation—think on all this, I implore you, and act not till you have thought. I resign myself into your hands, and may that great and merciful God who governeth all things and all men, who ordereth the thoughts and actions of his creatures, and maketh them subservient to his will, possess your hearts with a feeling of mercy for the wretched individual whose fate is now in your hands, and who pleads for mercy at the door of your hearts.</p>

On the 24th of December, after six o'clock in the evening, (it was dark) I was in the shop speaking to Mr. Brown, a customer - when a pane of glass was dashed in with great violence; I found a watch case taken out of the glass case - it was taken at that time I am sure, for I saw it safe in the afternoon. Brown ran out, and a cry of Stop thief! was raised. I did not pursue, fearing that if I left the shop, more might be taken; the prisoner was brought back by several people, and the case was given me. He said it was his first offence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure this was after six o'clock - A. Yes, for I had set a watch just before, and I was at tea when the clock struck six. I could see the watches hanging on the rail. I know this case, for I have the inside which fits it. I rent the house.</p>

            . On the 24th of December, I was walking up Well-street, and opposite Margaret-street, I heard a cry of Stop thief! I turned round and saw the prisoner running towards me as hard as he could; I seized him - he had a handkerchief in his hand wrapping something up; I took hold of the handkerchief, and he slipped out of my hand; I took him again; Brown came up, and said he was the man. We took him back to the shop, and I found the watch case in the handkerchief, and gave it to Walker.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going down the street and saw some boys running, I ran, heard a cry of Stop thief! and picked up the watch case, which I saw one of them throw down - the gentleman took hold of me and took it from me, then let me go. I heard the cry, ran down the street, and some men took hold of me; I said it was the first offence, because he said, if I owned it, he would let me go.</p>
               <p>Five witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher of Rowland-row, Stepney-green—on 17th October I was in Dorset-street, Salisbury-square, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—a crowd was round a drunken woman—I went up to see—I did not perceive any one till I felt a tug at my watch, in front of me—I looked down and saw my guard hanging down by my watch—I had seen my watch safe the very instant before that—I did not exactly see it—I felt it was there in my waitcoat-pocket—when I looked down and saw the chain hanging, the watch was gone—I saw the prisoner standing within half-a-yard of me, in front—he was the only person near me—there was a crowd</p>

               <p>certainly, but he was near me, and with his back to me, just turned round—he was so close as to leave no doubt on my mind that it could be no one but he that had taken it—when I turned round he ran away—I ran after him calling, "Stop thief!" as lustily as I could, and in, I should think, about five, or six, or eight minutes afterwards, I found him in the custody of a policeman—this is my watch, and it is the same that I lost on that occasion—I was showing it at the time—the constable produced it—lie had the prisoner in custody—it is my watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When asked by the policeman if I was the man that took his watch, he said, "No." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I was asked the question, and I said, "That is the man; I know him perfectly"—I said I did not sufficiently see his face, but by his whole contour of person I knew him, and I knew the collar of his coat; it was rather a peculiar collar—I had followed him the whole way.</p>

I am a cheesemonger's assistant, and live in Fetter-lane—I was in Dorset-street on this afternoon, at this time, close to the last witness—the prisoner was standing next to me, and I looked him very hard in the face—I saw him take Mr. Israel's watch out of his pocket, wrench it off the chain, run away a little distance, and then drop an old rag as he ran, and the people stopped then; they did not follow—I saw him. taken out of the passage—I looked him hard in the face before he took the watch—there were two of them.</p>

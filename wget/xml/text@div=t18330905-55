            . I am a salesman in Thames-street. I sold Mr. Pierce twelve kits of pickled salmon on the Monday, and he came for them on the Friday; this is the top of one of them; I know it by the mark - I may have seen the prisoner but don't remember it - I had not sold him any salmon that day, for I had none to sell.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have bought a great many tubs of him. Witness. I cannot say that I recollect it - I am sure I did not sell him this on that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a billiard-table maker—About half-past 2 o'clock on the morning of 25th January last, I was proceeding along Lancaster-place near Waterloo-bridge. I was attacked by three men—one caught me round the throat, while the other two were in front. I hallooed "Murder and Police"—the prisoner Machin had hold of my arm—one seized me round the throat, and Fitzgerald tore my pocket out: there was in it a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, sixpenny-worth of half-pence, and two farthings, one of which had a hole in the centre, 3 keys, a knife, and a comb—the policeman, No. 20, and the toll-collector, heard my cry, and ran to my assistance—two of the men ran towards the Strand pursued by No. 20, and Machin ran across the road towards the new wing of Somerset House, and he was stopped by the toll-collector—he kept him till the policeman came back, and we then gave him into custody—here are 2 farthings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), one of them has a hole—I know that farthing—these 3 keys are my property, and this comb and cigar-tube—I was sober on this night.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Barking—on 6th April, between 1 and 2 in the day, I found my window broken close to the fastening, and saw the prisoner running away—I ran after him, and found him in a ditch—I said, "You have been trying to break into my house"—he said that he had not; he only went to do a job for himself—I said, "The woman next door saw you come out at the window—he said, "I have not been in the house; you can search me if you like"—I did not do so—he went back with me, and said going along, "I attempted to get in, but I have not been in, and I have not got anything, and I hope you will not give me in charge"—I gave him in charge—my window was not broken when I went from dinner.</p>

Q.</hi> Had I got my trousers undone in the ditch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No: you were sober—you did not say that you went to the back of my house for decency's sake—thera was a woman picking stones near my house, but she could not see you break the window, as there is a high hedge, and a bank, and a fence; nor could anybody see you from the road.</p>

                  </hi>. I live next door to Mr. Scarborough—I heard a noise as if some one was passing open a window—I then heard it again, and then a third time, and there was a tremendous crash—I went round the back way, and saw the prisoner: standing against the back window with a small pen-knife in his hand, cutting out the putty from the pane which was broken—I asked him what he was doing: he said that he came in to the closet—I said, "You did not; here is no closet here"—he got over the fence, and went into the road—I gave information, and he was brought back.</p>

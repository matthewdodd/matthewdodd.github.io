                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 122). On Easter Monday, 17th April, I was near Woolwich Pier, about 5 o'clock in the evening, and saw the three prisoners come from a steam boat—I watched them—they walked together to the Water-gate, and from there to the market—they spoke together, and walked back to the Pier—I saw Martin go to the ticket place, and take three tickets—the other two prisoners went a little in advance of Martin, and when he had got his tickets he overtook them, and I followed the three on to the dummy, which leads to the boat—when there, I saw Burn stand by the side of a lady, and put his hand into her pocket—he took his hand out, with nothing in it—I then saw Edwards place himself by the side of the prosecutrix, who was on the dummy—Burn placed himself on the left side, and Martin behind him—I saw Edwards put his hand into the lady's pocket, and take out a purse—they all three went away together—I spoke to the lady, and followed the prisoners on to the other boat, which was going to the Eastern Counties—I took Edwards by his arm, and as soon as I had done that, he dropped this purse from his right hand—a lady on the boat picked it up and gave it to me—she said, in Edwards' hearing, pointing to him, "That man threw it down"—Burn and Edwards were standing close together, and Martin stood a little away—I got assistance, and took the three prisoners into custody—Martin gave his address, No. 15, Shapp-street, Hackney-road—I have inquired, and no such person lived there—Edwards gave his address, No. 13, Jewin-street, Fore-street, City—I found the place, and made inquiry there—this is the purse, in the state it was when I picked it up.</p>

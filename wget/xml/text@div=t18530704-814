On 26th Jane the prisoner came between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, she asked for half a pint of porter—I gave it her, it came to 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she laid down a shilling on the counter—I put it in the till where there was only one half crown, no other shilling—I did not give her change, because Mr. Young a neighbour asked me to look at the money, which she had given me—he looked at the shilling, and I looked at it too—it was bad—Mr. Young said the prisoner had offered him a bad sixpence for half a pint of porter—he asked her what she had done with the sixpence—she said she had thrown it away—Mr. Young went for the policeman, and he gave her into custody—I marked the shilling, and gave it to the policeman—I am sure it was the same I had received from her—I saw the policeman take from the prisoner's hand a tin box, which contained a bad sixpence, and a bad shilling—he took her to the station.</p>

On Sunday night 26th June, I went to Mrs. Parson's, and the prisoner was given into custody for uttering a bad shilling—she had a tin box in her hand, I took it from her—it contained a bad sixpence, and a bad shilling—I told her they were bad, she said she did not know it—I afterwards apprehended a man, and while I was searching him in a public house, at a short distance from where I took the prisoner into custody; I saw the prisoner had got a paper in her hand which she dropped, I took it up and found in it a sixpence—a female searched the prisoner, and found on her one farthing—I produce the money.</p>

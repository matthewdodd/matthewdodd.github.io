When he came in, he stood at the front of the mantle piece, with one hand on the mantlepiece; I asked him civilly how he did, he came and shook hands with me, and sat down on the opposite side of the table, the servant of the house came and asked him what he had ordered, and whether he wanted any thing; he said, bring me a pint of beer, during the time that she went to fetch the beer he put his hand into his pocket, and took out a knife; when she brought the beer, he tendered this knife until he paid the money the next day; she immediately refused the knife, and took the beer back to the bar, her master told her she did very right, he sat two or three minutes, then he went to the bar, and got the pint of beer on credit, he brought the beer, and asked me to drink, I told him I did not wish to drink, but he forced me to drink out of the pint of porter; he forced me to drink the second time. Then three young men came into the house, they came to the box that we were sitting in, and asked him to sit higher up the seat, he moved higher up the seat, came round, and sit at my right hand. One of these young men, I had a slight knowledge of, and I was in conversation with them; these three young men had a pot of beer, they asked me to drink two or three times, for which reason I passed the pot, after I drank to these people that gave it me, then the prisoner at the bar got held of my right hand, and squeezed it very much, as I thought in friendship, I turned my head, and desired him not to squeeze my hand so, that it was not agreeable. The pot passed again after that; after he squeezed my hand, and while I was leaning across the table conversing with these young men, the prisoner took out a knife, and passed it upon my throat, and said, b - r your eyes, I will kill you.</p>
               <p>Q. You were leaning across the table - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He put the knife to your throat while you were leaning across the table - A. Yes, I immediately started up, and put my hand to my throat, and ran out of the box for fear of the second attempt, he had cut me, but I ran out of the box for fear he should attempt it the second time. I went to the bar, and said to the landlord, that old villain has cut my throat, and I do not know for what, I was immediately taken to the watch-house, by two men, bleeding very fast; from the watch-house I was conveyed to the hospital by two patrols, as an accident, and there I remained three weeks and two days in the house, and last Thursday week, I was made an outpatient.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you given him any offence - A. No more than what you see now.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you account for it - A. No other way than my passing the pot to the people that gave it me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What employment do you follow - A. A cork-cutter.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember you laid with me about ten days - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I asked you why you laid abed so long - A. You did, I said that did not belong to you.</p>
               <p>A. You picked my knives out of my pocket, four out of this, and some out of the other, and if I did cut you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180909200045"></xptr>intoxication, I should have been murdered if I had not; if I did do it I did it at the risque of my own life.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I will tell the matter as nigh as I do recollect, first of all, I wish to address your Lordship and the jury and the hearers; I was in a state of intoxication at the time this matter happened; I had 9 knifes in this pocket and 4 in this; I had known that young man only 10 or 12 days before this happened by sleeping in a room with him. On the day this happened I sold 2 knifes to some women in Smithfield; I went down Chick Lane to find a lodging for a man and a woman I did get them a lodging. I went into the public house; I do remember seeing that young fellow; I called for a pint of beer to put the time over for the horse fair. I dropped to sleep and got into a doze; to the best of my recollection this young man sat on the side of me and that young woman on the opposite side of the box, they sung some scamping songs. I wore a surtout coat over my body coat, I missed my knives, I said, young fellow give me the knives, he called me an old b - r, there were some people on the other side of the box, who I believe were his companions, they slipped into the other box; however, I had a knock of my nose, they took all the knives away from that pocket, and some from this; I am an old man, excessive lame, and very weak; I was seven weeks in the hospital, for the rheumatism, I was obliged to drink laudanum and rhubarb, and upon my word, eleven shillings and a halfpenny was the last money I had after I had pledged all my clothes, and if I did wound the man, it was in my own defence. I was an entire stranger in the place; I was an helpless old man among a parcel of people who had robbed me, and whom I considered as dangerous, afterwards I was taken to prison, they were obliged to wash me in the yard, and dress me in these clothes, I have had nothing but the prison allowance, bread and water, for five weeks.</p>

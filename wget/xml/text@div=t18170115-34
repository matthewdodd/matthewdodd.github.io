            . I work for Messrs. Freaks, sugar-bakers, Thames-street, I live there; the prisoner and the deceased also lived there, and were in their employ. On the <rs id="t18170115-34-cd171" type="crimeDate">28th of December</rs>
                  <join result="offenceCrimeDate" targOrder="Y" targets="t18170115-34-off170 t18170115-34-cd171"></join>, the prisoner and the deceased went out together, and came in before nine o'clock in the evening, and came into the place where we eat our victuals; I was there with them, we began to eat our supper: they appeared to be on very good terms. They had worked for Messrs. Freak about four months, and used to sleep in the same room. When the prisoner had done eating, he took up a candlestick which was bent, and began to straighten it with the poker. The deceased was at the table, and had not finished his supper; the prisoner was knocking the candlestick with the poker on the table, the decased desired him to desist. The prisoner continued knocking, and the deceased went from the table to push him away; he stepped back a little, and the prisoner continued knocking; the deceased laid hold of the poker, and they began struggling up and down, pushing one another about, each having hold of the poker, for about five minutes - They appeared to be in a passion with each other; they each let go of the poker with one hand, but holding it with the other, they struck each other with their base hands; they then laid hold of the poker again with both hands, both trying to get it. The prisoner wrenched it from the deceased, and hit him over his head with it twice, and after the last stroke, the deceased fell down. They were both in a passion, and in liquor. The noise brought the people down. The deceased was bleeding.</p>

               <p>HENRY WORTHINGTON. I am house-surgeon of St. Bartholomew's Hospital; I saw the deceased at the hospital before his death; when he first applied to me, there was a large wound on his head - He was in a stupor; he died on the Friday evening. I opened his head, there was a large fracture in his scull, which might have been done with a poker; and, in my judgment, that was the cause of his death.</p>

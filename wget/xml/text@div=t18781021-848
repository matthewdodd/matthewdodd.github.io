                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 28, Nicholas Lane—I was present at the trial of Edwards <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Sprange—I heard Hart give his evidence—he said he regarded Sprange as his partner from the first time that he saw him sign the books at the bank—Barclay and Bevan's Bank was mentioned—in answer to my question, Hart said "I never heard Sprange say that he was not my partner"—in March, 1878, Sprange consulted me about Hart's business—there was a conference between Sprange and myself at my office—Sprange was my client—Hart attended—the primary object of the conference was to introduce capital into the business of the National Bread and Biscuit Company, which was not a joint stock company—it was the prisoner's business—there is no company—Hart told me upon that occasion that Sprange was not his partner, and that he would not have a partner—the question was as to what number of shares Hart should have and what number should be given to Sprange in satisfaction of his debt—I sketched a scheme, or rather I spoke of a scheme; then Hart took the objection that as Sprange was not his partner he was not concerned as to how many shares he got—I believe that was on the same occasion—the interview came to an end for that reason, and there was an end of the matter—at the West<lb></lb>minster County Court I put the question to Hart as to whether he had ever said that Sprange was not his partner, and he said "I never heard Sprange say that he was not my partner."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I do not know that Sprange had been in the hands of another solicitor—he came to me first the end of April—now you mention it I believe the County Court action was in May—six or seven actions have been brought since—the settlement of an action has not been contemplated—the County Court action was for advertisements in the <hi rend="italic">Echo</hi>, on 8th, 10th, and 17th January, 1878—I do not remember the Judge saying "This case depends firstly upon whether there was a partnership as a matter of fact, and secondly whether the defendant did anything that would justify the plaintiff considering him a partner; these are the sole points"—he said there was no defence—he had before him the bank books</p>

               <p>of Sprange jointly with Hart for January—I have no doubt he also had the letter of 12th or 14th December, because the observation was made at the time, but I do not remember at what stage—when the matter was placed in my hands I did not know Hart was in pecuniary difficulty—I knew he wanted capital—he said the biscuit baking was a good business—I did not think it was worth starting a company for; that idea emanated from Hart—a small company was contemplated—Sprange was to have some<lb></lb>thing to do with it—I was not—I should charge my costs—the company only consisted of Hart and Sprange—no doubt Sprange was fearful of being liable and consulted me—I gathered that he had consulted a solicitor who was a friend of his, but he had not taken any formal advice of any solicitor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of Seething Lane, City—I had known Sprange many years prior to November, 1877—in consequence of a conversation which I had with him on 5th November, 1877, I went with him to meet Hart to a restaurant in Crutched Friars—he introduced me to Hart as a gentleman wanting a book-keeper in his business, and asked me if I could undertake it, Mr. Sprange having said that he had advanced money to Hart—then terms were made as to what I was to receive—Mr. Sprange said that he could not engage me, it not being his business, but Mr. Hart's, and Hart must make any arrangements that were necessary—I went into Hart's employment immediately, and remained four months—in the course of my business I opened this cash account of A. C. Sprange—I remember a meeting at the counting-house at which Mr. Sprange, Mr. Hart, and myself were present—that was early in January last—Mr. Upton urged being appointed manager of the business, and Mr. Hart was compelled to make that appointment because he was the only person who could make it—Mr. Sprange said so when Mr. Upton came for the place—I always under<lb></lb>stood Hart to be the proprietor of the business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I did not say before the Magistrate that Mr. Sprange said he could not make the appointment of book-keeper—I was not asked—the charge was dismissed before the Magistrate—the business was not a large one monetarily speaking, it wanted capital—I was not put there to look after Sprange's business.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn factor—I was introduced to Mr. Sprange with reference to this baking business, in consequence of which I had an interview with Hart, and went into the matter very fully with him—Hart said it was his business and "I shall give you a share, but you will let me have money." I said "What for?" He said "I want to repay money that I have had from other people," and that he had had 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Sprange and wanted to pay it off, and if I would lend him that money he would give me a share—I asked him what position Sprange held, and what security Sprange held for his 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "Nothing except the profits of the shop"—we discussed whether I should have a third or half share, and in answer to my inquiries he said Sprange was not his partner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was not asked, but volunteered to give my evidence about a month ago—I did not go to the police-court—Hart did not tell me he wanted to pay Sprange out, and that he wanted it done in six months.</p>

               <p>Simpson's Chop-house, when he spoke of whole-meal bread, which was being made by Hill and Co., and he recommended me to try it—Hart said he should start himself by-and-by—we had interviews from time to time about it—Hart asked me to lend him money—I lent him from half-a-crown to half-a-sovereign, and sometimes a sovereign, but very seldom, small sums—in September, 1877, it was proposed that I should lend him money on the profits of the business—I declined till I was sure I could do it without making myself liable beyond the amount I lent—I then purchased Smith's law book on Partnerships, and Hart and I consulted it together—I am afraid we were none the wiser afterwards—I began to advance Hart money about the middle of September—the first cheque was for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, but it went on to the extent of about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in six weeks—with guarantees and everything I am liable for about 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we had many conversations about my being regarded as his partner—he said he would hot have a partner, and secondly, he would not for a minute entertain the idea of my becoming his partner—that was stated repeatedly—I was present at the interview with Hart and Heritage at Mr. Heritage's office—I heard Hart say distinctly in Mr. Heritage's presence that I was not a partner—I also remember the interview between myself, Hart, and Mr. Clease—Hart then stated to Mr. Clease that I was not his partner, and that it was his own business—I was examined at the Westminster County Court—in none of my interviews with Hart did he suggest that I was a partner, or liable as partner; it was the other way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I knew Hart wanted money—the first time I went to Beyan's Bank was on 13th November—I signed a book there; I believe Hart did so—Mr. Upton made advances—I cannot tell you when—I cannot tell when Mr. Upton came first upon the scene—it was before Christmas, 1877—he was to act as secretary—he afterwards had authority to write cheques—in January, 1878, a proposal was made to obtain a loan of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the security of the premises and my personal guarantee—I went to Barclay's on 17th January, when an alteration took place in the books; Upton was then authorised to sign cheques, and Hart ceased to do so—I signed this document—(<hi rend="italic">containing the phrase</hi>: "I shall be jolly glad to have my money returned, with 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bonus, at any time within six months; of course, being relieved from all liabilities")—Hart asked me for it—this is my writing—(<hi rend="italic">a letter to Hart, dated 14th December</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">proposing to form a syndicate, and containing the phrase</hi>, "or take another partner")—that was in the pressure of business, and "another" was not meant—I meant, "take a partner"—it was written after a conversation with the bankers, in which I explained my position to them—I distinctly stated before the Magistrate that the conversation occurred in which Hart stated I was not a partner—Mr. Bevan was a witness—I do not recollect his declining to pledge himself that Hart had said I was not a partner—I heard his evidence—I do not recollect his saying, "I have no recollection of anything being said about the position of Sprange in the matter"—this is my writing, "Please honour the signature of Mr. Frederick Upton on our account; H. W. Har will cease to sign from this date.—A. Charles Sprange, H. W. Hart, Proprietors of the National Bread and Biscuit Company."</p>

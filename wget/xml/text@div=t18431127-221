                  </hi>. I carry on business in the medical line, in Trevor-terrace; I am a surgeon and general practitioner. The prisoner came into my service on the 12th of August—he resided in my house—I had no reason to be dissatisfied with his honesty till the 30th of Oct., when I had a commu<lb></lb>nication from Esther Bryan, my servant, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In consequence of what she said to you, did you speak to the prisoner on the following morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In consequence of that, and having seen something myself (I did not make any examination myself, but Bryan brought me two bottles) I examined the prisoner's great coat on the following morning, and found several packages—I did not examine them all—I then spoke to the prisoner; I desired him to bring his great cost to me, and he did—the contents of the pockets were then taken out, and these things were found there—(<hi rend="italic">looking at Men</hi>)—these things are mine, and I proved them to be so by the paper which he took out of the drawer—I fetched some papers from the shop drawer, and they were the same as these papers—the prisoner said the things were his own, that he brought them from his own house to give to the sundry-man to dispose of for him—I sent for an officer, and the prisoner was given into custody—before he left my bouse in custody he said that was all the property of that kind that he had—I then accompanied him and the officer to the station—his person was there searched, and three other packages were found, making altogether seventeen packages—among these things were found half an ounce of sap green, two bladders, twelve steel pens, two bottles, one pot of ointment, one ounce of lozenges, twelve boxes of pills, and four<lb></lb>teen packets of medicine—fourteen packages were produced in my surgery, and then three more—these are the fourteen, and these other are the three—the value of them would be about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the same kind of paper as is in use in ray surgery—I had such articles as the whole of these in ray stock—here is a piece of sap green, the wrapper of which has the handwriting, in three</p>

               <p>separate placet, of my former assistant, Mr. Reeve—there is nothing on any of the others to distinguish them in that way, but I have the whole of such things in my shop—I was absent from my surgery generally from eleven o'clock till five—the prisoner was left in charge of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any conversation with him about any stock that he might have? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I said if he had any remaining on his hands from the time he had been in business I would take it at cost price—he said he had nothing but a few sundries which would be of no use—these are such things as I would have taken of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been in busi<lb></lb>ness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About ten years—my business, as a chemist, has not been exten<lb></lb>sive—it is not very limited—it is an average business—I do not keep a stock-book—I have not taken stock, as a whole, during the ten years I have been in business—about October my stock was worth about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I am not much accustomed to valuing these things, I only speak generally—the prisoner's brother lived assistant with me for twelve months—I heard from his brother and himself that he had been in business—my own circumstances had never been troublesome to me in my life—I never felt the want of money—I have borrowed money—my circumstances were not crippled during the time his brother was with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever borrow 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his brother on your wife's watch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—his brother had spoken to me about the high price I was paying for drugs, and he said that he could, for ready money, purchase drugs far cheaper than I was buying them, and if I liked, be would purchase those drugs at a low price, at wholesale houses, in large parcels, and I should borrow money of him, as he was in the habit of lending money on interest, and that was the way he employed his capital, and I should give him a bill—I never had given a bill—I did not notice it, and I said, "You shall have this watch (which I believe was the one I have in my pocket)for a few days"—and another time I gave him a bill, which I was not accustomed to, which I think was for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not recollect the amount that was advanced on the watch—I think it was about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know whether it was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was when he first came into my service, in the autumn of 1842—I make no me<lb></lb>morandum of these things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I take it for granted that this money was all paid back in the lump, and not by instalments? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect that—I think the bill was for two months—whether it was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. lent on the watch, I do not know, and whether I paid it by instalments, I cannot tell—when the term expired, the bill was settled, but how, I do not recollect—I believe I gave him the money—I do not distinctly recollect—the first arrangement was, that he should buy the drugs, and 1 should owe him the money, and pay some in<lb></lb>terest; but afterwards he was to have a larger quantity, which I believe came to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was willing to avail myself of a loan of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the purpose of buying at cheap houses—I knew when the prisoner came to me that he was a married man—at least I believed so—I said be might as well let people suppose he was single as not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After a little while did you suggest to the prisoner that he should buy or hire a Clarence carriage for you to ride in, and you would pay him by instalments? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I said as he had a coach-house, and he kept a pony and chaise, whether it was worth his while to keep a larger carriage, which I would pay him for the use of, for two hours a day—I spoke of a four-wheel headed chaise—I looked over his coach-house, and said, "This would not do in case I were to keep a Brougham"—I never in my life instructed him, when the wholesale druggists called, to offer them bills instead of money.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184311270151"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever with him to purchase quantities of candles, and soap, and tea, and sugar, on your account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I suggested, as he had a pony and chaise, if he was to go into the City and make these purchases at the wholesale houses; then when he brought them home, I would take them at cost price, or a portion of them, so as to be a mutual saving to both fami<lb></lb>lies—the prisoner was to buy those things with his own money—I do not know that I told him I had not the present means of paying for them—it was the proposal that he should pay for them with his own money, because I had not the present means of paying for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember any time wishing to postpone the payment of Esther Bryan's wages, from a deficiency of pecuniary matters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have never been applied to by her for wages when I have not been prepared; but my wife has sometimes said to me, "I wish you would let Esther have her wages up to this date, "and I have told her it was not convenient to pay them at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long before you gave this man in charge had he taken a house in your street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not aware he had taken any house—I do not know now that he has—I had not reason to believe that he had taken a house, or was about to take one, to commence business—I have reason to believe it now—I heard it the morning after he was taken—three persons told me—Mr. Chester and the hair-dresser, and a servant, and my wife told me—I will swear my wife had not told me before—at the examination at the station, there was the copy of a letter showing him to be in treaty for a house in the road, two doors from me, but that letter I did not see at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I ask you this question, and permit me to suggest to you to be cautious how you answer: When the wholesale druggists applied for their bills, due the preceding Christmas, did you not authorize him to ask the people to take bills? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—two of my creditors sent word to know if it would be convenient to send for their bills—I sent word it would be conve<lb></lb>nient, and if I did not give them their money in two or three weeks, I would give them bills, which I did—I did not tell the prisoner, that if the servants of any of the wholesale druggists applied for their accounts up to the pre<lb></lb>ceding Christmas, I was unable to pay them, and to offer them bills—I never had any communication with him on the subject of my wholesale druggists' accounts, except those bills I am speaking of—those two bills were for 79<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I certainly do not know that a fortnight before he was given in custody that he told my wife, as well as Esther Bryan, that he was in treaty for a house—the sundry-men never call at my house for the purpose of buying drugs—I told the prisoner, when 1 gave him in charge, that these goods were mine, and I could prove it by the papers—I have mode inquiry about the paper of the man that sold it me—I believe his name is John Croft—he is an oil and colourman, aud I believe lives in the Kent-road; but I bought this in my shop—he is not a sundry-man—a sundry-man supplies leeches and pill-boxes, and things of that kind—I asked him whether he could not identify that paper—he did not tell me it was impossible to do so, that he had above eighty reams, and was in the habit of selling it at various places—he said he did not understand the manufacture of paper—I said the proper way of distinguishing it was by the water-mark—he said he had no means of distinguishing it, because it was not his manufacture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Take any wrapper from any of the drugs you know by the paper, and tell the Jury your means of distinguishing the paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By holding it up to the light you will find there are minute lines which designate the paper, but by way of distinguishing the paper I produce this piece from the drawer, and that exactly corresponds in form and size, edge, and in character.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184311270152"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Allow me to ask, if in ten years' experience you intend to swear to the identity of that wrapping paper by the comparison of it with the piece you hold in your hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly I do—there is not another chemist or drug<lb></lb>gist in the street I live in—this is a cheap paper, which I bought on account of its cheapness, but I have used better paper—I swear to this from the simi<lb></lb>larity of its size and the irregularity of the edge—here is one piece which has writing on it," Bots II" and "Sap green"—this is all the writing of Mr. Reeve—I do not know that I had seen this before—I know I had a piece of sap green—I do not know that I had seen it for twelve months—it is not a drug—it had been kept in a recess—the last time I recollect seeing it was in the till—that was when Mr. Reeve was with me, in the early part of 1842 or the latter part of 1841—it is the custom of my assistants to leave a paper in the till of what they have paid—this means that he had paid out of the till 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for bottles—at the time I saw the paper it was valueless, but by its having "Sap green" on it I suppose it was after that used for the purpose of enveloping a piece of paint—I cannot give any time when I had seen this green—I had seen this box of Inglish's pills, and this Hooper's pills, and this pot of Poor Man's Friend in the drawer in which I keep these things two or three times before I charged the prisoner with having stolen them—I never said so till to-day—I was not asked the question—I have been to the prisoner's house, and seized a box containing between 300 and 400 packages—that is the subject of another indictment—I firmly believe every one of these articles is mine—I think I can undertake to swear positively to about ten or twelve.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now living servant with the prosecutor, and have for nearly two years. I remember the Tuesday on which the prisoner was given into custody of the policeman—I had on the Monday told Mr. Douglas something about the prisoner—I had noticed two bottles of medicine in the prisoner's great coat pocket on the Friday in the week before—his great coat was kept in the bottom drawer in his bed-room, which is in the bottom part of the house, by the side of the kitchen—I looked in the pocket, and saw these bottles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you seen any thing before that induced you to look in that pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, by his coming down for the last month, and closing the door after him—I went and felt, and thought there was something in his pocket, and the next day I went and there were two bottles in it—I looked at night, and the bottles were empty, and then I looked again—before I looked in the pocket I had seen the prisoner go out with his great coat on, and I noticed several times that the pockets were full—on the Monday afternoon I looked into the pocket of his great coat—I found two bottles and a parcel—I am sure there was no more, and from the time I saw them till the policeman came the next day the prisoner did not go out of the house—I told my master on Monday, and on Tuesday before I spoke to my master I examined the pockets again—there were more packages then in it, but I did not count them—my sister lives housemaid in the house, and she had noticed the same as myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother—I live at No. 23, Clifton-street, Finsbury, and am a chemist and druggist—I was in the prosecutor's service from June 1842 till last June—my brother succeeded me about a month after I left, and I think he was there three months all but a few days—he had been in business for himself between nine and ten years ago—when he left business he disposed of a portion of his stock, and kept the remainder, endeavouring to sell it from time to time as opportunity offered—I remember seeing the box in which he kept this stock—I am the son of Commodore Keys, of Bombay—he died about thirteen years ago, and left all of us pro<lb></lb>perty—when I left the prosecutor he had a very small stock—if 400 parcels had been taken from it, they must have been readily missed in so short a space of time—my brother had been living at No. 1, Chelsea Park-cottages—I remember hearing of his leaving his situation—I called on Mr. Douglas in consequence of hearing he had had my brother apprehended, to ascertain what the charge was that he made against him—after Mr. Douglas had asked me how I did, he invited me into the parlour—I went, and they were having lunch—he asked me to partake of it—I had previously asked him what he charged my brother with, and first he said, if my brother had acknowledged that the drugs were not his he would not have done it, and out of the great respect he had entertained for me, he did not intend to press the charge at the</p>

               <p>next examination—he told me his servant had had suspicion about my brother's honesty, and had gone down stairs and examined his pockets at different times, and had carried her suspicions to Mr. Douglas, and Mr. Douglas had told Mr. Douglas of the fact, and he upon that charged my brother—I reminded him that I had previously mentioned to him that my brother had been in business, and had some drugs by him—he made no reply to that—he said he could identify most of the packages he found—some of these articles produced are what my brother purchased of me at Mr. Douglas'—I cannot swear to this sap-green, but I sold my brother a piece of sap-green while I was at Mr. Douglas, and the only piece Mr. Douglas had there—it was in paper—here is a box of Frampton's pills, marked No. 8—I sold my brother some of them while I was in the prosecutor's service—I never told him any steel pens—I sold some iodine to him while I was in the service—it was in a bottle, and this is the bottle—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now turn to a bottle of balsam of peru—is that out of the box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes it is—I sold my brother balsam of peru—it was in such a bottle as this—I know the bottle again—this is it, and this is one of the articles that Mr. Douglas swore to—here is a packet of cardimum seed—I sold my brother some of that while I was with Mr. Douglas—they were wrapped in paper like this, and I believe it to be this very bit of paper, because it has the whole<lb></lb>sale druggist's writing on it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, in the interview you had with Mr. Douglas, speak of the disgrace which would befall your family, and entreat him not to appear at the next hearing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I entreated him not to press the charge—I did not say that if he did not press the charge, the whole of these things should be readily given up—I told bim that it would affect my character so much that I would rather give him the amount, or double the amount—I will not swear that in the course of the whole of that conversation I said one syllable to Mr. Douglas of my having, while in his service, sold my brother an article—I do not know that I did not—I do not recollect having said so, our interview was so short—I was eating luncheon—I will not swear that I gave him the slight<lb></lb>est intimation of part of these things being sold by me to my brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember saying to him that you knew and could swear that your brother had in his possession a box containing drugs and perfumery jars? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly I do—I do not recollect that upon that Mr. Douglas said to me, "Why, it so happens that in the box found there were not any perfu<lb></lb>mery jars"—I did say that I believed, when I was in Mr. Douglas' service, I might have taken a few pills occasionally—I do not recollect his saying, "I suppose you did not take 100 at a time?"—I remember his saying, "Among other things, there is a large box of pills which has on it my printed label."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think you have told us that, after you spoke to Mr. Douglas, he said if your brother bad admitted what he was charged with he would not have prosecuted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not say it in those words—he said, if my brother had not said they were his own, he would not have pressed the charge against him—he said my brother denied the charge made against him; that having charged my brother before the Magistrate, he was bound to proceed with the matter, or it would affect his honour—I observed that my brother would lose all his property if he were convicted—I did not tell Mr. Douglas that I would take care, or his friends would, that there should be an assignment, so as to prevent that; the subject was not alluded to—my brother was living for a year and a half or two years at No. 1, Chelsea Park-cottages, before he went to Mr. Douglas—he was in the habit of coming to me during that time—I was at my present shop—he came to me frequently while he was in Mr. Douglas' service, and frequently while I was at Mr. Douglas'—I cannot positively recollect that any of the sales occurred in Mr. Douglas' presence, but Mr. Douglas knew of my brother's coming to purchase—Mr. Douglas has passed through the shop while my brother has been there with me—he was never present to observe any dealing between us—he was seldom in the shop.</p>

               <p>my brother things—I sold him such articles as these while I was there—this large box is the box my brother had containing the remains of his stock at Chelsea Park-cottages—when Mr. Douglas said there was a large box hav<lb></lb>ing his printed label on it, he did not produce the box to me, so as to call my attention to the description of article—my reason for stating that I would rather pay him double the amount of the drugs than have my brother prose<lb></lb>cuted, was to save my reputation and my name—I had no reason for believ<lb></lb>ing that my brother had really been guilty of any felony; I believed him to be not guilty—I pay nearly 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year rent for the house I occupy—I have been in trade for myself about six months this last time—I remember an application being made to the Magistrate to permit witnesses to be pro<lb></lb>duced to examine the contents of this box, that they might be able to state whether they could recognize any of them, as having sold them to the pri<lb></lb>soner—the Magistrate refused—I remember your protesting against it, and you said you would make that a part of your case to the Jury when he was tried.</p>

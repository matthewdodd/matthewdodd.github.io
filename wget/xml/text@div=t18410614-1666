                  </hi>. I am clerk to Richard Henry Cox and others, of Craig's-court, Charing-cross; he is the senior partner. On the 13th of May I was in attendance at the banking-house—the prisoner came there about a quarter to three o'clock in the afternoon, and presented this cheque—on looking at it I discovered the signature was forged—I asked him who Robert Perks, the person in whose favour it is drawn, was—he said he brought it from the under butler, at the same time handing me this card—he said the person had asked him to get cash for the draft, and to make haste, as the gentleman was going out of "town in the morning; that he received 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and drank a pint of beer with the man, and was to re<lb></lb>ceive 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on his return—I asked him if he knew the butler—he said he did not know much of him, he had seen him before—he said the under butler had sent him to receive the cheque—suspecting it to be forged, I consulted with the firm as to what steps to take, and a policeman was called in—Mr. Lawrence Palk had an account at our house at that time.</p>

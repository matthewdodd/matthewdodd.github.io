I am barmaid at the Coach and Horses, 29, Bay Street Clerkenwell—on 9th October, about 11.30, I served the prisoner with a half-pint of beer—he put down one shilling; I tested it, and told him it was bad—he said that he thought he knew where he took it, and he would take it back—I said that he must pay for the beer, and the landlord said so too—two men were standing there; one of them gave him a penny to pay for the beer, and I gave him back the shilling—the two men stopped a short time longer, and then left; Mr. Westley then closed the house and went after them—I bent the shilling; and this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) looks like it.</p>

I keep the Coach and Horses, Kay Street, Clerken<lb></lb>well, about three minutes' walk from the Horseshoe and Magpie—I heard the prisoner come in and saw him served by the last witness, who when he tendered the shilling said that it was a bad one—he said that he did not know it was bad, but knew where he got it, and would take it back—he said, "I have very near drunk the beer, I may as well finish it"—she said, "You will have to pay for it," he said "I have no money"—I went round and told him he would have to pay, he said that he could not—two men there sympa<lb></lb>thised with him and said "That is hard <hi rend="italic">lines</hi>, a man may have a bad shilling and not know it"—I said "I will call a policeman and see how much bad coin he has on him"—one of the men then paid the penny for him—he asked for the coin to take it back in the morning, and went away—I went out and saw him join the same two men, who whistled to him, and they all went away together—I followed them to Theobald's Road and gave them into custody, but one ran away—the two were searched on the pavement, one was let go, and the prisoner was taken to the station.</p>

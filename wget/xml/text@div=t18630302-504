                  </hi>. I am a furniture-dealer, of 3, Mellor-place, Kensington—on 21st November the prisoner, who owed me money, came and said, "If you can get this bill discounted, you can have a portion of the money to go off my account"—he said he had got an order at Brighton, and was short of money, and if I could spare him some he should feel obliged—I advanced him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had altogether 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the bill is for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it pur<lb></lb>ports to be accepted by Mr. Ormsby—I had another bill transaction with the prisoner last February twelvemonth, supposed to be accepted by Mr. Ormsby—I went to Mr. Ormsby with the prisoner—he said, "You had better wait outside while I go in and see Mr. Ormsby, because the last bill he had his wife heard of, and it caused a misunderstanding"—he came back and said that Mr. Ormsby had not returned from the City—I after<lb></lb>wards received a letter, signed "Ormsby," the same as the signature to this bill—I have not got it—this "William Morriss" at the foot of this bill is the prisoner's writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HAWTHORNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About fifteen months—he is a working upholsterer, and I am a furniture-broker—I have had a good many business transactions with him, but he has only brought me two bills—they purported to be signed by Mr. Ormsby—I never applied to the prisoner to get me accommodation bills in my life, nor to any one, and I never put my name to one—Mr. Barnes is a grocer facing me—I had a dishonoured cheque for some goods I had sold to a mining company in the City, and I took it over to him—Mr. Barnes cashed it for me, and passed it through his bankers, and it was returned—I was indebted to Mr. Barnes 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him if he would take the cheque and deduct his bill to pay himself—upon my oath, I did not apply to the prisoner in the difficulty I was in about the dishonoured cheque, that I might settle with Barnes—I had not seen the prisoner for some considerable time—any bill transactions I have had with the prisoner have always been paid, but not very punctually.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIAMS</hi>. You were unfortunate enough to take a cheque and Pay it to Barnes, which was afterwards dishonoured, and you had to pay Barnes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have received two bills from the prisoner, one in February and one in May last, both of which were honoured—there is a third standing, which is not paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On those two former occasions, did you inquire whether the acceptance was genuine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I thought I could not be wrong in inquiring about the genuineness of this bill, because the time that had elapsed since the last bill was so long that I thought Mr. Ormsby had moved—I advanced the money on this bill because the prisoner said that he was pressed, having a job at Brighton—I consider all bills bad debts till they are honoured—I first discovered that this bill was not signed by Mr. Ormsby a few days before it became due, by the prisoner coming and getting some goods of me worth 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and selling them for one-third of the money, which awakened my suspicion—I took up the 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill when it became due.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 18, Fieldgate-street, Whitechapel—on 24th January I was in the prosecutor's house when Mr. Ormsby called—the prosecutor came in about two hours after Mr. Ormsby had gone, and in the prisoner's presence Moss asked what Ormsby had said—"I told him that Mr. Ormsby had been down to the bank, and stated that the bill was a forgery"—he said that it was his brother—Moss said, in the prisoner's pre<lb></lb>sence, "Well, we had better go up and see if he has got a brother"—we went to St. Petersburgh-place, and before we got to the door the prisoner said, "You and Frank had better go in; I will stop here"—we said, "Oh no"—he said, "You go and knock, in case Mrs. Ormsby should come to the door"—I knocked; a servant came, and I asked if Mr. Ormsby was at home—she said, "No, Mrs. Ormsby is"—Mrs. Ormsby came to the door, and said, "That is the vagabond! he ought to be transported"—we said that we had better go to the station, and see if it was all right—the inspector said that he could give him in charge if he thought proper, and he was given in charge.</p>

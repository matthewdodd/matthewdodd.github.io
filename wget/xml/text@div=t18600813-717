My sister, Mrs. Hodson, keeps the Royal Mortar Tavern, at Woolwich—on 16th July, the prisoner came there and asked for a pint of beer, I served him, and he gave me a half-crown—I put it in the till where there was not any other half-crown—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he left the bar and returned in a quarter of an hour and asked for change for a half-crown—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and put the half-crown in the till—I had not then any other half-crowns in the till but those I had put in—something struck me and I looked at the prisoner, suspecting he had given me a bad half-crown—he left, and I looked at the half-crown and found it was bad—I sent after the prisoner; he came back, and I said, "You gave me a bad half-crown"—he said he was not aware of it, and he gave me the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. back, and I gave him the last half-crown, and he said he did not want it; he took it away—I then examined the other half-crown and found that was bad—I sent after the prisoner again; he was brought back, and I gave him in charge—I marked the half-crown and gave it to the officer.</p>

I am ostler at the Royal Mortar Tavern—the last witness sent me after the prisoner on 16th July; I overtook him about twenty yards off walking slowly—I said to him, "Were you at the Royal Mortar?—he said "Yes"—I said "Be kind enough to come back"—he did so, and the last witness gave him back a half-crown, and he went away—after that I was sent after him again—he was then about fifty yards off—I said to him "Come back, we want you, we are not going to let you off so easy as we did before"—I took him back, the policeman was sent for, and he was given into custody.</p>

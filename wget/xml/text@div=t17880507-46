             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 25th of April, this woman's servant came to the office; I am a watchman; I happened to be at the office, there was only me and the door-keeper in the office; immediately this man came and gave information; I took the key from him; he went away some where; I could not find her; this was on the Friday; upon the Saturday they were looking for her, but could hear nothing of her; on the Sunday evening about half after ten, I happened to be at a publick-house getting a pint of beer; this prisoner and another woman came in together; I knew the prisoner; I immediately spoke to her, and asked her whether she was not such and such a person; she immediately said, she was; that she had been to St. Giles's watch-house, to see to get in there; she said, she wanted to go, to give herself up; I said, for what? then I asked her further, says I, what do you want to give yourself up for? she did not know me at this time; says she, I hear there is people gone down into the country after me, for robbing my mistress; I spoke two or three words to her; I said, I shall take you into custody, and I did; I searched her at the same time; she had nothing upon her, only one half crown; first, I asked her what she had done with the money; the ten guineas; she said, she had laid it all out.</p>
               <p>Had you before this told her that you had any intelligence of her? - Yes; I did.</p>
               <p>Did you give her any reason to expect that she should not be prosecuted? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Then she had a voluntary conversation with you, in which she said, that she had spent the ten guineas? - Yes; she had the cloak on her back; I have it here to produce; it has been in my custody ever since; it is now in the same state it was.</p>
               <p>(Shewn to the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>It is my cloak, I have had it a great many years.</p>
               <p>By what marks do you know it? - There is no particular marks in it, but I know it to be mine; the lace, when I first had it, cost me three shillings a yard; I have had it near ten years.</p>
               <p>To Elliott. Is that the same cloak that was on the back of the prisoner, at the time you apprehended her? - It is: I was going to observe to you, on Monday morning when I got up, and took this woman; she told me she had some things that she had bought with some of the money, and left them at different places; I took her that night to the watch-house; on Monday morning I took her out, and went with her to get the things she had bought; (those things produced;) a bonnet, and several gowns and a petticoat, and handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Court. Was she perfectly sober at the time she conversed with you at this publick-house? - As sober as I am this minute; that day about eleven, she was carried to the office, and committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Some body is gone for, but they are not come yet.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had not other people access to the bureau, as well as the servant maid? - At this time, I had a man servant, as well as this, and another young woman, that goes of errands; but no body had access to my bureau but myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Crown-row, Mile-end-road. On 1st Nov., about half past 5 o'clock in the evening, I was passing along Brick-lane, Spitalfields—I had with me twenty-nine yards of doeskin cloth—I was carrying it on my shoulder—I remember passing the door of a public house—the prisoner was standing at the door of it, and two persons along with him, and I dare say there were two or three persons inside—the prisoner said to me, "Old friend, you are too proud to speak to me now"—I told him he had the advantage of me, I had not the pleasure of knowing him, and I walked on, I should say forty or fifty yards, before anything happened—I was at the corner of a street, when I was caught round my arms from behind by somebody, and another man came behind me and pulled the cloth off my shoulder—it was taken by a man, but I could not identify the man that took it—I could not swear that I had seen that man before that night—I saw him take it from my shoulder, and he gave it to another, a younger man, a few yards Off, and he went off down Fleur-de-lis street—I caught hold of the man who was holding my arms, and it turned out to be the pri<lb></lb>soner; it was the roan who had said, "Old friend" to me—I held him, and called out, "Police!"—I wanted to go after the cloth, but I would not let the prisoner go—I had hold of him, and was going with him between 200 and 300 yards—I had an opportunity of seeing him so as to know him again—at the end of that 200 or 300 yards he came opposite to a lodging house—he dragged me into this house, and then he <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> through a door that is in the side of the house—that door led into a court—I let go of him when he got through that door; after he went through the door was shut—I did not venture to go through—I waited there, calling, "Police!"—two policemen came, and I went with them through that door, which led into a court where there were six or Seven little cottages, and out of one of the cottages the policemen brought the prisoner to me—I said in his presence that he was the man, but he had changed his coat—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When I was brought down by the officer, he objected to say that that was the party, because he could not exactly bring it to his recollec<lb></lb>tion. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, not him; another party who was brought out before him, who I believe was the man who took the cloth from me, but not this one.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, H</hi> 27). On 1st Nov., after 5 o'clock, I was at the bottom of Thrawl-street. I went across the road, and saw the last witness standing at the door of Hurley's lodging house—another con<lb></lb>stable was with me, and one came up immediately after—from what the prosecutor said, I left one constable outside the house—I took another constable with me, and we went through a door in a room in Hurley's lodging house into the court, which contains five small cottages of two rooms each—I went and searched every one of them—I found four men; one was coming out of the entrance of the same cottage where I saw the prisoner—I got a candle, and said to the prosecutor, "Look at these men, and see if you know either of them"—he looked, and immediately pointed out the prisoner as being the man who pinioned him, but he had changed his coat—he did not express any doubt respecting the prisoner; he did respecting one in shirt sleeves, who he said he believed was the man who took the cloth—I told the prisoner the charge—he said he must be mistaken; he had not been out of the house since dinner time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I am not the person; about the time that the prose<lb></lb>cutor speaks of, about half past 5 o'clock, a man, five or six inches taller than me, came up the court; I heard him come up; I sent down one of my girls to see what time it was, expecting a man to come for a coat I had to bind and new button; the girl came and brought word it was a quarter past 5, and as soon as the girl came up, a footstep came up the court; the man asked the girl to give him a pail, or tub, to wash in; she asked me, and I said, "Yes, let him have one, but be sure you bring it up again;" she took the pail down, and heard a great deal of disturbance and bustle at the end of the court; she came up, and said, "There are three or four policemen and a great number of people;" I said to my daughter, and another girl who works with me, "Don't, either of you, go down;" there was a disturbance with the police and the man who was washing himself—they had accused him of this robbery that I am now here for; he is rather older than me; shortly after, Mr. King came up and knocked at the door; I said, "Open the door;" he said, "I want to look if any one is here;" he looked through the room; he found nothing, and was satisfied; he was going down stairs, and he said, "You may as well come with me;" I said, "Certainly, I know I have not been out since half past 1; I know there is nothing can be brought against me;" I went down with him; that was the only time I had been out of my own room since half past 1; it was then a quarter or 20 minutes after 6; I had a shilling job to seat a pair of trowsers in the morning; I took them home and received the shilling; I went in a public house in Whitechapel-road, and it was four minutes after 1; I called for a pint of porter, and stayed and drank it; I then returned to my own house; it was not ten minutes after the time I left the public house till I was at home, and from that time till I came down with King I had not been out of my house; I have been living there the last five years, and neither King nor any one can say I was quarrel<lb></lb>some or troublesome, but always conducted myself well.</p>

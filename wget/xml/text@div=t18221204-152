            . I live in Market-street, Fitzroy-market. On the evening of the 23d of November, I was going from home towards Tottenham Court-road; it was a dirty night, and I struck my foot against a post at the corner of <placeName id="t18221204-152-crimeloc787">Grafton-mews</placeName>

The prisoner was the <rs id="t18221204-152-deflabel788" type="occupation">watchman</rs>

He took up the basket, turned round, and took the purse and crape out of the basket, and took the umbrella from me. I told him he had taken it; he denied having taken any thing of the kind, and said,</p>
               <p>"Mind, this is my number, 20; appear against me, if you dare." I went home, and, in consequence of my landlord's advice, I went to the watch-house again at twelve o'clock. I described him to Howard, and by his advice sat in his chair; and when the prisoner came in I said</p>
               <p>"That is the man." Howard immediately asked if he knew me; he said Yes, he saw me fall; he asked him if he had any thing belonging to me, he said</p>
               <p>"No, I have not." He was making towards the door, Howard prevented his going out, and when he was brought back the purse with its contents were found upon him; the umbrella was under his arm, and a piece of mutton wrapped in my piece of crape. They were all taken from his person in my presence. I immediately knew them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you say the basket fell out of your hand, and then swear I snatched it from you. - A. To save myself from falling, I let them fall; the umbrella dropped; he did not snatch it out of my hand. I was in Howard's chair when he came into the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You signed your deposition before the magistrate, did not you - A. Yes, it was read over to me; (looking at it) - this is it.</p>
               <p>The deposition was here read, in which the witness stated that the prisoner had snatched the basket and umbrella out her hand, and that she was rather intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say, then, that he snatched it out of your hand - A. He took the basket from me, and threw it at me afterwards; he snatched it from me. I let the umbrella fall to save myself from falling; he picked it up, I asked him for it; he said he had nothing of the kind.</p>

            . I am the watch-house-keeper at Cleveland-mews, the prosecutor came to me between nine and ten o'clock at night, on the 23d of November, and said that the watchman No. 20, had robbed her of her purse and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040058"></xptr>umbrella, in Grafton-street, that he took it from her little basket; she had the basket with her at the time, she was not quite sober. I advised her to come about twelve o'clock which she did, she then appeared nearly sober, at twelve o'clock the prisoner came in, it was his time to go off, the girl came just before him and was sitting in my chair, I asked him, if he knew any thing of that woman's purse, she got up, he said</p>
               <p>"No, what woman," I pointed to her, he said,</p>
               <p>"Here let us look at you;" he then said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! I gave you your basket," she said</p>
               <p>"Yes, but you took my purse out first, and the umbrella," she said she was sure it was him; I told him I should search him, he then shifted out of the watch-house with his umbrella in his hand and a little bundle; before I could stop him, he put the umbrella and bundle just down, outside the watch-house door, I caught his hand and pulled him in, and took up this umbrella and bundle, the girl immediately said that is my umbrella, and that the gauze in which he had wrapped some meat was her's. he said it was veal, I opened it and found it was mutton, he said he gave 6 d. a pound for it, I began to search him, he pulled off his watch-coat, his own coat and waistcoat and threw them down; Shepherd picked up the coat, the purse dropped out of it; I produced the umbrella</p>

               <p>"That is the man who took my purse," he denied any knowledge of the purse, but said he had seen her and picked her up, but had none of her property, when he found he was going to be searched, he shifted out at the door with the umbrella and bundle, Howard pulled him in with them, and when he put the umbrella on the table, she said,</p>
               <p>"That is mine and the crape round the bundle is mine," he then threw off his watch-coat, his own coat and waistcoat, all at once, and as I turned the waistcoat up, 3 1/2 d. and a purse fell out, there was several duplicates in the purse.</p>

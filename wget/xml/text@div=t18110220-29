            . I am a ticket porter, I ply at the Change. In December, I cannot ascertain the day of the month; I recollect a person applying to me to get a note cashed at the bankers. I verily believe the prisoner to be the person. I was on my stand at the Bank Buildings. I believe the prisoner to be the person, he put a paper in my hand, and enquired for St. Mildred's Court, I told him he had passed it; he took a twenty pound note out, and asked me to get two ten pound notes for the twenty pound. And he not asking my name, nor taking any notice of my number, I made a remark upon him. This is the check; I took the check of him; I said, I would do it; I presented it at Mr. Fry's banking-house, they gave me two ten pounds for it; I told them the circumstance that I had remarked; they took my name, and where I plyed; I returned with the two ten pound notes, and received a shilling of the prisoner, I believe; I returned the two ten pound notes to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200024"></xptr>man who sent me. The prisoner said he was waiting for his master, he should have gone by rights himself, but he was afraid of missing his master. I believe upon my oath that the prisoner was the man.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to take the number of these three - A. On account of the notice that we had at our office, that four one pound notes were included in that parcel, and three of those produced by the prisoner to me were three of those four notes; I gave to Mr. 
               <persName id="t18110220-29-person333">Newton</persName>

               <p>JOHN NEWTON. Q. I wish to ask you whether that witness gave you these three notes - A. He gave me six notes, I took them to Mr. Stephenson, I have no personal knowledge that they are the three notes; I took the six, and left them at Mr. Stephenson's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before the lad took a memorandum - A. I apprehend it was, I gave them to Mr. Tolman.</p>
               <p>- TOLMAN. Q. Did you receive these notes along with others - A. If I did, I should not know them. I do not know that I received them at all.</p>

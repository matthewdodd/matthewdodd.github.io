            . I live in Angel alley, Bishopsgate street; I have known the prisoner some time. On the last day of June, at half after nine o'clock at night, I was putting up my shutters, she came to me, she had a piece of print under her arm for a gown; she asked me if I would take it in for her, I told her I could not take it in without asking my husband's leave; he gave her leave to leave it; she came in and sat down; she pulled four pound notes out of her bosom, she also took out a pocket book from her bosom, containing a pair of earrings and a seven shilling piece, she said her husband had sent for her to come down and see him; she had a husband at sea; she fell asleep and sat in the chair all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she sober - A. I do not think that she was much in liquor; she was fast asleep, we could not awake her. The next morning she asked me if I would go with her to buy a few things to wear with this gown. I went with her; she came back to my house, and the officer came with this woman and took her. My husband delivered up all the things to the officer. The woman said to the officer this was the woman that had robbed her.</p>
               <p>- SHEPHARD. Q. You went to the last witnesses house to enquire for Dolling - A. Yes, I went in and found the prisoner sitting in a chair behind the door; the prosecutrix came in and charged her with the robbery, she denied knowing any thing of it; I then proceeded to search her; I found nothing on her person. Down by the side of the chair where she sat, I picked up a one pound note. The last witness's husband delivered me this pocket book, he fetched it down stairs, he said the prisoner had given it him to take care of for her. I shewed the pocket book to the prosecutrix, she said it was her property. In a chair, on the left hand side where the prisoner sat, I took this linen, a piece for a gown, a petticoat, and a pair of stockings; the next day, before the magistrate, the last witness delivered me a pair of gold ear rings.</p>

            . Q. Do you recollect the prisoner coming to your house and asking leave to leave a gown there - A. Yes, and I saw a pocket book containing a pair of gold earrings, four one pound notes, a seven shilling piece, and two shillings; the pocket book she had in her hand that night. The next day she gave me the pocket book to take care of for her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the constable coming to your house - A. Yes. He said this woman had lost a pocket book, mentioning the things that were in it; I said the woman in my house has such things.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the pocket book you gave to Shephard was the same that you received from the prisoner - A. Yes; the earrings she had put in the box where the rest of the things had been; the next day I gave them to the constable.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met this body by Crispin street, she asked me to go with her to buy a bundle of calico; I went with her; from there she asked me to go with her to take a gown to a mantua makers; I said Sophia I have got no money to treat you; I took her to a house where I was known in Fashion street, there we had two pints of beer and a quartern of gin; from there we went into another public house, she wanted to vomit, she went backwards, she was gone some time; I was standing talking to a person in the public house; she not coming back I went to her; going along the yard I picked up the pocket book in the yard; I took no notice of it; she was vomiting down the privy, I held her head; I perceived three caps fall down the privy, I took them up and doubled them up as well as I could; she told me to put them in her pocket; as I came along with her she asked me to see her to her mother's, she being in liquor. I had not power to lead her along and carry the child. I saw her safe to her mother's; what was in the pocket book I did not know. I had two glasses more of liquor. I met a person, I said I had a find; I saw this person shutting up her shutters; being in liquor I stopped there as they said all night; I found it, not knowing it was hers; I do not think it is her's, any more than it is any other person's here.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

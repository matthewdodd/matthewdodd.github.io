                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, T</hi> 9.) On Tuesday, 11th Jan., at a little after five o'clock in the morning, I was in a shed adjoining the White Horse, at Shepherd's Bush—the prisoner came up, with a wagon and three horses—he looked at the watering-place, came to the shed, and put his arm out, and felt me down the face—he seemed to be feeling if any one was there—he called out,"Halloo!"—I made no answer, and he walked out of the shed, went to his wagon, and took a truss of hay out, took it on his shoulder, and laid it in the manager, in the shed, three or four yards from the wagon—it was very dark, but I could see out, and see him and the wagon very plainly—he then drove away I put a stick in the hay, to mark it, then followed the prisoner about half a mile towards town—I went to him, and asked how much hay he had in his wagon when he left Turnham-green—he said, "A truss and a bit"—I said, "How much have you in your wagon now?"—he said, "You must go back with me, and look at the bit"—as we were going along, I asked if he had left any there before—he said, "No"—he then said he left it to bait his horses, as he returned—I took him there, fetched the hay, and said, "Is this the bit?"—he said, "Yes"—I took him in charge—the hay weighed 51. lbs.

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. William Gunner, a farmer—he lives at Teddington. The prisoner was his carman—on 10th Jan. I put six tursses on my side of the loft, and nine on the prisoner's side—he helped me—I knew of his coming to London, but I did not know what he took—I was in bed—he was allowed one truss of hay for three horses to come to London—about nine o'clock next morning my master fetched me from the fleld—we went to the loft, and found on the prisoner's side six trusses of hay—there ought to have been seven—he had allowed his horses to eat one truss before he started—this hay is very kike the hay that was there, and is bound almost in the same way.</p>

I had a green silk purse in my pocket, with steel beads, steel tassels, and steel rings—Mr. Wagstaff tapped me on the shoulder and told me I was robbed—I felt, and I had lost my purse—it contained about ten shillings—there were sixpences and fourpenny-pieces in one side and shillings in the other.</p>

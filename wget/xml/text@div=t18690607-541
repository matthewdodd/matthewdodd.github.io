                  </hi>. In September last I was third mate on board the <hi rend="italic">Hertfordshire</hi>, British ship—the prisoner was a seaman, and the deceased the second mate—I remember the 15th of that month—about 9.30 in the morning I was in the hold of the ship, and found that two cases of bottled beer had been broached—I reported it to Window the chief mate immediately, and he and the carpenter went into the hold, followed by some of the watch—when I came out of the hold again I heard the chief mate speak to the prisoner—a quarrel had taken place this morning, about 8 o'clock, between the chief mate and a man named Look, and the chief mats struck him—the prisoner came up and said, "Don't too many get on one man"—I told him not to interfere—Lock was put in irons, and the prisoner was sent aloft to work—he was coming down just at the time I was leaving the hold—the chief mate then spoke to him about the beer, but I don't know what answer he made—he also asked him why he had come down from aloft, as he had not done a day's work—they had some words, and the chief mate made a grasp at him—the prisoner was close to the door of the fore-castle,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186906070028"></xptr>
               <p>and attempted to get inside—the second mate, the deceased, at this time was coming up the hold—the chief mate and the prisoner were scuffling, and the second mate interfered—the three got hold together and fell, prisoner being undermost—I put my lamp down, and went to them—the chief mate was lying on the top of the prisoner, and the deceased was standing and kicking the prisoner on the head—the steward came forward and said, "Don't kick him, don't boot him, don't beat the man like that"—the chief mate and the prisoner then got up—I turned round to pick up my lamp again, and then I saw the chief mate with his hand against his breast—the prisoner seemed to be very much infuriated—the second mate was standing against the cabin door with his hand on the lower part of his belly—I did not see any blow struck—the prisoner was quite furious, and ran towards me as if he did not know where he was going to—the captain then came forward with a revolver, and said to the prisoner, "I will shoot you; do you mean to give yourself up?"—the prisoner then threw a knife away, and said, "I will give myself up"—I and the carpenter came aft and put him in irons under arrest—I afterwards saw the second mate in the cabin—there was a wound in his abdomen, on the left side, from which a large quantity of his bowels protruded—the wound was about six inches long—the captain sewed up the wound, and did all in his power, but the man died at midnight—the knife was a sheath-knife, common to sailors—I do not think the prisoner was under the influence of drink.</p>

I was steward on board the <hi rend="italic">Hertfordshire</hi>—I have been sent home from Francisco by the British Consul there—the crew numbered twenty-two men, the ship being about 800 tons burthen—I remember seeing the scuffle between the three mates and the prisoner, on the 15th September—they were endeavouring to pull the man out of the forecastle, and the chief mate was striking him with his fist—I heard him cry out, "For God sake, will somebody save my life!"—the first and second mates and the prisoner fell on the deck together, and as the prisoner lay on his back, the second mate regained his feet, and commenced kicking the man on the head—he kicked him six or seven times—I said, "Don't boot the man; don't kick him!"—the prisoner released himself, and sprang to his feet, and then drawing his knife from his sheath, he stabbed the second mate in the abdomen—the first mate was in the act of getting up, when the prisoner stabbed him also on the left ribs—I fetched the captain, and when he came on deck, the deceased was lying down, and his bowels were pro<lb></lb>truding from the wound, which was two inches in depth—the prisoner seemed to be in a passion.</p>

               <p>have just arrived from San Francisco—I remember the disturbance with the man Lock on the morning of the 15th September, just after eight bells had struck—when Cranby, the prisoner, came from aloft, the chief mate asked him if he called that a day's work—Cranby said that he had been working—the mate said, "You will have to do a d—sight more yet"—Cranbyreplied, "I will do all I can"—the mate then said, "I am an Englishman "to which Cranby rejoined, "And I am a <hi rend="italic">Yank</hi>,; and the mate then struck him—Cranby was making for the forecastle door, when the second mate laid hold of him, and the third mate came up, too—the three then dragged him to the forecastle door, where they fell—Cranby then called out, "Is there nobody who will save my life?"—the steward was coming forward with some knives in his hand, and called out to Wills not to boot the man—Wills was kicking at his head—Cranby then struck the second mate, and was making a rush at the first when I said, "For God's sake, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, no more of the knife"—Cranby said, "No, no;" and dropped it immediately—the captain then came on deck, and by his orders Cranby was placed in irons.</p>

               <p>made them sore; and for six days I bad no water to wash them. I could not move my head, and my jaws and ribs were swollen from the pain where I had been kicked, and blood run out of my mouth. I was senseless when I had the knife, and do not remember anything about. it The captain told all hands to stand back as he was going to blow my brains out with two revolvers, which he held in his hand. He said, "Do you give yourself up?" and then I looked at my hand and saw the knife, and threw it down imme<lb></lb>diately. They did not allow me to change my clothes, which had become filthy with vermin. When we got into cold latitudes, where there where was snow and ice, I could not keep myself warm, as my clothes were wringing wet from the water running down upon me. The captain defied me to look at him, as if I was a robber, and he told me he would blow my brains out if I did; and he threatened to hang me up by the heels, and set the dog on me.</p>

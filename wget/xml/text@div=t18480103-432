General Fleming, there are robbers in your room"—I made as much noise as I could—I held the door outside, and they pulled inside—they got it open, rushed out, knocked me down, and kicked me—I dod not see them—it was dark—if Mr. Fleming came out of the drawing-room she would have an opportunity of seeing the persons who came down the stairs—Phillipson was brought back to the house in a few minutes—I know him again.</p>

               <p>being a tailor, to a gentleman I worked for, an army clothier, and as I was coming down George-street, in my way home, I heard a cry of "Sop thief!" I joined in the cry; there were thirty or forty persons running; a tall man crossed the road; I stopped; a female was running behind him, and the police<lb></lb>man came up, and laid hold of me; I said, "It is not me, it is the other man across the road;" he looked across, and saw another man running; they took me back to the house; the lady says there were only three females there, there were about twenty in the passage; I am sure ten came out of the back parlour; they searched me, and found this bag on me; I said I was a tailor, and how I gor my living; no keys, or anything, were found on me, only a latch-key, belonging to the house where I lodge; there was a patent Bramah lock to the prosecutor's door, which was taken off, and brought to the police<lb></lb>office; it is a lodging-house, and dress-makers live in the house, and they seemed to be there that evening; the bed-room door was open, and anybody was free to go up and down stairs; no property was tied up or carried away, only these things shifted a few inches; it seems that that the servant had been in the room from six to eight, dusting or preparing for the General to go to bed; she might in her mistake have placed one box on the other to dust the table.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Anderson's Defence.</hi> No one can prove how the persons got in; no locks were broken; on the night of the robbery, from about five in the evening till nearly eleven. I was in Mr. Rowbotham's coffee-shop, sitting reading the paper and talking to the landlord; I went home at eleven, and went to my work again in the morning, and was backwards and forwards there till the Monday evening, when I was apprehended.</p>

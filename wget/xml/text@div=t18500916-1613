                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Collard, a policeman, and live in Eccleston-place, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. I know George Stevens—on Thursday afternoon, 3rd Sept., I saw him in Eccleston-place with his child, bowling the child's hoop—I also saw George Fox there—I knew him before; he lodged at our house—the child's hoop struck Fox's leg—he put his hand on the top of the hoop, and smiled—George Stevens was about a couple of yards from him, and said, "You b—, if you do not leave hold of the hoop, I will punch your b—head"—Fox said, "If you do, I can do the same"—they then both struck each other one blow—Mrs. Stevens came out of the beer-shop, took Fox by the collar, and pushed his head against the shutters—he had nothing on his head—Hayes then came out and struck him on the head, and two or three more rushed on him as well, and kept striking him till they got him across the road—they got him near a cart, and Hayes struck him down, with his body across the shafts of the cart, and his head was lying on the ground; and Mrs. Stevens took him by the hair of the head and knocked his head on the stones—I cannot say on what part of the body Hayes struck him—they lifted him up, and Hayes knocked him down again—the other two prisoners were close to him at the time—Hayes knocked him down several times after that—the Stevens's were striking him while he was down—he got up by himself, and he and Hayes fought again—Hayes knocked him down again, and he came on the side of his head in the road; and Hayes knocked him down again, and that was the last blow, it was under the ear—he did not get up till he was picked up, and carried away to my house—he was insensible—a medical man was sent for—I had seen him before that day, about two o'clock—he was a little the worse for liquor, and went to bed and slept—this happened about five—he was a little the worse for liquor when he went out—his hat was knocked off.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 40, Eccleston-place. On the afternoon of 3rd Sept. I was at my door, and saw Stevens bowl the hoop against Fox's leg—he trod on it, and turned it upward, and put his hand on the top—Stevens said, "Leave go, or else I will give you a slap on the ear"—Fox said he would give him another—Stevens put himself into a fighting attitude, and Fox the same, and struck Stevens on the breast—I did not see Stevens strike him—Mr. Harwood went between them, and parted them; and when he bad got them nearly apart, Mrs. Stevens came up, seized Fox by the breast, and drove his head against my shutters—Hayes then ran up from the beer-shop, about two doors off, and seized on Fox, with Mr. and Mrs. Stevens—he hit him with his fist as fast as he could; I could not count the blows—there was a cart there, with the shafts lying down, without any horses, and as Fox was walking backwards be fell over the shafts, with his head on the ground and his heels upwards—it is a Macadamised road—he got up, and tried to keep them off him—three or four more ran out from the beer-shop, and closed in with the Stevens's—the mob gathered round, and hid the fight from me, and I saw no more—when Fox got up he seemed confused and frightened, and very red in the face.</p>

            . I am the wife of Michael Brennan; we live in Monmouth-street. On the night of the 24th of April I left a public-house, near St. Giles' church, between ten and eleven o'clock - Maria Mayne was with me; I saw the prisoner with two other women; when I got some distance I received a blow on the back of my neck - I fell; I saw the prisoner - she took a shawl from me and ran away; I called Murder! and Police! and she was stopped.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there any other persons with you? A. Yes, there were six of us; my husband and others - I saw you in the public-house - I did not speak to you then - I did not turn and say, "Here is that prostitute following me;" I did not see any fight with you or any of the company; I saw you tearing a woman's bonnet in the public-house, and we went out in consequence of that; you had no cap on, nor bonnet - I had not observed the prisoner following me; I did not see any one with her when I was knocked down.</p>
               <p>MARIA MAYNE. I am the wife of Stephen Mayne, we live in Porter-street, Newport-market. I left the public-house with the prosecutrix, and was on my way home - I did not perceive that the prisoner was following us, till she struck the prosecutrix; there were two women with her - I saw her strike the prosecutrix, and she fell from the blow; the prisoner snatched her shawl from her shoulders, and threw it to the two women, who ran up one of the turnings towards St. Giles' - I believe it is George-street; one of the women caught the shawl; it did not fall I have not said before that it did; I said I believed it was Plumtree-street, but it was not; the prisoner ran off - I called Police! and she was stopped.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not get half a yard away; we both fell together. Witness. No; the prisoner did not fall - I said I should know one of the women who was with her.</p>

            . I am a boot-maker, and live in Rose-street, Long-acre; I was two or three yards behind the prosecutrix - I saw the prisoner make a rush at her; she knocked her down, snatched her shawl, and ran off with it; I pursued, and she threw it to two girls on the pavement - she was running in the road, and did not stop for a moment - I caught her about two hundred yards off - she said, "Sir, what have I done?" I said,"Knocked a woman down, and stolen her shawl" - she begged of me to let her go; I said I would not till the persons came up, which they did in about two minutes - a Policeman came up, we stated the affair to him and he took her; I had been at the public-house with the prosecutrix and her husband; there was a dance there - I do not remember seeing the prisoner there; there was some disturbance, but I do not know what; there had been no insult to the prisoner by any of our party; I did not see any one strike her at all, or call her an improper name.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not all quarrel together in the public-house, and strike me and use me very shamefully? A. I do not recollect seeing you at all - there was a little disturbance about dancing, and the prosecutrix said it was not a fit place for us to be in, and we went out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. These people and I were at the public-house; we had some words, and they all struck me as I was coming down the passage - I then came down the street, and saw the prosecutrix and her friends - she said,"Here is the street-walker, whom we had words with in the public-house;" I said I was no such thing - she then struck me; I defended myself as well as I could - all her friends were about her; I had my cap and handkerchief and all torn off - as to the shawl I am innocent; I had no person with me.</p>

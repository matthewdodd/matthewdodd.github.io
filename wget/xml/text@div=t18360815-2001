                  </hi>. I am a labourer. I knew the deceased Hugh Wood—he was a carman—on the day this happened, I was in Bridge-yard, help<lb></lb>ing him to load a cart with potatoes—there were six sacks—they were put in front, there on each side—he was in the front past of the cart, and I was behind—the body of the cart appeared as usual—there were two more sacks to come in, and the first of the two that was put into the cart tilted up, and we were both shot out—it was put on the back part of the cart at first, and directly the weight came on the tail-board, the cart turned up—the deceased was thrown right out of the cart, on his back, on the stones; and the potatoes were shot out of the sacks, and covered over him—I did not see what he fell on, for I was shot out myself—when he was picked up, I saw the blood on the back of his head—I was hurt—my leg was nearly broken—I did not lose my sense—he was taken to the hos<lb></lb>pital—I did not see him dead—after the cart tilted up, I went round and found the trap stick was out of its place, and was laid against the front of the cart—if it had been in its proper place—the cart not have. tilted up.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the cart—when the seventh sack was put in at the tail of the cart, up went the whole cart, and they were both shot out—after it was over, I saw the pin lying in the front of the cart out of its proper place—I saw the deceased at the hospital on the Monday fol<lb></lb>lowing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cowkeeper, and live in Dean-street, Tooley-street. The prisoner has worked for me for some time—I just came by after the accident happened—the prisoner was not there—I saw him on the Monday following—Wood was then dead—the prisoner said there were several persons, he thought, accused of pulling the trap-stick out, and he was the person who actually did do it, but not with intent to do him any harm as he had seen it done several times before; and I have seen it done myself by other people—that least weight will tilt a cart up when the pin is out—I should think the weight of a man getting into the cart would do it—the prisoner seemed very much affected.</p>

On the night of the 30th of August, I went to bed at ten o'clock: I saw the property safe; I missed it the next morning. I saw my house had been broken open. The sash was taken out of the back kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any particular notice of the goods that Lyons left - A. I saw the blanket that he had left; it was safe on the dresser. I had a woman a washing; I went to give her her supper. All was safe when I went to bed. Lyons goods were left on the dresser in the back kitchen.</p>

            . I am charwoman to Mrs. Joseph. On the 30th of August, I went out a quarter before eleven o'clock. I secured the window and the street door. I saw the basket with the crockery ware in it in the kitchen when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. to Israel Lyons. Now, tell us what property you left in this place - A. I left five shillingsworth more than is here.</p>
               <p>JAMES FAGO. I am an officer. I had information on the 31st of August, that the prisoner had made his escape from a Bow-street officer. I took him in Cambridge-place; he had this basket of crockery-ware, he was shewing them in the parlour. I took him, and this basket of crockery-ware into custody. They have been in my custody ever since. I followed him through information.</p>
               <p>Lyons. This is part of the property I lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the robbery.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose a duck at any time. - A Yes. On the 28th of October our poultry was laying on the window, and the window up; about two o'clock the prisoner came in for a quarter of a pound of butter; another woman came up to the window and asked the price of the duck, I told her half a crown, she said it was too dear; I kept looking at the window, I rather mistrusted the other woman, I did not mistrust the prisoner; I walked out and missed the duck from where I had seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the other woman gone before you missed the duck. - A. It was all within two minutes; I pursued the prisoner, she said she had not got a duck of mine, I said she had; I took hold of her apron and she had the duck in her apron; she then said the other woman gave it her.</p>
               <p>- BLIGH. I took this woman in custody; the duck was delivered to me; I asked the prisoner how she came by it, she said the other woman gave it her to put into her lap; she appeared to be very much in liquor at the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I gave her the duck, and I went down upon my knees; I begged her a thousand pardons; I told her the other woman gave it to me. I did not know but the woman had paid for it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

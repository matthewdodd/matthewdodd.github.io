On the 5th of March, I was on duty in Whitechapel-road, about eight o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoners with a child's four-wheeled chaise—the younger one had a parcel on his back, containing a kettle full of sugar; and there was a large fish-kettle in the chaise full of sugar—I asked what they had got—they said, sugar—I asked where they were going to take it to—the elder one said, to Holborn—I asked him where he was employed—he said, at Mr. Chapman's, Wick-lane, Oldford—that he was al<lb></lb>lowed perquisites of the scums and scrapings of the boiler—I was not satisfied, and took him to the station-house—I went to Mr. Chapman, who came with me to the station-house, and made a charge against him—he did not say a word to the charge—we went and searched their lodging, and found about 30lbs. of syrup, in the same state as the syrup at his master's premises; and in the cart was 60lbs. or 70lbs.—what the boy had was 75lbs.—the syrup at the lodging was in different vessels; some</p>

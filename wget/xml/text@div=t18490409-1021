                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Willett, a linen-draper, of Barking. On the 20th March, in the afternoon, the prisoner came and bought several things, and paid me about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for them—she returned, and desired to look at some black cotton stockings—I showed her some at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said we had some at 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said she would take a pair at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I put them into her parcel with some more goods which she bought—after that, and as she was about leaving, I missed a pair of stockings—I told my master—he followed her out of the shop, sent for a constable, and found the stockings on her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I paid for one pair—you took another pair and rolled them up in my parcel—I said I had one pair, and that was sufficient. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You did not say so—I did not give you the second pair—you must have taken them while I went to inquire the price of a piece of print for you—I had counted the stockings by my master's order before putting them before you—you had been a customer before.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the prisoner in the shop—I had reason to suspect her, and ordered Heath to count everything he put before her—he told me something—I stopped her going out of the shop, and accused her—she said she was sorry for what she had done, and would never do it again, if I would forgive her—I found the stockings in her apron, and the pair she had bought in the parcel.</p>

             sworn. Q. Did you sleep in the same room with the prisoner. - A. Yes, I and three or four more; I went out in the morning, I left the prisoner in the room at that time, I did not remark whether the sheet was gone or no; the landlady came up stairs to put some clean linen on the beds, there were four beds in the room, there was one sheet missing; she came home at night and called her husband, I gave her the candle and she came up stairs, I told the landlady the good woman was come home, the landlady asked her what she had done with the sheet; the prisoner told her not to make a piece of work about it, she would replace the sheet in the morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never said any such thing; the landlady came up and asked me what I had done with the sheet, I said my sheets were on the bed, I did not know about the others; she swore that if I did not own to it she would transport me, there was eight people slept in the room.</p>

On Friday, the 29th of June, I got up about four o'clock in the morning, and went to work at a gentleman's house, till eleven o'clock; then went into a field to assist at haymaking, and found two men mowing - I mowed there till one o'clock, and while I was mowing, the prisoner came into the field; I knew him before, he lived at Hampstead. At a quarter past one o'clock, I went to lay down to rest by the hedge; I looked at my watch when I left my friends, laid down in the next field, and fell asleep under an oak tree - I had left the prisoner in an adjoining field - I awoke about four o'clock, and missed my watch;

On the 3d of July, the prisoner came running after me, and said, there was a d - d piece of work about the watch, that he would shew me the man who had a watch but it was not mine - he pointed out Marriot, who produced a watch, which was mine, he said he bought the duplicate of it of the prisoner on Friday night, the 29th; he did not deny it, and we took him to Bow-street.</p>

            . I am gardener to Mr. Tollard; his cows broke into the field where Marshall lay, I do not know that it was him, but I saw a man laying asleep, and directly as I went over the hedge into the field, I saw the prisoner (who I had known three years), in the act of drawing the man's watch, leaning over him; he was drawing something from the man's person, nobody was with him at the time - I stood looking on, and could then see it was a watch - he came up to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have been doing the soldier," (he had a white jacket on),</p>
               <p>"he is a hearty fellow, we have been drinking all day at the public-house, and I spent 7 s. 9 d. on him, and we came into the field to have a sleep;" I said,</p>
               <p>"You will make him stand some ale for it," as I thought he was playing a joke, he laid down on the grass, and shewed me the watch - I went away, and on Tuesday, heard of the robbery, and informed the prosecutor.</p>

            . I am a labourer, at Hampstead. I bought the duplicate of the watch of the prisoner, between eight and nine o'clock at night, on the 29th of June, for 4 s.; it was pawned for 26 s. I redeemed it the next day. The prisoner came up to me and asked if I had any objection to let Marshall see the watch, I shewed it to him, he claimed it - I collared the prisoner, and said he should go to the office.</p>

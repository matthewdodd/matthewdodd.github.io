                  </hi>. I am a watchman in the employ of Matthew Cotes Wyatt, builder, Dudley-road, Paddington. On the 22nd of Nov., about seven o'clock in the morning, I was in South-crescent, watching some houses for him—I saw the prisoners with some others—they filled a bag with some chips and some bricks of wood out of an area in Southwark-crescent—I did not see them go down into that area—the prisoner went up Radnor-street with the bag—I followed and asked what he had got there—he said, "Nothing"—I said he had got some property of my master's, and he had better go back to him—there were two others with him, who ran away—he went on to Star-street—he stood a few minutes, and then threw down the bag, and ran—I ran after him, and the inhabitants went and shook the wood and chips out of the bag—they took out the pieces of quartering, and said, "Thank God, there is the principal part gone"—there were a great many people about, and they ran away with the bag—I picked up the remainder of the wood—I am sure the prisoner is the boy.</p>

When he had thrown me down, he clapp'd his Thumb under the Root of my Tongue, and his Fingers upon my Nose, and press'd me so hard that the Blood ran out of my Nose like a Tap. I scream'd out, and in about a quarter of an Hour, up came 3 Men, and I told them I had been robb'd, and they went in Pursuit of the Prisoner, but could not find him. I went back to Mr. Prices, and the next Morning he sent out 2 Men and Horses, but they could not light of him. At last he was taken at Holloway.</p>

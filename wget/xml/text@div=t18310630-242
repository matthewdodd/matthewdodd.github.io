               <p>SARAH HOW. My husband is a wine-cellar man. On the 28th of June, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I went out to market, and saw the prisoner in Whitechapel-market; the boys in the market were using her ill - I told them to go home, and asked where she lived; she said in Petticoat-lane, and that her husband was a drover - I took her into <placeName id="t18310630-242-crimeloc1273">Petticoat-lane</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you ever see me before? A. Not to my knowledge - I swear positively she is the woman.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutrix gave me an account of this - her eye was badly bruised and puffed out; she described the woman to me - I knew where to find her, and found her in bed about twelve o'clock that day, in a room in New-court, Wentworth-street - she had some of her things off; I found no money on her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to call my witnesses.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM -. I keep the King of Prussia, in Petticoat-lane. The prisoner and prosecutrix came into my house on the morning this happened, about eleven o'clock- they were both a little in liquor; they called for a quartern of gin, which I served them with - after that they had a pint of beer together; I did not hear a word mentioned about a robbery - the prisoner had a basket of eels, which she was taking home to clean, (I suppose, as she sold eels;) I saw they had both had liquor enough, and would not serve them more - they had not had quite enough when they came in; they were intoxicated - they seemed very good friends; after I told them to go away the prosecutrix endeavoured to take the eels from the prisoner, and in the scuffle the prosecutrix received the blow - I got between and separated them, and got my shirt torn; I put one out at one door and the other at the other - the prisoner's husband took her home, and the prosecutrix remained at my house for half an hour - the prisoner said the man was her husband; I have occasionally seen him pass my door - they fought in my house: there was no pretence for money being taken away - she received the blow in the eye in my house.</p>
               <p>SARAH HOW. I never was in his house in my life, nor in any house with that woman - the Policeman can tell whether I was intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Witness. It was an hour and a half after it was done that the Policeman took the prisoner - when she went outside my door I heard her say she had lost 3s. 6d.; she told the officer it was 13s. 6d.</p>

            . I was standing at my door, opposite the King of Prussia. I saw the prosecutrix and the prisoner at the corner; a great crowd was standing round - the prisoner's husband came and took her home; I left the prosecutrix standing among the people - I had seen the witness put them out; they were both intoxicated - the prisoner could hardly stand on her legs.</p>

            . I sell strawberries. I was coming home about eleven o'clock, and saw the prisoner and prosecutrix going along, arm-in-arm, reeling in the pathway, and as I came back, in Wentworth-street, I saw the publican turning them out together - I stood to see the row, and in ten minutes saw the prisoner's husband come along; he carried her home in his arms, leaving the prosecutrix with eighty or a hundred people round her.</p>

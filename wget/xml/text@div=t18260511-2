On the morning of the 14th of April I got up about a quarter past five o'clock - it was quite light. I found the wash-house door and window open - the door opens into a yard, which is surrounded by a wall eight feet high; the thieves had broken a square of glass, put an arm through, and unfastened the window, got in there, and taken this property off a stool, and escaped out at the door. I missed two Cheshire cheeses and a half.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I was the last person up on the 13th of April - I fastened all the doors and windows, and left them so at about a quarter past twelve o'clock, when I went to bed. My husband got up first, and alarmed me; I found the wash-house door and window as he has stated, and missed two large Cheshire cheeses and a half, a Glo'ster cheese, half a side of bacon, 12lbs. of candles, and a blue apron. I keep a chandler's-shop. I had seen them all safe the night before, at a quarter to eleven - they were worth 6l. 18s. I have found none of them. I was cleaning the yard, as the thieves had left some filth there, and found a piece of a waistcoat. I sent for Pullen, and gave it to him in the state I found it - I found it in an hour after I came down stairs.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bethnal-green. - On Friday, the 14th of April, Mrs. Harris sent for me; I examined the windows and doors; she gave me a piece of a waistcoat, but being busy I desired her to give information of the robbery at Worship-street; I kept the piece of waistcoat till Parish, and officer, came to me. I saw the prisoner on the day after the robbery, coming by my shop; I had some beef on my shoulder, and could not put it down; I saw him go along with his coat off - he was endeavouring to put it on - the wind blew it aside, and I saw a piece torn out of his waistcoat, on the right side - I put down my beef and ran out, but he was gone. I knew him before.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. Pullen gave me this piece of a waistcoat. The prosecutor's wall is eight feet high. On the Monday after the robbery I met the prisoner in Shoreditch - I had seen him about that neighbourhood before, and knew him. I unbuttoned his coat, found his waistcoat torn, and matched the piece - it exactly fitted the tear in every way; it is a black cloth waistcoat - I produce it and the piece - I am certain it must be part of the same waistcoat. I took him in charge, and asked what he had done with the cheese; his answer was, "You are bouncing me;" meaning I wanted to find out what he had done with it. I then matched the waistcoat to the piece - he said, "I can satisfy the Magistrate how I tore that waistcoat - it has been torn some time;" part of it is torn in a point, and fits in the stitches and every thing.</p>

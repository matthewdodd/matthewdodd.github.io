On the 20th of October this happened, I came home about eight o'clock in the evening. I understood there had been three men in the shop, and they had taken goods away, and had not paid for them. I went after them, and found the prisoner in a baker's shop, and two of his comrades, as I supposed, were standing at the window. I saw the prisoner take a muffin out of the window and eat it, and then he was coming out without paying for it. I stopped him at the door, and asked him what he had got in his pocket, I found eight Bologna sausages, and three pieces of black pudding. I asked him how he came by them, he told me that he had bought them, and paid for them. I asked him to come home with me, and clear up that point. He refused. I then insisted that he should go, and took him about twenty yards, when two of his comrades come up. I then sent my brother for a constable, the prisoner knocked me down, and his companions struck me, and my hat was taken away. Whether he took my hat off, or it was on the ground, I cannot say. I ran home for another hat, and when I came back, I found the prisoner in Cottage lane. I conveyed him to the watch-house, the prisoner said a woman had got my hat.</p>

            . On the 20th of October, about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner knock Townshend down, the prisoner took his hat off his head, and run up Cottage-row; I ran after him, and took the hat from him. I am sure it was the prisoner, I know his person; I saw him flogged once for stealing a seaman's chest, and a bed. This is the hat.</p>

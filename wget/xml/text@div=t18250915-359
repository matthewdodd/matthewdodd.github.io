These boots are my property; they have my initials on them, but are not made by myself; I had missed three or four dozen pairs at different times previous to the detection of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not he in your employ? A. Yes; he lived twice with me - the first time for about five years; the last time he came to me in great distress, being out of work, and I said I would give him 10 s. a week, and the moment he could suit himself better he could leave. He is not a good workman - he was to go on errends; the second time he worked as a clicker - I give my other clickers 24 s. or 25 s, a week.</p>

In the evening of Christmas day, between nine and ten, I catched him taking the copper money; I heard the halfpence rattle; I was walking in and out of the bar; the money was in the bar, and the prisoner was in the bar; he had dined and drank tea with me that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards leave him alone in the bar - A. Yes; I heard the halfpence rattle while I was in the bar; I have a tame jack daw about the bar, I supposed it was him at first; I was in hopes that it was, but to convince myself I put him in the cage; after that I heard him rattle the halfpence; there was nobody else in the bar at that time; I made believe to go into the tap room, but I did not go, I opened the door and let it go so, then I looked over the bar: the basket containing five poundsworth of copper, which I had counted up that day for the purpose of payment, was behind him on the ground; I saw him stoop twice, and I heard the halfpence rattle at the same time; he was sitting in a chair close to the basket; I saw his hand in the basket; the third time he was stooping I went round and catched him; when I seized him he dropped the halfpence from his hand on the ground; I said good God, Scott, what are you about; he said he did not know, he seemed confused; he then said he had like to have fell down; I said you shall not sit there any longer, I moved the chair; he said I know you are wrong; I said I was sure I was right, and put the basket on the table and began to count the halfpence; he said you have no occasion to do that, you cannot tell; then I said I insist upon you giving me the money that you have taken out; he put his hands into the flap of his small clothes and pulled out two handfulls; I counted them, I found I was deficient; when I first counted the copper I was deficient in three shillings of my five pounds; I made him untie the knees of his breeches; he shook out sevenpence halfpenny, that made up the three shillings; I asked him how he came to do it; he said he was mad or the devil must be in him.</p>

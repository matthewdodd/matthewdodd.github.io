I am barmaid to Mr. Jayne, of the American Stores, Fenchurch-street—on the evening of 13th May, I saw the prisoner there, between 8 and 9 o'clock—I served her with a glass of porter—she gave me a bad shilling in payment—I told her it was bad, and she asked for it back again, and said she did not know it was bad—Mrs. Jayne, who was there, said, "We do not return bad money"—Mr. Jayne was then coming downstairs—directly the prisoner saw him she rushed out—Mr. Jayne left the house directly and followed her—I next saw her at the police-station—I gave the bad shilling to Mrs. Jayne, and she gave it to Mr. Jayne.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 519). I was on duty in Mark-lane, about half-past 8 on the evening of 13th May—I saw the prisoner there—my attention was drawn to her by Mr. Jayne, who told me she had been passing a bad shilling; he gave me the shilling, and I followed her—when I came to the end of Mark-lane I was about thirty yards from her; when she turned the comer I lost sight of her—I then went up Folks's-buildings, and saw her at No. 2, in the act of ringing a bell—I asked her if she lived there, she said "No"—I asked her who she wanted, and she said she wished to see a friend—I asked her who her friend was; she said he was a clerk, and that his name was Brown—I asked who his employer was, and she would not give me the information—I then held the shilling out in my hand, and asked her if she remembered passing that at the American Stores; that was the shilling Mr. Jayne had given me—she made no answer—I then took her to the station—she wished me to allow her to sit down on the seat—I told her she could sit down—the inspector at that time came in, and I told him what I have told the jury—I then went for the female searcher; when I returned the inspector showed me three more bad shillings, which he had found.</p>

            . I am a constable of the Borough. On the 17th of April I was looking for the prisoner for another robbery - I went into a house, and he got away from me; next morning I had information, and followed a girl into Fleet-market - I found him in the tap-room of the Angel public-house there; that was on the morning of the 18th, a little after ten o'clock; I told him I wanted him - he said, "Oh. do you Mr. Pett;" I said, "Yes, you must go with me," and I took him in custody - he had a bag there; I asked if it belonged to him - he said it did; I have had the bag ever since - the prosecutrix claimed the contents.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110088"></xptr>Prisoner. I sat there ten minutes - then you asked if the bundle on the table was mine; I said it was not, but it was in my possession, and I expected the young man in every moment. Witness. No, he did not say a young man had left it - he said it belonged to him.</p>
               <p>MRS. REED. I know all this property - here is a shirt, and I believe all the rest to be mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I came up to London in search of employment - I had not been in town more than two months; I had appointed to meet a young man at the Bolt-in-Tun, as he knew of a situation which he thought would suit me - while I was there a well-dressed person, in appearance a gentleman, came into the house, and asked if there was any one there willing to earn a 1s.; having nothing to do I gladly accepted the offer, and asked him what it might be - his answer was, "To carry this bundle for me;" the bundle now before you is the same one which the aforesaid person gave into my possession to carry - I put it on my shoulder, and went along with him until we reached the Angel public-house; opposite the door he stopped and said, "Young man, I wish you to stop here a few minutes - you can go into the tap-room and sit down - here is 2 1/2d, get a pint of porter; I have to call upon a friend, who is going to Tring with me, and shall not be more than ten minutes, and mind take great care of the bundle" - I went and sat down, and had been upwards of ten minutes there when the officer came in and said,"I want you;" I, not knowing what he wanted, and fearing that it was some trick to get the bundle from me, felt rather reluctant to go with him - he asked me if that was my bundle; I answered in the negative, but that a person, whom I described to him, had left them in my possession and in my care - we waited about ten minutes more, and the aforesaid person did not come; the officer then sent for a coach, and gave orders to the coachman to drive us to Union-hall - judge then my amazement in being taken before the Magistrate, and charged with having those things in my possession, and not being able to give an account of them; I never having been in trouble before, was so agitated that I could scarcely speak - however, I told the Magistrate the whole of the business; I declare solemnly, and in the presence of that Supreme God who created me, that I am innocent of the crime imputed to me.</p>

I was not drunk; my wife and Weaver were with me-there were twenty or thirty persons in the room. They took my beer away from me. I laid my head down - I got up. One of the men said he should like my neck-handkerchief-Fruin is the <rs id="t18170917-228-viclabel1160" type="occupation">landlord</rs> of the house. I was immediately seized, and the handkerchief taken off my neck. I said nothing to provoke them. Carrol untied my handkerchief. I never saw them before; nine, or ten of them struck me - I was thrown down on the table-Weaver has absconded. I had drank nothing but a drop of porter.</p>

            . I was with my husband; we had been to see Weaver's apprentice in a poor-house, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon. We went to two or three houses, and had a pint or two of beer. I believe the poorhouse was at Whitechapel. We had a pot or two of beer before we got there, we also went home and had a pot of beer. I do not remember whether we had any spirits, or not. We stopped at the first public-house two hours; my husband was not sober - I do not think Weaver was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know he was drunk - A. I believe he was. I wished him to go home, because he was drunk. I believe Weaver was also drunk-the prisoner, Longmour, sat by the side of Weaver. He struck me. I gave him in charge.</p>

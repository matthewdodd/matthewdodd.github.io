               <p>Q. Did he say from whence he had taken it. - A. Yes, he had taken it out of my shop. We went into the wheeler's shop, he had been knocking a waggon wheel to pieces, there was one streik that seemed to belong to that, I had a high opinion of the man, he had free access to the shop, and always kept the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any iron of that form missing. - A. There was, that one piece that was brought back with him I believe it is.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow Street office, I stopped the prisoner on the 23d of last month, between six and seven in the evening, just by Bagnigge Wells, he had the large pieces of iron on his shoulder, and these short pieces tucked in his waistcoat, I asked him what he had got there, he said, old iron, he and his wife went round the country buying old iron, I took him to the light, I said,</p>
               <p>"I think I know your face, you are a wheeler, I think you work at Battle Bridge," he denied it, I told him I would find it out, I knew all the wheelers thereabouts, and took him along to Battle Bridge, he owned that he worked for Mr. Smith, I took him to Mr. Smith, he there said he took it from Mr. Smith's shop, he went down upon his knees, and begged Mr. Smith would forgive him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

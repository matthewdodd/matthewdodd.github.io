I told him I had; he asked me who had them locked up? I told him the clerk of the market; he asked what right we had to lock up his property? I told him I could not deliver them without an order from the clerk of the market; he went to the clerk of the market, who came and ordered me to deliver them; I did, and saw no more of them: I said he had better let them stay till morning; he said if he did, he should lose the job another time: it is usual to pay a halfpenny a piece for them when they are locked up; he gave me a penny, he had no more, and the clerk of the market paid the other three halfpence; I knew the prisoner before by using the market.</p>

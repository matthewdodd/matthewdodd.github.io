               <p>A WATCHMAN sworn. - I was present when the boy charged the prisoner with picking the prosecutor's pocket; I saw the prisoner searched, and the handkerchief taken out of his pocket; there were two handkerchiefs found upon him; one of them the prosecutor said was his: I did not take much notice of the handkerchief. (The patrol produced the handkerchief, which was deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

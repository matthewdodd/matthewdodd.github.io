                  </hi>. I live with nay mother at 17, York-court, East-street, Marylebone, and help at a plasterer's. On 6th April, a little before 7 o'clock in the evening, I was standing at the corner of the court in East-street—the prisoner and two other boys were on the other side of the way, they were throwing stones at me—I went over to the prisoner, and asked what he was throwing stones at me for—he told me to go and b—r myself, and I slapped him in the cheek with my open hand once—I just tapped him again, it was a slight blow with my open hand—upon that he drew a knife out of his pocket, and stuck it in my shoulder—before he took it out I saw him with his hand in his pocket, and he appeared to open the knife in his pocket—I bled a good deal—the prisoner ran off when he had done it—Mr. Clark, the surgeon, afterwards saw me.</p>

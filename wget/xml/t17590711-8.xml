               <p>Q. What did you let her the lodgings for per week?</p>
               <p>Dickerson. I let her them at six-pence per week, because I took her to be an honest girl.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>Dickerson. I lost a bed, a bolster, a pillow, a sheet, a half-teaster curtain, and a window curtain; these I lost about five weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know who took them?</p>
               <p>Dickerson. She owned she took them, and said, he never was concerned; she told me also I should never have them again, and they were not out of the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get them again?</p>
               <p>Dickerson. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention all these things to her when you charged her?</p>
               <p>Dickerson. No, I mentioned nothing particular: she own'd she had taken the bed away, and said, I should never have it.</p>

            . I lodge in the prosecutrix's house, and have for pretty near five months: I have seen the prosecutrix take the key from her side and go into the prisoner Brown's room; this I have seen three or four times, when the prisoner has been gone out; and when she wanted to go into the room when she missed the things, she tried a key and said, she could not get in; I bid her try the key that hung on the other side of her; she did, and the key opened it; she had pretended to me she had looked through a hole in the wall and saw the things were gone; I desired her to show me the hole, but she could not.</p>

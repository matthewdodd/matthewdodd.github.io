The prisoners came there together at twelve o'clock at night, on the 4th of April; there were two others in company with them, and they called for four basins of soup - they sat in the box in which the prosecutor sat asleep; I noticed them - Allen came in with a straw hat on; he went out with a black one - I went to look at the prosecutor, who lodges with me, and his hat was gone from the table where it had been laying; I suspected the prisoners, and went after them - I saw an officer, and described the parties; he brought Allen back first, and then got Murphy - the prosecutor was still asleep.</p>

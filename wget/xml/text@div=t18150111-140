            . On the 2th of December, about twelve o'clock at night, I was going down Drury Lane to seek for a lodging; I <rs id="t18150111-140-viclabel802" type="occupation">work at groundwork</rs>

               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. Yes, the prisoner came up to me, she said, she would take me to her lodging in <placeName id="t18150111-140-crimeloc803">Charles-street, Durry-lane</placeName>

I laid down and went to sleep, my cloaths were on me except my coat, that I put under my head. I think she was drawing the coat from under my head that awoke me. I went to sleep again; I awoke about one in the morning, and found my coat and watch gone; and when I awoke again, the prisoner was gone, and the watch and the coat with it. This is the coat I have coat on, and the watch I have seen since at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MGLESWORTH. I am shopman to Mr. Turner, pawnbroker, Brydges-street. I produce a watch pawned by the prisoner, and a coat pawned by another person.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That watch is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor gave me his coat to pledge. I pledged it for ten shillings; he had four shillings out of it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She robbed me of my coat. I did not give it her.</p>

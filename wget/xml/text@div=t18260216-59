I heard the noise about five o'clock in the morning of the 3d of February, and gave the key of my yard to Franklin, and ran down to assist him in apprehending the prisoner; I then got my clothes on, and searched the premises; I missed thirteen pieces of tier iron, which were safe between three and four o'clock, the day before - my gate is always locked - I found part of the iron in Mr. Perkins' garden - some of it was in a sack - there was a fish cloth with it - the prisoner comes there to sell fish two or three times a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. What does it weigh? A. About three quarters of a hundred - a man could not have taken it all at once.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I went to Mr. Hone's yard, and found the prisoner behind a log of wood. I took him into custody, and got him outside the gate. Mr. Hone assisted me, and we put him into the cage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say how he came there? A. No; I did not search him - there was nothing near him - we found the iron in the garden about half-past five o'clock - I shewed the cloth to him but he did not own it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is this an enclosed yard? A. Yes; with palings - there is a gate to it, which was locked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Record and Writ Office in the Court of Chancery. I know the prisoner by sight—on 1st Feb., I received this paper from him at the Record and Writ office—it purports to be an affidavit in the suit of Drew and Drew—according to the practice of the office, if a person wants an office copy of an affidavit, he brings a copy of the affidavit, which is left with me for the purpose of being compared with the original, which is filed and left in our office—this was left for that purpose; and after it has been examined and found to be a correct copy, there is a mark put on it to certify that it is correct—it is done by a seal stamp—when a copy is brought in the way the prisoner brought this, there are fees payable; 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for every seventy-two words—these fourpences are received by adhesive stamps on the papers—these stamps are not always affixed when the affidavit is brought—sometimes they bring them without the stamps—they can get them in the office close by, but they must be affixed before the affidavit can be examined—here are eighteen stamps on this copy of the affidavit—it was in the same state when the prisoner gave it me, with these stamps on it—he brought it a short time before the office closed, between half past 3 and 4 o'clock—it was getting towards dark—immediately on receiving it I looked out the original, and gave both the original and the copy to our stationer in the office, Mr. Warwick, to compare them—on the following morning he brought it to me, and drew my attention to the stamps—I then noticed that two of them had got an impression of an obliterator on them—several of the others appear to have passed the obliterator, but I could not swear that it was my obliterator—we obliterate these stamps before we give the copy out—the two that I can recognise my obliterator on, are the fifth and the sixth—some of the others appear to have been obliterated, but I could not swear it was by my obliterator—some of them have not been obliterated at all—there are about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of good ones, and about 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of obliterated ones—I am certain they have been obliterated, but I cannot swear it was by my own instrument.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the clerks of the Record and Writ Offices in the Court of Chancery. On 2nd Feb. I received this paper from Mr. Wright—his own principal not being so early at the office as I was, he brought it to me—I examined it for him—there is no doubt that some of these stamps have been obliterated—there is an obliterator for each seat in the office—on one of these stamps I can trace the obliterator of Mr. Bedwell—I can see "A—D," which is Mr. Bedwell's division—there are four seats in the office—Mr. Bedwell's is from A to D—the suit of Drew and Drew would be in his division, and here is "A—D" remaining on one of the stamps—it has been stamped upside down—the "A—D" is at the bottom of the stamp, not at the top—I have no doubt that some others have been obliterated—I see an odd Y and an odd C on some of them—I have little doubt that all but five of them have been obliterated—I went to the Master of the Rolls, and took his directions upon it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

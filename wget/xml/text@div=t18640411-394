                  </hi>. I am the wife of the prosecutor, who is an attorney residing in Bloomsbury-square—on the evening of 24th March, between 9 and 10 I was leaving my dining room, and I saw the prisoner going up the stairs—I said nothing to him then—as soon as he saw me he returned and rent into the clerk's office—I then asked what he wanted—he said he came to see the servant—I called my husband, and he came into the hall—I then said, "This man says he has come to see the servant"—my husband told him to sit in the hall chair, and he did so; the servant was called up, and she said she did not know him—I asked him how he got into the house—he said he came in with the servant—I said, "That is not true, for I let her in myself"—I then observed that the clerk's room window had been pushed down to the farthest extent, and I said, "He is a thief; I shall send for a policeman," and I sent the cook for a policeman—when the servant came we called her Mary, because the last housemaid was Mary; her name is Amelia—when she came up, I said to her, "Do you know this man?"—she</p>

               <p>said, "No"—he then said, "Oh yes, you do: you know me very well"—she said, "I never saw you before"—he then said, "Oh, Mary, you will get me into trouble"—my husband then took up the conversation, and I said nothing more—I had not been in the clerk's room for some time before—when I saw the room last one window was open and one closed; the window near the street door was closed—about half an hour after the prisoner had been taken away, I went into a little ante-room on the ground floor where there is a bed—I saw impressions of feet on the bed—I found a lucifer match which had been lighted, and a workbox which had been on a high shelf had been removed—it was a valueless box; it had not been used for a year or two.</p>

I pass in my present situation in the name of Mary—I recollect this Thursday evening when I saw the prisoner—I had never spoken to him or seen him before—I gave him no invitation to come to Mr. Wright's house—I did not meet him in the public-house; there was not a creature there when I went in—it is not true that he came into the house with me.</p>

I examined the ground floor of my house after the prisoner was taken—it appeared to me that he got in at the window nearest the hall door; it is very near the hall door, you can reach it by standing on the scraper—I saw footmarks on the iron railings, on the window<lb></lb>sill, and on the window-frame—a man could step easily from the iron railings to the window, and could reach the sash easily.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to David Richardson, a hosier, of No. 3, Leadenhall-street. On 2nd Oct., between half past 3 and 4 o'clock, I was in the shop—the prisoner came in, and brought some canvass money bags for sale—there were no customers there—I told her I did not want anything of the kind, and told her to go about her business—she spread them out on a glass, which was on the counter; and when I had told her, two or three times, to go about her business, she took them up and went to the door; and then she came back again, and spread them on a box of gloves, on the top of the glass case—there were about eighteen or twenty pairs of gloves in the box—I told her that if she did not go I should send for a policeman—she scrambled them up in a violent hurry with both hands, and scrambled up a bundle of gloves out of the box, at the same time, and put them into her bag—the gloves were quite at the top of the box—I saw distinctly the lining of the gloves; and, on looking more closely, I saw the paper, with the makers' name, "Brown Brothers," on the paper—she went out of the shop—I followed her, brought her back, and took her bag away from her—she said she would give me in charge for taking her back—I asked her what she had got in her bag—she said she did not know she had got anything—I took the bag away from her, and put it at the end of the counter—my employer came in, and I asked him to look in the bag and see if there was any of his property there—he looked in, and there was the bundle of gloves—I sent for a policeman—the prisoner made two or three attempts to get out of the shop, and said she would give me in charge—a customer came in, I turned round to speak to him, and the prisoner seized me by the hair, and said she would throttle me—I do not think the prisoner could have taken the doves by accident, because she stopped so long, and would not go out of the shop—I do not think that she could have swept them into her basket in mistake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I did not take them intentionally; I swept the bags into my basket, and never saw the gloves. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You said, at the station, that I put them into your bag, and that you would give me in charge for taking your bag; I am quite positive of that—I distinctly saw you put them into your basket, or black leather bag—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—my employer is not here.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 571). I was called, took the prisoner into custody, and saw this bag—the prisoner was the worse for liquor—she was so bad that I was obliged to lead her to the station—I heard nothing said about Ellis putting them into her bag—such a thing may have been said—she said so many things going along, being the worse for liquor, that I did not observe what she did say.</p>

I went to No. 3, Leadenhall-street, to sell some bags; I asked him to buy some; he said he required none; I took them out of my basket, and laid them on the counter; it was between the lights: he said he wanted none, and I swept them into my basket; I saw no gloves, but they might have been on the counter and put in with the bags; I have been in the habit of selling cash bags for twenty-seven years, and never was imprisoned before; I can get the best of characters, and hope my age will be considered.</p>

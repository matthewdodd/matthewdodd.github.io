On the 18th of January when I came down in the morning, my children gave me information; I missed a silk umbrella from its place, and the prisoner was out; she came back without it - I told her the children had seen her take it out - she denied it - I sent for an officer, who took her.</p>

The prosecutor said his children had seen the prisoner take an umbrella out; she pointed to one which hung up, and said that was the one she took out, and had brought home again; The prosecutrix said that was there while she was out - I afterwards found this umbrella and two books at Bristow's.</p>

            . The prisoner brought me an umbrella to repair on the 18th; and said she would call for it at twelve o'clock, as she had taken her place to go to Paddington; she asked if she might leave a small parcel, which she did, and it contained two books - I gave them all to the officer.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, declaring that the articles were given her by Mrs. Perrington, instead of money, which she had agreed to allow her as chambermaid: but that the prosecutrix was frequently intoxicated and did not know what she was about; that the prosecutor had beaten his wife, and compelled her to deny giving them to her; it being done anknown to him, as they were constantly fighting.</p>

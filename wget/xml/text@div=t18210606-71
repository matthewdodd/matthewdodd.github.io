I am certain it was shut after eight o'clock, the candlesticks which remained, were in a confused state, and one was broken.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time did you go the coffee-shop - A. About nine o'clock. Cook sat in the front room, and the other on his right hand; only Bedwell came out of the back room.</p>

I assisted Upton in taking Brett, at No. 9, White Horse-court, White Horse-street On the following morning, I was taking him from the watch-house to the office, and on going up Holborn, we overtook Mrs. Epps, she asked if he would take a little porter, he said, Yes; we went into a public-house, and had a pot of porter, she said,</p>
               <p>"I am sorry for you, Brett," he said,</p>
               <p>"You are are you, I suppose so." I told him it was a pity he gave himself to keep bad company, he said it was too late now; I asked why - he said he supposed the others had said enough; I asked what he thought he should get for the candlestick, he said,</p>
               <p>"I do not know, I only wish we had taken them all;" that he was equally guilty with the rest, and what they suffered, he should wish to suffer likewise.</p>

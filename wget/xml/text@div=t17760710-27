               <p>What were the contents of a piece? - Generally about 70 yards, but one of them was a short piece; the six pieces contained 380 odd yards; there were seven yards of peagreen silk barred with silver; there was 20 lb. weight of silk died black; there was a draught upon my banker for 10 l.</p>
               <p>Who is your banker? - Boldero, Barnston, and Co. No 5, Mansionhouse-street; and there was 2 l. 15 s. in money, that is all that I can be certain of.</p>
               <p>How long before you missed them had you seen them in the house? - I left the house on Saturday, and left the foreman in the house; on the Saturday following I found the six pieces of silk in the possession of Mr. Worthy, Hanway-yard, Oxford-road; I have found nothing else but the draught: one of Sir John Fielding's men came to me on Saturday morning, and told me he had found the draught upon the prisoner Connor; the silk has been ever since in the care of Mr. Stellings; he is not here, but his head man is. (The draught produced by Heley;) that is my draught. - (The pieces of silk produced); I believe them to be my property; I was out of town at the time of the robbery; one or two I cannot swear so positively to as my man can; these answer to what I lost as near as can be; I believe them to be mine; they measure the same as what I lost.</p>
               <p>Did you look where your house had been broke? - Yes; they had broke through the yard into a lobby where the work-people are served; they cut a hole through the door, and then broke through another door into the warehouse; they cut two holes through each door; I believe one was large enough to get their arm through; they were cut over where the bolts were.</p>

               <p>Had you fastened up the lobby where they broke in? - I fastened that up at seven o'clock; the maid was up before me in the morning; she called me at seven; I was the first that discovered the breaking of the place; as soon as I came to the warehouse door, I found that the lock had been forced off.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that was whole and locked over night? - I am very positive of it: I entered the warehouse, and saw the things all in confusion; I went to the door that leads into the lobby; there were two holes cut in it; it had two bolts and a lock; there was a hole cut over the lock that commands that; I then went to the outer door that leads into the yard, and saw that cut in like manner.</p>

               <p>Did he say where he bought them? - No.</p>
               <p>Or in what manner? - No; he said he bought them of them, and produced a bill of parcels of them before I paid him for them. [The bill of parcels produced]</p>
               <p>Do you know Still and Baker's hand-writing? - No.</p>
               <p>That you had from Edrian? - Yes; I understood him that he was to give but 3 s. 6 d. a yard; the bill of parcels is 4 s. 6 d. it was a mistake, because I had not the bill of parcels then; my brother had it; he was to pay the money.</p>
               <p>The bill of parcels was not delivered till the money was paid? - Yes; we had it before; but I did not see till Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>These are the goods? - Yes; these are the goods I bought of Mr. Edrian, and offered to Mr. Elam; they were loose, because I had just measured them; they came to me folded, not upon rolls: I have dealt with him for silks before; I had no suspicion of him.</p>
               <p>What are the silks worth to a wholesale dealer? - I think, to pay ready money, they are worth 5 s. 6 d. a yard.</p>
               <p>You don't know Major Baker and Still? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you not surprized to think of his buying these silks at 3 s. 6 d. a yard? - I thought it a low price; but knowing him so long, I had no suspicion that they were stole.</p>

               <p>I act as clerk to justice Clark, who is a magistrate for this county; I wrote this bill of parcels, all but the last name, Major Baker.</p>

               <p>And the receipt too? - Yes, all of it: I live at No 7, Holywell-row, Moorfields: on Saturday the 29th of June, as I lay in bed, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, somebody threw up at my window; I got out of bed, and there I saw Corbet; I know no such person of the name of Still; he asked me if I was about to get up; I said I was; he said he was going to the public-house at the bottom of the Row, and asked me to come to him; I said I would: I have known him four years; he is a weaver, I believe in the narrow branch; I got up and went to the public-house to him; at the public-house there was another man, who said I was the person he wanted to see, he wanted me to bind a boy apprentice to him; I went in, and Corbet was sitting in a box, with a strip of paper, and asked me to do a jobb for him; I said I would, what was it? he said a friend of his had sold a parcel of goods, and they wanted a bill of parcels with them, and they could neither of them write; he said it was five pieces of mantua at 4 s. 6 d. and I carried it on to 22 s. 6 d. he said that was wrong, it contained 380 odd yards, at 4 s. 6 d. a yard, with that I tore that off.</p>
               <p>How was you to indite the bill? - He said Edrian bought of Still, word for word as it is there; he said it was not his property, but he lent a person part of the money to pay for it.</p>
               <p>Did you cast up the contents, or did he cast it up? - I was in a hurry, and cast it up myself.</p>
               <p>You wrote all but Major Baker? - Yes, by his directions.</p>
               <p>How came you not to write Major Baker, as well as Still, as he told you neither of them could write? - I was not directed to put Baker's name.</p>
               <p>Did you understand there were two sellers or one seller? - One seller; I understood that neither buyer nor seller could write.</p>
               <p>That is Corbet? - Yes.</p>
               <p>WORTHY. That is the man that answered to the name of Still.</p>

I live at Sutton, in the parish of Heston, where I am groom to Mr. Jones—on 21st January, about 5.30 p.m., he was away from home, and I went out and locked up the house—I returned about 6.30, and found the dining-room window, on the ground-floor, broken, and I missed from that room three coats, a pair of trousers, a gold-plated Albert chain, and a burnisher (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these are them—three shirts are still missing—I then went to Quinlan's, the pawnbroker's, at Hounslow, and there found the prisoner Pusey pawning two coats and a pair of trousers, and he had an overcoat on—I have known him two months; he slept in that room on the Saturday before this—I gave him in custody—I do not know Hope.</p>

I am a labourer, of Heston—on 2nd January, about 5.30 p.m., I saw Hope walking backwards and forwards, and while I was having some beer at the Old George he came in—I looked him in the face; he is the man—I then heard Pusey in the house; I knew him by his voice—Hope got a light for his pipe and joined Pusey, and they both went away together—Pusey was courting a young woman there—that house is a quarter of a mile from Mr. Jones's.</p>

I keep the Rifleman beerhouse, Hounslow—on 2nd January, about 7.15 p.m., Hope came in with a coat on his arm—a friend of mine at the bar said "Have you been travelling?"—he said "Yes, worse luck"—ten minutes afterwards a constable came in with Pusey, who picked up the coat lying beside Hope and put it on—this is it.</p>

I am a pawnbroker, of Hounslow—on the evening of 2nd January, Pusey came and produced two coats and a pair of trousers, and said that his name was Liddell, and he lived at Heston, and that the trousers were made for him expressly, at Pennington the tailor's, for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said "They were never made for you, they are gen<lb></lb>tleman's riding trousers"—I detained him and went to the door to look for a policeman, and met the prosecutor and another man, and Pusey was taken in custody—he still persisted that the goods were his own, but afterwards he said that a man gave them to him at the Rifleman beerhouse—two constables brought Hope there, and I asked him whether he gave Pusey the goods—he said that he had never seen them.</p>

I was in Mr. Wright's public-house, and Pusey, who was under the influence of drink, woke up, and asked me to shake hands, which I did, and then he asked me to mind his old coat till he came back. The policeman came in with Pusey and said "Did this man give you the clothes?" He said "Yes." I said "It is false." He picked up the coat which belonged to him and put it on—I am innocent.</p>

I said "You have to get your living and I will get mine." After that I was going home and saw him <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> a bundle down. I picked it up. He took his own coat off and put a brown one on and asked me to take the other to the pawn-shop and he would give me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

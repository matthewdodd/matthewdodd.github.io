On the 6th of July last the prisoner came to my premises—I had never seen him before that I recollect—I was in the gallery when he came in—my son Alfred was at work in the gallery, which is at the end of the shop, at the back—it is a place where people practise pistol and rifle-shooting—it was between twelve and one o'clock when the prisoner came in—he spoke to me first—he asked me if he could be accommodated with a brace of duelling pistols—I said, "Yes, sir, you can"—I gave him them, and took him to the pistol length of practice, which is fifteen yards, where gentlemen generally stand, when they fire at the figure which I keep—I loaded both the pistols—I handed him one—it was regu<lb></lb>larly loaded with ball—he fired that off; and said, "This pistol pulls of too hard, I should like one to go easier "—I told him I would in the next set the air-trigger, and that would go easier for him—I did so—the second pistol was loaded the same as the first—he fired that, and complained of that going too easy—he was a very good shot—he marked the figure every time—he said, "I will not have the air-trigger set now, let me have it as I had the first"—I loaded him a third, and after that he came back to the loading-place, and said, "I will stand the long distance now"—that was about thirty yards in length—the third was loaded in like manner—he hit the mark then—our longest distance is fifty yards—the third pistol he fired off at thirty yards—after he fired the third I gave him a fourth—that was loaded exactly the same—I did it myself—I then proceeded to load another, which would be the fifth—he was about two yards from me when I gave him the fourth, and my back was towards him—I had the other pistol, and was beginning to load it, and his pistol went off and shot me—it pushed me against the bench—I leant over and seized the rail, and said, "Good God, I am shot!"—my son said, "That gentleman has shot you"—my son was at the end of the loading-place—I fell forward towards the wall—I was not sufficiently sensible to speak a word—I heard the report of the pistol—there was no person in the gallery at the time but the prisoner and my son—a medical man was sent for, and I was afterwards taken to the hospital—I remained there nine weeks before I went before the Magistrate, and I was taken ill again, and obliged to go for a fort<lb></lb>night or three weeks—I am labouring now under very severe pain—the ball was extracted five weeks after I was in the hospital—they made several at<lb></lb>tempts before they could venture to get it.</p>

On Saturday, the 6th of July, the prosecutor was admitted into the hospital as an in-door patient—I examined the wound—it was just on the right of the spine, and immediately above the loin—I probed it, and found a resisting body, but it was impossible at the time to say whether it was bone or the bullet—from time to time I endeavoured to find what the hard substance was; and ultimately I found it, on the 16th of Aug.—I first ex<lb></lb>tracted a small piece of bone, and then a bullet, which I produce; a piece of cloth with a seam in it also came away—it appeared like the cloth of a coat—the prosecutor remained under my care a considerable time—he went out on the 24th of Aug., and was re-admitted—he is now labouring severely under the effect of the wound—at first we considered the wound dangerous, and even now, with portions of the bone coming away, we do not consider him out of ultimate danger—he is out of immediate danger—he is not very likely to be fit for active business again.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner is my brother. He will be twenty-three years of age next Nov.—he is the third and youngest son of the late Lord Audley, who died on the 14th of January, 1837—shortly before his death a very protracted litigation commenced respecting his property, which has gone on ever since—it has practically been adverse to our family, and has left us in very embarrassed circumstances in point of pecuniary mat<lb></lb>ters—I consider that the prisoner has from his youth been very sensitive and reserved generally—I remember the loss of an associate of his, of the name of Weston—he was about sixteen then—Weston died at sea; his death seemed to make a very great impression on the mind of my brother, I think stronger than on persons generally under such circumstances—he was not educated for any profession—he became from time to time acquainted with the embarrassed situation of the family—those circumstances seemed to make a very great im<lb></lb>pression on his mind, and I think it depressed his mind to notice things which persons generally would not—we were not a very great deal together during the year 1842—we saw each other oftener than we had done some time pre<lb></lb>vious—I was in Ireland in the latter end of 1842—I had gone over in March, 1842, and, I believe, a third time—I was a good deal backwards and forwards—he was in Ireland at that time, and I saw him frequently, particularly to<lb></lb>wards the latter part of the year we were more together—he left Ireland, to come to London, in Jan., 1843, leaving me in Ireland—I did not see him during the whole of the year 1843, after he left in Jan.—I did not see him till last April, when I came over to England; and from that time down to this</p>

               <p>unfortunate occurrence we were living together constantly in the same apart<lb></lb>ments—as he became acquainted with the circumstances of difficulty in the family, he made them the subject of observation to me, and I thought he took a very depressed view of things; he showed great depression of spirits, more so than perhaps I felt myself; and I attribute this view entirely to the circumstances in which we were placed acting on his pecu<lb></lb>liar temperament—I have sat with him in the same room for many hours together—on those occasions he was very reserved; occasionally he would be not so much so, but rather cheerful—generally speaking he was very reserved—during the time I have been living with him, from April down to last July, he has very seldom spoken to me—when we have been sitting together in the same room, he has been doing nothing but sitting in a pensive manner—when I addressed him he very seldom did more than answer, "Yes" or "No," and sometimes he would not answer me at all—he generally seemed to avoid conversation—when he sat in this way without speaking I have ob<lb></lb>served that the expression of his countenance would sometimes alter, but generally it was a very settled expression of countenance—I remarked his countenance particularly, because I did not consider at that time that his bodily health was good—generally speaking, when he was sitting in this pen<lb></lb>sive way, his look was downcast—sometimes he had, I thought, a very fixed, severe expression, very great austerity of countenance, and sometimes rather the reverse—these changes were not produced by conversation but by what was passing in his own mind—his eyes were very suffused at times, he had a very dreamy expression of countenance, very melancholy and dejected—he was very sensitive of public observation, and complained that he was constantly the subject of observation—the house we lived in was in a street with houses fac<lb></lb>ing us—he said he thought the people in the houses opposite watched him, or us rather—I remember on one particular occasion his stating that they were then watching us—I did not consider that that was the fact—I was near the window at the time, but not before the window—I was between two windows—I think I was rather nearer the window than he was, and on his mentioning that there were people watching, I looked, and saw no one—I think the neighbours might have watched, just as neighbours will do, but I do not think we were the subject of any particular observation—I do not consider we were watched by them—he was not in the habit of dining at an eating-house while he was with me—we generally dined at home, except on Sunday—lie did not dine at any one particular place when he dined out—he was in the habit of frequenting certain places—mostly two, I believe—he said he was known by the people there, that they made observations respecting him—that struck me as very improbable at the time, and I went afterwards to take means to satisfy my<lb></lb>self of the fact—I found no foundation for it—they did not know him—he did not show any disinclination to go out into the public streets, but he had a great disinclination to be observed in the neighbourhood—the first thing that struck me when he walked in the streets was the heedless manner in which lie walked along—his head was generally raised—he appeared to be looking up and not heeding the passers-by—he seemed to feel his way by my shoulder, so much so that it was rather a subject of annoyance to me—he did not make way for people he met in the street—he walked with his face, generally speaking, upwards—although he walked generally wherever I chose to take him, he would show hesitation to go in particular directions—he would yield to me, but would rather that I would not go that way—he gave no reason for that except that he evidently did not like to go that way—I think it was in the direction of High-street that he disliked—when we used to take a walk we generally walked in the Park, or Regent-street, and sometimes I would go to Hyde-park—the nearest way was by High-street,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184410210019"></xptr>
               <p>Marylebone—he appeared always to evince a disinclination to go by that particular way—I know no reason for that except that it was a more public direction, and he was very sensitive of observation by anybody—he did not wish that I should stop for a moment to look at anything, and objected pass<lb></lb>ing any shops—he was very restless, indeed, very impatient if I stopped to look into any shops—he would not look in himself, he would stand with his face down on the pavement, evidently wishing I should leave as soon as pos<lb></lb>sible—I thought he did not like anybody to come into the room suddenly—he did not appear to wish any one—he was very reserved—I could not exactly understand what his feeling was, but he did not like anything to disturb him—my mother was a daughter of Sir Ross Donelly—Sir Ross Donelly became insane before his death—I know the fact of my own knowledge—it did not occur so long ago—I am aware that there were proceedings taken by Admiral Sir Ross Donelly's family, and the result of the commission of lunacy which was issued was, that he was not of sound mind—he was a very old man—my brother often alluded to this circumstance when he was speaking to me in these times of depression—he alluded to it during the time that I was so much in England, 1841 and 1842—he was left very much alone, in 1841 particularly, and I have no doubt that at that time, from the observations he made to me, when I saw him after a long interval, his mind then first began to suffer, and in order to divert his attention from his affairs he said he used to walk about Dublin, and at those times he very often went into Mr. Sharp's literary rooms, there looking over books, and I have every reason to believe, from what he stated, he found matters there which fixed his attention and caused him to make them matters of reflection—he said he was very much annoyed indeed in taking up an old publication to see some allusion to an ancestor of his, a member of his family, and he expressed himself to the effect that he con-sidered he had unfortunate blood in his veins, and that there was unfortunate blood in the family—he spoke it generally—my impression is that he com<lb></lb>municated to me to the effect that he felt it himself—he said he considered there was unfortunate blood in the family, and that he sometimes felt it himself—he has several times complained of pains in the head, a long time back—he first complained of head-ache on the last occasion of my coming over to Eng<lb></lb>land—observing that his health appeared to be not good, I questioned him on the subject, and he stated to me that it was not very good—I said I hoped his last visit to England and seeing his family would have improved his health—he replied that was not the case, for nearly the last year, in fact ever since he came over, he was getting worse, particularly for the last four months—he said he had a constant noise in his head—he has occasionally complained of giddiness—he said that he passed many sleepless nights, and complained very much of his head, and of agony of mind at night—he said he could not turn his attention to anything apart from the subject of our affairs—I advised him to consult a physician—seeing that this feeling was increasing latterly, I spoke to him rather strongly—he seemed indifferent about it—he said to me one day, with I thought a peculiar air, that these things might go on sometimes too long—since this unfortunate event I have looked into a box of his which was at the same lodging where we lived together—it was locked up—I found in it a tin letter-box, and on opening that I found a bottle containing a few drops of laudanum, also a bottle nearly full of acetate of morphia, and a small paper containing a few grains, marked "A few grains of acetate of morphia "—it was not very long before this event that I spoke to him on the subject of con<lb></lb>sulting sulting a physician—I do not think he did consult any physician, but I pre<lb></lb>vaded on him to have a little prescription made up, which I furnished him with—from what he stated I believe he did have it made up, and took</p>

               <p>some of it—it appeared to me that his health was declining down to the day on which this occurred—I saw him on the morning this happened—he left home between eleven and twelve o'clock—he did not tell me for what purpose he was going out—I thought he might be going to my agents—I consider that he was formerly neat in his dress, and cleanly in his person—I have noticed an alteration in that respect latterly—he became indifferent—sometimes he did not shave, and allowed his hair to grow.</p>

               <p>seemed to avoid conversing with me very much—he appeared to me to be in a very melancholy state at this time—I have frequently endeavoured to rouse him, and speak to him, and offer him kindnesses from time to time, which he has avoided latterly—I knew he was the member of a noble family, and felt for him; and when I have made little advances to relieve him from what I thought were the appearances he presented, he has avoided those advances, and seemed to decline to converse with me—he was a very good deal at home—he endeavoured to avoid public observation—I took most notice of this me<lb></lb>lancholy and wretchedness about him from about last November—I recollect his going out on the morning of the 6th of July—I saw him pass the shop window—I did not see him come down stairs—I was not aware of any object he had in going out then—I did not see him afterwards till he was in cus<lb></lb>tody.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I reside in Harley-street. I was called on by Lord Audley, on the 8th of July last, two days after this occurred, and visited the prisoner in Clerkenwell prison on that day—I saw him ten or twelve times in the course of July, and I have seen him since occasionally, in Newgate—I saw him yesterday—Dr. Warburton accompanied me, I think, on about five occasions, about three to Clerkenwell, and two latterly, to Newgate—I have had considerable experience in the treatment of persons of unsound mind—it has been my constant profession for more than thirty years—when I first saw the prisoner I was aware that he was the grandson of Sir Ross Donelly—I had attended Sir Ross Donelly for several weeks at his house in Harley-street, and gave evidence at the commission of lunacy which took place shortly after that, about five years ago—at that time Sir Ross Donelly was certainly in an unsound state of mind, not merely the result of old age and imbecility, but labouring under delusions—he was found of unsound mind by the Jury—I have every reason to believe that he remained so to his death—his affairs were in Chancery ever afterwards—I have heard the evi<lb></lb>dence of Lord Audley, Mrs. Lawledge, and her son, to-day, and have had submitted to me an account of the prisoner for some time past—I have made minute inquiry as to his whole history to enable me the better to ascertain the state of his mind on examining him—I first saw him on the 8th of July, at Clerkenwell—I was with him I think nearly an hour on that occasion—I–saw</p>

               <p>him in a small cell on the first occasion, and so I did on the second oc<lb></lb>casion, and I have seen him in the infirmary, and sometimes in the court-yard of the infirmary—from my examination of him on the 8th of July, I had no doubt in my own mind that he was of unsound mind—he told me that his sole object in this transaction was to get hanged, that he had no knowledge of Mr. Smith, and did not even know his name—he also told me that he had been brooding over suicide for years, that he had purchased laudanum at Savory and Moore's, in Regent—street, that he had purchased morphia at Dinneford's, in Bond-street, that he had taken on one occasion, about a week before this transaction occurred, about an ounce of laudanum, without any fatal effect; and he had also taken some small quantity of the morphia—he told me that he had no occupation, no friends, no companions, that he had been brooding over melancholy subjects for years, not only on his own family affairs, but every event that happened of a horrible description, occupied his attention, and worried his mind constantly; that he cut out of the papers all the dreadful events that occurred, particularly one that happened at Brighton, where a policeman was killed, I think, and that this event ran in his head for weeks, and it struck him if he were to do the same, he should attain his ob<lb></lb>ject, which was to get hanged—he told me that he was watched, not only by his own landlord, in Weymouth-street, but by the neighbours; and that the clock in the house kept saying to him all night, for several nights before this occurred, "Don't attempt it, don't attempt it!"—he told me also, on one occasion, especially, that he had the strongest inclination to repeat this thing, and that if he had a pistol at the moment he certainly should shoot anybody that was near him; that he could not trust himself—he told me that he had sought comfort in religion, but he had found none, that he had studied me<lb></lb>taphysics; that he could find comfort nowhere, that he had been driven to desperation; and in fact, not only in my judgment, to desperation, but to distinct mental derangement—I have not the slightest doubt that his conduct was genuine; his whole history gives the lie to any idea of simulation—he is in a state of downright melancholia, and not to be trusted for five minutes—if he were at liberty to-day, I should expect the same thing to occur—he is enveloped by strong feelings, which he is not able to resist—on one occasion, in Newgate, about a month since, when I saw him in the dining-room of the Governor, he was so extremely bewildered that he could not answer the com<lb></lb>monest question—if I asked him where he slept, what sort of bed he had, or what he had for dinner, he said he did not know what I meant—I saw him alone in that room—he was sent for from his cell to see me—he was in ex<lb></lb>treme confusion of mind—he seemed to be much worse on that occasion than I had ever seen him—I think he had that peculiar expression of eye which denoted that his head was affected by physical pain—melancholia is some-times times attended by delusion, and sometimes not—I do not think that this re<lb></lb>presentation presentation about the clock saying, "Don't attempt it," was a pure substan<lb></lb>tial delusion—I think that his extreme melancholy induced him to suppose that the clock said that—it proved that he had been brooding over some ter<lb></lb>rible affair—I believe that he perfectly understands what is going on now—I have no doubt of it, but he is in a state of apathy—lie has no compunction—he has repeatedly stated that he was without any feeling, that he felt quite indifferent, he could not understand how it all was, and he hoped the time might come when he should feel as he ought; but he had no compunction, and no feeling—he appeared to be very indifferent about the consequences—madness is notoriously hereditary—there are intervals in which there may be soundness in one member of a family direct from another member who has been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184410210023"></xptr>
               <p>unsound, and the subsequent member may be as unsound as the first—that is not at all unusually the case—it is quite in the common order of things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the state of mind in which you found Sir Ross Donelly be one of the circumstances which you would take into your consideration in arriving at a conclusion as to the state of the prisoner's mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By no means ne<lb></lb>cessarily so—I should have come to the same conclusion had I never known Sir Ross Donelly, because the points are so strong—they tend to throw some light on the matter, but the other circumstances are ample without it—if I had heard of such an act as this, committed without any motive, the fact of an ancestor having been deranged, would assist me in coming to a conclusion as to the state of the man's mind—I should have thought it an important cir<lb></lb>cumstance, but in this case I thought there was sufficient without.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHARNOCK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe Sir Ross Donelly was very aged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was, I believe, seventy-five—I had known him about a year before his death—I believe he had been labouring under this complaint only a few weeks before I saw him—he was a very hale old man—he had been an admiral, and was a strong hearty man—he was not bowed down by bodily infirmity—he was not of feeble body, but of feeble mind—as far as I remember he died of dropsy—I cannot say whether the complaint under which he laboured was hereditary—I had never seen the prisoner till the 8th of July.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. WARBURTON</hi>. I have been practising as a physician for about twenty years—during that period I have directed my attention chiefly to diseases of the mind—at the time of the last Sessions I was exceedingly ill, and confined to my bed at Bath—I have visited the prisoner six times altogether in com<lb></lb>pany with Dr. Monro since this unhappy transaction—I have been in Court, and heard the statement of the circumstances attending the prisoner's life, and the manner in which this act was committed—my opinion is that he is most decidedly of unsound mind at this time—I believe him to have been so at the time this transaction occurred—I have made notes, which I have got with me, but I came to the conclusion from the extraordinary solitary mode of life which the unfortunate gentleman had been leading, from the strong marks of melancholy and great depression which had existed all the way through, from the attempt which he made on his own life, and from his having told me that he bought double the quantity of laudanum which he had taken, that he only took one half of it, because he had heard or read in medical books that if he took an over dose, it might not produce death, but would cause vomiting; he was, therefore, anxious to destroy himself by only taking part of the dose—he also told me he had bought morphia, both solid and liquid, for the same purpose, and from the act being committed apparently without any motive whatever, and from his telling me that he did not even know Mr. Smith's name when he went to the shooting-gallery—my opinion is that he committed the act when he had lost all self-control, and did not possess anything like moral liberty.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

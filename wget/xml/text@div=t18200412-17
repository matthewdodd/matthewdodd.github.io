On being struck I attempted to secure the person whom I supposed to have struck me. I was about to turn round, but before I had done so a person rushed out of Exeter-street on me. The two together surrounded me a moment, and I felt my watch taken away - one of the party ran away. I turned round, seized the prisoner instantly, and am certain he is the person; he exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"A dog has bit my thigh." I then dragged him into a public-house at the corner of the street, and desired the landlord to send for an officer, which he did, but with some reluctance. In the room I took the prisoner to there were a number of men assembled; as soon as I took him in, one of them asked me why I took a gentleman by the collar? he said he belonged to Bow-street. They got the prisoner away from me, and took him to the back of the room. The officer then arrived, and I pointed him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were many people in the street when you was robbed - A. No, only the two persons. I have not recovered my watch. As we were taking him to the watch-house a fellow came up, and tried to rescue him; he then attempted to escape himself, but did not. I felt the watch go from me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I take your watch - A. I cannot say, but I swear you struck me.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody, and searched him, but found nothing on him. I was taking him to the watch-house, and he endeavoured to disengage himself from his coat - he then whistled and one or two people came to his assistance. I sprang my rattle, and got the watchman to assist me in taking him to the watch-house. The men went away without attempting anything.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The person I lodge with was at work at the fire in Suffolk-street, and his wife sent me to see for him. A man came behind, and shoved me against the gentleman, a third came out of Exeter-street, and ran across the road. I had been bit by a dog about a week before, and I had hurt my thigh. The gentleman asked me what was the matter? I said I had hurt my thigh.</p>

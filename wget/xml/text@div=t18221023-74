            ; there is a great number of bonnets in the parlour; there is a railing before the window, but the gate is not kept locked. I had been working in the parlour a quarter of an hour before this happened, and am certain I left the sash entirely closed; nobody went there after me. About half-past seven o'clock, I returned into the parlour without hearing any alarm, and found the window quite up, and one Leghorn and three straw bonnets gone, they cost me 3 l. 6 s. 6 d. Nobody was there; the prisoner is a stranger. On Monday evening, the officer brought two of them to me; and on Wednesday I saw the prisoner at Worship-street. I am sure they are two of the bonnets stolen from our room.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Luke's. On Saturday evening, the 19th of October, about eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming along Golden-lane about a mile and a half from Mr. Shaw's house; he turned from me; I went over, took him, and asked what he had got - he said,</p>
               <p>"Two bonnets." I found it was so - he had them in a handkerchief. I asked how he came by them; he said he brought them from his sister's. A mob collected. I sent him to the watch-house, and there he said he brought them from a man named Roberts, of New Compton-street, St. Giles's, and was going to take them to his sister's to sell, who kept a bonnet shop in play-house yard, Golden-lane. Compton-street is near an hour's walk from Golden-lane. I asked if his sister knew he was gone for the bonnets - he said she did, and she had sent him for them. I found his sister where he said. I made enquiry, and Mr. and Mrs. Shaw claimed the bonnets - they described them before they saw them.</p>

            . I live at No. 8, North alley, Cumberland-street. On Thursday night the 24th of August, I was going home through the <placeName id="t18090920-32-crimeloc180">Strand</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18090920-32-crimeloc180" type="placeName" value="Strand"></interp>

I pushed her away, she begged my pardon, and said she did not mean to put it into my pocket, she meant to put it into my breeches; I found my watch was safe, I said, go along, are you not ashamed, if you want any thing go to a proper place; I had then got my watch and money, she then drew me by main force from the Strand down Beaufort buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. Yes, as I am at this minute.</p>
               <p>Q. How far down the buildings did she draw you. - A. About fifteen yards, I then pushed her away, and found I missed the watch, I took her to the watchhouse there she was searched, I could not find the watch upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body passed you - A. Yes, two men one went between her and the houses, and one behind me, there was none nigh me but her by three feet, the moment that man passed I said, watchman, this woman has robbed me, that man run away, he was a soldier, the other man was in the middle of the street, the soldier was nighest.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long were you with her from first to last. - A. Put it all together, I do not suppose it was five minutes; neither of the men was near enough to take the watch, they passed me twice, once in the Strand, and once in Beaufort buildings, when I missed the watch, the soldier ran away; I told the watchmen the soldier must be the man that had got the watch, he said, hold her hands.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel, called one witness who gave her a good character.</p>

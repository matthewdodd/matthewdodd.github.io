               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. A grocer the prosecutrix was not drunk; she was collected; she was crying - she said she had taken some bread and cheese, and a glass of rum and shrub, which had made her ill when she got into the air - she said she had been with the Honourable Mrs. Lee's servants, at St. James'- she walked very well</p>

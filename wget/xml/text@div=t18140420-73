            . I am an officer of Bow-street office. On Thursday the 17th of March, I went to No. 41, Horn-alley, Little Greenwich, Aldersgate-street. I went there about the middle of the day; I found the prisoner there. I knew it was her house from the information I received; I went there, accompanied by Mr. Fish, one of the inspectors of the Bank of England. I searched the room below stairs, and two rooms up stairs. After I had searched the three rooms and the prisoner, I searched over the stair-case between the uprights, between the lath and plaister; there I found a parcel in a brown paper. The prisoner was with me at that time. That parcel contained bank notes. I said to the prisoner, what is this; she denied knowing anything of it whatever. She said she had lodgers in her house, and probably they might have put it there; and she had had different workmen in the house. I then took her below stairs to Mr. Fish, and shewed him the notes. Mr. Fish said they were forged notes in her presence. She denied knowing anything of them, and mentioned respecting her lodgers, and that she had a workman to fix up a grate. Mr. Fish enquired of her when her lodgers went away; she said they went away in the middle of November. The parcel was quite clean, and had not the appearance of having been there a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house did you find these things - A. In the staircase, in a hole in the lath and plaister, between the uprights. These are the notes I found in the parcel; ten one-pound notes, and five two-pound notes.</p>

            . I am one of the clerks at Bow-street office. I took the examination of the prisoner by the magistrate's direction; she then said her lodger was a man, his wife, and child, whom she understood was a butcher, came to lodge with her in October, and staid with her five or six weeks; the butcher then went away; she has had no lodgers ever since; the house has had workmen in it ever since.</p>
               <p>ROBERT FISH. I am an inspector of bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Take these bank notes in your hand, the ten one-pound and five two-pound notes, are all of them forged - A. Yes, they are. The one's are all off the same plate, and the two's are of the same manufactory. The signatures to the one's and the two's are the same hand-writing; the three stated in the indictment are dated 15th of December, 1813.</p>
               <p>Q. So that all the one's are dated in the month of December - A. They are. They would not have found their way in circulation in October or November.</p>

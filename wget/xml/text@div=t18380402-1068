                  <hi rend="italic">JAMES FOGG</hi>. I am a Thames police surveyor. Last Wednesday I went a house in Fusham-hard, Wapping, and found the prisoner Coulton in a front room there—I laid hold of him, and said he must go with me—he knew me—he said, "What for?"—I said, "For stealing some spelter from the St. Katharine's Dock"—he said he knew nothing about it, and had nothing to do with it—I then told him he was at Mr. Foster's, with Herbet, selling it—he said, yes, he was—that he knew Herbert, and that Herbert had met him one day, and asked him to carry a parcel to clerkenwell with him and he would give him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that he went into Com<lb></lb>mercial road for him, and brought a parcel to him which he took to St. Paul's Churchyard—he said he had given him the heaviest—he said he had known Herbert for some years, that they were schoolfellows together he said they had been offering him money to go out of the way, and had they given him money he should have done so, out he had no money, and could not go, and that I might have found him there Wore—I found him at a marine store-dealer's—I had followed him there—he and the marine store-dealer were in conversation when I went in—the marine store-dealer was at Hatton-garden when the prisoners were both charged with this at first, but no owner being found then they were discharged—I knew Coulton before—he lived close to the London Docks.</p>

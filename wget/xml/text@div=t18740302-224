                  </hi>. I live at 55, Bird Street, West Square, Lambeth, and am a cellarman—on Saturday afternoon, 14th February, I was in York Road, Lambeth, and saw the prisoner coming out of the Sun public-house, followed by the prosecutor and a black man, who had the prosecutor's coat in his hand, and was irritating him to attack the prisoner, and a man with the prisoner put his left hand up and said "Go away, we don't want any <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with you"—that was his uncle—the prosecutor <hi rend="italic">squared</hi> up to the prisoner, who stood with a pipe in his mouth and his hands in his pockets—the prisoner then ran away, followed by Harmsworth and the black man, who overtook him at the fourth door from the Sun, and pitched into him, and they had a fight up against the railings, striking each other—a white-whiskered gentleman came up and parted them, and said to Harmsworth "You ought to be ashamed of yourself to use a young man like that"—the prisoner run away again, followed by Harms-worth and the black man—they had a tussle against the railings at the corner of Sutton Street, and I saw blood streaming down Harmsworth's head—some some one then said "He has got a knife"—the prisoner said that he had not—a constable came up in three or four minutes, and a gentleman at the back of the crowd handed him this knife, saying "Here is a knife I have picked up on the pavement—it was shut—the prisoner said that he had no knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have seen the prisoner's uncle here to-day—the prisoner did everything he could to avoid the attack; it was the most brutal attack I ever saw, otherwise I should not have wasted my time to come here—when he was struck he had his hands in his pockets—his pipe was not knocked out of his mouth, he took it out and put it into his pocket—I am certain no open knife was used, I must have seen it if there had been, and should have been the first to have rushed forward to take it from him—I did not examine it—the black man goes by the name of "Snipe," he has dancing dogs, he is a fighting man—Harms-worth was drunk, but the prisoner was sober—I saw Harmsworth about on the Tuesday night, outside the Strand Theatre at 11.35—I spoke to him at the corner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman of 1, America Square, Southwark—on 14th February, about 4 o'clock, I was in the York Road, and saw the prisoner and Harmsworth hustling together, hugging one another—my horse went on, and I had to turn him back again, and then Harmsworth said "I am stabbed"—he sat down, and I held him while a woman washed his head—I put him in a cab and took him to the hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw a knife in the prisoner's hand—it was then shut.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Thomas's Hos<lb></lb>pital—the prosecutor was brought there, and I found five wounds on his head and one on his left ear—the three posterior wounds were incised, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187403020046"></xptr>
               <p>might be inflicted with a knife of this sort—here is a curly human hair like the prosecutor's sticking in the clasp of the knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The wounds were very trivial, but a wound on the head may produce erysipelas if a man is out of health—the three posterior wounds were superficial, but the two anterior ones were more like stabs—the closed knife scraped along the head would not cause the marks I saw, because the wounds would then be parallel to one another, and sepa<lb></lb>rated—you might be able to make a scratch with the outside of the knife, but the anterior wounds were deeper, and could not be done so—there was no blood on the knife when I saw it at the station, but wounds of this nature might be produced without there being any blood on the blade; if the knife is drawn sharply through the integuments the blood does not always remain on it, but when the knife remains in it does—after I had dressed the wounds he walked away, and was taken home by the constable—he was drunk—he came again as an out-patient.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Convoy Street, Wandsworth Road—on 14th February, near 4 o'clock, I went to the Sun, and found the prisoner there—the black man came in after me, and was performing with a doll—I made a collection for him, and asked the prisoner for something for the performance—he said that he had not got more than 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his pocket—he was coming out at the door, and I asked him again—he gave me a <hi rend="italic">shove</hi>; we went outside, and he began fighting—he got my head under his arm, and stabbed me on my head several times—I saw the knife, and put my hand up to protect my head, and got one small stab in my hand—I saw him go away with the knife—my waistcoat and shirt were saturated with blood—I have them here—some men held the prisoner till a constable came—I had never seen the black man before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I took off my coat—we were fighting—my hat, I believe, fell off in the struggle—I did not take it off and hand it to the black man to hold for me—I went after the prisoner a few yards—we both struck each other—I do not think he had taken off his coat—I was not drunk; I had had a little liquor; but the more disgrace to him if I was drunk if he stabbed me—I struck the prisoner for pushing me—I had never seen the black man before—I heard last night that he is in custody—after having my head dressed, I called in again at the public-house to see if I could get some witnesses—I said nothing before the Magistrate about my hand; I never thought of it—the prisoner tried to run away from mo after he had stabbed me—I did not follow him; I was taken in a cab to the hospital—I was not turned out of the Rising Sun after the prisoner had been locked up; they told me they would not serve me with any beer, and I walked out without it—the black man was not with me—I am not aware that I insulted two gentlemen before I got into the altercation with the prisoner, or that I tried to take a child out of a woman's arms.</p>

I was going out, the prosecutor came up and said "I want to speak to you, you are not going like that." My uncle said "Come away." I was going away, this man pulls off his coat and comes up and hit me. I wanted to get away and went some distance. He followed and got bold of me and I got up against the railings with him. We had a bit of a struggle there. He tried to throw me down. I got hold of the railings to save myself. His head was not even under my arm. I saw his head bleeding, I thought it was against the railings it was done; I did not stab him. I reserve my wit<lb></lb>nesses."</p>

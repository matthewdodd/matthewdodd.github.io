On Sunday night, the 30th of April, about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock, I left my cab on the stand, with the mare in the shafts, in Whitechapel—I went to get something to drink at a public-house opposite, and was absent about ten minutes—on my return the mare and <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> were gone—I went on Monday to Flying Horse-yard, Lambeth-street, which is a very little way from Whitechapel, and found the cab there—I went the same morning, with the policeman, to the Green-yard, Colchester-street, and found the mare there, about 300 yards from the stand—the policeman found the bridle—my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> is marked M.</p>

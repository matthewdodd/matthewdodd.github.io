               <p>passed through me, and there it is. I examined it, and broke it in pieces, and here they are, and no one can say but that they are the pieces that passed through me. Where is the piece that fell on the floor? There were three or four other gentlemen there; why was it not picked up and pro<lb></lb>duced? Because it was good. The constable came in and I said it might have fallen down the area; they went down, and in the deposition it is stated that they were there ten minutes. Were I charged with smuggling away that piece that was on the floor, the Jury could not say that I was guilty; but merely because I was convicted before I must be guilty of uttering the coin. I called my wife to see what I had done, and she said, "Throw it away;" and had it been bad I would have done so. The lady would not swear what day I was there first, and she says she put the shilling in the box because she suspected me; she never told me, but took the shilling, and afterwards said it was bad; would any gentleman take a bad piece and allow a man to leave the shop without telling him? She says, to the best of her knowledge, it was on the 11th or 12th of July, and I was at Colchester, I received a letter there and answered it on the 12th, and that answer will be produced. My friends saw me off on the 2d of July, and I did not return till the 17th. Here are my friends who saw me off; I also forwarded in that letter ten shillings'-worth of postage stamps to my brother.</p>

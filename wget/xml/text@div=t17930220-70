               <p>Q. Do you remember any cloth delivered to you on board the Clockton from the East India Company? - There was a number of bales (I cannot tell what they contained) delivered between the 11th and 13th of December; the hoy was then at <placeName id="t17930220-70-crimeloc398">Lion's Key at Billingsgate</placeName>

               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Turrell? - He was apprentice to a master of another hoy that belonged to the East India Company, the name of it was the Bearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Taylor? - I know a lad that they call Taylor, his real name is Smith, he is an apprentice of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Adams by at the same time these goods were delivered on board the Clockton? - He lent me a hand to get them in.</p>
               <p>Q. He was employed to take these goods? - Yes, under me, he was a constant servant with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When these goods were taken in, in what part of the hoy were they put? - In all parts of the hoy under the Company's locks; they were locked up and keys given to the supercargo, Mr. Higgins, he is not here; I locked them up myself.</p>
               <p>Q. About the time the indictment states did you lose any thing? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Adams sleep there? - I expected him to sleep there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You say that something was delivered to you from the East India Company, what they were you cannot tell? - I cannot tell the contents of the packets.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you attend the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there at the time that Adams was examined? - I was at one time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him put his name to a paper? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that? - That is my hand writing, and Adams made the mark; I saw him make it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. For any thing you know there might not be a particle of cloth within these bales; you see nothing but the outside of these bales? - What bales?</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were bales delivered? - There were two hundred delivered.</p>
               <p>Q. It might be linen, woollen, or no cloth at all? - It might for what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Turrell was a person belonging to an hoy just by you, a very bad<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200146"></xptr>fellow you know? - I don't know any thing about him.</p>
               <p>Q. He has owned that he is a thief? - He certainly has.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there on board your vessel besides this man? - Only this Smith, myself and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Smith is not here? - He is not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you see the Lord Mayor sign this paper? - I cannot positively say I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You was not present during the whole time he was under examination? - I heard that he had had some private examination, to which I was not present.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you was not present at the whole of the public examination? - Yes, I was, I believe, I think I was to the best of my knowledge; I don't wish to swear it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long was you there? - I might be there an hour or more.</p>
               <p>Q. All these things that were delivered had the East India Company's marks on them? - I did not examine the marks, but I took them as the East India Company's goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. In point of fact you don't know they had the East India marks on them.</p>

               <p>Court to Webb. Do you mean to insist on it; it was the 13th of December? - It was, it was before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Stevenson. I did not notice any thing particular, only as being an officer on board of her, until I got on the Keys on board at Billingsgate, where I perceived this piece of cloth concealed, sewed up in a bed in the cabbin; we came from Gravesend to come up to the Custom House Keys to deliver this cargo that she was leaded with.</p>
               <p>Court to Webb. You say with regard to these bales of goods they were delivered on board the Hoy the 11th or the 13th of December, this man says when he came to the Keys in town, he found something in a bedding; had these bales been delivered at Gravesend? - They had been delivered. When I delivered my bales at Gravesend, I went immediately to Chatham River, and then we came back again to Gravesend and this revenue officer came a board of us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. They were first of all delivered on board the Clockton at Lyon's Key? - Then they were to be delivered on board the East India ships at Gravesend; then the hoy returned and took this Custom House officer.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he bring any goods back with the ship, or how did he come on board? - After I had been at Gravesend I got my receipt for the cargo, I went away from that ship to Chatham River for a load of cottons, and when I got at Gravesend they put this officer on board, and they came back with the cotton to the Custom House Key.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You delivered all the cargo as you believe, and the officer of the ship gave you a receipt for the full amount of that cargo? - He did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Who has the custody of the cloth now? - One of the warehouse-men.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200148"></xptr>Q. In what situation of life have you been in? - I have been in the service of the East India Company, in the vessel, the hoy, named the Bearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the defendant Adams? - He was a person employed by the Company, likewise in the Clockton.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Taylor? - Yes, he was likewise employed in the Clockton.</p>
               <p>My Lord we two, I and Adams were on board the Clockton; and

             was on board; we jointly agreed to take a bale of cloth out of the Clockton; I believe it to be the 13th of December, to the best of my recollection;

             went down the cabbin in the Clockton and fetched a piece of iron called a marling spike, and with that prized the board over the foremost hatch; he was then going down himself, but he afterwards recollected that if in case his master should come there would be no one to give an answer, and he would wonder to see him not on deck; he thought it was most fit for me to go down, and I went down and cut open a bale of cloth, the smallest I could find; one of the smallest, the contents of which was six pieces; I then handed it up to Edd Adams and

            , and the pieces of rope, and the two pieces of board that were about the bale; the two pieces of board which is packed on each side of them, one at the top and another at the bottom of the bale, I handed up likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these boards any mark on them? - Not that I observed; there was the Company's mark on the canvas; I came out of the hold, and they were all then handed into the cabbin, and Edd Adams then took and cut the mark off the wrapper of the bale, and the boards with the mark of the wrapper he burnt, and the remaining part of the wrapper was hove over board; the bale contained six pieces of cloth, and each piece was wrapped in a sort of dark coloured canvas, and at one end of the canvas was painted flowers, with the Company's arms,</p>
               <p>"super purple sixteen and half yards"; Edd Adams and I took the canvas off from one of the pieces of cloth and found it to be a very dark purple, the cloth at one end had a square piece cut out and a leaden seal at one corner, and I held the leaden seal while Edd Adams cut it off, which in so doing he cut my finger; then we considered what was to be done with the cloth, we were going to take two pieces away over the water, but we thought it was too late, and Adams said, he could put no more away, he could hide no more than two pieces; the Bearing, the vessel that I belonged to, lay close to the Clockton, and I agreed to put four pieces in her, which Edd Adams then assisted me in carrying over; I then put them, I hid them in the cabbin which I slept in; he then went on board of his craft, and I was gone to bed, he afterwards came over and told me that he had put his two pieces in his bed; the next day the Clockton went away with the goods, she had got in for Gravesend; the same morning a person of the name of

            ; one piece of it he took to his house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the two pieces in the cabbin of the Clockton? - One piece of it Adams told me he carried to his brother's house, and the other piece was seized by two Custom House officers, he did not tell me their names.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the situation you hold in the East India Company? - Three years and five months</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200149"></xptr>Q. You know the marks of the East-India Company well? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Where the marks you have described to be on the canvas, the marks belonging to the East-India Company? - They were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This is a very pretty account you have been giving of yourself? - Yes, sir.</p>

               <p>Q. I see you give it with just as much ease as if you had been at church last Sunday? - I wish to give it with ease.</p>
               <p>Q.Pray, sir, be so good to shew that pretty face of your's, and stand up like as an honest man ought. How long have you been a thief? - That is not to the point in question.</p>
               <p>Q. That is to the point in question; how long have you been a thief? - I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I hear very much to the misfortune of the East-India Company you have been three years and five months in their service; now of that three years and five months, what part have you employed in plundering them? you have been plundering them without remorse, and I want to know how long you have been in this practice? - That is not to the point in question.</p>
               <p>Q. It is to the point in question, what kind of credit the Jury can give to your testimony? - I have told you before I could not justly say how long.</p>
               <p>Q. How many years? - Not many, about nine or ten months.</p>
               <p>Q. Nine or ten months is not a year; then nine or ten months you have had your full swing at the East-India Company's property? - No, it is not so, not always.</p>
               <p>Q. No oftener than you had a good opportunity? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then having given such a good account of yourself, I take it for granted you do it to save your neck? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Now there was one thing I think you told us, that Adams told you, that he would not go down into the cabbin to get up these things, because there would be no one to give an answer to his master? - I did not say the cabbin, I said the hold.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a lad on board besides Adams, so that that could not be the true reason, yet you have sworn it; with all that load of iniquity on your head, I take my leave of you, good by to you, you may stand down; I dare say the next time you give an account of a robbery, you will not do it so easy, you will do it at that bar.</p>
               <p>Court. You have not explained to us after you had taken out this bale of cloth, what you did with it? - They were all in pieces of canvas, there was six pieces; the whole bale was completely taken away.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called ten witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

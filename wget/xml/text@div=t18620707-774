I am a carpenter, and have a shop within sight of Mrs. Glide's—on 13th June, Crawford came a little after half-past 9, and asked for half an ounce of tobacco—my wife served him, and he gave a half-crown—she called my attention to it, and I found it was bad—I said, "Young fellow, this is a bad half-crown"—I cannot say what answer be gave—the last witness just then came in and said, "You know it is a bad one; we have been watching you"—I said, "I will fetch a policeman"—I went out and saw Roote outside—I said, "I want you"—he said, "What do you want?"—I said, "Oh, don't be so <hi rend="italic">green;</hi> you know"—he said, "No, I do not"—I said, "Come and see your mate"—he said, "I have no mate"—I caught hold of his arm and said, "Come on"—as he was coming he forced his hand into his coat pocket, and down fell some money—I picked it up; it was 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took him into the shop, and gave him in custody.</p>

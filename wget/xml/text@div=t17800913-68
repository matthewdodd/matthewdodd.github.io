I saw a place made like a stove, I put my hand on it and said it was hot; it was in the front garret on the right-hand side; I spoke low, I thought he was near enough to hear me. I turned round and saw Jealous open the door at the left hand side of me; he went in and I followed him. Mr. Carter was then standing upon his feet; I looked over and saw the mother standing next the window. The daughter was getting up, and I heard some money fall down; I said Charles, the girl is throwing down money. He said never mind any thing, let us keep them where they are.</p>

               <p>I went to Carter's house in Water-lane, and when the door was opened we all went in together. I saw that young girl (Jane) in the kitchen, at a carpenter's chest. I thought it was a bench; she went from thence into the yard, and put her hand into the water; I was close to her; I asked her what she had thrown into the water tub? She said nothing. I looked into the water tub, but there was not any thing there; I brought her back into the kitchen. I looked on the chest where she came from, and there was a pan of aqua fortis and water, and a pan with water and white sand in it (producing them) in that pan; with the white sand in it there were these half crowns and shillings (producing a large parcel); in the aqua fortis and water there were some half crowns and sixpences (producing them. The witness likewise produced a bottle of aqua fortis and a pipkin.) This pipkin was on the corner close to the fire; there was some fire in a pan under it. I called Prothero to look at her hands; they were all over sand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130076"></xptr> and aqua fortis; for she had but just touched the water with one hand when I catched hold of her.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went to this house in Water-lane with the rest of the officers; I took care of the back part of the house for fear of an escape. When all the prisoners were in custody Prothero came and called me; when I came into the house I saw the youngest daughter in the custody of Phillips and Prothero. I then went up stairs through a room where some body had been casting, and in a room adjoining to that were the father, mother, and the eldest daughter. To the best of my knowledge the father was on the left-hand side, in the centre the daughter, and on the farther side the mother. The father was without his coat, his shirt sleeves tucked up; and I think he had a white cap on and a pair of slippers; he had no stockings. The daughter and the mother were in bed-gowns. There were three pair of handvises, three stools, which three people had been sitting upon, and some money lay all over the bench where they had been at work. I took them before the magistrate in the same situation they were in; and I am sorry to say there was not a doubt that each of the persons had been doing some part of the work.</p>
               <p>That is your opinion? - Clearly so.</p>
               <p>Upon what do you found that opinion? - By examining their hands, which were discoloured with working silver. There was a thumb-stall with silver on it found on the thumb of the father. There was a quantity of filings and a pair of knippers they cut it off with. There were the filings which had been filed, and some pieces cut off the rough edges. They are all here. I then went to examine the work shop; they had been casting there that day, for the furnace was warm. There was a melting pot in the furnace. There was a get which they lay in the sand, for a gutter for the metal. There was casting sand, facing moulds, and every thing complete for casting. I went down stairs; I found the pickle and other things there, and a quantity of half crowns which had been taken out of the wet sand; she had certainly been at work; her hands were in a terrible situation by working with the aqua fortis. I asked her what her name was, which she refused to tell me. She begged me not to ask her any questions. I put her into another room, and then found by the grandmother, that she was a daughter to the man. (All the implements were produced in court). This is the melting-pot which was on the fire; this is part of the money which lay before them; here are some rough cast as they came from the sand, the others are filed round the edges to take the roughness off.</p>
               <p>Then the persons so employed were filing these? - No doubt of it; here are files, and here are parts of the get; here are three hand vises, scowering paper, and cork, which they make use of; and another finger stall, which was found in the shop; here are flasks; here are the patterns with which the impressions were made in the moulds in which this counterfeit money was cast.</p>
               <p>What is the use of the pickle? - By putting them in the pickle it forces the silver to the surface.</p>
               <p>These halfcrowns which were found in the pickle do they correspond with the pattern you have produced? - They do; there is one which has been cast and made use of as a pattern; and these two are counterfeits; here is another made from that pattern.</p>
               <p>Are the shillings and sixpences the same? - All the same; here is a shilling which is a rough cast, a filed one, and a complete<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130077"></xptr> one, and a pattern; there is a hole in the woman side, and that corresponds with all of them.</p>

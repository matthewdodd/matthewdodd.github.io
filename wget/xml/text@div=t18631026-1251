                  </hi>. I am a chimney-sweep, of Meeting-house-lane, Woolwich—on Wednesday evening, 7th October, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I was in the Uncle Tom's Cabin beershop, Air-street, Woolwich, sitting in front of the bar—I had just come from my daily work—three men came out of the taproom and stood in front of the bar—Conway was one; he was drunk—he up with his fist and struck me on the mouth—I gave him no cause what<lb></lb>ever—the other prisoners followed him out—they said they came there to make a piece of work, and they thought they would commence—I saw Brown start upon another man, and the other one started upon the landlord—I am quite certain the prisoners are the men—the landlady called for assistance—a constable put his head in, and the landlord said, "For God's sake come and give assistance"—he had no sooner got inside the door than they began and knocked about his hat, and knocked him over the mouth—Conway was the one that struck at him—I did not see the other two do any<lb></lb>thing to him—they were hustling with another witness named Warwick—I did not see any one but Conway do anything to the policeman inside the house; outside I saw him terribly kicked, and greatly ill-used—the three prisoners rushed on him at once.</p>

I was on duty in uniform on Wed<lb></lb>nesday, 7th October, in High-street, Woolwich, and I heard a disturbance in Uncle Tom's Cabin—the landlady first called me in, but I did not go at that time—I went close to the door, and the mistress said, "For God's sake do come in"—then, as soon I put my head inside the door, I was struck by Brown on the forehead between the eyes—it was a very severe blow, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186310260092"></xptr>
               <p>there was a lump on my forehead—I saw Conway getting hold of the land<lb></lb>lord—after being struck, I went towards the landlord—they let him go—the whole of the three seized me—I was pushed out by the door and received two hits; I struck Brown—by the time we got into the street I was thrown on the flat of my back, and received injuries from which I am suffering now—I was kicked both on the back and chest—Bright gave me a kick between the shoulders—I could not exactly see how I was kicked, as my face was covered with mud—they were all on me at the same time while I was on the ground—I heard them say, "We came to Woolwich to kill a b—y '<hi rend="italic">slop</hi>,' and we might as well have you as anybody else; there was one of our mates had fifteen months for killing a 'slop,' and we might as well have fifteen years"—a "slop" is what they call a policeman—I suffered very much from spitting of blood, and I have suffered much to-day and all the days I have been here from pain over the chest and between the shoulders—I received two or three kicks there, and had, for some time, a stiff neck—my watch was broken in my pocket by a kick—when assistance came the prisoners were taken off me—I have been off duty ever since, and am still under the doctor—the prisoners were drunk, but not so drunk that they could not know what they were about.</p>

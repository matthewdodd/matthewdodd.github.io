James Noble depos'd, about 12 a Clock at Night he stepped over the Way to get a Pint of Drink, and in the mean Time the Prisoner came to his Shop; and being inform'd that there was a Man got into his Shop, went, and found the Maid holding the Door fast by the Ring, telling him, there was a Rogue in the House, whereupon he got Assistance, and beset the House before and behind, that he could not get out, and that it appear'd, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172310160006"></xptr> finding himself lock'd in, and the Door beset, had attempted to get out backwards, in that they found the Glass broken down, but finding he was beset that way as well as before, and being in the Dark, and not knowing which way to get out, he, at last, opened the Street Door, and was apprehended. The Prosecutor's Maid depos'd, That about a Quarter before 12 a Clock her Master being gone over the way, as she was sitting by the Fire, in an Apartment adjoining to the Shop, on a sudden she perceiv'd the Candle that was in the Shop to be put out, and starting up on a sudden went into the Shop, where she ran against the Prisoner, who was just turning to go behind the Counter, and asking him, What he wanted there? He pretended to ask her for some strange Name, upon which she gave him a push, got to the Street Door, and catching hold of the Ring pulled it hard after her, which being a Spring Lock, lock'd to, and holding the Door fast, call'd out till her Master and Help came; and he being thus caught in a Trap, when he found he could no ways get out of it, at last opened the Street Door, and was taken. The Prisoner had nothing to say in his own Defence, but, that he was in Liquor, and took it for a Thorough-fare. The Jury found him <rs id="t17231016-51-verdict269" type="verdictDescription">

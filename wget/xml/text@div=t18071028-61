            . I am servant to Mr. Chippen; I saw him come from the parlour with a small parcel in a silk handkerchief under his arm; I went after him. When I came up to him I asked him what it was, he said it was a kind of a spirit; it kept spilling as he went along; he put it down inside of the door of the shop; I went in and saw it was cherries in brandy; I walked out, he did not see me. When he came out I asked him again what it was, he said it was brandy with laudanum; I said I know it is not, I had seen what it was, it is cherries with brandy in it; he then said he had it of a young woman in the shop, he gave her a shilling for it; I asked him why he did not have it of his master, he had a deal more than the value he gave for it; he said he did not know the value, I told him he had better take it back again, he said he would; I left him and went to another place. I asked him on the Saturday if he had brought it home, he said yes, he had given it to the young woman. On Monday he was going into the country; his master asked him what bundle that was he carried out on the Thursday, he said it was two coats.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to prosecutor. You do not know that you lost any cherries, do you. - A. No, because we keep a quantity in the cellar.</p>

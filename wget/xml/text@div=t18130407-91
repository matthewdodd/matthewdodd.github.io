               <p>WILLIAM HARE. I am cashier to Messrs. Biddulph and Company. On Monday the 15th of March, the prisoner presented to me this bill of exchange for sixty-three pounds. I suspected it to be a forgery, and told him it was necessary to send to Mr. Thomas, the person that it purports to be accepted by, to make some enquiries respecting it. I desired him in the mean time to walk into the lane room. A person was sent to Mr. Thomas. In the mean time I asked him if he knew the endorser. It appears to be endorsed by Henry Gilbert. He said, he received it from Mr. Gilbert, who was a glover on Holborn Hill. I asked the prisoner his name. His answer was so indistinct. I am not sure whether he said John or Jeynour, that he was a glover, and resided in Berkshire. About this time Mr. Davis arrived, Mr. Thomas's partner. I put this draft into his hands. In consequence of what he said, it was found necessary to send for Mr. Tedbury, Mr. Thomas's clerk. Mr. Tedbury came. He said it was not the hand-writing of Mr. Thomas. The prisoner was then taken to Bow-street and committed. I am acquainted with Mr. Thomas's hand-writing; the name I do not think is his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. You, of course, was not certain of Mr. Thomas's hand-writing by sending for somebody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070060"></xptr>else - A. I had no doubt in my own mind at that time.</p>

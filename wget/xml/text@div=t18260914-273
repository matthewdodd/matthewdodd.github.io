            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Whitechapel-road. On the 6th of September, the prisoner came to my shop, about six o'clock in the evening; he showed this piece of gold, and asked if it was gold; I had my suspicion, and asked, why he supposed it was gold, as it looked more like copper than any thing else - he said, by the weight of it, and he had picked it up opposite Whitechapel-church - I asked if any one saw him pick it up; he said, they might or might not; it was close by a stall, where some women were selling fruit - I asked if he worked at the Mint; he said no, nor any of his relations or friends; that he worked at the West-India Docks, and his name was Thompson; he lived at No. 33, Chicksand-street; I weighed it; I supposed it to be a blank sovereign, I told him to follow me, and show me where he lived; I went there - he said, he wanted to go up stairs, but I prevented it - a young woman then came forward, and I asked if he was her brother? she said, Yes; I asked if he worked at the Mint? she said, No; nor any of her friends or relations - the prisoner heard this, and they endeavoured to communicate with each other, but I prevented it - I then brought the prisoner along Chicksand-street, and when I got near the top, his sister came running after us, and wished to speak to him again; I would not allow it - and she then said, she would tell me the whole truth, his name was Richards, and he did work at the <placeName id="t18260914-273-crimeloc1550">Mint</placeName>

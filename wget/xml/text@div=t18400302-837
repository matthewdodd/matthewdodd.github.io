                  </hi>. I am a hosier and tailor, and live in Regent-quadrant. The prisoner was in my service for about seventeen days, up to the 13th of February, when in consequence of something I called her into the parlour, and stated that some things were missing—she denied taking any, and offered that her boxes should be searched—I went up stairs with her—she turned the things out of her box—I found nothing but some hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs which I then thought to be mine, and which I now know to be mine—I then searched her bed, and found a number of these articles made up like a pillow on one side, and the bolster was doubled, and made a sort of pillow on the other side, and being covered with the pillow-cases it appeared a well made bed—I found this pair of garters which I suppose she took from the shop—the other things were wrapped up in the blanket—this lambswool waistcoat I can identify, having marked it myself, and it had got soiled in the shop—this lace sleeve belongs to my wife—I know these handkerchiefs, as I had been serving a customer with some a few days be<lb></lb>fore, and showed him the parcel in which these were—when I found these, I sent down to one of the shopmen to bring up the parcel, and it could not be found—in a parcel behind the prisoner's room door I found this other handkerchief which had been taken from the same parcel—I sent for an officer, and gave the prisoner in custody—I have since then missed nearly 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property.</p>

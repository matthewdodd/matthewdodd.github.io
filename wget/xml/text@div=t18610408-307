                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Hudson—we keep a confectioner's shop at 44, Goswell-Street—on 21st March I paid the prisoner 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he at that time gave me this receipt for it—he wrote it at the time—(<hi rend="italic">This was a bill containing various items to Smith and Co., 5, Fell-street, Wood-street, London; and at the foot was</hi> "Received on account 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., George Brown."</p>

I am cashier to Mr. Samuel Smith—the prisoner was in our employ as collecting clerk—his duty was to receive the various sums that were paid him on his rounds, and to pay them to me either that night or the following morning—on Friday morning, 22d March, he did not hand me any account of what he had collected—I asked him if he had any cash for me—he said, "I have not a farthing; only my expenses"—he did not tell me what the charge was for expenses that morning—on Saturday morning he handed in this account to me—that was the manner in which it was usual for him to hand in the account—this "Thursday, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." at the bottom is the expenses of the Thursday's round—"gold" means what he had received in gold, and "silver" what he had received in silver—I don't remember asking him anything further on his handing this in to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a confectioner, carrying on business at 5, Fell-street, Wood-street—I have a partner—the prisoner was in my employment as a collector—on Saturday afternoon, 23d March, I sent for him into my room, and asked him whether he had received any money on Thursday that he bad not accounted for—he said he had not—I said very pointedly, "Are you quite sure of that?"—he said he was—I asked if he had not received any money from Mrs. Hudson on the Thursday—he said he had not—I asked him again if he was sure of that—he said he was quite sure that he had not—he said he had paid in all the money he had received—I then told him it was known that he had received this money, and that we had a policeman waiting in case it was as we feared—he then said if he had received it, it was in a book that he had in his pocket, which he threw down on my table—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he then said he had got into the company of a bad woman on the Thursday night, and had spent the money, and it had been preying on his mind—he made a long rambling statement or confession; I can't recollect every word—he said it had been preying on his mind ever since he lost the money, and he did not know what to do—he was then given into custody—</p>

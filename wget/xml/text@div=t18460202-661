                  </hi>. I am a nurseryman, and live in Camberwell New-road. On Saturday morning, the 17th of Jan., about a quarter to seven o'clock, I opened the gates of my nursery, which adjoins my dwelling-house—my house is in the nursery—I missed thirty standard rose trees, twenty-one peach trees, and three cytisus, which I had seen safe at six the previous evening, growing in the nursery—they were in an inclosed place—I gave in<lb></lb>formation to Kendall, and was with him on the Wednesday following, when the trees were found behind a house in which the prisoners live—they said they resided there—I found a label on one of the peach trees, which I knew—I can swear to it by that—there had been labels on the other trees, but they had been torn off—the trees themselves exactly correspond in size, number, and quality with those I lost—the peach trees were maiden trees, only grafted one year—I had had them from a gentleman in the country on the previous Thursday—I saw them all put into my ground, and I attended to them myself—I could swear to the trees being mine, independent of the label—these now produced are them—Raynes had worked for me for a short time about two years ago.</p>

On Wednesday, the 21st of Jan., about twelve o'clock in the day, I went to a cottage in Wheeler's-fields—I found Raynes sitting by the fire, and Waite behind the door—I said, "Hollo!" and he repeated the same word—Waite said, "I know what you are coming about, you are come about those rose trees; a man named Piper was to give me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to try and sell them"—he said he did not know where Piper was, or where the trees were—Raynes said he knew nothing about it—I took them to the station, took their shoes from their feet, went to Mr. Fryer's ground, and compared them with the marks in the ground—they all four corresponded with the marks there—I put the shoes in the marks—I noticed the marks before I put the shoes in—they corresponded with marks going and coming from where the trees were taken—I afterwards went to the ground near where the prisoners resided, and there I saw similar footmarks—I tracked them till I came to a trench covered over with dung, I took that away, and there found the trees produced, on one of which was this label.</p>

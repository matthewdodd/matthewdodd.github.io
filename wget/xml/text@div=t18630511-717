                  </hi>. I am master of the workhouse of St. George's-in-the-East—I have known the prisoner from time to time for about two years—she has been chargeable to the parish, and an occasional inmate, the last time was in November last—on 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> April she was in the workhouse—I received some information with regard to her conduct, in consequence of which I ordered her to be removed into the vagrant ward, between 9 and 10 in the morning, apart from the rest of the inmates—I told her it was for her refractory conduct—the vagrant ward is in front of the workhouse—it is part of the same building, but has no communication with the other inmates—the pri<lb></lb>soner was alone there during the day—I saw her there about half-past 10</p>

               <p>in the morning—there was a quantity of straw there; about a truss, or from that to a truss and a half, and there are nine cots, divided by wooden partitions—about seven in the evening I heard a cry of "<hi rend="italic">fire</hi>"—I went to the vagrant ward and found the straw all in flames—the prisoner was in the fore-court in front of the ward—she was not locked in the ward—we got the engine to work, and subdued the flames—the cots on which the vagrants lie at night were burnt—they are made of timber, fixed to the flooring—the partitions were very much burnt and charred—a beam that runs across the ceiling was also burnt a little and charred—the windows were all cracked by the heat of the flames, over the vagrant ward is the assistant matron's room—the parish is under a board of guardians.</p>

               <p>Mr. REYNOLDS was sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. A letter came to me from one of the Justices of the peace for Middlesex, informing me that the prosecutrix of the prisoner at the bar had been enticed into Newgate to the prisoner, and that the moment she came to him, a woman sitting upon the same bench with him had got up, and immediately accused her with robbing her of the cloak she had on, and an apron, and of various other articles, and that he was fearful of some trick in this business; it struck me as something very extraordinary, and I took some pains to enquire into it; I sent for the woman into my room and examined her very particularly and took down what she said, the next day the woman that accused her seemed to be very plain in her story and to have the appearance of truth, I desired my Lord Mayor yesterday in the afternoon to appoint a meeting to examine into this business, and after we had been with the people for about four hours, the prosecutrix in this business acknowledged that what the woman had accused her of concerning the robbery was true, and that she would restore the goods; and the keeper of the Compter went and found the goods as she directed him, she therefore appears to be a very improper evidence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord I wish to be indulged in a few sentiments.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. You need not say any thing.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury Gentlemen you have heard what Mr. Reynolds has now said, and if you wish after that to examine this witness to be sure we will go on.</p>
               <p>Jury. We should think it very improper my Lord.</p>

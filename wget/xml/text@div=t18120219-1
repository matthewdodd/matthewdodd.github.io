               <p>Q. Was your house broken open open - A. Yes, on the 31st of January at seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it quite dark then - A. Yes, it was quite dark; we had lit the lamps about an hour. A square of glass was broken in the shop window. The Bow-street officers brought the two men into my shop. The window was broken so that I could get my three fingers in; the handkerchiefs that laid near the place were moved a little of oneside; I had seen them there about an hour before that.</p>
               <p>- NICHOLS. I am a conductor of the patrol of Bow-street. I saw Parton go to the middle of Mr. Rogers's window; he put his hand against the glass; he went to the other side of the window, and then Green, he came; I passed the window and perceived the glass was starred. I saw the two prisoners go back again to the window, it appeared to me that Green had got hold of some of the goods; I found two knives upon him. Partons fingers were cut.</p>
               <p>- JONES. I am a patrol of Bow-street. I have no further to say than what Nichols has said, I was with him at the time.</p>
               <p>Parton's Defence. I have subpoened the glazier that mended the prosecutor's windows the next day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Grosvenor-row, Pimlico. On the morning of the 31st of March, I was in my slaughter-house, and missed a leaden gutter from it—I had missed something four days before, and observed to the prisoner, who was my foreman, how light the slaughter-house looked—and on the 31st my landlord was there, and we missed the leaden gutter—I said, I had noticed that something was gone—I got the officer, and found that the leaden gutter had been pulled down inside—I pressed my lad to tell me about it—he said, he knew nothing of it, but <hi rend="italic">Josh</hi> did—I said to the prisoner, "<hi rend="italic">Josh</hi>, tell me the truth of this"—he said, "Well, I have had the lead, and sold it for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I will make it right, I will give you so much money"—he said he had sold the lead to a man, whom I had warned him against—we went and found that man in a house in Hospital-row—I brought him to my shop, and said to the prisoner, "Is this the man whom you sold the lead to?"—he said, "Yes"—I gave them both in charge, but the other man was discharged.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Peckham-rye—on 21st October, about 3 o'clock, I was on my way home—I had reached the corner of Rye-lane which conducts you into the Rye—I observed the omnibus time-keeper, George Allen, seated in a chair opposite a shop at the corner of the lane, reading what I took to be a newspaper—he appeared to be between forty and fifty years of age, and had dark hair—I saw the prisoner and two other men approach him—I had observed them before, as the prisoner had run against me—the prisoner struck the paper out of the deceased's hand, put his right hand to the hair of his bead, knocked it back, and pulled him by his whiskers—the time-keeper rose from his seat and pushed him away with his open hand, saying, "Go away, you foolish fellow, what do you Mean?" or words to that effect—the prisoner then made use of some words, and struck him in the face a straightforward blow—a scuffle then ensued sad they closed, during which I saw the prisoner seize him by the back part of his head with his left hand, and strike him; he then tripped him, by putting</p>

               <p>one foot between his, having a purchase by the hair of his head, and threw him on to the pavement, the back of his head came in contact either with the kerb or the pavement—the blow was on the stone—it was a most fearful blow—it resounded most fearfully—he laid in a perfectly insensible state, with blood flowing from his ears, and I rather think from his nose as well—he was taken up and conveyed to a neighbouring druggist's shop—I left my name and address—no one else struck the deceased.</p>

I am a labourer living at Peckham—on 21st October, about a quarter before three in the afternoon, I was at the corner of Rye-lane and saw Allen the timekeeper sitting in a chair reading a paper—the prisoner went and made water up against a cab—he came back, got up on the pavement, walked up to Allen and struck him open-handed on each side of his face—Allen said "You go away, you stupid fool, what did you do that for?"—after he got away Allen got against Mr. Coggin's window, and his shoulder took the sash frame—the prisoner got hold of him and said, "You b----I have got you now, I will give you a cross <hi rend="italic">buttock"</hi> and he took him by the hair and tripped him up with his legs, he fell on the pavement, and was taken to a doctor's shop five or ten minutes afterwards—the prisoner said, "You b----, come out again and I will give you a <hi rend="italic">worser</hi>—the fall was enough to kill anybody.</p>

I am a professor of music, living at Camberwell—on the afternoon of 31st October, just before 3 o'clock, I was getting off an omnibus at the corner of Rye-lane, and saw the deceased standing with his back against the shoe shop, and the prisoner sparring at him, and pressing him against the window—the prisoner's back was turned towards me, and partially hid Allen, so that I could not see everything; but I saw blows exchanged, and they went against a window—the prisoner took hold of the deceased's hair, held it upright, and cast him down on the ground—the deceased was then retreating, and the prisoner pushing him against the window, he went down like a stick—the prisoner threw him down by holding his hair; and putting his legs between the deceased's, they came down to the ground together; but the prisoner somehow escaped a fall; and the moment the deceased's head touched the ground he let go of him—the deceased was as rigid as a poker, perfectly still—the blow might be heard across the road.</p>

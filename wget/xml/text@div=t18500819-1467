                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Mann. On 2nd Aug., at half-past twelve o'clock, I got into an omnibus—I rode from Clare<lb></lb>moot-square to the Quadrant—I saw the prisoner in the omnibus—I am not quite certain where he got in—he sat nearly facing me, and he removed from that seat, and sat next to me on my right—he got out at the Quadrant in Regent-street before me—I got out immediately after, at the same stopping of the omnibus—the conductor spoke to me, and I missed my purse—I had had it a few minutes before—I know there was a sovereign in it, and two 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. -pieces—what the rest of the silver was I cannot say—my pocket was on the right side of my dress—this is my purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, B</hi> 3). I was No. 350 A. On the morning of 1st Aug., I saw the prisoner get into an omnibus at Regent-circus—I knew him, and went outside of it—I then saw him get into another omnibus and ride back—he then got into two or three other omnibuses, and I got outside them—I then saw him get out in the Regent Quadrant, and I saw Mrs. Mann get out—in consequence of what was said, I went after the prisoner—I saw him put his hand over the side of a cart—I was then about twenty yards from him—I took him, went back to the cart, and found this purse and the money in it—the prisoner said, "You are not going to take me, are you?"—I took him, and found a remarkably sharp penknife in his pocket, and this black bag which he used to cover his hand with, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber, living at 5, Queens-square, Hoxton—on the night of 26th January, about 7 o'clock, I was with John Haines, in Dunstan-street, Kings land-road—I saw the prisoners Whitty and Door, and from something I observed, I watched them—I followed Door until she came to Bridport-place, Hoxton, about a quarter of a mile—she went into 52, Bridport-place—I looked through the window and saw her tender a shil<lb></lb>ling to Mrs. Anderson's daughter—Whitty was at that time standing about twenty yards off, under a public-house window—after Door came out, I im<lb></lb>mediately went in—Mrs. Anderson showed me a shilling, which I marked—I came out again, and saw the female join the male prisoner, and go up an opposite street—I followed them through various streets, till they came round again within ten yards of the place where the shilling was tendered—they went down Poole-street, to a baker's; Door went in for a halfpenny slice of bread—she did not tender any silver there—I then followed them down the New North-road, till they came to the corner of Wimbourne-street, to a Mr. Smith's—they stood outside the window looking into the shop—Door then went in—I called the attention of the constable 60 <hi rend="largeCaps">N</hi>—the male prisoner crossed to the opposite side into a dark street, named Cliff-street—I went up to him and told him I wanted him for uttering base coin—he resisted, and ran away—in running he dropped this doll and this journal—I picked them up and still pursued him—he then put his band into his coat-pocket, put something into his hand, and threw it away as he was running on to the top of 8, Cliff-street—I still pursued, and captured him, and gave him into custody—I afterwards went on to the top of 8, Cliff-street, and there found this purse containing two counterfeit shillings, wrapped up separately in paper.</p>

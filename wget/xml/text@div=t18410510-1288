                  </hi>. I am bailiff to Lord Montagu. The prisoner Mat<lb></lb>tenly was his carter, and was directed to go to Uxbridge, on the 22nd of April, with a load of wood—I overtook the wagon, and noticed on the top of the wood some rye-grass hay—it was not quite a truss—he generally had a truss of hay to feed his horses, it would be the usual quantity—when horses are detained on a journey longer than usual, I believe men sometimes borrow bay, and, instead of paying for it, replace it—the con<lb></lb>stable afterwards took possession of the bay.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Cowley. About ten o'clock on Thursday, the 22nd of April, I was passing the Crown inn, at Cowley, kept by the prisoner Newton, and noticed Lord Montagu's wagon with the hind part standing towards the house, and the horses to<lb></lb>wards the road—I saw Mattenly at the hind part of the wagon with a bundle of hay in his hand, which he gave to Newton, who turned round and carried it to his stable—I went up to Mattenly and said, "You are a very foolish man, I think you have been selling your master's hay"—he made no answer—I said, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself, I sup<lb></lb>pose you have sold it for a shilling"—he said, "No, I have sold it for a pot of beer"—when Newton returned I said, "Newton, you have been buying this man's hay; you ought to be ashamed more than him"—he said, "I am only going to give him some beer for it"—I said, "Go and fetch it back," which he did—I laid it down between them, and was going to take it away—Newton said, "Don't take it away, it is the first time," and he would not do it again—I gave the hay to Mitchell, the constable—it was about three-parts of a truss.</p>

I have got no chain"—I pulled him off the wall—he struck me two or three times—Seymour then came behind me, pulled the skirts of my coat, pulled me away, and they both escaped—I sprang my rattle—sergeant Walker came up—I described the prisoners to him, and he apprehended Barnes—about seven in the morning I went down to the wharf, and saw Seymour on a boat in Pad<lb></lb>dington-basin—I told him I should take him for being in company last night with a man who had some chain—he said he had been in bed all night, I must be mistaken, he was not the man—I took him.</p>

On the morning of the 29th of Dec., I heard a rattle sprung when I was near Park-place—I went to the top of Park-place, and met Hughes—in consequence of what he said, I went to North-wharf Road, Paddington to look for the prisoners, who I had met to<lb></lb>gether in company in North-wharf-road, at half-past one, about 200 yards from where the chain was taken—I am sure they are the men—Barnes was in a very thick flannel frock at that time—I apprehended him about twenty minutes past six, in the same frock, in North Wharf-road—I said, "I want you for that chain you had in your possession this morning"—he said, "What chain? I know nothing of any chain"—I said, "At the top of Park-place, you made your escape from one of our men"—he said, "Not me, let me go," but I said, "No, I shall not, where did you sleep to-night?"—he said, "I slept at the wharf"—I said, "I met you at half-past one, in company with a short young man"—he said nothing to that—I took him to the station—I had gone with Hughes, and found the chain about five minutes after three o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boatman, and live at Wendover, in Bucks. I had a boat lying in Paddington canal basin on the 28th of Dec., and had a chain about ten yards long on board, and another on another boat—one was made fast, and the other loose—Seymour came to me before daylight on the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 29th, and said, had not I a chain—I said, for anything I knew I had, on the forward part of the boat—I said I did not want it, if he liked to have it he should have it for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was the value—I sold him that one for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not deliver it to him—I told him it was there, and he might take it—he paid me the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I afterwards found the other chain down at the station produced by a policeman—that was not the chain I meant to sell for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know how it got out of my possession—I was in the cabin getting np when Seymour came to me—I did not go out to look after it—I was not dressed—the chain was on the forward part of the boat, towards the head—I told him it was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Boxmoor.

                  </hi>. I am horse keeper at the Swan Inn, Stratford. On the night of 27th May, I was in a four-wheeled chaise, which was in a ride where we keep the carriages—there was another man with me—I was on the further side, the dark side—I saw the prisoner come into the yard and he pulled the ladder from the lamp, and placed it against the water-butt—he saw Knight, the man who was with me, but he did not see me—he said to Knight, "You had better come out of that trap, or else the ostler will pull you out"—Knight said, "I am, (doing no harm, only sitting down taking my rest"—the prisoner theu walked round the closet and up the yard—he came back in a quarter of an hour and then he walked out of the yard again—he went out of the front door—Knight then left me, but I remained in the chaise—the prisoner then came down the yard again the third time, from twenty minutes to half an hour after Knight had left me, and he went and took this tap from the butt; I saw him take it—he then went up the ladder and took this ball; he took them both away—I can't say whether he put them under his jacket, but he took them out of tne yard—in three or four minutes afterwards I went up the yard and saw two officers—Mr. Hadland keeps the house, it belongs to him—I am in the employ of the General Omnibus Company—I can swear positively to these articles, I have had the handling of them for four or five years—the chaise I was in is fourteen, or fifteen, or sixteen yards from the water-butt.</p>

I am landlord of the Swan Hotel, Stratford—on the night of 27th May, Carter gave me some information—I went in the yard and examined the water-butt—I found the tap was gone, and the water was flowing from the butt—the prisoner was brought back afterwards—I can swear to this tap being mine—I cannot swear to this ball—I have com<lb></lb>pared this with the piece it was broken from, and it corresponds exactly—these things are worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe I had seen the prisoner, I believe he was in work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Stratford—on that Sunday night I was with Carter sitting on the same seat in a phaeton—I saw the prisoner come down the yard, he came and touched me on the knee, and said I should get pulled out if I sat there; I said, no I should not, I was not doing any harm—I did not see him move anything in the yard.</p>

Q.</hi> How many persons were in the yard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I and Carter, nobody else, that I saw, but the prisoner—I was close to Carter—when the prisoner spoke to me it was sufficiently loud for Carter to hear him—Carter sat more in the dark. <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS KINCHENDEN</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 53). I am stationed at West Ham—on Sunday night, 27th May, Carter came to me while I was on duty in the Broadway—I went round to a place leading to the Romford-road—I saw the prisoner standing against the churchyard railings, he was in the act of drawing his arm through the railings—I said to him "You must go back with me to the Swan public-house and see the ostler"—he trembled very much, but he went back, and while I was trying to find the landlord and the ostler he ran away—I ran after him—he jumped over a garden wall and I lost him—I went back to where I had seen him—I got over the church-yard railings, and found there two brass taps and this ball, inside the railing—they were so near that a person standing outside could have placed them there—when I saw the prisoner there he was stooping down and drawing his hand out—I saw the prisoner again on the following night after he was taken in custody.</p>

             is my man; in the night, between the 12th and 13th of December, I had my slaughter-house broke open, and three sides of beef, the thick and thin flanks and briskets cut off, and the kidney suet and the kidneys, and the fat off the buttocks.</p>
               <p>Q. How had you left the slaughter-house at night? - A. Locked up safe; I locked it myself, I was the last person that came out of it; all the thin fat, and the rough fat was gone out of five sheep, and three shoulders of mutton; my man alarmed me about half after six in the morning, I went to the slaughter-house, the door was not broke open, they got in at the top lost, which was left open for the air, we could see by the print of their feet that they got in there, and there was a ladder set, in Howland-street, opposite to my house; the prisoner Northcote told me he was one of the persons.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to tell you that? - A. I don't know; I asked him, and he denied it at first, but afterwards, at Marlborough-street, he said that he was one of the persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise, or use any threats to induce him to say that? - A. No; I asked if he helped to cut the meat to pieces; he said, he cut none at all; he said, Tomkins cut the meat, for he could come at the flanks of the bullock better than he could, because he was taller; he said, I was satisfied with the first load, but Tomkins was not he would go back for the second.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he was when the other cut it? - A. He said, he was in the slaughter-house with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he himself came back for a second load? - A. He said, they both came back again; he said, they were in the slaughter-house when the watchman came down two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the business of Northcote and Tomkins? - A. I know no more than I was informed, that one was a <rs id="t17970111-29-deflabel182" type="occupation">tripe-man</rs>

             sworn. - I was a watchman in the parish; about a quarter after two, my fellow-watchman told me there were two men going along with something in a bag; I followed them; this was in the New-road; I came up with the short man, Northcote, and asked him what was in the bag; he told me it was turnips; I laid my hand on the bag, and felt it, and he threw the bag down and made off; I made after him and sprung my rattle; the other man made off at the same time; I followed Northcote, and never lost sight of him till he was taken by the patrol, and we took him to the watch-house; there was some beef, and a cleaver in the bag he threw down; I gave them to the night constable, Mr. Chinnery.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any turnips in the bag? - A.

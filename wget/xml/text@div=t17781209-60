I lost a brown mare on the 6th or 7th of August, which I had bought on the 4th. I agreed to give four pound sixteen shillings for it, but had not paid for it. I turned her upon Uxbridge Moor . I went to see for her on Friday afternoon, and she was gone. I did not see her again till the 25th of October. Mr . Sage the person I bought it of, went down to Leighton-fair to buy some horses; he stopped the mare there. I saw it on the Saturday following. I am sure it was the mare I bought of Sage, for I had marked the fore-hoof with the initials of my name, but it was rasped out.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Uxbridge Moor is a large open common from whence the mare might have strayed? - Yes; it might have strayed. I do not charge him with stealing it.</p>

               <p>I bought a mare for 4 l. 16 s. I told the prosecutor if he liked it he should have it at the same price; and he had it of me. It was lost from Uxbridge Moor . I saw it again in October, in Leighton-fair; I challenged it as Mr. Duncan's mare. There was a boy had it. I laid hold of the bridle. The boy said it belonged to one Stevens, a capital man in the town. We went up to Mr. Stevens's. Duncan and I agreed if the mare was lost to be at the loss between us.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Uxbridge Moor is an open moor? - Yes. Very likely it might stray, there are many roads through it.</p>
               <p>You agreed with the last witness if the mare was lost to bear an equal proportion of the loss; Duncan swore to the horse being his property? - And I swore to the property.</p>
               <p>You could not swear to the mare, if Duncan did? - I swore to half the mare, it was half mine.</p>

               <p>Did you see him again before he was taken? - No. When I heard it was stolen I pursued him, and took him at his own house. I challenged him with selling me the mare at Dunstable-fair . At first he denied it. Then he said he bought it of one Mitchel at St. Albans. I took him before the justice, and he was committed. He said he coul d produce the man he bought it of, but never did. When he said his name was

             spoke something to Mr. Sadgrove, that was the man that came to fetch me, while I was searching the manservant, and he followed her out; and soon after they came in, and brought me in this little book (a book produced), and the note was tied up in it; I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>What conversation had there been about the note? - I did not hear any thing.</p>
               <p>- SADGROVE sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 7th of January Mr. Chadwick came to me, and desired me to step with him, for he was ruined; immediately I went with him, and Mr. Chadwick took me to Mr. Bond, and he granted a search-warrant; Mr. Bond said to me, run and see if you can find a constable; I immediately ran to Chelsea, Sloane-street, Sloane-square; I found Mr. Burridge, and begged of him to come up with me to Justice Bond; Mr. Bond produced the warrant, and he says to me, Sadgrove, I advise you to go with the constable, and see it served; and so I went with the constable to Mr. Chadwick's house, and Mr. Chadwick was in the garden when I came; and he came, and we went into the fore-parlour together; and then the constable came, and knocked at the door afterwards; and then Mr. Chadwick had his servants into the room; and after the maid had come up, he said he had missed, or lost, I cannot tell which, a Bank-note of 50 l. and he had a search-warrant, and there was the constable, and that they must both he searched; the constable began on the man-servant first; he pulled off his coat, he searched it all over, and then his waistcoat, I believe, and then his stockings, and he was searching them; and by this time the maid-servant was disposed, as I understood her, either to speak to me, or her master; I immediately took more notice of her, and comprehended that she wanted to speak with Mr. Chadwick; I turned about to the prisoner, and said, what, do you know any thing of this? she said faintly, yes, I have got it; Mr. Chadwick and I and she went into the passage; she immediately fell on her knees when Mr. Chadwick came out, and gave me a little book; and Mr. Chadwick went and told the constable, to prevent his searching any further, and he came out, and I delivered this book with the note.</p>
               <p>Did you open the book before you gave it to Mr. Chadwick? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you see it opened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was in it? - A 50 l. Bank-note; I delivered it to the constable.</p>
               <p>Court to Constable. In what condition was the book delivered to you? - Tied up.</p>
               <p>When was it opened? - Immediately, in the parlour; the 50 l. Bank-
note was in it; I have kept it ever since.</p>


               <p>(The Bank-note read by the Clerk.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I cleaned the room out with a flannel, and under the bureau I took out this note with the flannel, and I put it into my pocket; I cannot read or write, nor I did not know, it was a Bank-note, and so I did not know in consequence that it was different from other paper; I never heard it inquired for till my master called me up from my work, and then shut the door; I was quite thunderstruck to see the gentleman and the constable in the parlour; when my master asked me about a 50 l. note, a 50 l. note, Sir! replied I; directly it struck me it must be that that I had put in my pocket; on that, I spoke to Mr. Sadgrove; he looked at me, and nodded at my master, and they both followed me out into the passage; and I told them I did not keep it with an intent to steal it; and therefore I put my hand into my pocket, and asked them if that was the note; says I, please to look at it.</p>
               <p>Court to Chadwick. Was the book yours? - No, it was the maid's.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. How long have you lived with your master? - Seven months.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Chadwick gave her a good character, having had a character with her of three years and a half when he took her, and having not the least suspicion of her being bad inclined, but very ignorant, and he did not know as she could write, having<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179201130038"></xptr>never received any wages of him, nor signed any receipt.</p>

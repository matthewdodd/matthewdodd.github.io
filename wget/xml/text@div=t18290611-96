I lost three fowls on the 17th of May, which I had seen safe the day before; in the morning, my servant brought up two of their heads to the bed-room, about half-past seven o'clock; and I got up, went to the coop, and missed three fowls; I have no hesitation in swearing they were mine.</p>
               <p>ROBERT SMITH. I am a gardener. On the 16th of May, I had information that my masters pond was about to be robbed - I was on watch, and saw the prisoner enter Mr. Pike's premises, which join the prosecutor's; I went in, and secreted myself under a tree - the prisoner came by me with a spade under his arm, between twelve and one o'clock; I had a gun - I presented it to him, and told him to stop; he refused at first, and said he had as much right there as I had, and at last he went with me a little distance; he then seized hold of the gun, and said he would go no further; we had a struggle - I got the gun from him, and he ran to the gate; I pursued, threw him upon a bush, and kept him there till the constable came.</p>
               <p>MARTHA BAGBAY. I live with Mr. Pike - I picked up the fowls in a bush near the gate, about seven o'clock the next morning.</p>

             MILES. I am a constable. I was on the premises watching; I was talking to Mr. Snell, and heard the gardener call - I ran to him, and found him struggling with the prisoner, whom I secured; the night was dark, which I suppose was the reason we could not see the fowls - they were found in the same bush the next morning; the spade was found near the place where they struggled first: I then went to the cage again, and found some feathers in the prisoner's pockets.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been at the Bell public-house with some friends, and we stopped there till eleven o'clock; they agreed to take half a gallon of beer home - we went and sat down in a lane, and drank that beer - then I went close to Mr. Pike's; the gardener came out, and said, "You are my prisoner;" I said, "What for?" - he struck me two or three blows, and I struck him, and got away; he caught me again, and threw me down - he came down to the cage, and found about four white feathers in my pocket.</p>

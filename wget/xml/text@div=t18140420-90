            . The prisoner had a large basket on his shoulders, and when he came out of the shed he went along by the side of the hedge; I thought he observed me; I had suspicion of him. I went round to the gate with intent to meet him; he saw me; he stopped. I got over the gate. I asked him what business he had in that shed; he told me he had not been in the shed. I then said, I saw you come out of the shed. I asked him what he had in his basket; he said, he did not know; the basket did not belong to him. I took the basket into a public-house, and examined it; the basket contained turkeys and fowls; they had all been recently killed. At Hatton Gardon office the prisoner said he found them on Harrow-hill-common. They proved to be the property of Mr. Buck.</p>

               <p>JAMES WELLS. I am a gardener to Mr. William Buck, he lives at Hendon. On Wednesday night, the 13th, I saw the fowls all safe then. On Thursday morning, I went to the shed, and missed the turkeys and fowls; I have seen them since at Hatton Garden office; I am sure they were Mr. Buck's property.</p>

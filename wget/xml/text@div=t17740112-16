            . I was servant to Mr. Akerman: the prisoner was tried in September sessions, 1772; she was convicted to be transported for seven years; I was in court when the Jury brought in their verdict, and am certain to her person; I was sent for when she was before the Justice; she called me by my name immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was she in Newgate before she took her trial?</p>
               <p>Howard. I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was she before the transports went away?</p>
               <p>Howard. When I was with Mr. Akerman I used to have a list of the transports; but I have mislaid my papers since I left him; she called me by name as I said before at the Justice's, and desired I would not be too positive.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not call him by his name; he bid me pull off my bonnet that he might see my face; I took my bonnet off, and then he said he believed he knew something of me; I never called him by his name; a man in the prison told me Howard would make it up, if I would advance some money.</p>
               <p>- Lee. I went down to lock the women's side; she said Mr. Lee, what do you think will become of me? I said I do not know; she said she had a friend that would give ten guineas to Howard not to appear; I told her I knew nothing of it, she must apply to him; that was all that passed; I was not bound over.</p>

            . I took a woman up for a felony last August but one; this they say is that woman; she was like her but not half so big nor half so lusty as this woman; the keeper came to me to look at this woman; I saw her; there is some likeness; but if it is her she has got remarkably fat since; I cannot swear to her.</p>

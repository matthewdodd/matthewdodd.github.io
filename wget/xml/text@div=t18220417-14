About eight o'clock I was going out at the private door, and saw it open - the prisoner was standing at it, on the threshold; his feet were not within the door, nor any part of his body. I said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want;" he said he came to measure the shopman for shoes - I said I was the shopman; he said I was not the person, but it was some cabinet-maker, a short thin man; but he did not know his name. The door had been opened before by a key I suppose; it was shut ten minutes before.</p>

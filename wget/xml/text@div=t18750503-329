                  </hi>. I am assistant letter carrier at Churton Street. Office, which is seven minutes' walk from Lupus Street—on 28th April, about 10.45 I saw a letter bag lying on the stamping table—I emptied it out and this pair of earrings came out, and this box and these three letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I immediately communicated with Mr. Alley—the prisoner afterwards came, took away the bag and put it by his side—he was arranging the letters which he was going to deliver—two of these letters are addressed to Lupus Street, and one to Rutland Street.</p>

                  </hi>. I was acting overseer at Churton Street Post Office, on this morning—the prisoner was a letter carrier—his district was Lupus Street—on 28th April, at 10.55 a.m., Harris took up a bag which was on the stamping table—it contained three letters, a box, a small piece of paper and some earrings—I took the letters and box away, and told him to put the bag back, and immediately afterwards the prisoner came and took it to his seat—it was a bag which I had lent to the prisoner a month or five weeks before as he had lost his own—I know it; it has his initials</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187505030033"></xptr>
               <p>on it—I allowed him to arrange his letters and then asked him if he could account for these letters—he said "No"—I asked him how the letters and earrings came into his bag; he said "I don't know"—I told him he would have to go with me to the S. W. district and explain to the postmaster—this envelope addressed to. Mrs. Crowhurst, bears the W. C. post mark 3 o'clock on Monday the 26th, and S. W. of the same-date but later—if that had been posted at 2 o'clock in Holborn, it would have come to Churton Street Office, between 5 and 6 o'clock, and would have been sorted to the prisoner for delivery and he would have delivered it between 6 and 7 o'clock—these three letters are marked "Southampton, April 26th;" "S. W., April '27th;" "Wallington, April 26th;" "S. W., April 27th;" and "High Wycombe, April 26th;" "S. W., April 27th."</p>

                  </hi>. I am attached to the missing letter branch of the post-office—on 28th April my attention was called to this matter, and I went with Moore to the S.W. office and saw the prisoner—I said "I have been informed that letters were found in your bag, how do you account for not delivering them?"—he said "I know nothing about them"—I drew his attention to the cardboard box, and earrings, and said "How do you account for these being in your possession?"—he said "I know nothing about them"—I directed Moore to search him, and saw him take this envelope from his pocket addressed to Mrs. Crowhurst—he said that he knew nothing about it—he was given in custody.</p>

We have very often loose wrappers. I had one in my pocket at the time, but they make no mention of that.

               <p>T. J. <hi rend="smallCaps">HARRIS</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I emptied the bag because I thought it was a collection, and that it ought to be emptied out—the bags are not necessarily emptied out because they are laid there, but I mistook it for a collection.</p>

I got two officers, they found the watch upon him and part of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them find it upon him. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time did the prisoner come home in the evening. - A. About six o'clock.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Thames police. On the 30th of December I was sent for when I went the prisoner was standing at his own door, when my brother officer and I went into his house; we asked him where the watch was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who asked him. - A. Gillmer; I heard the prisoner say something about going back to the privy, I told him not to let him go, we would search him first; I looked down and saw the watch chain; my brother officer directly tore the watch out, pocket and all.</p>
               <p>(The watch produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I work in ballast lighters. Upon the 30th of December; I went to my work about twelve o'clock, my wife always knows me to come home at high water, she expected me that night, and coming into my own bed chamber I catched this man sleeping in my own bed where my wife and I sleep together, I catched him by the breast and asked him what business he had there, he did not speak a word to me, he appeared to be very much in liquor. There was a watch laying upon the table at a distance in the room, I took the watch, I could get no sense of him; I took this watch till I knew what he come about. I went up stairs, having a strong suspicion of jealousy, but finding her locked up in one of my lodger's rooms I went away. In the morning after my going away to my work, he arose and went up to where she lay, and sent the woman out of the house and had connection with her in the bed. I never denied having the watch to the officers; I put it in my pocket only to find the man out; he fetched this Mr. Walker and swore against me, and that he was captain of the Canary; he is neither captain nor owner, nor does he belong to the ship. At the time of my imprisonment in Clerkenwell he lived in my own house with my wife, and took her from me. He came up to Newgate to tell me if I would not prosecute him for having to do with my wife and give him some money, he would not appear against me. I have witnesses to prove the same.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you not tell me that before. You represented it that he wanted to go to the privy as if to conceal something. Then he wished Gillmer to go backwards with him to the privy to talk with him. Look at this, and tell me whether this is your examination; is this

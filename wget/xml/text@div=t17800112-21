I told him not any one at all. He said directly, give me your watches and money, or I will shoot you through the head in a moment. He said that to me and my man, who was with me on the box. He asked what I had got in my hand? I said a bundle; he demanded that.</p>
               <p>What did he say about your money? - He put a pistol to my head, and said give me your watches and money or I will shoot you through the head. I said I was a poor man and had no money. He asked what I had in my hand? I said a bundle; he took that bundle from me; there were two horse-cloths in it. When he had taken the bundle he went a second time to the coach door, and looked through the glass and found there was nobody there; he came back and presented a pistol again to my head and said, your watches and money or I will shoot you through the head; we told him we had got none; he then went and opened the coach door. I thought we must die if he came again, and therefore jumped off the coach-box and laid hold of him by the right-hand and got him somehow on the ground. I found he was very strong and I called to the coachman who was along with me to help me as soon a possible. He got down as soon as he could, and assisted me. I called to the watchman; he came, and presently after about ten or a dozen more. The prisoner was very strong; I was afraid he would get from me; I secured him and took this pistol from him.</p>
               <p>Was the pistol loaded? - No.</p>

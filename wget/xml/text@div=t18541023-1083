                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 133). In consequence of Instructions I received, I watched Taylor's house, No. 6, Milton-street, Cripplegate, on a Wednesday evening in Aug., about half past 7 o'clock; he keeps a marine store shop—while I was watching I saw Judge coming up the street, very bulky about his person; he went into Taylor's house; he remained two or three minutes, and then came out, and appeared to be counting some money; he threw up some coin, caught it, spat upon it, and then put it into his pocket—I followed him to No. 15, Bristow-street, Hoxton, where he lives, and next morning I watched him going from there to his employer's, N. 36, Newgate-street—(I was in plain clothes on both occasions)—on that day I saw him again, about a quarter after 1 o'clock, coming out of Taylor's shop again—there was another officer with me—on Thursday evening, about 7 o'clock, I saw Judge come out of Mr. Simcox's, his master's, with a fellow servant—Judge appeared very bulky—I followed them to Moor-lane, where my brother officer, Bull, who was hi plain clothes, joined me—the prisoner and his fellow servant parted company in Moor-lane; we both fol<lb></lb>lowed the prisoner to Taylor's shop again—he went in, we remained outside about two minutes and a half, and then we went into the shop and saw Judge and Taylor—there is no counter in the shop, but there is a small ledge which projects out about a foot square—Judge was in the act of but<lb></lb>toning up his trowsers' when we entered—I asked him what he had brought there to sell; he said he had brought nothing to sell, he came to see if he could get a door handle like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which he produced to me—I told him that we were two police officers, and that we were convinced that he had come there to sell some carpet; he said he had not—I asked Taylor if he knew Judge, he said that he did not; then he hesitated, and after<lb></lb>wards said that he had seen him once or twice before; he seemed to study—I asked him, if he had purchased any carpeting of Judge, to produce it; he said that he had not, and that he had not got a bit of carpet in the house; upon that Bull directly went behind Taylor, where the small board projects out, picked up this piece of event (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and said, "Here is a piece</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230010"></xptr>
               <p>of carpet; how do you account for this?"—I do not know what Taylor's answer was, but I went round, and said, "You have got more than that?—Taylor said, "Yes; here is another piece," and picked it up himself—I said, "How do you account for this?"—he said, "I bought it of a dealer but I do not know who"—I then took Taylor and Judge into custody—when Judge went into the shop on the first occasion, he presented a bulky appearance, and when he came out he appeared much thinner round the lower part of the stomach.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 181). On Friday evening, 25th Aug., at a little after 7 o'clock, I was in Moor-lane, and received a commu<lb></lb>nication from Packman, in consequence of which we followed Judge into Milton-street—as he crossed over from a court, I saw that his appearance was very bulky, as if something was put between his trowsers and waistcoat; he went into Taylor's shop—we waited outside about two minutes, then went in and found Judge buttoning up his trowsers, which had what is called a fly front—Packman asked Judge what he had come there to sell; he said, "I have nothing to sell, I came to get a door knob like this"—Packman asked Taylor if he knew Judge; he said, "No," that he had never seen him before; he afterwards said, "I have seen him once or twice before"—Packman had said that we were two police officers—Packman said to Judge, "You have come in to sell some carpet?" he said, "No, I have not"—Packman then said to Taylor, "I want that carpet that you have bought of this man;" Taylor said, "I bought no carpet of him, I have not a bit of carpet in the house"—I said, "I am positive you have, and we must have it"—I then went round and picked this piece of paper up behind Taylor's heels; he was standing just by the doorway of the partition, with his back towards it; it was between the two shops; I could not see it while the conversation was going on, but I saw that Taylor was rather fidgetty and I went and found it, and said to him, "You said just now that you had no carpet in the house; how do you account for this piece?"—he said, "Oh! I bought that of a dealer, I can account for it another time"—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230011"></xptr>
               <p>he did not mention the name of the dealer, nor has he since—he said that he should not account for it any further—I saw Packman bring another piece of carpet from the inner shop—I found on Taylor 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that this man had this piece of carpet in his breeches on the day you saw him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is my view on the subject; I have not tried whether it will go into my trowsers—I should say that these are Brussels carpets—I was about twenty-five, or it may have been thirty yards, from Judge at the time he went in—he would not have to take his trowsers down entirely to get the carpet out; he had only to undo the fly front, and it could be pulled out—I could not see the carpet when I went in—the shop was very dark—there was a lot of canvas hung about—these are the only two pieces of carpet we have found—Packham had been watching a day or two previously, as we supposed that Judge was robbing his employers—he had no carpet with him unless it was in his breeches—the other piece of carpet was in the inner shop—Taylor did not bring it out himself; Packman brought it out—there was a great deal of property—the shop was in a state of confusion, with things piled on the top of one another—Milton-street is an extensive thoroughfare—it was between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening—when I got a good view of Judge's bulk, he was not under a gas lamp—it was on 25th Aug.</p>

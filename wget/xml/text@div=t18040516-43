             put her hand in my pocket and took five-pence halfpenny out; I told her not to be so meddling, but the object of halfpence I did not mind; she went out, and was gone two or three hours; she came back, and tumbled down on the bed; I told her I did not want her there; I said, I wish you to be off; I went to sleep, and when I awaked I saw her standing up by me; when she went out I put my hand in bed and found my watch was gone; with that I said to her who was with me, get up, and let me look whether the watch is under you; she got up; she was undressed, and so was I; I felt all about for the watch, and could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. So you get drunk, and go to a house in Church-lane, Dyot-street, and there you continue drunk till the next day at noon; you were half-drunk and asleep all the time; what are you? - A. I am a shagreen case maker; I am sure this is the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sleeping, drowsy, and drunk? - A. I was so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the watch ever found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- NORMAN sworn. - I am a publican: about 2 o'clock this woman came into my house; she offered this watch to a Jew; the Jew came to me, and said she had a watch to sell; he asked me what he had best do; I told him to send for a constable; I took her by the hand and asked her her name (she was very drunk); she told me in the best manner she could, that her name was Kelly; I gave her and the watch to a constable; she said it was her husband's; both her eyes were black.</p>
               <p>- PERRY sworn. - I am an Officer: on the 14th of May Mr. Norman sent to me, and said a woman had offered a watch to sell; I took the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160032"></xptr>woman, and he gave me the watch; she was very much intoxicated with liquor; she said it was her husband's watch, he was on board a sloop of war, and was going off; I said I did not think it was so; I took her to the office; Mr. Kinnaird desired me to put her into the watch-house till she was sober. (The watch produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) You know the other young woman very well, as you had been there so many hours - what is her name? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not give her the watch to pawn? - A. No; when I came away, I had about nine shillings in my pocket; I had had no supper, nor no breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. You had had a little porter in the morning - you do not call that a breakfast? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went down to Billingsgate, and could buy nothing; I returned to the public-house facing of this bawdy-house, where he was; this gentleman and this woman were standing in this tap-room, where she was drinking; I asked her to give me some drink, and when I got a little tipsy, she told me to go home, and lay my head down till I was sober; this gentleman, after I went there, said, this is all the money I can afford at present, I will give it you if you can get any gin for it; I went out to get the gin, and broke the mug, I was so intoxicated with liquor; he got up on his elbow, and gave me the watch to pawn for a trifle of money; he bid me bring in half a pint of gin; I took the watch in one hand, and the bottle in the other, and as I was going down stairs, I broke the bottle.</p>

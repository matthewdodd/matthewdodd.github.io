Others said, That the Prisoner was a person of a fair Reputation, and Sick at the time when the Rape was said to be Committed. There were several Scandalous Reproaches, and Ugly Reflections, on both sides; and in the whole course of the Evidence there was abundance of Malice appeared, which weighed so much with the Jury, that they <rs id="t16891211-28-verdict126" type="verdictDescription">

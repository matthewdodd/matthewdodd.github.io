                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman,</hi> 112). On 5th December, about 4 o'clock. I saw the prisoners with a van going slowly up Liverpool-street, towards Bishopsgate-street—all the prisoners were with it—Garrett was down on his side, and could see that his arm was at work at the top of</p>

               <p>one of the bales—the younger Bird was on the box looking round—the elder Bird saw me, and no doubt, knew me, though I was in private clothes—I had seen him a short time before—he was driving—he called out "Help," or something like that, and Garrett started up suddenly with a handful of wool in his hands on the top of the bales—he then turned round and sat on the bales—Robert Bird the younger is the nephew of Robert Bird—he was looking at Garrett—he could see him very plainly—the driving box is very high—Garrett was nearly level with the drivers head—anybody turning their head could see them quite plainly—the younger Bird was standing up by the side of the driver with his head towards Garrett—I am quite sure Bird, the driver, saw me, for they increased their pace and drove quickly away up Liverpool-street—I ran as fast as I could round Bishopsgate church-yard, and as I got to the top, I saw the van turning down Hounds-ditch—they were then in the same position as when I first saw them—the younger Bird was up on the box, and I could see that he was taking wool—they drove slowly down Hounds ditch—Liverpool-street is nearly opposite—it is in the line of Haydon-square—they must go across the street—I followed them, and the van stopped at the corner of Aldgate church-yard—I could see Garrett and the younger Bird sliding down the van behind—the younger Bird must have got over the top—they both left the van—the younger Bird went towards the Minories, and Garrett round the churchyard, carrying this bag of wool (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on his head—I could not see which of them handed it down, as they slid down to quickly, but Bird was down so that he must have seen Garrett with it—it contains wool—I followed Garrett, and gave him into custody to another officer—I then met the younger Bird walking in the Minories, told him that I was a policeman, and I should charge him with stealing wool from one of Pickford's vans—he said, "What van? I know nothing about any van; I have not been in any van to day, and I have not been at work to day"—I took him to where the van was stopped by another officer, and told the elder Bird that I should also take him in custody for stealing wool from the van—he said that he knew nothing at all about it—I told him I must take him to the station-house, and took him there—Bird was on the box driving, at the time the van was stopped—he pulled up long enough for them to get down; about half a minute—the van was loaded three or four feet above the rails.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Pickford—the company consists of Joseph Hornby Baxendale, and others—the elder Bird was a carman, and Garrett was the guard of the same van—the younger Bird was a labourer in the warehouse—on 5th December the elder Bird and Garrett</p>

               <p>went with the van to fetch some wool from 65, London-wall—they were to bring it direct to Haydon-square—the younger Bird should have been at work in the warehouse, but was not—he had no business with the van—one of the officers came to me—I examined the bags, and found one of them cut open, and there was about twelve pounds short—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) corresponds in sample and quality—I have got the cart note from the elder Bird—that includes this bale which was cut open—the value of the wool was about 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the bag does not belong to us; we have none like it—on examining the van, I found another bag like this, which did not belong to us—I also found another bag there, containing the same sort of wool—the van had no business to go up Hounds ditch—it was a quarter of a mile out of its direct way—it ought to have gone straight down Camomile-street—the prisoners had no business in Liverpool-street.</p>

Q.</hi> Is Camomile-street a crowded street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I should call it a quiet street, and so is Liverpool-street; one is as much retired as the other—no particular directions were given with the van as to what streets were to be taken on that day, but many of our carmen have orders to go down certain streets—they may not take the most convenient streets—the street from London-wall to Camomile-street is very narrow at some parts, but two can pass very comfortably.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Pickfords, and the younger one about twelve months.</p>

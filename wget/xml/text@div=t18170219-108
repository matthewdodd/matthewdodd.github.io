He did not pay his rent regularly; I asked him why he did not pay it - He said it should be paid the next evening. He asked me to go up stairs, which I did, and my wife followed me - We missed some feathers out of the bed. I heard him come down stairs soon after, and I went into the passage; he had got a bundle in his hand.

I asked him what he had been about; he said, he had been sweeping the room. I stopped him at the door, and went up into his room, and found the bed turned down, and the feathers about the room-some of them were under the grate, and some sticking to the broom with which he had swept the room. We took him up stairs, and he shook his bundle in the room; it contained a stuff gown, and some feathers-the feathers exactly corresponded with those in the bed.</p>

On the 23d of May he was skeining some silk; I was in the counting-house watching him while he was in the skeining-room, and saw him put some skeins into his pocket - he went to breakfast - I called him back, and asked what he had got in his pocket - he said nothing; I told him to put his hand into his pocket: he did so, and pulled out one skein of silk; I then put in my hand, and pulled out another. I sent for an officer, and the prisoner said I had better not prosecute him, as it would be only losing time. The whole of the silk is worth about 6s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. Have you any partner? A. No; I can swear to this silk by its being dyed by a particular process.</p>

            . I am a journeyman to Mr. Sodo. I saw the prisoner put one of these skeins into his pocket - I told my master - he went into the counting-house and saw him put another skein in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go before the Magistrate? A. Yes; the prisoner there stated he had done it through distress; I have known him about twelve months, during the time he has been there at work.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). The silk I was found in possession of is two knots, which form the minor part of skeins, and, having two particular colours to knot up, I had, as is very common with workmen, placed them in my pocket just before breakfast time, to be knotted when I returned.</p>

            . I am a watchman: I was in Mr. Jones's house, sitting at the table where the prisoner was, on Saturday last; there was only him and I at the table; I saw him take the pots off the table; I believe there were two or three of them; he went out with them, and I followed him home to his own house; one of the pots was the pot he had his pennyworth of beer in; when I saw him go out I informed the prosecutor, but he could not come out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before where he lived?</p>
               <p>Innes. Yes. I followed him close and saw him put the pots down on the table; he did not see me; when he had put them down he returned to the house, and took another pot that stood, on the table by him, and three or four more. I acquainted the prosecutor of it, and he came and took him, and he dropped the pot under the table where he sat. The landlord and I went to the prisoner's house and found the other pots there.</p>

               <p>I went to Mr. Jones's house and called for a pennyworth of beer; I drank a little of it and then took the rest home in the pot; I came back and called for another pint; I drank some of that and took the rest home in the pot; the other quart and pint pot were in the house before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

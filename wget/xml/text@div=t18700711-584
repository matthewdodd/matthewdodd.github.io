                  </hi>. I am a vegetable cook at Cremorne Gardens—the prisoner occasionally helped me—on Thursday, 16th June, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I went in to the prisoner and asked him to help me—he said he should not obey my orders, he should obey Mr. Lindsay, and he said something indecent to me—I told him I should punch his head if he did it again, and with that he took up the knife and said if I touched him he would stick me—I ran away, and said I should speak to Mr. Lindsay—it was a black-handled knife, one that he was peeling potatoes with—this is it—it had a handle on at one time—William Hall, one of the witnesses, chopped it off—I went into the cellar to see Mr. Lindsay—I did not see him, and I returned to the green garden, and put my hand on his shoulder and said "If you take a knife to me again I will knock you down with the first thing I come to"—I put my hand on him in a quiet way—he jumped up, took me by the neck, and stabbed me—he had the knife in his right hand at the time—he stabbed me in the left side twice—we struggled together, because he was hanging round my neck—we were both sober—I struck him after he stabbed me, but not before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant at Cremorne Gardens—I saw Smithson crying—he went up to Clark and put his hand on his shoulder, and said if Clark ever said such a thing again he would knock him down with the first thing he got hold of—he did not push the prisoner at all—the prisoner got up, and they had a bit of a scrimmage together—I saw the prisoner draw a knife from Smithsou's side, from his body—Smithson had his coat off—the knife was drawn out, and then he asked for it to be taken away—it was wrenched from the string that was round the prisoner's body—Hall took the knife and threw it on one side—he chopped the handle off afterwards—I called out that Smithson was stabbed—as soon as I could catch hold of him I lifted up his shirt, and saw the wound, and then I helped to take him to the hospital—Clark was taken away as soon as I caught hold of Smithson.</p>

I am house-surgeon at St. George's Hospital—on 16th June, Smithson was brought there about 4 o'clock—I found two wounds on the left side; one bleeding freely—one was over the region of the heart, and the other was lower down—they were incised wounds, such as would be produced by a knife or sharp instrument—I did not examine the depth, because it was not advisable to probe them—they were about an inch and a half long—they might have been dangerous wounds—they must have been done with some violence to have gone through the clothes—I should not think they were done by accident.</p>

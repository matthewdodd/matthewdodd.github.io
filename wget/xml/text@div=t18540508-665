                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Robert Hyde, of No. 6, Bells-buildings, Salisbury-square. I lost a gown on 21st April, between 11 o'clock at night and 7 o'clock in the morning—I left it at night on the foot of the bed where I was sleeping, and I missed it when I got up in the morning—my two younger sisters slept in the same room—I also missed my father's boots—the house had not been broken open—there was no fastening to the street door, only the latch—I missed nothing but the gown and the boots—there were lodgers sleeping in the house in three different rooms, a family in each room; they are still there—none of them lost anything—Julia, Con<lb></lb>nelly made the gown for me—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I have had it since Christmas—I have worn it, and am sure it is mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Connelly, a boot maker, of Fox-court. On Saturday week I saw the prisoner in Fox-court, with this gown on—I followed her into Brook-street, and asked her how she came by that gown; I told her it was a stolen gown; that it belonged to my cousin; that I had made it, and I could prove it to be the gown—she at first said she bought it at a pawn shop in Liquorpond-street—I said I did not think they sold articles in a pawn shop until after they had been twelve months pawned—she then told me that she had bought it in a clothes shop on Eyre-street-hill, and given 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, that morning—I said I should ask a police<lb></lb>man about it—she told me not to call a policeman; that she was willing to come with me to Mr. Hyde's house, which she did willingly—I told her I would say nothing about the dress, but when I got in I would ask the family if they knew any article of dress she wore—I did so, and the girl said at once that it was her dress—the prisoner then said she was willing to give up the dress, and lose her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. so that there was nothing more said upon it—it cost 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When she first met me she asked to look at the sleeves of the dress, and asked if I knew it was stolen, and I said I did not. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She said she did not know it was stolen—she said she had bought it that morning, and paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—at first she said she bought it at a pawn shop in Liquorpond-street, and then she said she bought it at a clothes shop on Eyre-street-hill—I am certain she said so—I brought her down Fetter-lane, and across Fleet-street, to Bell's-buildings—when I first spoke to her it was in Brook-street, Holborn, a few minutes walk from my own door—she said, "If I knew it was stolen, do you think I would wear it in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood it was stolen from? I would give it up directly;" but she was not in the neighbourhood—she said at Mr. Hyde's house that she bought it in Field-lane; she did not say who from, but she said she would take us to where she bought it, and she took us to Mrs. Moore's house, on Saffron-hill.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Daniel Moore, of No. 70, Saffron-hill; I am a dealer in second hand wearing apparel—this gown was brought to my shop after the prisoner was detected, by Margaret Hyde—I had never seen it before—I have had a dress like it in my place for sale—Margaret Hyde asked me, in the prisoner's presence, if I had sold this dress in the morning, and I said, "No," I had not sold a dress of any description out of my shop for the last fortnight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Well-close-square. On the 2nd of March I was on board a vessel in the St. Katharine's Dock—the prisoner was in the next vessel—I did not know him before—he spoke to me first, and seemed to know me—he said he had come off a long voyage, and said, "I want a suit of clothes, Mr. Levy; if you will make me one to my satisfaction I will pay you justly"—he asked the price—I said it would be 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the suit—he said when the work was done he would pay me—I made the clothes, and brought them on board to him on the 4th—he had told me to bring them there—I took him a pair of trowsers and a waistcoat, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he seemed perfectly satisfied with them—I folded them up, and he said, "What shall I have to pay you?"—I said, "These things come to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he looked round, called to one of the men, and said, "Where is the key of my trunk?"—a man came up to him, and gave him a key—he took the things out of my hand, jumped down into the forepart of the vessel, and said, "I will pay you in a few minutes, "but in about five minutes he jumped up, and jumped on shore, and ran off like lightning—I pursued him, but could not find him—I should not have let him have had the things without immediate payment—I have never found the clothes—he was taken up about two days after<lb></lb>wards, and I said, "How dare you rob me in that kind of way? what have you done with my things?"—he looked at me and laughed, and said, "What I have done I have done clean; I have served you as I have served a great many more, and will serve others so, in defiance of the law of Great Britain"—I said, "I don't wish to hurt you; very likely you have pawned them; if you will give me the duplicates, I had better lose the half than the whole"—he said, "Oh, no; I know my trade better than that; I am not such a fool"—an officer came by, and I gave him into custody—he had never come for the jacket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> He came on board the ship on Thursday—he is a jew, and would sell a thousand such fellows as me for half-a-crown—he offered to make me a suit—I said, "Well, make me a suit as quick as pos<lb></lb>sible"—next day I went on shore, and came on board rather fresh—he brought the trowsers and waistcoat, and said, "The jacket will be done in about an hour and a half and when I bring it you can settle with me"—the captain was paying some of the men down in the cabin at the time,</p>

               <p>and the captain's son said to me, in the prosecutor's presence, "Tom, have you got a stamp receipt?"—I said, "No, I have not"—he said, "You had better go and get one, because the captain won't pay you without one"—I went away to get one, and fell in with some shipmates; I got entirely drunk, and never went for the stamp, and when I came on board the ship two days afterwards, the things were gone—they had been getting all the goods out of the ship; and how do I know that man did not take the things back with him? it is as likely as not; a Jew like him would do any thing—he never asked me for payment of the clothes—the first thing he did was to give me in charge—I did not run away from the ship.</p>

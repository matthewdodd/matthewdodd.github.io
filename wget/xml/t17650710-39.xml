The prisoner lived nine weeks with me; my bureau, in the back part of my house, on the ground floor, was set on fire; the door of the room where the closet was, in which stood the bureau, was usually unlocked: every body in the house had access to that room.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the key of the bureau?</p>
               <p>Lady Effingham. I had the key; I was there the day before the robbery, the 17th; I believe there might be about threescore pounds in guineas and half guineas, two half crown pieces, and a silver groat, in the bureau; some of the money was in the purse, I believe; (two half crowns put into her hand) I had such as these in the bureau; one I had a great while, but cannot be certain there are they. (Two bags produced) These are mine, which the money was in, in the bureau: my maid came and told me the room was on fire; I got dress'd, and out of my room as soon as I could. I found, when they brought the bureau out, the back of it was burnt, but the front was not burnt. The lock was very difficult to open, and it appeared to have been cut where the bolt snot, in order to open it; t hat I imagine to have been done before it was set on fire; after the fire I searched to see what money was taken out, and found it gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep that bureau always locked?</p>
               <p>Lady Effingham. I never failed locking it; and nobody had the key but myself.</p>

            . I lived with my Lady Effingham Howard at the time of this robbery: I was awaked by the alarm of fire; the prisoner rung the bell at the bottom of the stairs: I went down and saw him at the bottom of the stairs, just by the fire; he was drest as he was the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was that?</p>
               <p>Catlin. This was a little after three o'clock; he had his black stock about his neck: he went by me, and he shewed me where the fire was, with his shoes and every thing on he had the night before, with his stockings tied up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he used to appear flush of money?</p>
               <p>Catlin. No, he did not, he borrowed money of me, a shilling at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the fire?</p>
               <p>Catlin. About a fortnight or three weeks before the fire. I had directions to search the wall in the garden about a week before the fire, on account the maid-servants had told me and others, that the prisoner told them he had seen three men in the garden; I went to look, and saw no print of feet, or any thing. I searched the borders, which are soft ground; if people had come over there, there must have been the print of their feet.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. How long was it after I rang the bell before you came down stairs?</p>
               <p>Catlin. It might be five or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Where did you go when you went down stairs?</p>
               <p>Catlin. I asked him where the fire was; he said it was in her Ladyship's back parlour; I begg'd him to shut the door: the smoak came out very much; I ran out into the yard, to see if the place was open, and after that her Ladyship sent me to St. James's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you dress yourself before you came down?</p>
               <p>Catlin. I put most of my things on first.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the prisoner was searched?</p>
               <p>Catlin. I was; I saw six guineas in all; there were six half guineas among them taken from the prisoner, two half crowns, one looked very fresh, and a silver groat.</p>

            . I was servant to Lady Effingham; the prisoner had lived there about nine weeks: about a week before the bureau was set on fire, in the way of discourse, the prisoner asked me if I knew how he had been frighted in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100025"></xptr> night; he said there came three men in the night opposite to his room in the garden; that he got up out of his bed and asked them to come in, and they d - d him, and said it was well for him that they did not come in, for there were three more for him, and they got over the wall again, and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he tell you this?</p>
               <p>B. Lewis. This was in the kitchen, on a Sunday, between two and three o'clock; they must of necessity go over a border of soft ground that is round the place, in order to come at the wall, and the wall is pretty high, so that if this had been true, there must have been the print of their feet to be found: this I told to our housekeeper and

            : the prisoner told me he went down with a book, and read it, at five o'clock, after he had frighted the thieves away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know at what time the fire happened?</p>
               <p>B. Lewis. The bell awaked me between two and three in the night: we at first thought it was my Lady's bell: Mrs. Davis went from me to the top of the stairs, and asked what was the matter; the prisoner made answer the house was on fire. I and Mrs. Davis went to my Lady's room; I left her with my Lady, and went and fetched the cook down stairs; the first thing I saw was the prisoner, with his hand upon the lock, shewing them where the fire was: he was dress'd in every thing as he was the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when he was searched?</p>

               <p>B. Lewis. I was; it was in the parlour; there were six half guineas, three whole guineas, two half crowns, and a silver groat found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lady Effingham. When was the money missing?</p>
               <p>Lady Effingham. That was not missing till the fire was all over; that was about twelve or one o'clock in the day. I had the bureau carried over to my Lord Faulconbridge's, knowing there were things of value in it: when the fire was over, I had it brought to me; we plainly saw, that it had been cut at the place where the bolt goes in, to get it open. They had put it in the back-yard; I hearing of that, ordered it to be carried to my Lord's for security, seeing how it had been cut to break it open.</p>
               <p>Q. to B. Lewis. Had the prisoner been out of the house after the fire to the time of the search?</p>
               <p>B. Lewis. He was missing some time between three and four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner used to be slush of money?</p>
               <p>B. Lewis. I never saw any money upon him; he used to borrow a shilling or two of me; he asked me for a shilling on the 9th of May, and I did not give it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he active in helping to put the fire out?</p>
               <p>B. Lewis. I saw him once in the yard when the engine was playing; I did not see him do any thing.</p>

            . I lived with my Lady at the time of this accident.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of you in family?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. There were my Lady, myself, the house-maid, the cook, Catlin, and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had the prisoner used to lie?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. He lay below stairs in the dressingroom; the room joining to the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you in the room where the bureau stood last, before the fire?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. I was in it betwixt the hours of twelve and one in the morning, to put my Lady's pincushion into one of the drawers: these drawers are never lock'd: then I went to see if the back-door was fast, and then I went to bed, and he rang the bell about three.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all safe then?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. I observed nothing but what was very safe when I heard the alarm of fire. I opened the door, and ask'd what was the matter; he was below; he told me there was a fire below; I ask'd where; he said, in the back-parlour. I went directly to my Lady, and got her out of bed, and went down stairs; there I saw a great smother in the room. I staid in the house till the fire was all out. The bureau was brought to my Lady; she desired it to be carried to my Lord Faulconbridge, where it was taken and lock'd up; only the back part of the bureau was burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner search'd?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. I did: there were 6 half-guineas, 3 guineas, 2 half-crowns, and a fourpenny-piece, found upon him. His knife was taken from him. I never saw that knife before that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the bureau was search'd?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. I was; I saw the purse and two bags taken out; the fire had singed them. This was after the bureau was brought back. There was no money in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner us'd to be slush of money?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. I never knew he had any money before this. Whenever he went to market for my Lady, I have given him money, and I have lent him a shilling.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100026"></xptr>Q. Is there a fire-place in the back-parlour?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. There is; but there had been no fire in it for a great while. My Lady kept no fire in her dressing-room at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was burnt?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. The wainscot and chairs were burnt, besides the back part of the bureau, and part of a stool covered with leather.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a window in the closet?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. There is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the bureau stand up to an outside or inside wall?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. It stood up to an inside wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of any fire coming through the wall from the next house?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the next house on fire?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any fire came down the chimney?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. No, the chimney was boarded up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a candle in your hand when you went to put my Lady's pin-cushion into the drawer?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. I had: the drawer that I opened is not burnt (the bureau produced in court; she goes and takes out the drawer).</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a wax or tallow candle?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. A tallow candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not something fall from that candle, so as to set the house on fire?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. I am satisfied nothing did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the pin-cushion after?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. I did; part of it was burnt that lay backwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put the candle out of your hand?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. I believe I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Catlin. What part of the next house does this closet join to?</p>
               <p>Catlin. The brick-work of the other house comes farther out than my Lady's; I don't know what room it joins to; one Mrs. Parrot lives in it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Catlin. What time did you go to bed that night?</p>
               <p>Catlin. I went to bed about 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a fire at that house at the time?</p>
               <p>Catlin. I never heard of any; the servants came to us the next day; they said nothing of a fire; there was no alarm of fire at that house.</p>

               <p>Herculous. It might be about a fortnight before the fire: he left the note with me; my master was not at home. When he came home in the evening, I told him; said he, I would have you go and see who is to pay it: I went, and found it was a man named Hartwell, that lived in a two-pair-of-stairs room. I desired my master not to discount it; so he said he would take my advice. When the prisoner came, I told him my master did not chuse to discount it: he said he was going into place at Lady Effingham's, and he had no money; so my master lent him six guineas upon the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they guineas or half-guineas?</p>
               <p>Herculous. To the best of my knowledge, they were guineas.</p>
               <p>(The note read; signed Readman Hartwell, dated 28th of March, payable the 18th of May).</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Howse. Look at that note.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Howse. This is the same note the prisoner brought me.</p>

            . I was present when the prisoner was search'd: I went with Justice Kynaston to Lady Effingham's house between 11 and 12 o'clock; we search'd all the servants, and found 6 halfguineas, 3 guineas, 2 half-crowns, and a silver groat, upon the prisoner at the bar: he had two returned him. We saw the bureau; it appeared to have been cut with something. so that it would open without unlocking it. The prisoner was asked how he came by that money; he said it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100027"></xptr> the money he had of Mr. Macavoy.

               <p>Q. to Catlin. Did the prisoner go out of my Lady's house from the fire's beginning to the discovery of the robbery?</p>
               <p>Catlin. I don't know that he did.</p>
               <p>Lady Effingham. I sent to the prisoner several times, but never saw him the time of the fire; I can't tell where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. to M. Davis. Who removed the bureau from the closet?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. That was removed immediately from the closet, as soon as it was quench'd, to the landing-place where my lady stood, but I can't tell by who, and after that into the yard.</p>
               <p>Lady Effingham I saw it with the flap open in the yard, before I sent it to my Lord Faulcon-bridge's.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take notice of it sooner to have it search'd?</p>

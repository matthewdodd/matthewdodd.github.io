Yes; I came up stairs from the kitchen, and attempted to unlock the parlour-door, but could not; I gave the door a pull towards me, and it pulled open; I saw two men, the prisoner and another, and was inclined to shut the door again on seeing them, but they rushed out upon me, and knocked me down. I fastened upon one of them, and pulled him down upon me; I did not see the features of the other that made his escape; the man I pulled down got up, and I with him, and we had another scuffle, he threw me down again at the passage-door, and ran away, but I got up and pursued him, and it proved to be the prisoner; he was taken in Hungerford-market, by

A bundle was found when I returned from the watch-house in the parlour, packed up in a blue apron,(produces it); I know all it contains to be mine, they had been removed from the shop into the parlour; all are here but a pair of small-clothes, which I let a customer have who was going out of town; the cloth is worth twenty-six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How had the men got into the house? - A. I think they must have got in by a pick-lock key, I did not see any mark of violence at all; a pair of shoes and a hat were left in the parlour, which the prisoner owned to be his, he would not own the blue apron; he was without hat or shoes when he was taken to the watch-house; the things in the bundle are worth more than five pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was any part of the house broke open, or any wards broken? - A. I apprehend the lock was picked; I fastened the house up myself between seven and eight o'clock.</p>

I am watch-house-keeper of St. Martin's in the Fields: On saturday morning, about ten minutes past six, on the 15th of October, I was shutting the door, and was going to bed, when I heard a noise in the street; I looked out, and saw Mr. Dowman and the prisoner, with some other person; I let them in, and observed the prisoner had no hat or shoes on; I searched him, and found in his right hand waistcoat pocket a little nutmeg-grater box.

               <p>Pilgrim. He was locked up; I took them to him, and shewed them to him, he owned them both; I told him to be sure they were his, but did not put them on.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you say any thing to induce him to own them? - A. No; as soon as he owned them, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180310260034"></xptr>told him he should not have them, but I would take them up stairs; he begged of me not to say any thing that he owned the shoes.</p>

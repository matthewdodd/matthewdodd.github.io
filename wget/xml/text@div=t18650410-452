Hickson I watched their premises on 10th February—about 7 o'clock in the evening I saw Betts leave—he came out with two other men—they walked a little way and then separated—I followed Betts to Fins<lb></lb>bury-square where he met Pretty—I then followed them to the Duke of Northumberland public-house, in Worship-street, where they remained about a quarter-of an hour—they came out together and went to Shoreditch, where they got into a cab and drove to the Greyhound public-house, Old Ford-road—Betts went into a house in Saunders-terrace, where he lives—he re<lb></lb>mained there about five minutes—he brought out a large parcel—he had no parcel when he went in—he took it to the public-house where Pretty was—they remained about five minutes, and then got into the cab, and were driven hack to Shoreditch—they separated at the top of Church-street—when they were in the public-house in Worship-street, I went in and saw Betts and Pretty sitting in the tap-room—I stood at the bar close by, and saw Pretty give Betts 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I watched Betts again on the 23rd February—I was in com<lb></lb>pany with police-constable Gater—I saw Betts leave the warehouse; his two side-pockets appeared very bulky—he went up Holborn, and turned down Southampton-row into Theobald's-road, where the prisoner Pretty met him—they went into the Red Lion public-house, in Crown-street—Pretty did not appear to have anything with him—they remained in the public-house about a quarter of an hour—they came out together—Betts's pockets were then flat to his side, and Pretty's were full—they only went a few steps</p>

Hicksou, and again on 22nd February—I stopped Pretty in Bocwell-court; I asked him what he had got in his pockets—he said, "Some leather, "and then pulled out some of these pieces of leather (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him where he had purchased them, and he said he had bought them of a man, but he refused to tell me his name, then afterwards he said he cut them oat himself, that he kept a little shop close by, and be would take us there if we would go—I told him that did not satisfy me, and I took him into custody—on the way to the station I asked, "Who was the man you were with in the public-house?"—he said he did not know who I meant; he did not know whether he had been in any public-house—afterwards he said he had been in one, which was the European, in the City, about 1 o'clock—when at the station 18 pairs of vamps were taken from him—I asked him how he accounted for the possession of them—he said he had bought them of a man who travelled, and had paid ready money for them—I think he said this after I had asked him whether he had got an invoice for them—I afterwards went to his shop, and found 10 more pairs of vamps, and borne pieces of skin—I produce what was found in the shop—I got this piece of leather (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Messrs.

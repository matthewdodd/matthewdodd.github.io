                  </hi>. I am a tar maker, of Harlesden Green—on 25th October I was going along with my wife, and the prisoner came and looked me in the face—I said "What are you looking at me for?"—he made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at my watch chain, and ran down a court—I picked him out among six others at the station, three weeks afterwards—I have no doubt he is the man—he has the same coat and waistcoat on now.</p>

               <p>in the course of two or three minutes—it was in Whitechapel—a great many people were passing and re-passing—I met a policeman, and he ran after the prisoner, but did not catch him—the prisoner has on the same fur waistcoat now—I did not describe his fur waistcoat to the policeman, but I did his coat and hat—I was too agitated to take notice of his waist<lb></lb>coat—my saying that it is the same is a little exaggeration and embellish<lb></lb>ment—I told the policeman he had a black coat, rather short—I did not give any other description of it—but I can swear to him among a thousand—I described his hat as rather a big sort of felt hat, turned up on each side, and that he was a man of dark complexion with a dark swarthy face—I am looking at him now—I said he was a man with no colour in his face, and rather brown—I did not say that he had got black eyes, or describe his tie—I did not tell my wife, going home, that I could not identify him—I said that I could—she was angry at my losing my watch, and gave me a curtain lecture that night, and said what an old fool I was—three weeks elapsed, and then a policeman came and told me that he had a man in custody who answered the description I gave—he was put among six others in the dock—they were common men—not more than two or three of them were policemen—they were dressed in fustian jackets—none of them were dressed like the prisoner—only one had a dark coat, and that was the prisoner—I live in the country and do not often come to Whitechapel—my wife did not say that it was no use her going to the station, as she could not identify the man, nor did she say that I could not identify him—she said that she knew that I could.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> She was looking in at a linen draper's shop at the time the robbery took place—I have not the least doubt about the prisoner, because I had a good look at his face before he snatched my watch—it was day<lb></lb>light.</p>

I took the prisoner on 17th November, at Bow Street Police Court—I told him I should take him on suspicion of stealing a watch and chain; that was in another case—going down in a cab he said "I hope you are not going to get it up for me?"—I said "What do you meant"—he said "Telling the prosecutor who I am, and how I am dressed"—I took him to the station, placed him with four or five coster<lb></lb>mongers and others, and the prosecutor picked him out without the slightest hesitation.—</p>

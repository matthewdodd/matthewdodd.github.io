               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I want to go to the Captain; he has wrote for me; my husband is a gentleman; he is settled at Boston in New England. I was taken up and put into prison among all thieves; Justice Fielding and Mr. Welch know me, and they want to send me to my husband. They call me a mad woman: I am not mad, only I am kept from my husband, who loves me as well as his own soul. Nobody knows I am here now, my Lord, but myself. I wanted to see you, and they would not let me: I went and broke the high constable's windows; there is money enough to pay my passage. I may as well be dead as alive. They put me in a goal in Moorfields three times for the same crime. I have been put in Newgate, and the Gatehouse. If they will produce a letter that the captain does not like me, I'll agree to be hanged. He allows me a lady's income.</p>
               <p>All the evidences being asked, declared she behaved in the same manner when she was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>The Jury believed her to be insane.</p>

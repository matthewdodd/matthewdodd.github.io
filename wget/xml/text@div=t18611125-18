                  </hi>. I am an oil merchant in Barking church-yard—the prisoner was in my employment as an errand boy, and was em<lb></lb>ployed about the shop—on 28th October, I left town for a few days—in a drawer behind the counter I left, among other things, a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—this is the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know it by my signature—on my return on 1st November, I found both the notes missing—from inquiries I made I found that a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note had been changed at Mr. Bentley's, a neigh<lb></lb>bours—immediately I missed the notes I spoke to the prisoner, and he disowned all knowledge of them—he said he knew nothing about it; he had never seen any note; what good were the notes to him; he could not change them—I then told him that he must know something of them, for no one else would hare gone to the drawer to take them out—the drawer was unlocked—it was a goods drawer behind the counter—it is not likely any one would go to it unless they had seen me place the money away; which the prisoner did, some fortnight before—he disowned all knowledge until the next day, Saturday—I then asked him to tell me what he bad done with the notes—he said he bad never seen the notes; what good were they to him—I challenged him with it three or four times; at last he owned that he had changed the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note at Mr. Bentley's—I then asked him what he had done with the money—he said he bad given it to a sailor to mind—I said that tale would not do—he then made two or threerother statements, that he had bought a purse and put the money into it, and had lost it on Tower-hill—at last he acknowledged that 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was hid in the cellar at his own house—I went there with him, and found four sovereigns and two halves on a beam in the cellar—I then asked if he had buried the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note there—he said, no he had not seen it—I gave him until the Monday to tell me where the note was, and he then said, "The dog brought the note down to me in the cellar, and I burnt it over the gas"—he then said he had hid it in the dust-hole, and after we had half-emptied that, he said he did not know anything of the note at all—I gave him into custody—the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note has not been found.</p>

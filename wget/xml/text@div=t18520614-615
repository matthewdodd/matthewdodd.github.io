                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Thomas Harrison; he is the landlord of the Cheshire Cheese, in Marquis-court, Drury-lane. On Friday morning, 14th May, the prisoner came between 12 and 1 o'clock—he asked for half a quartern of gin—he tendered me a shilling—I at first thought it was good, but I afterwards found it was bad; I showed it to a friend of mine who was there—whilst I was showing it, the prisoner ran off—he had drank part of the gin, but left half of it—I pursued the prisoner, and found him in a doorway in Pear-court—I spoke to him; he said he did not know me—assistance came, and he was taken—he struggled to get away—while he was struggling he put his hand to his mouth, and threw something away into the area of Mr. Gibbon, the baker; it sounded like money, and more than one piece—I gave the shilling which the prisoner gave me to the officer, after my husband had marked it—this is it—I had not lost sight of it, but kept it in my hand.</p>

            . I lodge at Mr. Hudson's. On Sunday the 15th of June, at five o'clock in the afternoon, I went out and returned about eight, when I missed the articles stated in the indictment; my watch was taken from the head of my bed, the rest of the things were in different places-some of them were in my burean, and others in the bed-room. I found five skeleton keys on my bed with the breeches, which were in the bureau before. The prisoner was at the watch-house before I came home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. My wife had the key of the bureau-it was broken open. I also found a chisel on the bed. I left my servant at home, she had the key of the door.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Lardner; he went out and left me in the front room, which was the sitting-room, I went down stairs and left the door locked, keeping the key in my hand. About seven o'clock I went up stairs again, and unlocked the door, but could not get in-it was bolted inside. I called Mr. Hudson's apprentice up, and he could not open it. I went down stairs, and stopped about three minutes with the apprentice, and then went up by myself, and found the door on the latch - I went in and found a large bundle behind the door - I called Mr. Hudson up. I did not go into the bed-room.</p>

             re-examined. Camp said she could not get into the room, I told her to stay in my kitchen-soon after she gave the alarm of thieves; I went into the front room and found the bundle, behind the door, and the things about the room, quite in confusion, and the skeleton keys at the foot of the bed; in about five minutes after I saw the prisoner in the custody of Thoroughgood, on the second-floor landing. My son was at home at the time.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a man who took me to the house, and told me to go up to the second-floor and whisper Harry, and tell him to come down - I did so, and as I returned a man met me, and said, "for God's sake run up and hide yourself!" which I did, for fear of the thieves.</p>

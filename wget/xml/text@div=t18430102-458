                  </hi>. I am a plumber and painter, and live in Store-street, Bed-ford-square. The prisoner was in my employ about two months—I have two houses in Bridgewater-square, which had been lately built—I had to do the plumbing, painting, and papering—there was a man and his wife taking care of the premises—I generally took the white lead in my cart, for the supply of the job—the prisoner was employed to work on the premises—there was a can there for the purpose of taking white lead to the job—my apprentice generally used to put the white lead up, and get it ready for me to take down in the morning—I took a pot of white lead down, weighing 28lbs.—I used to leave the prisoner, and had the white lead sent to him there, to use at the place—on the 13th of Dec. I looked at a white lead firkin, and noticed there wan deficiency—I made inquiries, and afterwards went to the job—I received in<lb></lb>formation there, which I communicated to the police—I went at five o'clock the same afternoon to Ann-street, Pentonville—I saw the prisoner there—I told him I had missed a quantity of white lead, and had every reason to be<lb></lb>lieve he had taken it—I said, "Perhaps you will permit me to look over your premises?"—he said, "If you wish to search my premises you may get a search warrant"—he shut the door—I waited about for a quarter of an hour—he then opened the door, and said, "Now you may search if you like"—I went to the station, and got a policeman—I came back, searched, and found the can, which I generally used in taking the white lead from my shop to the job, near the water-butt, in the yard—this is the can—it is mine—I found no white lead—he said he was going to take the can to the shop, to get white lead to use the next morning; but there was a sufficient quantity there—he need not have gone to the shop for white lead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Muggeridge. I was put into these houses to take care of them—the prisoner was there as painter—on the morning the prosecutor brought the white lead there, the prisoner went down into the kitchen in the evening, and took a quantity of lead out of the pot, put it into his basket, and went away—I watched him at the window go away from his work—I looked into the pot directly after he was gone, and observed half the pot of white lead that came in that morning was gone—I spoke to the prisoner, and he abused me for watching him—I told the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service. I remember the pri<lb></lb>soner's putting up some lead in the shop, to go to the premises in Bridgewater-square—he said I had not got the things down which he had taken there, and I had not kept the account right of what he had taken there—he said, "But it does not matter; Mr. Acocks told me to keep the account, you have no need to keep the account any longer"—I had kept the account till then—I did not keep the account after that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pork-butcher, and live in Shore<lb></lb>ditch. The prisoner Iliff is my apprentice—I received information from Wolfe on the 27th of September—I went through my back place out into the other street, and round into the stable occupied by Mr. Jeffs—I found Iliff and Flower there—I said there was meat there belonging to me—they both denied it—Iliff then went away on the errand on which he was sent—Flower then said, "Here is some meat of yours here; here is a leg of pork; take it home, make no noise about it; I will pay you for the leg of pork;" and then afterwards, when the officer had got the leg of pork, as Iliff, and Flower, and I were Walking to the station, Flower said, if I would not go to Court with him, his father would give me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am sure he first said there was no pork, and he afterwards produced the pork—it was mine—I had seen it safe about an hour and a half before.</p>

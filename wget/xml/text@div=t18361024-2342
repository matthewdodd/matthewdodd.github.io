I rent the front room second floor—James Thompson lodged in the same room, and left on Wednesday, the 12th of October,—The pri<lb></lb>soner lodged with me some time ago—he had left his place, and had not engaged a lodging, and I let him lodge with me without paying any things—on the 12th of October I let my room and padlocked my door—when I went home in the evening I found the padlock wrenched off and the door open—I missed a hat and coat of Thompson's—I had seen the coat in the portmanteau in the morning—I gave information at the police-office, and is consequence in the what I heard, I placed myself in Titchfield-street, to watch for the prisoner—I waited there till he came up the street—he had Thomp<lb></lb>son's coat on his back—he asked me what I was waiting for—I said I was waiting for the coat he had on—he said I should have it if I would allow him to go a little way to exchange it; he had left his own over the way at a friend's—I had before that found it there, and taken it home—he went with me to my room—he pulled off Thompson's coat, and the police<lb></lb>man came and took him—the hat was found over at his friend's in Titch<lb></lb>field-street—a silk handkerchief was pulled out of the coat pocket, belonging to Thompson—he said he had been playing at skittles on Wednesday, and got drunk, and they took his coat and hat from him, that he came and took these while he was tipsy, and he hoped we did not think he meant a make away with the property—I missed the coat at half-past six o'clock in the evening, and the prisoner was taken at half-past nine o'clock next morning—I got the prisoner's coat next morning, and took it to my</p>

The prisoner was in my service for fourteen months; I missed some money and marked four half-crowns, which I put into the till on the 9th or 10th of April - his business was to take money and give change, as it might be required; he would have access to the till; on the 12th of April in consequence of missing a sovereign, I sent for him up stairs, about eleven at night; I told him he was aware that money had been missed frequently, and I hoped he could give a good account of himself, and of what money he had belonging to him; he said he was innocent, he had in his box up stairs one sovereign, one half sovereign, and a few shillings - I asked to what amount? he said nearly a pound's worth of silver, but not 1l.; my brother-in-law was there; the prisoner brought his box down to the parlour, opened it, and took out his money in a bag, there was one sovereign, two half-sovereigns, seven half-crowns, two crowns, and 17s. 6d. in small silver - among the half-crowns I found one of those marked ones, which I had put into my till on the 8th or 9th - he said the money belonged to him; I said,"Can you say this half-crown belongs to you," at first he gave no answer, but he afterwards told me. -</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you make him any promise or threat? A. No, not before he made a confession; I did afterwards, relating to other money.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was the half-crown your property? A. Yes, and he at last said it was my money, or it might be my money - I asked him how he could account for there being more money than he had stated; he gave me no answer.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother-in-law. I was sent for to his house on the 12th of April; he mentioned that he had missed some money, and the prisoner was desired to bring his boxes down; he was asked what money he had, he said, a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and seven or eight shillings in silver; I asked if he was sure that was all; he said, there might be a shilling or two more - he then said there might be seventeen or eighteen shillings, but that was the utmost - there was found in the box a sovereign, two half-sovereigns, seven half-crowns and other silver; he said it was all his - Mr. Clarke took up a half-crown and said, "Is this yours?" he said, yes, but after a few minutes he confessed he had stolen it - I said, "Did you steal this half-crown from Mr. Clarke?" and he said, he did, but it was all he had stolen - Mr. Clarke said, "This is not all you have robbed me of you scoundrel;" he said, it was, but afterwards confessed it was not - he divided the silver and said part was his master's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When the prisoner was asked whether it was not his master's, was not his answer, it may be? A. Yes, several times he said, "It may be," but when I asked him if he had stolen it, he said, he did - my brother-in-law must have heard it, I think - I am not certain that Mr. Clarke asked him if he had stolen it, but I did, and he confessed to him and to me that he had stolen it - I am not acquainted with Bigg; I don't know that he is an acquaintance of my brother's - I understand the prisoner appeared against Bigg - my brother-in-law said he would prosecute the prisoner, but that was after he confessed - I don't remember Mr. Clarke saying, "If one goes the other shall" - I don't know whether the prisoner was taken up till he had appeared against Bigg. (see page 504).</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When, after the discovery of the half-crown, was the prisoner taken? A. I don't know; Mr. Clarke said he would send for an officer; I don't know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160075"></xptr>whether he did - I believe he appeared against Bigg about a fortnight afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKE. This is the half-crown I found in the prisoner's box, it is marked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Was any one present when you made this mark? A. No - I knew Bigg came to my house occasionally; I don't know Dovey; I did not say, "If one goes, the other shall," to my recollection - it was on the 12th of April I found the half-crown, and I brought this charge against the prisoner on the 2nd of May - I might have said they ought both to go.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What was the reason the prisoner was not taken before? A. I was to receive some further information about what I had been robbed of, I had not a doubt about the half-crown.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner had been with you some time? A. Yes, fourteen months; he had access to my till, and served my customers, but he was to give change from the trays, where we count up silver for that purpose - but sometimes he may have taken money from the till, or from his pocket.</p>

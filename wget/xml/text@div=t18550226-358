                  </hi>. I am shopman to Thomas Poppy, a draper, of No. 285, High Holborn. On 24th Feb., about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the pri<lb></lb>soner came, and asked me for a pair of gloves, as I was walking the shop; Mr. Blake supplied her with them—I heard her ask him for some silk for dresses—I undertook to serve her, the silk being my particular departments—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185502260050"></xptr>
               <p>showed her several dresses, and she selected one at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; she then wanted a body lining, and I showed her some slate Holland, for which I had to go to the other end of the shop, which is from fifteen to thirty yards off—I showed it to her, and she said, "I will have grey calico, instead of Holland, as it is warmer"—I had to go to the same place to get the calico; she bought two yards of it, and I then made out her bill, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I got the change from the cashier at the desk—when I took the calico back, Blake made a communication to me—after I had taken her money, Blake came up, and said, "We have every reason to believe you have a piece of silk concealed under your dress"—she was then sitting on rather a high chair, as near as she could well (get to the counter—when Blake said that, she immediately moved from her chair, and said, "Me got something?" and commenced to lift up her gown; there was a white skirt under it, then a black skirt, which she was attempting to move, and she flew forward, I thought, to <hi rend="italic">bolt</hi> out of the shop, and as she moved about a yard, I saw this silk drop from her dress—she had got it folded in a most ingenious manner—she was then about a yard and a half from the chair—I had not made up her parcel, and had placed her goods behind on a recess, and was going to send them home, but she said, "No"—the silks remained on the counter, and after I had finished searching her, I moved them two yards or two yards and a half lower down the counter—she rejected some of the silk, saying that it was too light for her sister—the silk is my master's property—here is the private mark on it—a policeman was sent for, and the prisoner given in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Poppy's employ. On Saturday afternoon last I was in the shop, and Eliza Lee made a communication to me, in consequence of which, about five minutes afterwards, I went to the prisoner and said, "We have every reason to suppose you have a piece of silk secreted about your person"—she said, "Me have a piece of silk!" and rose up—I said, "I must search you"—I lifted up her dress and her white skirt; under that was a black skirt, and on proceeding to lift that she shrank from me, saying, "Don't feel my legs," and immediately, by a jerk, she threw a piece of goods out from her dress, and shrank back two yards—I saw the silk come out from under her black skirt—I was quite prepared for it, because I had just felt it—I detained her till a constable came.</p>

               <p>thought to be the silk—I felt something which was inside her petticoat—there was one lady in the shop, being served—there were no females employed in that department, not within forty yards, and I was the only person disengaged—the silk was not more than a yard from the chair—I saw it not more than a few seconds after she got up—I was standing in front of her when I made the examination—Eliza Lee came up to see me search the woman—she was waiting to be served, and came down fifteen or twenty yards to inform me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HORRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the silk fall where she had been standing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, she threw it out—she sprang sideways, and then sprang back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Allen, of No. 18, Brownlow-street, Holborn. On Saturday last I was in Mr. Poppy's shop, and saw the prisoner there; Rudd was showing her some lining—I was sitting close to her, and while Rudd was at the end of the shop I saw her take a piece of silk off the counter, and put it under her petticoats—she then said to me, "Do not;" but whether she said, "Do not say anything," I do not know, as I am rather deaf—she showed me the silk, and asked me if they were pretty—I went down the shop, and told Blake what I had seen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was she sitting on the chair when she took it up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, she was standing up—I mean to say that I saw her lift her petti<lb></lb>coats, put the silk underneath, and sit down again, and then she showed me the dress she had bought, and asked me if it was pretty—I have been with Mr. Allen nine months.</p>

On the morning of the 12th of April, between one and two o'clock, I was in Great Suffolk-street—from information I received I hastened to the prosecutor's house—I saw both the prisoners there—Wheelwright had just come from the inside him<lb></lb>self, and seeing me, he called out to somebody inside, "Look out, look out!"—I was within two paces of him—he ran across the street—I collared another, as he came out of the door, but he got away—Kidney followed that second man as he came out—he had no hat or cap on—the three attacked me, and prevented my sounding my rattle—they knocked it all to pieces, and sprained my hand—I knew them by sight before—I distinctly saw their faces—I saw the prisoners in custody next day, and knew them—I examined the door, and saw marks of a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> on it—I found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> a few yards from the door—there were marks on the sash of the door, corresponding with this.</p>

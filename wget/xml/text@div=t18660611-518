                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 174). On Sunday morning, 20th May, about half-past 2, I was on duty in the City-road, and saw the two prisoners coming from the front gate of 355, City-road—there is a garden in front—I followed them to the corner of Sydney-street—they went up the right-hand side of Sydney-street to Sydney-grove—Probert went down Sydney-grove for about a minute—he then came up—Pulley (Nye) came about thirty yards and crossed the road, stooping as if he was picking something up to throw at a window, as if he wanted to get in—he gave the name of Pulley—he then turned round, and walked up the left-hand side of the street, about forty yards, saying to Probert, who was on the right-hand side, "Good night, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>; I am going home "—I followed them till I could see assistance, to the top of Sydney-street—Nye crossed over the road to Probert—I saw an in<lb></lb>spector and two constables coming up—I called out, "Stop those fellows"—Probert went away to the left, and Nye turned sharp to the right—they were both taken into custody—I afterwards went back to 355, City-road, and found the front door open—I called the inmates up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There are a number of trees in front of this house, are there not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Probert went down the grove—I did not stop them, because I knew I could not catch them both—I have not stated to anyone that the reason I did not stop them was because I was attending to a drunken woman—I will swear that—there was a woman in the street—I was not attending to a drunken woman; not at that time—I had seen a drunken woman previously on my beat; not for some time before—I have been in the force twelve months in July, I think—the garden in front of this house is ten or twelve yards long, from the front door to the gate.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, G</hi>). On this Sunday morning, I was standing at the end of Sydney-street, Goswell-road, and saw both the prisoners—they were on the right-hand side, at the end of Sydney-grove, coming towards Goswell-road—I saw Probert cross over to the end of Sydney-place—Nye turned round into the Goswell-road, to the right—about a minute after, Probert came out from the end of Sydney-place, and called out," <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, are you going home?"—Probert ran across the road, in the direction the other prisoner had gone—immediately afterwards, I heard some person in the street call out, "Stop them"—Probert was followed by a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186606110026"></xptr>
               <p>constable, and brought back—I followed, and went after Nye, and brought him back—I went with him to the station, and then went to 355, City-road—I found the drawers in the kitchen partly open—the back kitchen window was open, and the entrance had been effected that way—you could get to the back of the house by getting over two gates and two walls—I should think the walls are about seven feet high, or a little more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you quite sure it was Probert that called out, "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> are you going home?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am quite positive—what the last witness spoke to, occurred before I came up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Probert. Q.</hi> After we were charged, did you not ask a constable to look at our trousers to see if they were torn in getting over the walls, or any<lb></lb>thing of that kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the toes of your boots were all over mortar, as if they had been over the walls, and I took their boots off to see if any marks in the garden would correspond with them—they did not—there were some foot-marks, but the garden was dry—it was a smaller foot; no doubt one of the children who lived in the house.</p>

I was on duty on this Sunday morning, in Goswell-road—I saw Probert run up Windmill-street, and I turned round back again, and followed him up Spencer-street into North<lb></lb>hampton-square—he was stopped by another constable, and I escorted him to the inspector—coming back I came down Spencer-grove, and picked up these two pair of boots, about ten yards down the grove—it was nowhere near where I saw Probert—it was eighty to a hundred yards away.</p>

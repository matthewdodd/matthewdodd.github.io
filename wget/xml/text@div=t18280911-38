On the 28th of July I was possessed of the monies stated in the indictment - the silver was in a galley-pot and coffee-cups; it was all in one large box, which was not locked, in a drawer, in my first floor room; I saw it in the morning of the 28th of July, between nine and ten o'clock - I counted it over on Sunday morning, the 27th; there were then 66 sovereigns; I added two to them on Monday - it all appeared right then; I locked the drawer, and had the key in my possession. On the 29th, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, my wife told me the drawer was open; I got out of bed, found it open, and the money gone - I slept in that room; the lock was forced, and nothing but a shilling and sixpence left; the prisoner lives in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110035"></xptr>neighbourhood - I have seen him at the house at different times.</p>

On Monday evening, the 28th of July, I was by my own gates in the lane this public-house is in - my gates are about forty yards from the Coach and Horses; I saw the prisoner, whom I knew well, pass my gates, about a quarter before nine o'clock, towards Sharp's house, with a man, named Bamford; I did not notice whether he went into the house - the entrance to it was in my sight.</p>

            . On the 28th of July, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I went into Sharp's house, and saw the prisoner standing in the passage, between the bar and parlour doors - I knew him; I went into the parlour to see for a person, who was not there; I came out, and he was still there; I went home, returned in about ten minutes, and saw the prisoner let himself out of Sharp's bed-room window; as I went up to him I said,"Tom, what are you up to?" he never spoke to me, but walked away as fast as he could - nobody was with him; the shutters and doors were shut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Of course you went to the house, and told them? A. I did not - I was sober, and had been hard at work all day.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason you did not tell the people of the house directly? A. It is such a dangerous place, it is not safe to say anything - I was never charged with anything; I once took a bit of becon out of a neighbour's house out of a lark; they never threatened to prosecute me; the house was open between nine and ten o'clock at night - I said, "I will just play you a bit of a lark," and took it; they came before I was up in the morning, and asked if I had taken it - I said I had; it belonged to one Weller who worked with my husband; I took it to cantion him - it was in the kitchen, as soon as you open the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason you did not go before a Magistrate? A. I was afraid of saying anything, but I am obliged to come forward now, because I mentioned it; I did not know they were robbed when he came out; it is not a high window - it is on the first floor; I was within about a dozen yards of the door; I knew he did not belong to the house; I did not like to give information, as there are so many men in the place who would not mind killing anybody - there is a bad set in the town.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did the prisoner do when he came out of the window? A. He ran as hard as he could up the lane; I did not know what he had been about; he lives in the town somewhere - no constable came to me about the bacon.</p>

            . I am a waterman, and so is the prisoner. On Monday evening, the 28th of June, I saw him come down by the water-side, a little after seven o'clock - he staid there till near eight, then went towards Richmond - he told me he was going there, and I ferried him across the water and left him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long was he with you? A. From seven o'clock till near eight, on the Middlesex side of the river, above a mile from Richmond bridge; I took Henry Farnell over the water at the same time; I am sure it was the 28th of June.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. The robbery was in July.</p>
               <p>Witness. It was July; I heard of the robbery next morning.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. On Monday evening, the 28th of July, at a quarter to ten o'clock I saw the prisoner at the Talbot tap at Richmond; I pulled my watch out when he came in; I was going home, but waited, and he came out with me at a quarter past eleven; we had two or three pots of beer together; I left him at the door and went home - he went over the bridge. George Taylor was there.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How far is Richmond from the prosecutor's? A. About two miles, I suppose - I do not know the house myself: Thomas Rose was in my company, and the prisoner and a young woman he brought with him - he paid 6d. for a pot of beer - he did not produce any more money; Taylor was to have come there, but did not: John Smith and several people were at the Talbot.</p>

            . I live as porter at a druggist's at Richmond. On the 28th of July, at five minutes to ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the Queen's Head public-house at the foot of the bridge, and spoke to him - I did not see the last witness enter the house, but he was in the tap, for I was there myself; the prisoner came down the hill.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At what time did you see the other man in the tap? A. About seven o'clock: I had not agreed to go to the tap, nor told anybody I was going there; I saw no young woman with the prisoner - I came out of my master's house, which is opposite the Talbot, and saw him, at five minutes past ten o'clock - I am sure it had struck ten.</p>

            . I am gate-keeper at the Duke of Northumberland's at Zion House. I was at Sharp's on the night of the 28th of July, from half-past seven till half-past twelve - the prisoner was not there while I was; I was in the tap-room and parlour several times - as to Mrs. Hillier, she would swear to any one for a glass of liquor - she is a noted character; Bamford was in the par<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110037"></xptr>lour, and went away a few minutes before I did - he was not absent unless he went out for a temporary purpose.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether he was absent a short time, you cannot say? A. I am sure he was not absent more than five minutes, for I was playing a civil game of cards with him, Neal, and several more, and could not go on without him: we played at Put and several games - four play at that game.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the four? A. There was Allen, Rose, Neal and Child; they played for steaks, and after that game was over, we all had a civil game to ourselves - Bamford played, and the other witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they there the whole time the play was going on? A. Yes, all but Neal; he went after the steaks, when they were lost: they began playing for steaks about eight o'clock - Neal went after them, and was not gone more than a quarter of an hour - there is a passage to the house; a person can go up stairs without coming into the parlour, I suppose - Baylis and Fisher were there, and could see the game of cards - the house was full of people.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you recollect the night the robbery happened? A. Yes; I am sure it was on that night - I heard of the robbery next night.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time did you go for the steaks? A. About five minutes before eight o'clock; I was one of the party that played - I think we began to play about seven o'clock: Rose, Allen, Giles and I played - Hamford, Tayler and the others were not in the house then; we played at Put for nearly an hour - there was nobody but us four in the room when we played for the steaks; I am sure of that: when I returned with the steaks, we eat them as soon as they were cooked: there were several persons in the room when I returned, all at cards, nearly: there were two tables and they played at each - they played while we eat the steaks.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Were you in the room when he went for them? A.

               <p>MRS. SHARP re-examined. Q. Was the shutter of your bed-room closed, when you went to bed? A. Our bed-room window was fastened down in the evening, about seven or eight o'clock, but when I went to bed, the window of the room he got in at, was up - that was not our bed-room, but one on the same floor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your money was in the bed-room? A.

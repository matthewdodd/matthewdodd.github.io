                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Smith-street, North<lb></lb>ampton-square, Clerkenwell—the prisoner had been a servant. On the 27th of November, she came to my house about a cloak which she had given me the order for—she was in the kitchen—I missed a coat about two hours after she was gone—no one had been in in the meantime—it was missed from the passage, through 'which she went to go out—I have seen it since—her cloak was to be completed by the Wednesday following, but she never called for it—I afterwards met her in Bishopsgate, and charged her with stealing my coat—she denied it—on going to the station she told me she had taken it, and begged me not to prosecute her—she told me it was pledged at Mr. Attenborough's, at the corner of Sun-alley, Bishops<lb></lb>gate-street—I asked her for the duplicate—she said she had unfortunately burnt it with some other things—I had not made her the slightest pro<lb></lb>mise.</p>

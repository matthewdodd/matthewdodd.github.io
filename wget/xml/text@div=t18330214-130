The prisoner lodged in my attic for about seven months; she had a small income- while she was there I missed monies from time to time, and on the Tuesday before she was taken, I marked eight sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, four half crowns and twenty shillings; I marked them on one side, and Mr. Watts marked them on the other - I put them in a wardrobe in my bed-room, where the prisoner had no business; and on the Monday following I missed three half-sovereigns and two half-crowns, (I had missed two sovereigns on the Wednesday before this) I sent for an officer and went up stairs with him to her room; I told her I had come about a very unpleasant business, I had lost three half-sovereigns; that there had not been any person in the room, and I suspected she had taken them - she seemed indignant, and said it was false; the officer asked to look at what money she had, and she gave him two of my half-sovereigns; he saw that they were marked and said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140062"></xptr>"They will do;" he put them into his pocket - he then asked her for the other - she said she had not got it, but while she was putting some things into her box, this other half-sovereign fell from her person or her hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Now be careful, did you say to any body that if the prisoner would give up her gold watch and trinkets you would not appear against her? A. No; I said if she had shown contrition, and offered me a recompence, I should not have pressed it, but I did not say I would not appear - I did not make any proposal that she should give up her gold watch.</p>

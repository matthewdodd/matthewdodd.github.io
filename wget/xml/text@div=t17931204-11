               <p>I am an officer at the Police Office, Shoreditch. On the 17th of November, about eight o'clock, I was coming down Cherry-tree Alley into Golden lane, along with Harper, and I stopped the prisoner Collyer, Bowyer then being close by the side of him, Mr. Harper secured him; I took this hand saw from under Collyer's coat, which he said he found; I took him into custody, and he was taken to the Justice the next day, and the man knew it to be his, and I was bound over.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Has the saw been in your possession ever since? - Yes, it has been in the office, but it has got my name on it, and the day of the month I put it on that night.</p>
               <p>Court. When you stopped this man, did you see the saw under his coat? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing about him? - It was through the bundle that Bowyer had, that I took hold of Collyer, seeing Harper lay hold of Bowyer.</p>

             sworn,</p>
               <p>I am a police officer. Armstrong and I were coming along, and we heard the two prisoners talking in the alley; seeing Bowyer with a bundle, I laid hold of him, and Armstrong of the other; he had this bundle under his left arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing on the prisoner Bowyer? - Yes, I took these three planes from under his arm, they were tied up as they are now in this here apron; we took them into custody, and as it was Sunday, they had not their hearing till Monday, and then they were committed for trial; I have kept the planes ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. One of the prisoners is a carpenter, is he not? - I don't know that he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Have these things been in your possession ever since? - Only they have been in the office, but they were in a place, where I believe no one else has been.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible you can be sure that no other person had access to them; was the place looked? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then any other person might have access to them? - It was a place that belonged to the office.</p>
               <p>Court. How many people might go to that place? - The officer, the office keeper, and justice.</p>
               <p>Q. That is three people.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put no mark on them at all? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that they are the same? - I could not, but I have not a doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing Mr. Armstrong had carried another half dozen of planes, could you have distinguished them from these? - No, I could not, but I am sure it is the same apron, I tied it up myself.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you took the prisoner with that bundle, what conversation ensued? - None, only taking them into custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. You have already stated two or three persons had access to this place; now a great multitude of persons go in and out of the Public Office, you know that, as well as I. It is possible that any person being so disposed, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040032"></xptr>going in in a disorderly and improper manner, might have gone into this place where these things laid? - It is not impossible, but it is quite in a private place, where the justices go.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prosecutor. I see in the indictment there is a jack plane, have you it there? - No, nor the pannel plane; I lost all the property in the indictment, but this iron tenant saw, is the only thing that has been found; the pines now produced do not belong to me; this saw to the best of my knowledge, is the saw that I lost, I know the maker's name on the plate.</p>

On the 13th of October the prisoner came to our house - I am positive as to his person. I opened the door; he brought a great bunch of keys in his hand, and said he was sent to fit a key to a lock. I asked who sent him? he said he was sent by Mr. Extine, who was a smith, and lived in Gray's Inn-lane. I asked how Mr. Extine knew I wanted a key to a lock? he said Mr. Extine had seen my husband in the square and he had sent him. I looked at him, and said</p>

I have no doubt of his being the man. On the 15th of October I went out about eleven o'clock, and left the articles stated in the indictment in the front and back parlours. I locked the doors, and took my servant girl, named Pearson, with me. I gave her the key and sent her home for some bread and cheese. I had a lodger named

            . I am near thirteen years old. I was servant to Mrs. Wells in last October, and went out with her the day the house was robbed. She sent me home with the key, I opened the door, and went into her room - it was near one o'clock; everything was then safe; the time-piece was on the front parlour mantle-piece. I locked the room door after me, and saw a man come down to the bottom of the one pair of stairs with a light coat on, I do not know whether it was the prisoner or not. I went out - I did not notice the front parlour door, as a door leads from the back room to it. Mr. Wells came home before I went out. I took the key to Mrs. Wells. The outer door of the house was only latched. The man asked me if Mrs. Wells was at chambers? I said Yes. He asked me to lend him a chair and a hammer; I got them out of the back parlour, and gave them to him, he returned them directly. I put them in again, and locked the door.</p>

            . On the 19th of August I was in the house in North-street, at work, when the officers came; Mr. Horsefall, the owner of the house, had employed me there - I saw the prisoner there. On the day before he had come, and told me he had taken the house of my master, and on the 19th he wanted to come in - he said he wanted to bring his goods in. He followed me up to Tottenham-street in the morning, said he had a load of goods, and wanted to have possession - this was on the 19th - he came to me, and said he wanted the key, he had a load of goods at the door. I said I had the key, but would not give possession till my master ordered me. I saw my master, opened the door, and let them put their goods in - the prisoner owned the goods, and helped to carry them in - it was then about nine o'clock; the house was empty before that. The officers came about four o'clock in the afternoon. I saw the prisoner there five minutes before - he had his coat off then. I did not see him go out, but he left his coat behind him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you see him again - A. Not till I saw him at Hatton-garden. I have been in the house every day since till now. He helped to carry the goods in - there were boxes and bedsteads. The officers found no man in the house, except one, who was at work. I was not there when they first came. I was gone for a ladder. They found a great many picklock keys and a crow in the two parlours, which the prisoner said he should occupy while the house was being done. I had a deal of conversation with him, and am sure he is the man.</p>

I knocked at the door on the second floor - they would not open it, but did at last. I went in, and found the two women, who were tried and acquitted the night before, with another woman and a man. I searched and found the prisoner under the bed, and took him out - he immediately began to fight to get from me. I got him to the head of the stairs, he held by the bannisters, they gave way, and we fell down stairs together - he made a violent resistance, and the persons with him assisted him. When I had locked him up I returned, and all the parties were gone. I found some skeleton keys there, and some in the privy.</p>

            . I was tried here last Session. The prisoner married my sister. I came from Edgware, and had been staying with her for two months before we were taken up. The table-cloth produced was my mother's - there is a darn in it which I did myself about six months ago, when I was in the country. My mother died about ten months ago, it was then given to me; I marked it with my sister's name before I left the country, and when I came to town I gave to her. I marked it six months before I gave it to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know anything of the time-piece - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you - A. That time-piece was brought to me by a young man when I lived at New Haggerston - he kept me company for two years; he gave it to me about two months before I was taken up, which was on the 18th of August; I do not know what has become of him - he promised me marriage. I have not seen him since we removed to Pentonville. He brought a box to our house in Cross-street, City-road - he said it was full of china, and I was to take care of it till he called again; we moved to Pentonville next day, and took the box with us - he came there that day, and opened it, but I did not see into it - he put the time-piece into the box then; he was there when the officers came, about four o'clock, and got out of the kitchen-window.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he open the box and put the time-piece in - A. At Cross-street; the box was not touched after it got to Pentonville till the officers came. I believe they found the time-piece in the box. I have not seen the man since.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODERICK. Q. What was his name - 
               <persName id="t18201028-66-person719">A. George Brown</persName>
            . When the officers came I said I knew nothing about the time-piece, that was not true. I was at Iron-monger-row when the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go quietly - A. He wanted his hat. I did not help him to resist; he did not resist, only wanted his hat; they pulled the banisters down in getting him away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at Pentonville when you was taken up - A. He breakfasted there in the morning. I will swear he was not there in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man at the bar help East in with the goods - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he did not help to unload the cart - A. My brother; Yes, he did help, I did not know whom you meant.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You are not unacquainted with the bar, whom did you think was meant - A. The person who came with the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. The goods belonged to your brother - A. Part of them; there was a sofa which the young man brought me at Haggerston. I will swear the prisoner was not in the house after twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did he not escape out of window, and leave his coat behind him, when they came - A. No; he went out in a blue coat I did not see the things found by the officer till they were produced at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did the young man put the time-piece in the box, when he had given it to you - A. He asked me for it.</p>
               <p>ROBERT EAST re-examined. The prisoner, his wife, and last witness, were at the house; there was not a soul came there besides her before the officer came, except my fellow-workman. I was putting a water shoot up in front of the house. Nobody could come in or go out without my seeing them.</p>

            . I found a box there, containing watches, a quantity of seals, and about six dozen and a half of pencil-cases, but no china; there was a silver milk-pot, cut up, some miniatures, and a number of other things. I opened them in the presence of Griffiths; a time-piece was there, but not the one produced, that was on the mantle-shelf.</p>

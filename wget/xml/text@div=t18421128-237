                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Victor Dumar, an importer and dealer in French shoes, in Regent-street. On the 23rd of Sept. a person named William Clark called, and asked me to show him some French goods—I asked if it was for wholesale or retail, he said wholesale that he was living at Epsom, and had a large shop there—he had dealt in English shoes, but his customers had wanted French goods, and he came in, seeing Mr. Dumar's name on the door—he said he should require 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, as a sample of each sort—he said, "What are Mr. Dumar's terms?"—I said, "Ready money, with two and a half discount, or three months' credit; we must have a refer<lb></lb>ence, if we give credit"—he said, "I can give you a very good reference, one that I am sure you will be satisfied with"—he then handed me a bill, with "Thomas Hamer, 20, Bread-street-hill" on it—he requested that Mr. Durnar would go on the following morning, before eleven o'clock, for the reference, as Mr. Hamer was then most likely to be in the way—on the next day I went to No. 20, Bread-street-hill—I asked for Mr. Hamer, and the prisoner Morris said, "I am Mr. Hamer"—I saw the name of Thomas Hamer on the side of the door—I said Mr. William Clark, of Epsom, had referred Mr. Dumar to him, as to his capability of paying for goods—he said, "Yes, I know Mr. Clark very well indeed"—he said that he had served him with goods ever since he had opened his shop, and had always found him very punctual in his payments, his bills were always taken np before they were due, at the end of six weeks or two months—he said, "What kind of goods are they?"—I said, "French boots and shoes"—he said, "Of course they are of the first quality; because I know that Clark's customers are all gentlefolks; there are a great many gentlemen's seats about Epsom, which of course you are aware of"—I asked if we could give credit with propriety—he said, "Cer<lb></lb>tainly, without the slightest danger"—I said, "Has he been established long"—he said, "Somewhere about three years"—there was a counting-house and a warehouse—I did not look further—I thought, from the appearance, he was a very extensive merchant—when I went back, on the same day, Clark called again—he said, "Have you called on Mr. Hamer this morning?" I said, "Yes, I called on him, and Mr. Dunn was perfectly satisfied with the character he has given you"—before he went away he had eighteen pairs</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gate-keeper, in the service of the St. Kathe<lb></lb>rine's Dock Company. On Saturday, 17th Nov., at a quarter before four o'clock, I was keeping the gate, and the prisoner came up; he is a labourer in the employ of the Company—he asked if I had a pass for any samples of coffee going out—I told him "No"—he went away, and came again in about five minutes with Bays and Toomey; they had a pass for twelve samples of coffee—I examined the bag the prisoner was carrying, and found in it four sample-bags; three of them were mentioned in the pass, and this one (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) which weighed about twenty pounds of Ceylon coffee—it is worth about 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound, without the duty—on the three bags which were to be passed there was a tally-mark, and on this there was no tally-mark as there would be in the usual course of business on the samples to be passed, or else on the paper—I asked the prisoner how he came by this bag; he said he did not know anything about it, the bag was the same as was given to him—Bays was there, he said he did not know anything about the bag; that he did not put that bag into the prisoner's bag.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer in St. Katherine's Docks. On Satur<lb></lb>day morning, 17th Nov., I was in the "F" warehouse, drawing samples of coffee—I prepared twelve samples—it was necessary to obtain a pass for them—before I obtained the pass, I put on each bag that I drew a corres<lb></lb>ponding label, showing what each bag represented—the prisoner was em<lb></lb>ployed as a general labourer, running a truck or doing anything—part of that day he was making bags—I finished ray samples about half-past two; I then had my account to make out, to take to the brokers—I went for my pass about a quarter or twenty minutes past three—the twelve samples were enough for three men to carry—I divided them into three parcels; I gave the prisoner three, Toomey two, and I took on myself the charge of the other</p>

               <p>seven—I did not give the prisoner any more than three, and I did not give him any but those I had sampled, and on which T had placed the labels—I put the three samples into the prisoner's bag myself—there was no fourth parcel in the bag—I left the warehouse about twenty minutes past three, to go to the gate, but I was detained—the prisoner left about twenty minutes before I did, and he went through the western division of the warehouse—he would there have an opportunity of filling a sample-bag, if he had been so minded—when I got to the gate, I found the prisoner there; his bag was placed down, and he was walking by himself—I presented to the gate<lb></lb>keeper a pass for twelve samples—I saw the prisoner's bag opened; it contained the three samples which I had put in the bag, and one besides—I had not given him any other bag than the three, nor permitted him to take any other—I am not aware how he possessed himself of the fourth bag—the gate-keeper said, "How many ought you to have?"—I said, "Twelve; I have got seven, the other man two, and the prisoner three"—the gate-keeper said," There is another"—the prisoner then endeavoured to secrete this bag behind him—I took it from him—I heard him tell the gate-keeper that he knew nothing of it, that it was given him—I denied it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter in the employ of the St. Katherine's Dock Company. On Saturday, 17th Nov., I was employed with Bays in the "F" warehouse—it was my duty to check the samples before they were taken out of the warehouse—I checked twelve samples with him; I saw him label them—he took seven himself, gave Toomey two, and three to the prisoner—I saw the bags before they were brought there—when the three samples were given to the prisoner there were no other samples in the bag—the prisoner held the bag up while Bays put the samples in—directly the prisoner got them, he took a direction towards the western-end of the warehouse—he had an opportunity of filling a sample-bag with coffee—there were a hundred bags open at the time—Bays and Toomey waited to get the account—they did not go out by the same staircase that the prisoner did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an extra labourer in the St. Katherine's Docks.

As soon as I saw him, I said he will not do for me. I said, may-be he may be worth four pounds, and her best way was to take him to the market on the morrow. She asked me if I would give her three pounds ten shillings for him ? I said I would not buy him. She asked me if I could recommend her to a friend?

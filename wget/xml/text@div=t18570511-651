                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of John Hopkins and others—we are drapers and silk mercers in Shoreditch—the prisoner has been in our employ seven or eight years as shop walker—he was a person in whom con<lb></lb>siderable confidence and trust was reposed—he was the most confidential person we employed—in consequence of some information that was conveyed to me, I asked him whether he had any objection to my going to his house at Norwood—his wife keeps a shop there—he was in the habit of purchasing goods in our establishment from time to time—on his purchasing them it would be the duty of the clerk to enter them in our books—he had no authority to take any goods without their being reported by him to me or our clerk, and their being entered—there is one clerk in particular, Mr. Harber, to whom always it was his duty to state the goods he was about to purchase, and it was Mr. Harber's duty to enter them in the book that the prisoner had—without that the prisoner had no right to take them away—I accompanied the prisoner to his shop at Norwood—it is respectable, but comparatively a small one—I went with our clerk, Mr. Harber, and he took his book with him, which contained the prisoner's account—on entering the shop, I gave the prisoner's wife to understand that I had some painful busi<lb></lb>ness to state respecting her husband—that I had to bring a very grave charge against him, and I should be very glad if I could be satisfied as to the nature of the charge—I came down to the shop, and I took down from a line seven shawls—I folded them up, and I said to Mr. Harber, "Just turn to the account, and see if these are entered"—he did so, and he stated,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185705110154"></xptr>
               <p>"They are not entered"—I said, "Be particular; loot again"—he looked again, and handed the book to me, and said, "Do you look, Sir"—I did so, and they were not entered—the remark was then made to the prisoner, "How can you account for these?"—he said, "I suppose they were entered as dresses"—T said, "See if you can find anything to correspond with these"—he did, but he could not—we made a further search, and found these gloves, which I immediately recognised as our property—we examined the account, and these gloves had not been entered to the prisoner—I saw the gloves found under the window board in the window—I said to the prisoner, "Can you explain this?"—he could give me no account—he did not say anything—there were other articles found—some silk handkerchiefs, some muslin trimmings, and a quantity of ribbons—the prisoner was not present when the ribbons were found; they were found on a second visit—on the first examination I offered the book to the prisoner, and said, "Will you search for yourself)"—that was with reference to the handkerchiefs and shawls—I think he looked in the book—he did not show me any entry at all—it was on 22nd April I went to Norwood—the goods are here—I have looked at them, and can swear to them—here ore our special tickets on them—if we had sold these things, these tickets would be removed—here is the private mark in my own handwriting—I have never sold these goods to the prisoner—on these gloves here is our private mark—here is a peculiarity about the tops of these gloves which has only been introduced in the market since Feb., and we have not entered any gloves to the prisoner since Nov.—these gloves came into our stock in Feb.—these silk handkerchiefs have our mark on them—I never sold any of these goods to the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The ribbons were found in the library at your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not mention them to the prisoner—we had one clerk who died—I think another did not leave us lately—when we reached the shop at Norwood the prisoner said, these must have been entered as some other articles—it was the custom in our shop, when any person purchased anything, to bring the goods to Mr. Harber to enter them—I did not hear that many did not do that in the prisoner's time—I know there are many errors made—the prisoner did not say, that very often when he purchased goods, a piece of paper was put over for me to sign—he has been in our employ seven or eight years—he has laid out large sums of money with us—on the morning when I asked him whether I might go to Norwood, he immediately said, "Yes"—he did not know at that time that Mr. Harber was going with him—he knew it afterwards—we all went together—I went up first to speak to his wife—he was present—I wished him to be present with his wife, which he was—there was not a policeman there—the prisoner staid in the room the whole time, a quarter of an hour—when I went down, I observed these shawls hanging in the shop—there were the private marks on them, they are on pieces of card—there are no shawls entered in the book similar to these—there are three shawls entered, but very different to these—they were Paisley shawls, and these are tissue shawls—these gloves were under the window board.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose the wife was very much excited? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought she was—I had not been away from my duty before this—I had been out occasionally—my duties were rather increased by the death of a clerk, whose name was Middleton—he made entries when I was absent—that would happen about once a month—there is one other person, who would have to enter when I was out; his name is O'Neil—no other person would enter—there was one other, of the name of Boyes; he has made two or three entries—if he made them, he made them in course of his duty, which prevented other persons from "masking them—the prisoner purchased between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods in the last twelve months—he may have paid 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>the prisoner asked to have some, and he selected about twenty bunches—he said, "Make a list of them, and keep them for me"—I made the list, and kept it till he had some more goods about a week afterwards; and as he was having more goods, I gave the list to Harber.</p>

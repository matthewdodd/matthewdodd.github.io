               <p>JAMES WHITWELL.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DANIELS. Q. Did you ever see Brooks at the stable? A. Never.</p>

            . My house joins Hoskins' stable - I recollect a horse being brought there one Saturday night in May, and I never missed one horse out of the stable the whole week; I heard the noise of is being brought in about ten o'clock at night, as I sat in my house, but did not go out to see - it was taken out of the stable by the officers, on the Sunday week after that; I heard nobody; I only heard the horse stamp - it was very soon put into the stable; I could not judge whether one or two persons put it in - I heard nothing but the horse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.This has been a stable a long<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080072"></xptr>time? A. I believe so, but there had been no horses in it for a long time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Had you noticed any horses taken there before? A. No - on the following Saturday I saw one led to the door, and one come up in a chaise; they were both taken into the stable about three o'clock - the one tied up seemed very dirty.</p>

            . On Saturday, between three and four o'clock, a tall gentleman, named Fred, employed me to clean two horses, which he pointed out - they were very dirty and fatigned; there was a third mare in the stable - I did not notice whether she was in foal; she was clean and I did not notice her - I went there again on Sunday, and fed and cleaned the two again; Fred had given me the key on Saturday afternoon - Brooks was not with Fred at the time he hired me; there was a person with him, but it was not either of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DEVERELL gave the same evidence as before.</p>
               <p>RICHARD HORTON. I live at Shadwell-market. I know Hoskins' stable in Pope's-hill. On the 23rd of May, I saw a young man ride away from there with a mare, about a quarter-past nine or nine o'clock, but I cannot tell who it was - I cannot swear it was Parker; I saw the young man undo the stable gate - I will not be sure that it was Parker; it was a brown mare, with a white spot on the off side, and blind with both eyes - I knew her to be Holmes' mare, having seen her several times; he put a saddle and bridle on her - I saw him walk up and down the hill once or twice, but cannot say it was Parker; I did not know him before - the officers came soon after, and I went with them to look after the mare.</p>

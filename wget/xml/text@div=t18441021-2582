                  </hi>. I am a coal-porter. I live in what is called the Square, in Old-town, Clapham—North-street is further up than that—I am in the employ of Mary Ann Harvey—last Tuesday week, between six and seven o'clock, I was in her coal-cellar, and was struck with a stone—it was thrown down in the cellar at me, and I was struck on the arm and on the shoulder—I did not see the prisoner throw the stone—when I went out with my goods afterwards, I saw the prisoner in Walker's toy-shop—I pulled him out, and shook him—I told him it was for throwing a stone at me in the cellar—he took up a stone, and said, "I will break your b—head with this before I leave you this night"—he then ran, and I ran after him—he shot under a bar, then turned round, and threw this stone at me, and knocked me down senseless—he hit me in the eye—a young man picked me up, and led me to Mr. Parrot, a surgeon—there were other boys throwing stones at the time, but they were behind me—there was no other boy before me but the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher. On the evening of the 15th of Oct. I was opposite my master's shop, Mr. Terry's, at Clapham—I saw the prosecutor standing by my side, and I saw the prisoner with a stone in his right hand—I was not close enough to see whether it was a large stone or not—I heard him threaten the prosecutor—he said, "I will do for you to-night, you b—b—; I will split your b—head open "—Wheeler then ran after him, and I ran a short distance—I stopped, and I beard Wheeler say, "He has cut my eye out"—Wheeler groaned, and I ran and picked him up from the ground—I took him to the doctor's, and left him there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, and live at Clapham. On the night of the 15th of Oct. I was sitting at work, and heard a noise outside about eight o'clock—I got up and went outside—I went towards the persons who were making the noise, but I did not go close—I saw the prisoner with something in his hand, and he said to Wheeler, "I will break your b—head this night before I leave you"—Wheeler said, "Don't you let me catch you, my lad," and they all ran off—I did not see any more—the prisoner ran be<lb></lb>fore fore Wheeler, and soon after they had ran I heard Wheeler groan—I was<lb></lb>going going to his assistance, but 1 saw plenty of people round him, and I did not<lb></lb>go any further.</p>

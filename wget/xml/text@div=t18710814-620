I am the son of the last witness—I engaged the prisoner about the commencement of March, entirely on commission—he was to receive 10 per cent, on orders which he took for vinegar and dryers—he brought this order on 27th May, for Mr. H.

               <p>shop shut, and the house apparently empty—I received no answer—I waited a few minutes, and took the goods back again—when the prisoner called on 3rd June for the balance of his commission, I said that Mr. Whitty's order had not been delivered, but he had received the commission on it—the prisoner said "Yes, don't send the goods for a day or two, I will bring the fresh address of Mr. Whitty, 11, Sussex Place, Commercial Road, Peckham"—that was where I took the goods—he was paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. commission on 27th May, the day he brought the order, and on 3rd June he was paid the balance, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., including Mr. Whitty's, and another order or two—11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was due to him on Mr. Whittys order—he received 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 27th May, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 3rd June—Mr. Whitty called at my father's place on 13th June—the prisoner was not present.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I remember when Mr. Whitty called; it was about some rings—he said he had called for a cheque for some rings—the prisoner had brought the rings in, and asked whether we could purchase them—I told Mr. Whitty that the prisoner had given an order for varnish for him, and he said he had never ordered the goods—it was customary to pay the prisoner every Saturday on orders brought in up to the Friday evening—he brought Mr. Whitty's order on Saturday, 27th May—he was not paid all the commission on that order, then—after the order was booked he asked if I would let him have some cash—he had overdrawn his commission at that time, and there was nothing due to him except the commission on Mr. Whitty's order—it was on the following Saturday the prisoner told me not to send the goods till he changed his address—I understood the order was to remain a day or two until he brought an amended address—the goods were sent on 6th June—I accompanied them—he gave me an amended address on the 5th, and I told him the goods should be sent in the next after<lb></lb>noon.</p>

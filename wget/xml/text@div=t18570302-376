Dixey was in our service from Feb. to Dec. last year—on Feb. 3rd, we received information from Haydon. the detective officer, who accompanied me to Messrs. Edgcumbe's, in Wood—street, which is not above 100 yards from our warehouse—it is a wholesale fringe and trimming warehouse—we went into the counting house, saw one of the partners, and Hulme was Sent</p>

Edgcumbe's employment, was introduced into the counting house, and I asked him if he had seen any quantity of gloves in Hulme's possession during the time he had been living with him—he said that he had seen some, and that Hulme had made him a present of three pairs, one pair of which he had worn, and the other two he gave me on the following day—I then went with Haydon and Hulme to Dixey's lodgings—he was not at home, but we waited a short time, and be came in—I pointed to Hulme, and said, "You see this young man, you have disposed of various lots of gloves to him; how did you become pos<lb></lb>sessed <hi rend="italic">of</hi> them?"—he sank on a chair, and remained probably for five minutes without uttering a word—I said, "You must not put off our time in this way; you must account for the goods you have disposed of to him"—he then said, "I stole them"—we then searched his lodgings; some articles were found, which Haydon took possession of, and he was given into custody—this was about 7 o'clock in the evening—Hulme was not taken, but was desired to attend Dixey's examination before the Magis<lb></lb>trate on the following day, which he did; and Dixey was remanded till 7th Feb., when Hulme was desired to attend again; he did so, and was given into custody by the Magistrate's direction—the trade price of the gloves was, at that time, 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

I saw him again at Croy<lb></lb>don; he brought 'down twenty dozen more, and I think I paid him for them—he spoke to me again, about 2nd Oct., and on the next day he brought twenty dozen and a half at the same price—they were all French gloves of various makers; there were some of Dumond's, and Caldesar's, and Serrusier's—there were none of Courvoisier's there, but they were all Courvoisier's on the first occasion—I afterwards spoke to Mr. Johnson, who is in the employment of Hitchcock and Co., and spoke to him about the gloves; I also saw Mr. Gilbert, who is in the employ of Alcroft and Co., on the same day; that was about 4th or 5th Feb.—on the next day, I gave eighteen dozen pairs of gloves to Mr. Gilbert; those brought on 1st Nov. were also taken; they were all received from Hulme—I believe this letter to be in Hulme's writing—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated Feb. 2nd, signed C. Hulme, and requested to know when the witness would let him have some more money on the account</hi>)—I received that on 2nd Feb.—soon after I had given those goods to Gilbert, I saw Hulme at my house; he asked me what I intended to do about Dixey's case—I asked him what he was doing; he said that he had not been back to his employment yet—it was on Friday, 6th Feb.; I told him he had better go back; he said, "I suppose we shall be all right in the matter"—I asked him who he meant; he said, "You, Mr. Harris, and myself;" I said, "The best thing you can do will be to appear to-morrow"—he said at that time that Dixey had bought them at a sale in Oxford-street; that was the first time that Dixey's name had ever been mentioned to me—I knew at that time that Dixey was in custody, I had been present at his examination on the 5th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the conversation take place on 6th Feb? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I mean to state that—he did not say at that conversation that they were bought at a Custom House sale; he said that when I first bought the gloves—he said that Dixey had bought them at a sale in Oxford-street,</p>

               <p>with other goods—I think the word "Sale" was used—I had no suspicions when I took the gloves—it was I who gave information, it was given at my request—I had no suspicions whatever until the goods were shown to Messrs. Hitchcock—some of them remained on my premises until the first exami<lb></lb>nation tomorrow—I expressed a dislike to so many violet-coloured ones.</p>

BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Under what circumstances was it that he told you that they had been bought at a Custom House sale? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard it first from Hulme, at Croydon, when Mr. Harris bought his in Feb., that was the first parcel—he did not say by whom they were bought at a Custom House sale, I merely heard it incidentally—I did not hear Dixey's name till he was taken—I went to Hitchcock's to sell some of them, and showed Mr. Johnson a sample, but in consequence of what passed between us I did not sell them—I afterwards saw the prosecutor, and gave them over to Gilbert.</p>

                  </hi>. I am glove buyer to Messrs. Hitchcock. Mr. Mes<lb></lb>sent offered me some gloves, the first lot about Oct. or Nov., and the second lot about a month ago—I bought the first lot at 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was what he asked; there were about thirty dozen—when he brought the second lot, for reasons I had, I communicated with my principals, and did not buy them—I have not given up any of the first lot; Mr. Messent brought me the second lot to ask me whether they were the goods I thought them to be, or not; I had said something which induced him to bring me the two dozen—I found them to be of three different makers; these are the two dozen (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), they are marked, "L. N. C.," which is a mark known in the trade—some persons call them "L. N.

                  </hi>. I am manager of the glove department in the house of Dent, Alcroft, and Co., of No. 97, Wood-street, Cheapside. I have examined these two dozen pairs of gloves produced, from Hitchcock's—they are of three different makes; we are the only persons who receive those of Dumont's and those marked "L. N. C."—all the gloves that come to London from those houses are consigned to us, by contract with the manu<lb></lb>facturers; we contract with them for the whole of their produce—I have not seen any of these gloves in London through any house but ours—I have been fifteen years in the trade—of these two dozen there is only one pair of Courvoisier's, the others are Dumont's and L. N. C.'s—the value of these gloves at the time in question was 33<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen—that was the price we charged to the trade, to sell again—here are sixteen dozen other gloves from Messent's; they are the make of Dumont, L. N. C., and Serrusier; we are the only importers of those; they are of the same value within 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Then Messrs. Dent do not make gloves for them<lb></lb>selves? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, yes, they do, in very large quantities; but they also import—we purchase of a great many different makers; all those that I have mentioned, manufacture exclusively for us; they may also make a great many for the French trade.</p>

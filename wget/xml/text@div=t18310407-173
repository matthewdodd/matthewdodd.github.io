            . I live in Cowcross-street. On Thursday, the 17th of February, I sent a sack of black oats to Mr. Smeeton's slaughter-house, in <placeName id="t18310407-173-crimeloc950">Wheatsheaf-yard, Farringdon-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did he work about that yard? A. I believe he did, as a helper - I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070087"></xptr>not aware whether in our conversation I said "the oats," or "the sack" - he was taken in the same yard two days after.</p>

On Thursday, the 17th of February, I took a sack of black outs to Mr. Smeeton's, in Wheatsheaf-yard - I deposited them in the passage of the slaughter-house, and put a bill of parcels on the top of the sack, which was marked H. Stevens. Cowcross-street, and I had mended it at the bottom; I afterwards heard the oats were lost, and on the prisoner being apprehended, I attended at the Magistrate's, saw the sack, and knew it to be the same; there were a few black oats hanging to the flue in the sack - they were of the same quality and description as those I took to Smeeton's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had your master a tolerable stock of these oats? A. Yes, and he had fifty sacks marked the same - I had takes on about ten that week, and the same corn in some of them, but this was an empty sack about the place; I was obliged to mend it to take them in - I saw it at Guildhall in about a week - I could not be deceived in the mending; I placed it in a passage leading from the slangliter-house to the yard; it has a door which shuts, but has no fastening - Wheatsheat-yard is a thoroughfare from Farring don-street into Seacoal-lane - a person could not get to the sack without opening the door; any person might carry it away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you but one mended sack? A. Yes. but they were all out - I am certain this is the one I mended to send to Smeeton's.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was the prisoner employed in the yard? A. Yes; I have delivered him sacks of master's several times, but am certain I did not deliver him this particular sack.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 22nd of February, standing at a stabledoor in Wheatsheaf-yard - Millin came up, and he went up to the loft while I took the prisoner; he refused to give me the key of the stable, but Millin said if he did not he should break it open - he said it was his employer's stable; Millin brought the sack down, and the prisoner said he had found it in the yard on the Saturday morning - he saw it in Millin's hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Millin come up at once to him and demand admittance? A. He said his name was Beckett, and that he was employed there - I told him to give us the key, or let us in; he refused, and then gave it up; he said he was waiting for his master to come home with the horses.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know whether any body else worked in the stable? A. I cannot say - I stood at the door while Millin went up and found the sack.</p>

A. he said he would go into the loft and fetch me a sample - I then said, "Where do you live?" he said, "I hardly know where I live" -I said, "Where do you sleep?" he said, "I sleep here, over this stable;" I went up, found a place which he called his bed, and this sack formed a part of the bed - I brought it down, and questioned him where he got it; he hesitated for ten minutes, and then said he found it on Saturday morning in the yard - there are black onts in it now - Larman identified it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found about as many oats as would cling to it? A. Yes; he said he had the care of the place, as the man was ill - there are he other premises in the yard; there are stables there.</p>

Stevens, Cowcross-street, on it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Who is your employer? A. Mr. Barroclongh, a tobacconist, on Ludgate-hill - I look after his horse and chaise, and job about for Mr. Martin - he picked up the sack just by the slaughter-house door, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning - I should not think he could have forgotten it at night - I sleep at No. 1, Wheatsheaf-yard; I was out with my master on the 17th, and came horne about six o'clock - I did not see the prisoner; I did not see Mr. Smeeton on Friday, nor hear the oars were lost; I went out at six o'clock on Friday morning, and remained out till between nine and ten at night - Mr. Barroclough was out with his chaise that day; he came home on Saturday night, and I had nothing to do on Friday nor Saturday; I did not know of the oats being lost when the sack was found - I had been there eight or nine weeks; I never saw any oats delivered there.</p>

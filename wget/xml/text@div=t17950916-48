               <p>Q. Did you miss any quart pot on the 27th of August? - Yes, I see him take the pot, about four o'clock, rather turned the middle of the day, at that time he came to the bar and had a glass of gin; he had used the house frequently, this six or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160132"></xptr>seven years, backwards and forwards; on this particular day I looked at him, and he shoved the pot to the other end of the table, he was standing in a box in the tap room, I don't think there was any body in that same box with him; he shoved the pots under his hat, and I looked at him, I see him shove the pot from one end of the table to the other, with his hat, and he was stocking his hair, and was talking with the company in the other box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his hat laying on the table before? - He pulled it off his head, and it was laying with the crown downwards; I had spoke to several people in the house about it; I missed the pot from the box, and did not know which way he had conveyed it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Then his manner at that time did not strike you? - Yes, it did, but I was called away, I had occasion to go to the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you absent? - Not half a minute; and he came out at the same time, of the tap room door, and went out into the street; I followed him about three or four doors, and I said, Durand, you have got a pot of mine, and I touched him over the hat, I thought he could not hold the pot in his hat, on his head I found it was not there, and I put my hand round his waist, and felt his pockets, I thought I must really be mistaken, for I felt nothing; I said, if you will come back with me I shall be satisfied, and I certainly will take you back; when he came back I pulled up the bit of apron that he had before him, and he had the quart pot in his breeches, he pulls the pot out of his breeches, and gave it to me; I said, you rascal, what do you mean by taking my pot? he dropped down on his knees, and begged for mercy; I said, you rascal, how can you expect for mercy, when I have flogged my own children through you for these five weeks; he and no answer at all, but begged that I would not prosecute him, for the take of his family; I took him to Marlborough-street, and he was committed. This is the pot, it had remained in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>I am a brewhouse servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in this house this afternoon? - Yes, I see the prisoner in the top room, I took no notice of him till Mr. Payne thought he had took a pot out of the box, and brought the prisoner back; he was in the middle box; the prisoner went out, and Mr. Payne went out after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the prisoner do any thing before he went out of the box? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did Mr. Payne go out after the prisoner? Not half a minute, I see Mr. Payne go out in a hurry, and I went just out after him to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went to the door? - Yes; Mr. Payne was bringing of him back, and he took him into the kitchen, and I see Mr. Payne take up the apron that hung before him, and there was the pot inside of his breeches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask Mr. Payne whether he took the pot from me, or whether I gave it him?</p>
               <p>Payne. The prisoner unbuttoned his breeches, and I took it from him when he pulled it out of his breeches; I see the pot inside of his breeches before ever he pulled it out; the pot was quite warm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he was before the magistrate he swore that he took the pot from me. I was very bad for about five months in St. Thomas's Hospital, and I am now under the doctor in the goal. I never committed such a crime in my life before; I have a wife and family of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160133"></xptr>three children; I am very sorry it happened; I throw myself entirely on the humanity and clemency of the court.</p>

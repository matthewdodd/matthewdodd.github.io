The Prosecutor infinuated to the Court, that he might have been let out to commit Robberies, and then go back again; but the Evidence of Mr. Allen and Mr. Ewell gaining more Credit than that vulgur Insinuation, and it appearing incongruous, that they should run the Risque of forfeiting their Reputation, and laying all that is valuable at Stake, at the Mercy of a Villain, who would, no Doubt, embrace the Opportunity of Running away, sooner than return to meet Justice in the Face, and run the Hazzard of his Life, by standing a Trial.

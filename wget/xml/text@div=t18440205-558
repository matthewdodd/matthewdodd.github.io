                  </hi>. I am a brush-maker, and live in the Strand. On the 28th December this paper was brought to me—the prisoner, to the best of my belief, is the person—I do not swear positively to him—it was a man dressed like him, and his height—I only received it out of his hand—I went into the counting-house and directed my man to enter the goods, and give them to the person waiting—(<hi rend="italic">the order was for eighteen different brushes signed Henry Grey</hi>)—I think I might confidently swear to the prisoner, but I should not like.</p>

I am in Mr. Davis' service—he gave me the order—I looked out the goods and delivered them to the person waiting—it was a man similar to the prisoner—I have no belief on the subject—I do not believe he is the man—he is very much like him—I believe he is not the man—he is dressed differently now to what he was at the police court—he was dressed there like the man in the shop—I could not swear it was him at the police court.</p>

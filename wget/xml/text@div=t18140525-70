               <p>Q. Did he at any time make any application to you - A. Yes, he stated to me the pleasure he received when he was an apprentice, and the clothes he got, and the way he used to get them; he said he got cloth from his master, a Mr. Downes, in Fleet-street, and that the foreman used to sell it for him, and used to buy him clothes, and give him money to spend. He then asked me if I did not want a few things; I told him I wanted a great many things that I could not get. He said he would put me in a way to get them; he said if I would get a bit of cloth or kerseymere from my master down stairs he would sell it for me and buy me things. With great persuasion I let him have some kerseymere. I told him I did not like to do it; I did not think it was right; he said, very well. One day, I was going to Islington on my master's business; he met me; he said he was in debt, and wanted to make a suit of clothes for his brother-in-law. That was in last February. He said, if I could get him that I should never want for anything. After great persuasions, I got him what he wanted. I got him the cloth the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181405250042"></xptr>next morning. He came before six o'clock; there was only me and him in the room. He lifted down the broad cloth, and cut a yard and three quarters off. I saw it measured. That is the quantity for a coat. He took it away at dinner time. He told me he sold it. I never told my master of it; he discovered it.</p>

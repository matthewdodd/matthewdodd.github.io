                  </hi>. I live at Enfield. On Saturday night, 23rd Nov., I met Meader between ten and eleven o'clock, near King's-cross—I was not sober, but I knew what I was about—I went with her to 4, Paradise-court—Hodge was there—I went into a room on the first-floor with Meader, and gave Hodge a shilling to fetch a pot of ale—she brought the ale and the change into the bedroom, and stopped there—both the prisoners were in the room—I undressed and went to bed—I expected both the prisoners to come to bed, but I believe neither of them did—I fell asleep—I recollect winding up my watch before I went to bed, and I believe I put it under the pillow, or on a nail, I could not swear which—I think I awoke in a quarter of an hour: the prisoners were gone, and the watch also—I had a silver chain, and about 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which were gone—I dressed myself, and called a policeman—I went with him next morning to the same house, and saw the two prisoners, and they were taken—this is my watch and chain—I know the watch by the number—I have had it about six weeks.</p>

I do not recollect seeing any baby; you assisted me up when I fell—I do not recollect any third female, or my giving the watch to pawn.</p>

About half-past eleven o'clock on Saturday night, 23rd Nov., I was called by Johnson into Paradise-court—next morning I went to the house, found Hodge in the front-parlour, and Meader up-stairs—she said she had not seen the prosecutor—she after<lb></lb>wards said he offered her the watch to sleep with her, and she knew nothing about the watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, in Gray's-inn-lane. I produce this watch and chain, which I took in of Hodge, in the name of Ann James, 16, Bath-street—I never saw her before, but I can swear to her—she said she required the money to pay a bill with—she got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—she told where the watch was—the duplicate has not been found.</p>

I was called to take the watch to pawn for the gentle<lb></lb>man to sleep with the two females; I said I would not go by myself, and one of the other two females, who was to sleep with the gentleman, went with me; when we got back, the gentleman was gone; he had told me to fetch him a pot of ale, which I did, and then he had no money, and gave his watch.</p>

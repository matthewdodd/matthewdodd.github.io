             is a lodger of mine, he belongs to an Indiaman; I believe he is gone on board; there were 2 cheque shirts of his missing 7 weeks ago next Sunday. I never saw the prisoner before I saw him before the bench of Justices, to my knowledge.</p>

I keep a sale-shop by Wellclose-square, Cable-street; I have bought things of him, and sold him things: he brought these 2 cheque shirts to me about 2 months ago; I bought them of him, he is a seaman; he said he could not get his wages, and was forced to part with them.

            , I know them by the gussets being sewed in with purple thread: they are the same that I missed.</p>
               <p>Pescote. I bought them of the prisoner about 2 months ago, he said they cost him 11 s. and he would give me something handsome, if I would keep them till he got his money, I gave him 9 s. for them; he always behaved very civilly at my house: I bought a pair of breeches of him, which he bought in Rosemary-lane.</p>

               <p>the child to the station, and got there at 7 o'clock, and then to the work-house, where we arrived at from 7.30 to 8 o'clock—the time was taken up by looking to see whether it was a boy or a girl—the policeman and I did that—it was a very windy and cold night—the urinal was in rather a secluded part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is a gas lamp outside the urinal in the road—there is no lamp in the urinal—I went in for my own purposes, and heard the child cry—I saw no woman—it was not a wet night, but it Was cold—I found the child about 6.30, and delivered it to the porter at the workhouse from 7.30 to 8, having taken it to the station in the meantime—I held it all the time—it was 7 o'clock when I came out of the station—the child's clothes were wet, and I did not have them taken off at the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 21). On Saturday evening, 6th January, about 6.45 I saw Scotcher with a child in his arms, in Wheeler Street—I took it to the police-station, and gave a description of the clothing, because we could not see in the streets—we then took it to Whitechapel Workhouse—there was a light about six yards from the urinal attached to the wall.</p>

I am a nurse at the City of London Union, Bow Road—the prisoner was an inmate there for six Weeks—her baby was four days old when she came in—it was a boy—on Saturday, 6th January, the doctor discharged her from the lying-in ward into the nursery—she did not like to go there, and wished to discharge herself—she left at a little after 5 o'clock of her own accord—I dressed her baby—I did not notice the marks on its clothes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident surgeon at the Whitechapel Work-house—on the evening of the 6th January a child was brought in—it is marked in the workhouse books as at 7 o'clock—it was between 7 and 8 o'clock—it was very cold, as if it had been exposed to the weather, and was suffering from the effects of exposure—its hands and feet were cold, and it seemed exhausted—its pulse was feeble—it lived thirteen days, and died on the 19th—during the whole of that time it got gradually weaker—there was an inquest and a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—the cause of death was exposure—from the time the child came into the workhouse it never recovered from the effects of what I call exposure; it wasted—it took the breast for two days, and then it was too weak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We had a wet nurse for it as soon as it came—its clothes getting wet and its being carried through the cold wind did not do it any good—it died from wasting very rapidly—two months is a critical age—I think it was exposed a sufficient time to have great effect on its vital powers—waiting would be accelerated by exposure.</p>

I am a nurse at Whitechapel Union—on 6th January, between 7 and 8 o'clock that evening, Scotcher brought a child there, wrapped up in the large brown shawl in which it was left, and which was very wet—I took it from him—its under-clothing was not wet, but its outer clothing was—it was very cold indeed—it took the breast after it got a little warmth by the fire—everything that could he was done for it, but it died on the 19th—it took the breast well for the first two days, and then it seemed to waste.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was brought in on a very windy and wet night—the shawl was soaking wet, and there was mud on it, as if it had lain in the mud—I do not know the precise time it was brought, but I know I got it warm and comfortable before the 8 o'clock bell rang.</p>

            . The Prisoner came into my Shop the 23d of March, and asked to see some China-Basons, and bid Money for one; and as the Person that served her looked another Way, she took an Opportunity, as it is imagined, to conceal one under her Cloak; she went to the next China-Shop to see some Plates, and while the Person that served her went to take some Things off the Shelf, she took a China-Dish. My Bason was found upon her; my Neighbour came to me, and asked me, If she had bought a China-Bason of me: I said, No: says he, I took this Bason from her. - This is my Bason; here is my own Hand-writing upon it; I am sure I had it in my Shop that Day.</p>

I bid 14 d. and afterwards 14 d. Half-penny, and came out of the Shop; - it was not this Gentleman that served me; and as I went down the Street, I met two Acquaintance of mine, who were going to the other End of the Town; there was a China-Woman coming by, and I bought this Bason of her, and gave her 15 d. for it, and she had one Plate which was like that: Pray do not you sell these to the People who sell China about the Streets?</p>

            . On the 23d of March, the Prisoner at the Bar came into my Shop, and asked for some enamelled China Plates. I turned my Back to her, and took some off the Shelf; I showed them her, and told her the Price; she said they were a great deal too dear; I told her I could not take much less. She said she must have them cheaper, for she had broke three of a Gentlewoman's Plates, and that the Gentlewoman said they cost her 4 s. said I, you had better give the four Shillings to the Person; she stood humming and hawing and would not stir; said I, Good Woman, you had better go away; says she, look a little farther; said I, Prithee go about your Business, and I espied under her Arm something of China; thinks I, she may have been somewhere else and bought some. When she was got two or three Steps from the Counter, said I, Mistress, What have you got there? So I took hold of her, and saw my own Dish. I was almost frightened to Death. Said I, Oh, you Bold Face, you have got my Dish. I called up my Servant, and said, This Bold-Face has stole my Dish. She wanted to put the Dish down; I took the Dish from under her Arm; she had a short Cloak over it. I was glad to get my Dish, and I let her go. Says some Body, have you lost nothing else? Says the Boy, I will run after her and see; so he went over the Bridge as far as the Pastry-Cook's; says he, I am come to see whether you have any Thing else of my Mistress's; and she and the Bason were brought back to my Shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Dish lay upon the Counter; I did take the Dish up in my Hand, but with no Intent to steal it, or of covering it, but my Short-Cloak fell down over it, and the Gentlewoman thought I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174304130007"></xptr> was going to steal it; says she, What are you going to steal my Dish? and took it from me. There are three or four Ladies of Quality that I lived with, but they are out of Town, or they would have come to give me a Character. <rs id="t17430413-6-verdict39" type="verdictDescription">

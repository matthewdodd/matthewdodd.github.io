               <p>Q. How do you know the goose to be your's? - A. The goose I cannot swear to, nor the towel I cannot say any thing to, here is a person here that can.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did you see the prisoner in the place you call his lodgings? - A. When I went he was at work, his wife sent for me and he came.</p>

             sworn. - I am the wife of William Archer; I followed the officer, and my husband, and some other people on the Monday, to the prisoner's house; I saw the goose in the officer's hands, and two pair of giblets in a tin kettle, and a small towel; I know the towel to be mine, it is marked with a blue mark, I did not mark it myself, but I can safely swear to it by that mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the goose at all? - A. No, it is not in my power to do that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When was it that you lost this goose? - A. The 29th, or 30th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Just at Michaelmas you know? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All the persons about London, if they can, will have a goose upon Michalemas-day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What does I stand for upon the towel? - A. Townley; it was given to my little child by a relation that is dead, but she is not of age, it was given to me for the child.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the child living? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley contended that the towel ought to have been laid to be the property of the child, but the objection was over-ruled.</p>

             sworn. - On Monday, the 30th of September, I went with a search warrant to the prisoner's house; in searching the house, I found a goose in a closet, upon the shelf, and upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300042"></xptr>the fire in a kettle, two pair of giblets, and in a basket a quantity of goose feathers, and a small napkin, (produces it); I apprehended the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Archer.) What is the value of this towel? - A. Sixpence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean to say this foolish thing is worth sixpence? - A. I think it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Would any shop-keeper fell you such a thing at all? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know nothing about the cloth, but my wife tells me the child had picked it up about eight o'clock that morning.</p>

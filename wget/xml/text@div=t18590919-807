On 22d August I went to 15, Princes-place, Kennington, with the prisoner's wife—the prisoner was not at home; he came in; I met him as he was coming in the passage—he started, and I said, "Don't be surprised; if you will walk in the parlour I will introduce you to your wife—he said nothing then—I said to Mrs. Hayes, "Do you now charge your husband with having married you, his former wife being still alive"—she said, "Yes"—I told the prisoner it was my duty to take him to the station, which I did—Mrs. Hayes came to the station—I saw the prisoner wanted to go towards the inspector's room door—I asked him why he wanted to go there—he said, "To beg their pardon"—on the way to the station he said he was a great blackguard for having married her, and he deserved all he got, and he should not have married her if he had not been drawn into it.</p>

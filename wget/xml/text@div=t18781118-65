                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alfred Sullivan, baker, of 394 Wandsworth Road—on 2nd November the prisoner came for a twopeuny loaf, for which he tendered a half-crown—I recognised him as having been in the shop before—I saw the coin was bad—I marked it with a knife at the police-station—when I told him it was bad, he said I might try to bend it—I told him I had no right to give him change for it or give it back, and if a policeman were passing I would call him in—he did not move away until I turned my head to open the trap to call up the pastry<lb></lb>cook, and then I saw a policeman passing, and called him in, and the policeman brought him back to the shop, and the prisoner asked me if he were the man who gave it me, and I said he was, and that he brought me a bad two-shilling piece a fortnight before—this occurred in the kitchen, where he was searched—I gave the bad half-crown to the con<lb></lb>stable—on the former occasion I think it was twopenny worth of cakes he asked for—when he me gave the bad two-shilling piece, as I told him of it, my husband happened to come in, and I passed it to him, and he said it was bad—he then paid with a good sixpence and went away—I believe he put the bad coin in his pocket.</p>

Mrs. Sullivan pointed the prisoner out to me, and I took him into custody—he had started to run, and I caught him in about 150 yards—he said "You have got the wrong man"—I said "What for?

I said "Yes," took him to Mrs. Marsh's shop and asked him if he knew the woman who I had left there—he said "No, I never <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> her in my life before"—I then asked her if she knew him—she said "No"—</p>

                  </hi>. I was fourteen last May, and live with my mother at 2, Cross Street, Ball's Pond—on 28th August, about 4.5, Mrs. Robinson sent me for a constable, and as I was going, I saw the prisoner in Orchard Street—I am sure of him—he went round by Wall Street, and I saw him. stoop down by Mrs. Saunders' gateway and put something-down-in the corner; he then covered what he had put there over with, dirt—I fetched a policeman, who went to Mrs. Marsh's shop—five or six minutes afterwards I went to the gateway and found a florin and two shillings, which. I gave to the policeman—one of the shillings was wrapped in yellow paper, and the other was loose.</p>

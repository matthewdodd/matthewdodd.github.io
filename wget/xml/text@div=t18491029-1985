On Friday night, 10th Oct., the prisoners came there, with a sailor, who was half drunk, and sat between them—Alton asked for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of gin—they drank it, and he gave the sailor another glass—he got more tipsy—Alton took the watch out of his pocket, and left it hanging by the chain—Abrahams snatched it away, and put it into Alton's pocket—Alton then said to the sailor, "All right, drink another glass;" but he would not—he was <hi rend="italic">dozing</hi> on the bench—Alton said, "Stand up," and, pretending to put him straight, put his hand into his pocket—I heard a rattle of money—they took him out of the house—he did not want to go, but Alton forced him out—Abrahams said to him, "Go home, come along"—they helped him along—I went out, saw the sailor in the middle of the street, and told a policeman—I gave the prisoners in charge—I have not seen the sailor since.</p>

I was at the public-house, and saw the prisoners come in with a sailor—they called for some gin, gave him a glass, and sat him down opposite the bar—Alton put his hand round him, and took the watch out of his pocket—it hung down by the chain—Abrahams snatched it off the chain, and put it into Alton's pocket; then they sat down, and asked the sailor to <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> some gin, but he seemed very much intoxicated—I did not hear him speak—they took him out of the house—the landlord followed him out.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I received him in charge last Thursday night - he said he would return<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050104"></xptr>the harness in the morning, or 2l. 10s.; he produced the duplicate of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I called upon the prosecutor's son - he asked me to sell the harness; the prosecutor himself gave me the articles laid in the indictment, to show to hackneymen, to see if I could dispose of them, but being extremely old, although I had tried to sell them, I could not succeed; being very much distressed and fatigued, I called at Mr. Aldous, in Berwick-street, Soho, and pledged them for 1s. 6d., fully intending to redeem them, and return them to the owner - after I had received them from the prosecutor he wished me good-day, saying, that he had no money to treat me, and I said neither had I any.</p>
               <p>- WILLIE. The prisoner sent for me the evening he was taken, and I saw Mr. James, who said to me,"God bless my soul! I don't think the man has taken it with intent to steal it;" I said, "I believe he has not;" he said, "Will you call on me?" I called that evening at his place - he then said he did not think he took it with intent to steal it and not bring it back, but he did not bring it back for a week, and he was afraid his son would make him pay for it; I said I would make a bridle and pad to match rather than he should be taken - he said, "Well, I think I would take 8s. and drop it, if my expenses are paid;" I said as I had known Charters so long I did not mind that.</p>

I never saw the witness but once till he was before the Magistrate; I did not tell him I believed the prisoner did not intend to steal it, nor offer to make it up for 8s. and my expences - he followed me about from time to time, and wanted me to go and drink with him; since I have been here he has also followed me about.</p>

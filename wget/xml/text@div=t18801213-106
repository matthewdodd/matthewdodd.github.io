I am a servant at the Alma Tavern, Twickenham—on Friday, 12th November, about 9 p.m., I went to make the prisoners' bed, and trod on this box and three studs—the room was locked till 9—I opened it and looked at them—the prisoners both came in, and I asked the male prisoner if they were his studs—he said "Yes; they came out of my shirt, but I have not worn them to-day," and I gave them to him in the female prisoner's presence—after they left I told my master.</p>

I received information, went to Twickenham Railway Station, and found the two prisoners—I told them they would be charged with stealing some studs from the Alma public-house—the prisoner Alfred said that he had left some of his own things with the landlord as security for the money he owed him—on the way to the station I asked him if he had any studs or money—he said that he had no studs, and nothing belonging to the landlord—I found three studs</p>

            . I live in Little Alie-street, and am a maker of coffin plates, and such things - I was in the prosecutor's employ for nearly thirteen years - I left him last July - a man named

             brought some things to me to sell the day before new year's day - I was at the Bell public-house, opposite Whitechapel church - I was still employed in the same trade - I had seen Lazarus before - while I was employed at the prosecutor's, I acquired a knowledge of their manufacture - he employed me to sell coffin handles, and a variety of ornaments for coffins - I could tell them directly to be Mr. Gardner's manufacture - I did not buy them - I detained them, and gave information to Mr. Davis, the prosecutor's clerk, and gave him the articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long were you in the prosecutor's employ? A. Nearly thirteen years - I was discharged - I had had a little trouble concerning family affairs - I was rather given up to drink - I have served several undertakers with coffins - have attended funerals, but have not been regularly employed since - I am not now employed by the prosecutor - I do not know where Lazarus is - persons come to the coffin plate shops, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200099"></xptr>buy the tin cuttings - I was acquainted with Lazarus by his coming to the shop for this sort of cuttings and things - he lived somewhere in Spitalfields, within two or three hundred yards of the Bell - he came to sell them to me to sell again - I was to pay the money for them - the prisoner was not in the prosecutor's employ when I was - he came afterwards - I have not expressed any determination to get into my old place at all events - nothing like it- it has been said so, but there is no truth in it - I have not been at their warehouse since July.</p>

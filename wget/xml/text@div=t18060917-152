On the 4th of this month, between nine and ten in the evening, the three prisoners came together into my house, they came to the bar and requested a glass of liquor, two of the three had shrub, and the other rasberry, I charged them sixpence for the three glasses; Stewart tendered me a half guinea, he found I was inclined to give him all silver in change, he requested a seven shilling piece, as part of the change for the half guinea; I replied that I had not one, otherwise I would not part with the silver. Dowton observed that he had halfpence enough in his pocket (I had returned the half guinea to Stewart); Dowton searched his pocket, he said he had only four-pence halfpenny, on that Wise put his hand in his left pocket and took out a seven shilling piece, he stood a little reclined from the bar, I had not as good a view of him as I had of the other, but I am sure I took it of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you took the seven shilling piece of him. - A. Yes, I weighed the seven shilling piece, it was a good one; I was going to give him change for it when Dowton said he should not change, for he knew Steward had in his pocket a penny and a halfpenny, they should be able to pay me in copper.</p>
               <p>Court. When Dowton said that Steward had three halfpence did you return that seven shilling piece. - A. I did, Steward took it up, I told him it did not belong to him, when I accused him of doing it he muttered in his own language, I did not understand what; he said he had detained it, and when he failed of finding the halfpence to make up Dowton's four pence halfpenny, he put down a seven shilling piece, observing you must take it out of it now; I took it up and put it in the balance, the same as I did the other one Wise gave me; I found it to be a bad one, I asked him how he could be so base to give me that one, I conceived it to be a bad one; my husband hearing an altercation at the bar, stepped-out of the little room, and enquired the cause of it, I told my husband, in the prisoners hearing, what had happened, my husband was not satisfied with me, he went into the bar and put it in the balance, he found it a bad one; on that he stepped out of the bar, and went into the parlour, in which Mr. Batho the ward beadle was sitting, he said Mr. Batho, I stand in need of some of your assistance, for he thought he had got some men imposing bad money on his wife; on hearing the name of Batho, Wise and Steward endeavoured to make their escape; Wise took to the right, which is the front of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170087"></xptr>house, and Stewart made off at the back door; I put my hand upon Dalton, and observed that he should not go till the other prisoner returned, he did not attempt to go; my husband pursued and brought in Wise, and Stewart was brought back also; they were all then taken into the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. The last seven shilling piece you took of Stewart, what did you do with it. - A. I gave it to my husband.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the three prisoners coming to your house. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those the three persons, the three prisoners at the bar. - A. They are; when I got to the bar my wife was disputing with the three prisoners at the bar, I asked what was the matter, my wife gave a seven shilling piece into my hand, she told me that Wise put down a good seven shilling piece, Stewart had taken it up and gave her a bad one; I put it in the balance, I found it light, I opened the bar door, called out Batho, I shall thank you for your assistance, I have got three men at the bar that want to impose upon my wife; Wise ran out of the front door on my calling out to Mr. Batho, I perceived him running out, I said you shall not escape, I catched him at the corner of the warehouse, opposite to our house, I laid hold of him, we had a scuffle, we both were down, some neighbours came to my assistance, we took him and brought him into my house; when I came in with him, Stewart, Wise was brought back, and Dowton was standing with my wife at the bar; when we got them all three in the tap-room Mr. Batho insisted on searching them.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you received the seven shilling piece in charge from your wife. - A. I had it, I believe, I left it on the bar, my wife gave it me afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mrs. Daniels) I understand you to say that you had given the seven shilling piece to your husband. - A. Yes, to try it on the ballance, afterwards it was put on the bar; I afterwards returned it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same seven shilling piece that he had left upon the bar. - A. It was, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep your eye upon it the whole time. - A. I had one eye upon the prisoner and one upon that.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. After the bustle was over I gave the seven shilling piece to Mr. Batho; when Mr. Wise was searched, after he had put down a certain quantity of small gold, there seemed to be one bad one, Wise snatched at the bad one, and said that is mine, nobody shall have it from me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many seven shilling pieces did you weigh. - A. Six or seven, and two were light.</p>

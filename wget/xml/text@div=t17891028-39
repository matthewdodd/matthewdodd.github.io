               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, I told you, if you wished to have other witnesses examined, I would call them; this is a matter of very great consideration: nine tenths of the people that are tried here, must escape, if you expect that some person should see the crime committed; because, thieves and people capable of committing crimes, commit them in the absence of witnesses; and if property is lost, and afterwards recently found in the possession of another; that is in law, a presumptive evidence of the theft, unless the persons charged with the robbery, can prove how they came by the property; but I will call another witness.</p>

               <p>I am one of the Bow-street officers; this gentleman came to me and Jealous, another brother officer; I know the prisoner: I was present at the searching of this man's lodging; I found part of the property there: I found this handkerchief; the prosecutor was present at the time; he directly said, that is my handkerchief, and this is a piece of my nankeen.</p>
               <p>Jury. We cannot alter our verdict.</p>
               <p>Court. You will let all the thieves in London escape.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Look at these things? - They are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They were all in one parcel when I picked them up; I never opened them; I found them in the street, at the bottom of the stone steps.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I found them in his apartment, about an hour after I lost them.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, it is my duty to tell you what the law is, and then you will discharge your consciences upon it. The rule of law is, that if property is lost, and recently afterwards found in possession of another, who cannot give a satisfactory account of it; that is in presumption of law, an evidence of theft; now the prosecutor put these things in a coat pocket; and he saw the prisoner, who is a <rs id="t17891028-39-deflabel191" type="occupation">porter</rs>

Gentlemen, you will consider whether you are satisfied by this account.</p>

               <p>Jury. My lord, we wish to know whether there was not other people passing in the passage? -</p>
               <p>Court It does not depend on this man's being in the passage, but he was in the passage, and an hour afterwards, part of the things were found in his possession; and he sells part as his own.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is our opinion, that he is not guilty.</p>
               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice HEATH.</p>

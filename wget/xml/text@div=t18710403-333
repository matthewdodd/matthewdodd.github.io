                  </hi>. I live at the corner of Vicarage Lane—the front garden fronts the Romford Road—on Thursday evening, 9th February, in conse<lb></lb>quence of a communication from Miss Green, I went up stairs to the room, the window of which is over the portico—I had been in that room within twenty-five minutes, and then left the window quite safe, and the blind down—when I examined it, I found the knob of the catch broken off, and a pane of glass broken, directly over the catch, in the top sash—it was smashed all to atoms, so that a person might put their hand in, or their head—the knob of the catch was broken off, and the catch pushed up, almost perpendicular—if a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> or chisel had been forced between the two sashes, against the centre of the catch, that would exactly account for the appearance—it was an ordinary catch—I did not see the marks of any instrument just there, the marks were on the bottom of the lower window-sill—the lower sash goes to the ground—it was forced up nearly three inches—there were very distinct marks there of an instrument having been used to force it—it had not been opened for some time, on account of the damp weather, and it had stuck fast, and would not yield to the pressure of an instrument without a longer leverage—the blind was a white one, not Venetian—Inspector Mason after<lb></lb>wards made a careful examination.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housekeeper at the Green Man public-house, Blackheath, in the parish of Lewisham, which is kept by Thomas Henry Whitmarsh. On Thursday afternoon, the 9th of January, I was in the laundry, which is in the garden—I cannot get to it from the dwelling-house without going into the open air—it is partly under the ball-room—after pass<lb></lb>ing the great entrance of the house, there is a paling, which goes entirely round the premises, enclosing the whole building, till you come to Dartmouth-road and round to the great entrance again—the laundry-door opens into a small yard and you go out of that yard into the garden—a man could get over the paling I should think—the yard is in the garden, only separated by a gate—the fence goes all round the garden—my master's and mistress's linen, and some shirts, and waistcoats, and a bag, belonging to Mr. Thomas Whitmarsh, who is the father of Thomas Henry Whitmarsh, was in the laundry that afternoon—it was there to air—the policeman has since produced a bundle to me containing these articles—tome were marked in full, and some in initials—I left the laundry between four and five o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the owner of the Green Man pub<lb></lb>lic-house, and have been so wholly since May 1839. My father's name is Thomas—he does not reside with me, and is not a partner at all—it is in the parish of Lewisham—the laundry is under the ball-room and is part of the building—there is no access to it but going through the garden and yard—the laundry-door opens into a small yard close to the scullery—this yard is enclosed, and the garden is enclosed by pales six or seven feet high.</p>

                  </hi>. I am laundry-maid at the Green Man public-house. On Thursday afternoon, the 9th of January, I was in the laundry till half-past six o'clock—there is a window to the laundry—one of the</p>

               <p>panes of glass was broken—I secured the window when I left it by a hasp which kept it close—the hasp is about half-way up the window—it is only one sash—it opens inward on a catch with a hasp—the broken pane was not in the sash, but just under the hasp—it is a large window, which goes nearly all round the laundry, but the part which opens is about four panes—I saw the window next morning, Friday—the broken pane was not broken more than before—the opening on Thursday was large enough to admit the hand of a man who could then reach the hasp and open the window—a part of the window had been mended with wood—I found that broken much more in the morning—it is part of the frame-work; where it opens was broken, it had been repaired, and next morning it was found broken much worse—a piece of wood had been placed there instead of glass—one of the panes in the sash which opened was wood, and the other three were glass—the wooden pane had been broken partly out close by the hasp—the sash could be opened by putting a hand through the pane which was broken underneath—I do not think he could do it by putting his hand through the broken wood—the window could not be opened from outside without lifting the hasp.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How high was the broken pane from the ground? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think six or seven feet—I could not reach it myself by stand<lb></lb>ing on the ground—none of the under panes of glass were broken—I never knew the window come open after I had fastened it—I usually fasten it every day—it is my ordinary habit to fasten the window—I never forgot it—I looked round the laundry that night to see that It was all safe, and recollect it was fastened—I looked to see that the hasp was fastened—I had opened it in the day time—I shut it about four o'clock in the evening—I looked round to see that all was safe at half-past six o'clock—I had a light—I did not get on a stool—I could see it as I stood on the floor—it goes into a little hole—the hasp hangs to the window, and I could see the hasp was not hanging down.</p>

               <p>morning, the 10th of January, in the neighbourhood of Dartmouth-terrace, which is in the road coming from the Green Man public-house, about half-past two o'clock in the morning—I met the two prisoners, just at the top of Dartmouth-terrace, about seven hundred yards from the Green Man public-house—Perry was carrying a bundle on his back—I heard something, turned my lantern on, and could see them quite plain, twenty or thirty yards from me—when I saw the bundle I said, "Halloo, my lads, what are you loaded with?"—Anthony answered me, <hi rend="italic">"Kit"</hi> that is all—I then passed down to the foot of the hill, they on one side of the road, and I the other—I then crossed over, went up to them, and told Anthony I must see what the <hi rend="italic">kit</hi> was, and asked him what it was, he said, some things—I asked what things—he said, "A shirt or two, some stockings, and other things;" that he was going to work at Norwood—I took hold of the bundle Perry had on his back, and said, "I must look what these shirts are before you pass me, as it is a very un<lb></lb>seasonable time at night"—when I took hold of the bundle he pulled himself on one side, and said, "What, do you think we stole it?"—I said, I did not know, but I must see what he had got, or I should take them to the station-house—I drew my staff, and took Perry—he said, if I took him to the station-house, I should take the bundle myself, and carry it to the sta<lb></lb>tion-house—he gave it into my hand—as soon as I got hold of it they tried to escape from me—they spoke together as they crossed the road with me, as I was taking the bundle, but I could not hear what they said—they tried to run away—I caught hold of Perry, and he and I fell into a ditch by the side of the road—I got up again, and caught hold of Burt, and we tustled together on the road—Perry assisted him, and I had a tustle on the road with them both—I struck Anthony with my staff, and knocked his hat in—it fell off on the footpath—he ran and picked it up, ran along, and I pur<lb></lb>sued him to a chalk-pit—Perry had escaped—I pursued Anthony two or three hundred yards—he got away, and ran into a field—I pursued him, and I fell into a chalk-pit, seven or eight feet deep—I do not know what be<lb></lb>came of his hat—as far as I know, he took it away with him—I never saw it afterwards—he got away—I afterwards returned to the spot where I had thrown the bundle down on their attempting to escape—I found it lying on the road where I had left it—I had sprang my rattle, but got no assistance for some time—I took the bundle on my back, and crossed over Blackheath-road, to go to the station-house—I then heard somebody coming down the hill, I threw the bundle down on the road, and walked up the hill, in the direction of the footsteps I heard, and a few yards further I met Perry—I said nothing to him, but jumped in upon him, collared him by his handker-chief, and said, "I want you"—he said, "What for?"—I said, "On suspi<lb></lb>cion of stealing the bundle you had just now"—He said, "You have not got me yet"—we tustled, and I threw him in the gutter, and, by the assist<lb></lb>ance of two men who were going to work, I secured him—having sprung my rattle two constables came to my assistance—I took him to the station-house, found a key, a buckle, a piece of pencil, and a staple or small hasp, on him—I am certain he is the man who was carrying the bundle when I first stopped the two men—I saw Burt at the station-house afterwards, about five o'clock—he gave his name as Thomas Anthony at the station-house—he went by that name until Cockett, the porter, was produced—he then said his name was Burt, but Thomas Anthony Burt was his name, he was called Thomas Burt, for shortness—I had bent his hat right in with my staff, and broke the crown in.</p>

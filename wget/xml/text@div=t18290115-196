            . I live in Dock-street, Whiteehapel.

               <p>Prisoner. Q. How did you come by the money which you had? A. I had 3s. and a duplicate, which I had pledged a gown for that day.</p>

            . On the 10th of January, the prosecutrix came to my house, about four o'clock, and in about a minute after the prisoner came in, and asked my mother for a knife; she asked what he wanted with it, and, in the meantime, he took the fork off the counter, and stuck it into Murrell's shoulder - it was a small three - pronged fork; she was sitting sideways to him, on a basket; he stuck her in her left shoulder - he said nothing before that; he left it sticking in her shoulder - she got up off the basket, and staggered; I took hold of the fork, put my left hand against her, and pulled it out with my right, because I had a difficulty in getting it out - she then fell backwards; I took her into the kitchen - she fainted; I pulled her things off her shoulder - it had gone through her shawl, gown, and shift-sleeve; the shawl was doubled once - the gown was lined; I then saw three wounds of the fork, corresponding with the prongs - I suppose it had gone in about a quarter of an inch, or not quite so much; it did not bleed a great deal - while I was looking at it, the prisoner was in the shop; he said he would have his money or her life - I then went down for an officer, who came and took him; he then said he would stick a knife into her heart, or have his money - she went in the evening to a surgeon, after going to the office.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 10th of January, I was fetched to Amey's house, East Smithfield; I found the prisoner, the prosecutrix, Mrs. Amey, and her daughter; the prosecutrix was then coming out of the back-room, into the shop, I showed him her shoulder, and asked what he did it for - he said she had robbed him of a sovereign and 4s., and that he would sooner lose his life than his money, and if she did not give him his money, he would stick a knife into her heart, and be the death of her; I took him into custody - the fork laid on the counter; I brought it away, and produce it - I searched the girl, and found nothing; I had seen her give a duplicate and 3s. to Mrs. Amey - it was the duplicate of the gown pawned that day for 3s.; I took her to a surgeon, after the examination.</p>

            . On the 10th of January, a little before eight o'clock in the afternoon, the prosecutrix was brought to my shop; I examined her left shoulder, and observed three punctures as of pricks from a fork, in the fleshy part of the arm; it was in the least dangerous part - not at all calculated to disable or disfigure her: they are now quite well; they healed by the first intention.</p>

I came from the country to receive my pension; I lost my arm at the battle of Navarino- I fell in with a shipmate, and took him to a public-house, and there this girl stood before me; she whipped her hand into my pocket, took 24s. out, and started off as quick as possible: I followed her to this house - she whipped a sovereign into a man's hand, and he ran away; she kept 3s., and 1s. fell on the ground: I asked her for my money - she said, "Go to hell, I have no money of your's" I could not find an officer; I was deranged with losing my money, and being intoxicated, followed her to this house, but how the fork came into my hand I cannot tell; I mentioned no such words as that I would have her life.</p>

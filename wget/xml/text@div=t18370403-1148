I took the prisoner into custody, in Gainsford-street, Horsleydown—when I entered the room, she said, "I know what you want, I will give you all I have in my pocket"—she put her band into her pocket, and gave me money by handfuls—in all, I received 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and gold—there was a guinea and a 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece amongst it—she said, "That is all I have, and that about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of it belonged to herself—my brother-officer said to her, "Who brought the cash-box back?"—she said she brought it back herself, and she wished she bad thrown the money over at the same time as she threw the papers over—she said she had been an unhappy woman ever since she had done this.</p>

Gentlemen, in a case like this, I think it my duty to open every circumstance against or for the prisoner; it is not my wish, or your wish, I am sure, to strain the law against this young woman: you will, under my Lord's direction, first enquire, whether the child was born alive, or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150174"></xptr> whether it was not; and if it was, whether violent hands were laid upon it: she also said, that she meant to bury it privately, that it might not be known. If you should be of opinion that the fact is not sufficiently proved, then you will pronounce her not guilty.</p>

               <p>You are a married woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you had children? - Four dead ones.</p>
               <p>Did her pains excite any suspicions in you that they were labour pains? - Yes, I told her I thought she was in labour.</p>
               <p>Do you think she understood what you said to her, and what she said to you? - I believe she did: I went down stairs, and returned in about five minutes, she was on the side of the bed then; I went down to get my own breakfast, thinking it was gone off: I sent for a gentlewoman to go up, and in about half an hour I went up; she was got into bed, and said she was much better by what I gave her; I then imagined there was a child born, and between three and four I saw a child laying in a white apron by the side of the bed; it was dead, I could not take it up.</p>

               <p>Did you examine her drawer? - Yes, I did for another account, to look for the child, and there I saw a shirt and cap.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The poor woman has no Council, I will ask you what character she had? - I have had her six weeks, and I had a good character with her, and she deserved no other from me.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Soy and me went up with her, and asked her if she was not with child; she said she was not, and her mistress left me; I sat some time with her, and she said she was not with child, then I went away and was fetched again, and she would not own it; I saw the child in the apron in a chair; I asked her how that accident could happen, and she said she was sorry she did not own it.</p>
               <p>Did she say why she did not own it? - She said she was ashamed to own it, as she denied it so long.</p>
               <p>Court. What she said cannot be given in evidence for her.</p>
               <p>Mr. WILLIAMS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon and man-midwife; I was called upon to see the woman and child on the afternoon of the 18th.</p>
               <p>You found the woman had been recently delivered? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the child at its full time? - Yes; I questioned the woman, and I could not by her account learn if the child was born alive; I asked her if the child cried, she said not; I asked her if she felt the child move, she said no; I asked her if she did not use a knife to cut the navel string, she said she did not, she said she tore it. I should not suppose it was born alive; my opinion is, that the child died in the birth for want of assistance.</p>
               <p>Court. That is the conscientious fair opinion that you form? - That is my opinion.</p>
               <p>Were there any marks of violence upon the child? - Not sufficient to kill it; there was a mark on the cheek, as if she had tore it; there were two marks on the side of the neck which I observed, which were taken notice of by the Jury: I considered it fully, and I think it might happen in the efforts of delivering herself.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150175"></xptr>In the delivery the head of course appears first? - In the usual course of births.</p>
               <p>Then about the neck and head must necessarily be the place that the woman must lay hold of to assist herself? - I did not see the child for some hours after she was delivered.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this being a trial upon the Coroner's Inquisition at common law, not under any indictment on the statute, it is necessary that there should be some evidence to satisfy you, that the mother by violence and wilfully was the cause of the child's death; for either on the Coroner's Inquisition, or on an indictment, similar circumstances of proof are required to those and other cases of murder, and the case only differs in this, that where the act of killing the child is wilful and intentional, it must in all cases amount to murder, because there can be no provocation, it cannot be manslaughter; that is the only difference: the single question is, whether the child was wilfully and intentionally killed or not? But it is necessary that there should be clear proof of the child's being born alive, and having appearances of violence, and that the Jury should be clearly satisfied that the mother intentionally killed the child: to be sure you have not such proof in the present case. I cannot blame the Grand Jury with not finding the bill. You see the young woman had provided some things for the child, she had wrapped it up in a cloth, and laid it by her bedside in a situation which she knew it must be found. To be sure in this case, there is no evidence to charge her with the crime of wilful murder.</p>

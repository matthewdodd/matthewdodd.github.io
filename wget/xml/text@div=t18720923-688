I "am an accountant, of Burdett Road, Limehouse—I was employed by Mr. Ryland to receive moneys on behalf of the estate of Samuel Bradley &amp; Son, and came to London for that purpose on 29th December, 1871—the business was being carried on at the head premises of the firm, at St. George's, and Providence Road, Limehouse—the prisoner was employed at 3, Providence Place, Limehouse—I told him that all moneys collected by him would have to be handed over to me—he had a till-book containing entries of money received—his salary was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week—I, as Mr. Ryland's representative, received moneys on account of the estate, and acted in the management of the business—Mr. Bradley also assisted, and was paid 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week—I kept the banking account at the Whitechapel branch of the London and Westminster Bank; there was a separate account in the name of Mr. Ryland—all moneys were paid into the bank and partly used for the business—I paid the prisoner 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week myself; it was his duty to receive moneys due, and enter them in the till-book—there is no entry in the till-book of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from Mr. Salt on 27th April; there are no entries by the prisoner that day, or the day before, or the day after—the last entry by him was on 20th April, and the next afterwards on May 6—4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was due from Mr. Raphael on May 6, but here is no entry of it, although there are entries that day of 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in the proper way—here is no entry of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Cutler on 11th May, or of any other sum; I see no entry after 6th May—he was discharged on June 15; Mr. Ryland gave him a written notice, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to him in lieu of a month's notice—those sums still stand in the books—on 5th June I made out this list of accounts owing from the ledger which the prisoner was supposed to keep—it is called "Accounts owing considered good"—I told the prisoner to go through that list and tick off each that was good, and make any memoranda against those that are doubtful or bad—he ticked various items, and returned the list to me, with this memorandum in his own writing: "All I have ticked are good, and will pay, but most of them next quarter, J. H."—Salt's, Cutler's, and Raphael's accounts are ticked on tbat list—after he was discharged further investigation was made, and about the latter end of May, or the beginning of June, I asked the prisoner how it was that there were so many accounts still owing, as we considered they were very good customers and ought to pay; he kept putting it off, saying</p>

Hart, folio 442, 7, 7, "is simply entered and charged to suspense account, on the other side—"S. B." is put against that entry, which means Samuel Bradley—those are entries where Bradley has told me that he has received the moneys—the only entry that I know of where the prisoner has handed money over to Bradley is this of January 31, where he received 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and paid 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over to me—he paid Bradley 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was included in 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received by Mr. Bradley—35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is entered in the till-book, and the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he paid over to Bradley, to my knowledge, is not entered—if Bradley received it, or any other sum from him, it was his duty to enter it in the till-book; and if he paid over to Penfold, it would be the prisoner's duty to enter it—Penfold did not re<lb></lb>ceive money from the debtors—I have entered in the till-book moneys which he paid in when he neglected to do so—I then entered what I had received from him—that has occurred six or seven times, perhaps—I hare sometimes made an entry in my own cash-book, and I applied to him after<lb></lb>wards for the name of the person from whence he received the money, when I found he had neglected to do so—I then entered what I had received from him—I have never entered in the till moneys received from him—I applied to him two or three days afterwards for the name—nobody used the till-book but Penfold, Bradley, and myself—Hunt did not use it—he did not receive money—he was at the other part of the business—he only came there to make up the books—there is one day of entries of the prisoner after 20th May—from 20th April the other entries are Penfold's, Hender<lb></lb>ville's, and mine—Henderville entered from my cash-book when he found the prisoner had neglected to do so—I find no entry of Bradley's there—this entry marked "S. B." is in Henderville's writing—that means some money which he has received—I find that Bradley has received about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he has received sums since the prisoner left, and he has received cheques, and appropriated the money—Mr. Watkins had occupied the position I oc<lb></lb>cupy</p>

               <p>before—I have no written appointment; I am general clerk to Mr. Ryland—there are not in the list I have handed to you sums which to my knowledge the prisoner has collected and paid over to Bradley—I do not recollect one that Bradley or Bond has received—Bradley received this 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the Millwall Engineering Company on January 14th, and gave a receipt for it—that was before the list was ticked—that was not received by the prisoner, and handed over to Bradley—I know that 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of North's account was paid by cheque, and the prisoner gave a receipt for it—I asked the prisoner on the day he left whether there were any accounts which were not entered—he said that there was a few, and that Bradley had had the money; that he had received it, and paid it to Bradley—I applied to Dun<lb></lb>can's myself for about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and saw some of the prisoner's receipts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I find that the prisoner has received from 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and not entered it—the till-book was kept at the premises of the firm, and if the course of business had been regular, each person who received money would enter it there—I was not present when he paid Penfold any money—when he paid money over he paid it at his risk—I was there every day—Henderville was a clerk at the other shop, he is now down at Limehouse because the other place is given up—the prisoner ought not to have paid money over to Bradley—on 30th January, there is an entry of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I have found out that 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to Bradley, but I know of no other case—after the prisoner left I enquired particularly into the accounts and reported to Mr. Ryland every day—I consulted Mr. Bradley as to the management of the business—here is a regular debtor and creditor account against Bradley.</p>

I am a member of the firm of Bradley &amp; Son, iron<lb></lb>mongers—some time last year I had to consult my creditors—I executed this deed last November, and from that time Mr. Ryland acted as receiver—I have received 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—the prisoner was formerly my clerk, his salary was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week—he was employed in collecting moneys—I have never received from him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Salt, for the payment of a debt owing to the firm, or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Raphael, or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Cutler—I was not aware that the prisoner had received those three sums when he left on the 15th June.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not keep an entry of what he did pay me—he handed me some money over after the appointment of the inspector, but I do not know how much, or how many times—I think I received 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. once; it was part of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I do not remember how much at another time—I did not, to my knowledge, meet him at the door when he came home from col<lb></lb>lecting, and take what money he had—I may have been a little the worse for liquor perhaps twice in the last five or six months—I am sometimes so; I call it a little bit funny—I do not know that I want cash when I am funny—I like a little racing and sports—I go to races—I do not like favourites; I back the field—I do not keep a book for that—I do not think I have re<lb></lb>ceived 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the prisoner; I will not swear that I have not—I do not know when it commenced—the prisoner has been in the employ<lb></lb>ment seven years—he was not by any means active in keeping the business together—I do not remember receiving this cheque from the Limehouse Works for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I might have—I received this one for 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Kircaldy—I have never asked the prisoner for money, but sometimes he would say "I am going collecting, and if you are a bit short, I can get you some"—I did not bet in May and June—when I received this money I did not tell Mr. Goss, I left him to find it out—I do not think you will find any entry of mine in the cash-book—Hart would enter the 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Kircaldy &amp; Son in the cash-book; I did not—I did not once break open his desk; it was seldom locked; I went to it when I was a little bit funny.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you burn any papers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were some sporting papers, and a pack of cards; there was nothing of value there—I did not break it open a second night, but I broke open Penfold's desk—I did not burn his papers; I merely broke it open because it happened to be locked—I was particularly funny then—Penfold never objected to that to me—I did not destroy his papers—I cannot tell whether there were any papers showing what sums he had paid to me; that was a very long time before the prisoner left—I was funny enough to break open the till on the same night as the desk, but there was nothing in it—I did not discharge Rogers; Mr. Goss did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It is five or six months since I broke open the prisoner's desk, but I did not break open the desk where the papers were burnt; it</p>

               <p>was open; that was the prisoner's desk—I burnt the cards and sporting papers; there were no other papers there that I know of—I am quite cer<lb></lb>tain I never received these three sums—I never had any small amounts from the prisoner; they would be no use to me.</p>

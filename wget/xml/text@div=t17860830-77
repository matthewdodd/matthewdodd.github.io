(Produces a short thick piece of stick like a lop pole.) I told them I was a poor hard working man and did not know how to get a bit of bread, and begged of them to let me go about my business; the other man that is absent, took hold of my pocket on the outside, and said, you have money, do not stand hesitating and they said, we will have your money or your life; I told them, I owed money to the baker at the shop, and I did not know how to get a morsel of bread if I did not go home and pay it; but they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300104"></xptr> would have my money, and I took out a shilling and gave it to the other man, and the other man took that, and then they said, that should not do, they would have more; then this prisoner at the bar had another shilling.</p>
               <p>Did you give it to him? - He took it out of my hand; they heard somebody coming, and they ran off as fast as they could, and I heard the watch cry ten, and I ran after them as fast as I could, and cried out murder, stop thief! and the prisoner was taken; I did not see him taken; he was taken about five hundred yards off;

               <p>Was the prisoner at all pointed out to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300105"></xptr> him? - No, he was sitting down the same as any gentleman here, and nobody pointed the prisoner out to him.</p>
               <p>Was there any hint or intimation given him that he was the man? - Not to my knowledge, for I did it to know whether he knew it was the man.</p>
               <p>Who picked up this stick that was thrown away by the prisoner? - The watchman, and he brought it to the pubblic house sometime after the prisoner came there, but I cannot say how long; I saw the prisoner throw it away.</p>

               <p>Was not there something said, to encourage the man, or induce him? - No, I heard nothing of that kind; the prisoner said, I own I had a hand in the robbery, and had got part of the money; the public house was full; there might be twenty or thirty; they were all men; I did not see any women in the house that night.</p>
               <p>Had you the man by the collar or the wrist when the prosecutor came in? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Court. That was hint enough? - I might take him about four hundred yards off.</p>
               <p>Court to Stent.

               <p>Did you see any body running but this man? - Nobody at all, they were both before me, and when we came to the corner of the street, there the prisoner told me he threw the shilling away, and the other man turned towards Hyde-park.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I do not know the prisoner; only that night I heard the cry of stop thief, I ran out of doors to see what was the matter, and I went to the public house, and Mr. Stent went into a public house called the Shakespeare's head; he was set down at the corner, and said to the prosecutor, are you the man that was robbed; and he said, yes; then Stent said, d - n you that is the man, pointing to the prisoner; the prosecutor said, yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Let Stent stand forward.</p>
               <p>Truss. From that, this gentleman Stent took and examined him, there was nothing upon him, not a stick; from thence he was taken into the parlour; I went into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Did the prosecutor go in? - Yes, and there after they had set down a few minutes the prosecutor said, that if the man would confess he would forgive him; if he would give him the two shillings, and give the watchmen something to drink, he would let him go about his business; upon that, after a few minutes, the prisoner said, he was the man that did the robbery; then I went with him to the watch-house, and there they told him that the man that was concerned with him was to be found at Westminster; I went with the prosecutor and the prisoner, to look for the other man; and I said to the prosecutor before he went in, now you had better go along with Wall, and see if you can see the other man that robbed you; he said he would; there was a man a drinking, and he immediately challenged a young man that was there eating his supper, and he said he would swear to him.</p>
               <p>Do you know who that was? - No, but it was a different man from the prisoner; he swore down blank to him, that that was the man that robbed him;</p>
               <p>What he was positive about it, was he? - He was very positive about it, strictly positive.</p>
               <p>What did you say? - I said I thought it was a pity, without he was really positive in his own mind, to go to swear to the man; and Mr. Stent said the same, that he did not believe he was the man; and that he thought it was wrong of him; but he stood to it for sometime, till such time as the landlord and landlady stood up, and said they could prove that that man had but just left work, not above a quarter of an hour; and they could send for his master, and prove him to be a very sober, honest young fellow; upon that he said, he believed he was the man, and went off from it, and went into the other houses in Westminster.</p>
               <p>When was it that the prosecutor fixed on the prisoner? - When Mr. Stent said d - n me, that is the man that robbed you.</p>
               <p>Court to Stent. This young man says that the prisoner was taken into the parlour? - He was taken into the tap room first, and when the prosecutor said he was the man, he was taken into the parlour, and sat down.</p>
               <p>Did the prosecutor say, that if the man would confess and give him two shillings, he would forgive him? - He did not say any thing about confessing; but he said, if he had his two shillings again, he did not want to hurt him.</p>
               <p>Let me understand you clearly; did any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300107"></xptr> thing pass from the prosecutor, either in the tap room, or in the parlour, that implied he was doubtful that he was the man? - I pitched upon him, the moment he came into the tap room at first; I asked the prisoner if he had any money, he said no.</p>
               <p>This man swears that in your presence, and hearing, the prosecutor wanted to induce this man to confess? - I told the prosecutor, says I, if there is another confederate with him; for he told me himself, that the other man brought him into the premunire; that the other man took his part, that he should have been beat; he told me he took lodgings at the Three Tuns, in the Broad-way, and paid a shilling a week for his lodging.</p>
               <p>Court to Truss. What are you? - A hair dresser.</p>

               <p>I am a taylor; I was at the Shakespear's-head; I remember the prisoner being brought in, I believe it wanted about a quarter of ten.</p>
               <p>Do you remember when Bellinger came in? - I do; the prisoner had been in about five minutes I fancy, or not so long; Mr. Stent asked the prosecutor whether the prisoner was the man that robbed him, and he said he could swear blank to him; the prisoner was sitting in a box in the tap room.</p>
               <p>How came the prosecutor to see the prisoner first? - The prosecutor came into the house where the prisoner was; and this Mr. Stent shewed the prisoner to the prosecutor; he asked the prosecutor if he was the man that was robbed; there was several people in the room; they made room for the prosecutor; the prosecutor said he was the man that was robbed; says Stent, d - n you, this is the man that robbed you, pointing to the prisoner; or you are the man that robbed him, or something to that purpose; the prisoner was then taken into the parlour; and I heard the prosecutor say, he would freely forgive him, if he would pay him the two shillings he had been robbed off, and pay the expences of the people that were there; the prosecutor said, he did not want to hurt him, if he would give the two shillings back, and treat the watchman, and discharge the people.</p>

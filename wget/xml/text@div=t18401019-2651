                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Chapman, a cabinet-maker, in John-street, Holy well Mount. On the 11th of July, the prisoner came to look at the room I had to let—he then said he wanted to see my husband, who was not at home—he went away, and came again in a quarter of an hour—my husband was then at home—he took my husband away to carry a tool-chest for him—he said he was a carpenter—my husband went with him—in a quarter of an hour the prisoner came to me again—I said, "I was surprised to see him back so soon"—he said he left my husband tying the boxes up, and that my husband had sent him to ask me for all the moon I had got—all the money I could muster was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave him that—I should not have given it to him if he had not said my husband had sent him for it—I gave him two shillings, a sixpence, twelve halfpence, and twenty-four farthings.</p>

When I came in the prisoner called—he said he was the person come to take the lodging—he asked me if I would go and help him carry his chest as far as the George public-house in Shoreditch—I went with him, and in going down Holy well-lane he said, "Stop, I have forgotten, I must go to my <hi rend="italic">mate</hi> and fetch a basket"—he left, and told me he should be back in two or three minutes—he did not return—I did not authorise him to go to my wife to get what money she had—I would not have lent him any money—I saw him again last Thursday morning at Hoxton—I followed him to Booth-street, Charlotte-street—he then turned and faced me, and I gave him in charge.</p>

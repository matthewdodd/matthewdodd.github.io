                  </hi>. I am landlord of the New Duke's Head, Great Smith Street, Westminster—on 16th December the prisoners came in between 9 and 10 o'clock, and remained till past 12 o'clock—three or four others were with them, all drinking together—they ordered drink in turns—Smith ordered some drink at a little before 12 o'clock which came to 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a bad florin—I took no notice as I thought I should have some more given to me—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—about ten minutes afterwards Murray called for a pot of ale which came to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and gave me a florin—I gave him the change but did not think of looking at it because I knew him and did not think he would be Guilty of it—I afterwards tried it—found it was bad and told him so—he said "I will give your money back" and he gave me the 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and I gave him the florin broken—I afterwards gave Murray in charge, but not Smith as there was only one constable, but next morning while I was talking to a policeman I saw Smith and gave him in charge—when I cleared the till I put the money in my pocket—I afterwards found five bad florins among it—I handed them to the constable—I had no other money in my pocket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sure there was no access but through that hole? A. Yes; the office joins the inn - there is no communication between the inn and the office but through the yard - it is a large concern; Mr. Edward Sherman is the sole proprietor of the inn, and of all the coaches.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Do you know what parish it is in? A. It is St. Ann and St. Agnes - the coach office is the place where parcels are deposited.</p>

               <p>DEAR SIR - I received your parcel, and sorry I cannot give you the price you ask: the market price is much lower than when I dealt with you before: if you will take off 7 1/2 per cent. I can take the whole lot. your's, Sir, truly,

               <p>Q. How long do you thing you were in the coffee-room? A. I should think from half to three-quarters of an hour - during which time Gallawin went out once or twice; once he went to buy some string, as the waiter had not any - but he did not bring any; after the parcel was sealed and directed, he put it into his pocket; I did not see it again; he told me he was going to take it into the coach-office to book it; I waited at the coffee-room door while he went into the booking-office, and then we went to Williams' coffee-house in St. Martin's-le-grand.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the door of the coffee-room near the booking-office? A. It is on the right-hand side, and the other is on the left - you can see the door of one from the other; I saw him go in, and that was the only time I saw him go in there; he was absent a few minutes at the time he said he went to buy some string - I think four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. I believe you shortly after parted? A. Yes; he gave me a blue bag, and asked me to take it home - I took it to my own house; I saw him again on the Monday following - as near as I can recollect, he said he had a particular favour to ask me; I told him I would serve him in any thing I could - he said he had been making some speculations in business, he was afraid if they proved unfortunate he should lose his little all, and would I be kind enough to take care of two trunks for him - I told him he might put them in the workshop;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190074"></xptr>he said it was not a safe place, as the trunks were valuable, and the workshop was in the yard; he asked if I had a friend a little way from home - I said I had a sister - he had heard me speak of her, no doubt; her name is Haskins - she lives at Shepherd's-bush, and is the wife of Mr. Haskins a jeweller, of Regent-street; he asked me to go down the next day, and ask my sister's leave, which I did; he came the next day for an answer - I got my sister's permission, and told him so; he appointed me to meet him the next morning, which was Wednesday - he called at my house about ten o'clock, and we went as far as Newport-market; I was talking to a person whom I knew in the market, and he said "I will go on to the coffee-shop;" I rather think he said he had had no breakfast; I got to the coffee-shop in about half an hour - it is opposite the coach-stand in the Surrey-road, near the Rev. Rowland Hill's chapel; I found Galloway there - we then went in search of a carter to take away the trunks; we got a cart, after many inquiries, in Tower-street, Westminster-road, of one watling, I think; he did not tell me where the trunks were till after we had got the cart; he then pulled a piece of paper and a pencil out of his pocket, and told me to write down "No. 21, Richardson-street, Long-lane, Bermondsey;" he ran on first, and I and the carter went in the cart together - we overtook him just as we got up to Richardson-street; we saw him tying up his shoe; there is no thoroughfare in the street, and just as we were turning the cart round, I saw him knocking at the door - I saw a man and a tall woman, his wife - I now know that man's name is Garratt; I saw Gallawin. but I do not recollect seeing any other person; he and the carter brought out a small trunk first: the carter said to me, "You must assist with this other," and we all three assisted, and got the large one into the cart; Gallawin gave me a sovereign to pay the expenses on the road - he then went in, and we went away; the trunks were never brought on my premises - the carter and I took them to my sister's, at Shepherd's-bush, and left them there; Gallawin did not go with me; he called in the evening at my house; I told him what expenses I had been at on the road: I think he was waiting at my house when I came back - he then said he should be able to serve me or pay me for my trouble some time; I said I was perfectly satisfied with the way in which he had assisted me in my business: he had been a good customer. I called at Mrs. Haskin's towards the latter end of the month, and she told me she was going to remove further down into the country; I did not tell Gallawin of this. but the trunks remained with my sister till the 26th of september - I then took them to Kensington-square, to the house of Mr.

             Hamston - I frequently saw the prisoner the same as usual; he came to my house in December, and I told him my friend wanted the room in which the trunks were; he begged me to let them remain a week longer, as he did not know what he should do with them; on Sunday evening, the 21st of December, he called again, and said he had engaged with a man to take them away the next morning, and had got a friend who would take them; he appointed to come to me with a horse and cart on Monday morning at ten o'clock - he came into my shop, and went with me to the horse and cart in Goswell-street; one Lloyd was the driver - I had never seen him before; I got into the cart with Lloyd; Gallawin said to him, "Drive on fast Tom, and do as this gentleman directs;" Gallawin did not go with us - I took Lloyd and the cart to the Rose and Crown public-house, just through Knightsbridge turnpike; I left Lloyd there, and went on to Kensington-square; I met my brother there by appointment - I got the trunks from Hamston's; I then came back to the Rose and Crown, at Knightsbridge, where I gave the cart and the trunks in it to Lloyd; I went back, and my brother followed the cart - this was on the 22d of December; I gave Lloyd no direction, for I did not know where he was to take them to: Gallawin had given me no further direction, but to give them to Lloyd - in the evening, Gallawin came to my house much agitated; he said, "Where did you leave that fellow?" meaning the carman with the cart; I told him I had left the man and the cart just beyond Knightsbridge; he said, "At Mr. Davies'? I hope you have not deceived me;" he only sat down a minute; he said, "I am in a great burry - I will take a cabriolet, and see if I can find him;" he said he had somebody with him, but I saw no one - he came again the next evening, which was the 23d, and said, "Mr. Davies, have you heard the news?" meaning the loss of his trunks; I said, Yes, I had seen the account in the newspapers about the trunks being taken; he said, "Oh, it will be my ruin, and it will break my wife's heart;" he said he had eaten nothing all day; he called again in February, a few days before he was taken - it was before the February Session, and on a Monday; he said he was very poor, and wanted money, as they expected him over the water to pay Lloyd for loss of time and expenses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have thought a great deal about this; does it not occur to you that it is the strangest story that ever was heard? A. No, it does not. I knew his family, and he knew mine; he represented this as his own business; I did not know of any speculation - I wrote as he directed; I thought nothing particular of writing a letter in another man's name; I did not know but it was his friend's name - I parted with him that night about eight o'clock; I may have been in the office at the Bull and Mouth to take a parcel or two - I recollect going there many years ago, and only that once that I recollect; it was to take a place in the Union coach to go to Ireland; it must be twenty years ago - it was on the 7th or 8th that he called on me and told me of these two trunks - I had not seen any thing in the newspaper about large property having been taken from the Bull and Mouth; I seldom see a paper - I knew nothing of it; Gallawin represented himself as a jeweller, and I worked for him as such; I knew nothing of his business, but he said he had made a speculation, and must have the trunks put somewhere; I had no supposition as to whether trunks of this size were full of jewellery - I do not know how he traded; it did not strike me as at all strange; I did it to serve him, and to give his trunks house room; my wife saw him at my house, and there was a gentleman named Boyle at my house, who lodged with me - he is gone to America, I believe: he has been gone this four months; if I had been aware, I could tell you exactly the date; I do not know that the prisoner went to Shepherd's-bush while they were there - I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190075"></xptr>two or three times, but I did not see the trunks; I went with my brother to fetch them; the prisoner did not go - he trusted all to me; the people at Kensington-square and at my sister's, never saw the prisoner; he hired the cart of Lloyd - I told Lloyd nothing, but to wait while I went to fetch the trunks; I went from Knightsbridge to Kensington-square - the cart could have driven right up to the door, but I left it there; I had no suspicion of any thing wrong - I had no occasion to suspect him; on the 23d of December he came again - I had the good fortune to read the newspaper that day: I did not go to the Stamp-office to tell them all about it; my brother communicated it: I told my brother the dilemma I had got into at that time - that was a few days before they were stopped in the cart; I did not know they were stamps - the dilemma I was in was being acquainted with the prisoner, and having these trunks in my possession; I had no notion of what they contained, but I told my brother I suspected there was something wrong, and advised with him how to act - he said "Leave it to me, and I will act in the best way I can:" I did not know any thing about stamps till they were taken from Lloyd; I dare say my brother made a communication at that time, but I did not; I did know of the robbery at the Bull and Mouth, but not till December; I was living all the time in Sutton-street: I have told the truth as far as I can judge - it was a little time before Christmas, perhaps about the 20th; it was just before Lloyd was taken: a friend of the prisoner's (for whom I had done business) called and told me - I do not know his name, he is a man the prisoner introduced to me; I then told my brother about the dilemma I was in; I proceeded to remove the stamps with the help of the cart, on the 22d of December - I never told a police-officer or a solicitor; I told my brother I received these trunks, and I understood they contained some valuable property belonging to the Stamp-office; that was before I assisted to remove them with Lloyd; I was first spoken to, to tell what I knew, a short time before Gallawin was taken - it must have been the beginning of January.</p>

               <p>Mr. GURNEY. Q. How long before he was taken up did he call on you? A. Four or five days - the person who gave me information was a person who he had introduced to me; he came once or twice, and said if I would give up the property I had in my possession belonging to Gallawin, he should be able to give me a sum of money and at last he said they were stamps belonging to Government, and if I would give them up to him he would give me 500l.; I refused it, and made the communication to my brother - he desired me to leave it to him, and he would do the best the could to get me out of the dreadful scrape I had got into.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many conversations had you with this person? A. He came first with a diamond pin to repair, and again two or three days following - that was before he told me the contents; I did not ask his name, and he did not tell me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DAVIFS. I am brother to Stephen Davies and am a mariner. I assisted my brother in removing some trunks from Haskins' to Hamston's, on a Saturday, I think the 26th of September; on the 22d of December I was at Kensington-square before he arrived - he and I put the trunks into a cart; there was no one in the cart then - I saw him go on the road to Knightsbridge; before that time my brother had told me what he had been informed was in the trunks - in consequence of which I went to the Stamp-office, and gave information to a police-officer; I saw my brother get out of the 
cart at Knightsbridge, and a man got in - I never lost sight of it 
till it was stopped.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You call yourself a mariner, what do you mean by that? A. I mean, the last situation I held was captain's-steward, on board an Indiaman - I went to India; that is three years ago -I have followed ivory-turning, to which I was an apprentice; I was with a brother-in-law, my sister's husband, who had a coffee and smoking room in King-street, Covent-garden - I was a servant or waiter at that Divan, because I had seen hooker smoking abroad, and could put him in the way of it; I had no wages, but perquisites - I have made two voyages to India, both in the capacity of captain's under-steward; I went with Captain Stevens, of the Coldstream Guards, and Captain Drummond, of the Castle Huntley - I had property of my own after my father's decease, to support me since I left my brother; my brother asked me to accompany him to Kensington, and I did - he said what he had to remove was very weighty, and he could not do it himself; I went to see my sister also - I have been in the habit of reading the newspapers frequently, and walking the streets daily - upon my oath I never read or saw any account of the loss of these stamps from the Bull and Mouth till after he asked me to go and remove the trunks; I think it was in the middle of November I saw it in the Morning Advertiser - I never heard of it, or read it before, on my oath; I did not speak to my brother about it when I read it in the Morning Advertiser, to the best of my knowledge -I might in general conversation; I never did, in the month of November, to the best of my knowledge, except in the course of conversation - I never remember saying any thing to him about it; it would not have struck me at all - I mentioned to my brother that I read it in the Morning Advertiser, but not at that time, I am confident; it was not till the stamps were seized at the turnpike - I did not then know what they were, only by information; I never knew what they were: my brother informed me that the boxes were not the property of the party who placed them there.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, do you swear that in that sentence you have given the whole sum and substance of that conversation? A. He told me he had information that the property in those trunks was not the property of the person who placed them there; I give that, upon due deliberation, as the conversation, to the best of my recollection - I had given the information at Somerset-house previous to this; from information received in the first instance from my brother - I had no information from my brother that they were stamps; I did not hear his evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if he has sworn that before the stamps were stopped at Knightsbridge, he had told you the trunks contained property belonging to the Stamp-office, is that true? A. I received information in his presence - he told me he suspected the property in them did not belong to the party who left them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your brother tell you himself that the property belonged, as he was told, to the Stamp-office, before the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190076"></xptr>stamps were stopped at Knightsbridge? A. My brother told me that he had information that the property in these boxes was the property of the Stamp-office - there was no other person present when he told me so.</p>


               <p>Q. Who was the third person whom you said was present that gave you the information? A. I never saw him - I was hidden while he was giving information to my brother: I think my brother told me that he supposed this property belonged to the Stamp-office, the day before the person gave him the information in my presence - it was the latter end of November, or beginning of December; it must be in December; not a week - not many days before they were stopped; my brother first told me he suspected the property contained in the trunks did not belong to the person who placed them there, and he should be told by the person what they were; he said that person was a friend of Gallawin's, and he had done several jobs for him, being introduced by Gallawin - I do not recollect that he told me how long he had known him; I told my brother I considered he had got into the hands of villains, who would try to make a dupe of him, but I would secrete myself, and get what information I could from him - my brother knew I was hiding; my brother asked him first what he supposed the property to be, and he said he would give him a sum for it; my brother asked what he supposed them to be - he said Gallawin was a rogue, and he would make a dupe of him, and the sooner he got rid of those things that he had in his possession the better - my brother said, "What property is it? - you must know, as you seem to have such a wish for it;" he then said, "I will not keep you longer in suspence," or words to that effect, "They are stamps belonging to the Stamp-office," and he would give him 500l. if he would place them in his possession; my brother then said, "It is a serious thing - I little expected any thing of this sort; I cannot give you an answer now, I will see you to-morrow" - I do not recollect any other conversation; he went away; I do not recollect his expressing his surprise at the robbery at the Stamp-office; I do not think he did - if he asked him what stamps they were, it has escaped my memory; this was about a week before the stamps were stopped at Knightsbridge - I did not know from my brother that it was not till after the stamps were stopped, that he read in the newspapers what they contained; I asked this person's name, and he told me he did not know his name - my brother did not ask him his name at that time - I never was in his presence but that once, to my knowledge; I never knew my brother any thing but a jeweller - situated as I was, I did not know how to act; this took place in my brother's work-shop - I could have seized the man; when my brother told me he was to meet him the next day, I said, "Let me he present, and if you will leave it to me I will consider how best to act" - I therefore thought it would be better not to take the parties, but give information at the Stamp-office; I knew my brother had two trunks, and what this man had said, but I did not then know what was in the trunks.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. But you watched them till the officer took them? A. Yes.</p>

            . I have known Gallawin between five and six years - he came to my husband on the 3d of September; they went out together: before my husband went out, he asked me for some paper - I had not heard any particular request which the prisoner made to him, only he asked him to bring him some paper; when my husband came home that night he brought a bag, with a great coat in it - in a day or two after the prisoner called, asked for Mr. Davies, and asked me for the bag that he gave Mr. Davies; I gave it him, with the great coat in it - I frequently saw him at my husband's, between that time and the 21st of December; on the evening of the 21st of December I saw him at the door, and they had some conversation, but I do not know what it was - next morning, the 22d, I saw him again; he and my husband went out together - he came back the same evening, and appeared much agitated; he came in very quick, and said, "Mr. Davies, that fellow has not come back yet - I have been waiting all day for him, where did you leave him?" my husband said"Opposite the Rose and Crown, below Knightsbridge, about one o'clock, with the horse, cart and trunks, quite safe;" he said he would go down the road, and see if he could hear or see any thing of him - this was about six o'clock in the evening; he then went away, and I saw him the next evening - he came and asked Mr. Davies if he had heard the news; he said, "Yes, I have seen it in the newspaper."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you any memorandum-book in which you minuted down all these things? A.

            . I am a painter, and live at No. 21, Richardson-street, Long-lane, Bermondsey. I know Sewell ever since I was at school - we are no relations that I know of, but I have known him nearly thirty years; he called upon me in September last, I think, but I cannot be quite certain - he said a friend of his, or a person he knew, wanted to save a few things, and would I take care of them, or allow them to be brought to my house; I assented to it, and wanted to know when they would come; he did not seem rightly to know - I think they came the following morning, about eight o'clock, as near as I can recollect; he was at the door when I opened it - there was a vehicle, whether a cart or a chaise-cart I cannot say; it was drawn by one horse - there were two other persons with Sewell; I do not know whether there were any more - I did not know those persons then; I was not dressed; having opened the door, I ran back to my room, took the key, opened the front door, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190077"></xptr>pushed it open for them to put whatever they brought in- I slept in the back room: I did not at that time see what they brought in; I went to dress myself - when I returned I saw Sewell, and either be or one of the other parties said something to me - I cannot say positively who it was; I afterwards went into the room, and saw there were three largish parcels - they might be the size of this parcel, or smaller; they were not larger - they were in what I should call a sack, as if you took a sack and wrapped them up; one stood on the other two, on the top of my little drawers, and the size of this one makes me think that they would not have lain very comfortably on my drawers, as they are but small ones - I saw the parcels again the week following; a person then came to my door, and when I opened it, I recollected him to be one of the persons who came when the things were brought; in consequence of what he said I expected something to be brought, and a large trunk came, which was taken into the front room; I did not see any thing done with it, but when I came into the room again there were two trunks, and from the disappearance of the parcels I supposed they were put into them; Sewell came afterwards, and I told him that these things were going to be removed, or something to that purpose - I took him to the front room, and, to the best of my recollection, the person who came first was then cording the trunks; he went away, and Sewell remained with me; after that a cart came to the door - the person had been gone but a very short time; I thought he went for some persons, or for a vehicle, but he did not come with the cart; three persons came - I cannot swear whether Gallawin was one; my belief is that he was a young man - I cannot swear that he was the man- I did not know either of the other men: there are two men who say they are the men - I now know Stephen Davies, but if he had not told me he was one, I should not have known him; these things were put into the cart by the carter and Stephen Davies - the cart was driven away; one of the men remained a few moments, and took a lunch with us - whether one or two lunched, I cannot be certain; I was going out, and there was a bit of lunch on the table.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been a painter? A. Fifteen years, ever since I was first apprenticed - I never was a tailor, nor represented myself as such; I could not recollect at first whether this might not be in October - I now think it must be September, but am not certain: I think it is within this fortnight that I first told of Sewell calling on me; I went to the Stamp-office, but it was not there I told it- I told it to a gentleman, whose name I believe is Mr. Tebbs; I was sent for by an officer of Queen-square - I remember Maltwood and Woodberry being examined; I was asked to put my hat on, and I did - I did not know Maltwood before that morning, when we passed him with the officers, and they spoke to him; I have bought a trunk of Maltwood - I once lived at No. 12, Kennington-lane; I have been at Bow-street - I was at Bow-street once on a charge; I will swear I have not been there half a dozen times - it is a long time ago; I do not recollect having been there since, not lately - if it was a long time back I should recollect it the better.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been at Union-hall on your own account? A. I do not recollect; I do not recollect ever being charged with uttering bad money at Union-hall; I have been in Horsemonger-lane, but not as a prisoner, only as a visitor - I do not think I ever was within the gates of Cold Bath-fields prison; I never was there for six months.</p>

               <p>Q. Well, that was one occurrence; were you ever at Bow-street alone, or without John Smith? A.

               <p>Q. Have you since that time been a dealer in dead bodies? A. No, I never have to my knowledge; I may have been to St. Bartholomew's-hospital with persons who died afterwards - I have been there, and at other hospitals, and there might have been dead bodies there.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. -In September last I remember three parcels coming to my house - I saw them in the evening; they were similar to this, but I think not quite so large - they were all the same size, within a little: I know the person who calls himself Sewell - his name is Greenwood; I have known him twenty years, I believe. I saw the three parcels on a small chest of drawers behind the door: they were there till some time in the next week - I remember a sort of square box or trunk coming while they were there - I was not at my own door when it was taken in; I went in while it was there, with a small latch-key, and went to the other room - I saw the trunk when the persons came to the door; I only saw one, but when they were ready there were two: I did not see Mr. Sewell that day till they were ready to go - there were three men with the cart; Mr. Davies was one of them, as I have heard, but I did not know him: I opened the door to a young man, but cannot say whether it was Gallawin - I cannot recollect him; I have been shewn him before, but it seemed to me to be a younger man - I cannot swear that it was not him; the trunks went away directly, in the cart, Mr. Davies (as they call him) and the carter went away; the young man put on his hat, and he and Greenwood went away - they did step into the back room, to a bit of lunch; they did not sit down - one, if not both, took a bit after the trunks were gone; I did not see any more of the young man - I did not see Greenwood again till I saw him at Queen-square.</p>

Davies got in - he had in his hand a piece of paper, with No.21, Richardson-street on it - whether Bermondsey was on it or not I cannot say; I did not know where Richardson-street was, and Davies did not appear to know; we stopped, and inquired at a butcher's-shop - we went to No. 21.

             - we had a cottage at Shepherd's-bush; I had two trunks brought there in September last - my brother had spoken to me about them before; I think on the 8th or 9th he asked if I would have two trunks brought there, and they came on the 10th; I was not at home, and did not see them come, but I came home before they were taken out of the cart - my brother and a man who I think was Watling was with him; they remained in the same state till the 27th, I think, when they were taken away by Stephen and Thomas Davies.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Which of your brothers asked you to take charge of them? A. Stephen - he said they were for a friend of his; he did not say any thing about their containing valuable property - they were placed in a public room: he did not tell me they contained the all of a dear friend - they were in the room where my servant slept, and no particular care taken of them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you known Davies long? A. About thirty years: Stephen said they belonged to a friend of his, and asked me to let them be there; he did not say they were valuable, nor tell me to put them in any particular safe place.</p>

            . I am a working jeweller, and live at No. 31, City Garden-place, City-road. I know Stephen Davies and the prisoner Gallawin - I have frequently seen him at Davies' house; I believe Gallawin is a travelling jeweller; I have always considered him as such; I have seen him at Davies on that business; I saw Gallawin at Davies' on the Monday before Christmas day, about ten o'clock in the morning: Stephen Davies was in the shop when Gallawin came in; they both went from the shop with me into the house, staid a few minutes, then returned into the yard, and were in conversation there; Gallawin then came into the shop, and Davies went into the house; he was absent a little while, and then came again with his coat off into the shop; he brought some work into the shop; Gallawin told him to make haste, or they should be too late- Davies then went into the house, returned in a few minutes, and they both went away together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When were you first asked about all this? A. About three weeks ago, I was sent for - I have a house of my own, and work for Davies sometimes; I recollected the time, because there was a silver dessert spoon lying on the place - Gallawin took it up, and asked me if it was not a good one.</p>

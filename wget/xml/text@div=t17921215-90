               <p>Q. How lately before had you seen this gown and shirt? - I sent her up on the 29th of October, and I missed them on the first of November, I put the gown in the box, on Monday morning, and the shirt on the horse on Tuesday night; it was the day afterwards on Wednesday that I missed the shirt; on the Saturday after, one Mrs. Fitzgerald says to me, have you lost your shirt? Yes, I have, says I, says she, you must come over to Mr. Dover's, the pawnbroker's, and see whether it is your shirt; and I went over and it was my shirt.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Dover, this shirt was brought and I took it in on Tuesday, the gown was pledged on the 29th, we stopped the shirt, did not take it in; it was brought by a person, who called herself Fitzgerald, she pledged the gown in that name. The person that brought it, was admitted an evidence against this girl, and she has run away; she brought the shirt and we asked her whose it was, she said it was Fitzgerald's, I told her I would take it in of Fitzgerald, but I would not take it in of her; she fetched Mrs. Fitzgerald, and Mrs. Fitzgerald came; and she said this girl has brought me to own a shirt, that I know nothing about; she said that the girl lived at the Bell, a public house in Newtoner-street, a servant, she did live at the Bell, and we sent over to her master; then immediately Mrs. Fitzgerald found out that this woman lost her things, either this day or the day after.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. All you know about this girl's taking them is, that when you taxed her with it, she then said she had given them to her mother? - She did, and nobody else goes into the room but the prisoner and me, and two children; she said she met her mother in the street, and gave them to her.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to her character, and who proved she was not rightly in her senses at times.</p>

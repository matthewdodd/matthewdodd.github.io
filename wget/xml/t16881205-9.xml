            </rs>. The Evidence for the King was, That the Prisoner and two others came into the house of the deceased, being a private house, and demanded Ale; which being denied, one of them proceeded to ask for Whores, and Swords being drawn, fell to breaking the Windows, which occasioned the Skirmish, in which the Woman of the house was pricked in the back, and Henric received a mortal Wound of which he languished till the 14th of November, and then died. And much about the same time, or somewhat before, died Hacket of the Wound he had received of Henric. In Extenuation of this Charge, the Prisoner pleaded, That Henric's Wife had broke his Sword before any Wounds were given, and render'd him altogether incapable of contributing to the death of her Husband: But the Evidence being sum'd up, and the Law in that Case approved to extend to Aiders and Abetters, as well as to the Party immediately committing the Fact, the Jury, upon a second going out, brought Mr. Hussy in <rs id="t16881205-9-verdict40" type="verdictDescription">

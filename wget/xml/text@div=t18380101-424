                  </hi>. I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 28th of November I met the prisoner in Mary-street, Whitechapel—at soon as I came up to her, I told her I wanted her, she must go with me—she asked what for—I told her it was on suspicion of being concerned with other parties in uttering forged notes—she said, "I know nothing about forged notes, I can neither read nor write"—I told her I should go home with her, and search her place—she said I was welcome, she could not be accountable for any thing her husband had done—I went to her house in Infant School-yard, and after a little time got in—I asked her for the key first—she said she had not got it—I tried to force the door, but could not—I left her in the custody of another person, while I went round and got in it the back of the house—after I had got into the house, and brought her in, I vest up stairs—I took her up stairs with me, and searched her person, but found nothing on her—in searching the bed, between the mattress and bed-sacking, I saw a piece of newspaper lying, folded up—I took it out, and said to her, "What is In this?"—she said, "I do not know any thing about it"—I unfolded it, and found it contained four £5 and two £10 notes—I folded them up, and put them into my pocket—I desired her to put her clothes on, and brought her away in custody to Lambeth-street—nothing more passed—these are the notes I found—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—I put my name on the back of them all before they were out of my posses<lb></lb>sion—these are the same notes, and this is the newspaper I found them in.</p>

                  </hi>. I let houses, and receive rents for parties. I know the prisoner, and know the house in Infant-School-yard—I let that house to a man named Jones—I do not think there is any number to the house—I let it to him some time in June or July, I believe, or it may be later—the prisoner paid me the rent, till within this month or six weeks—she paid it, generally, weekly, but sometimes it ran a few weeks—the last rent I received from her was two months ago, I believe.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are sure it was since May you let the home to the man calling himself Jones? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I saw him on the premises—another man he knew lived there before, and he said, "I shall leave, and Jones will take it"—Jones did not pay me any money in advance—he did not pay me a sovereign in advance—he paid me some arrears of the former tenant—I believe it was about a sovereign.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of a blacksmith, and lire in the same yard as the prisoner, in the adjoining house. My husband has blacksmith's shop directly opposite—we agreed with Mr. Isley to take it, and pay him the rent—I know the prisoner—our shop is a little lower, and when the prisoner gave up a stable, we took it to enlarge our shop-we commenced the rent of the stable about the 29th of last May, and held the key previous to that—I was present when the agreement was made, and the key dame from Mrs. Jones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you mean it came from her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We knocked at the door, and nobody answered—the key was in the street door, there was a little girl there, who went on errands for Mrs. Jones—I went across to get the girl to go to Mrs. Jones, as she was very ill in bed—the girl was not at home—her sister came across—I sent the sister into Mrs. Jones's house, and she brought me back the key of the stable—during that time Mrs. Jones has lived in that house up to last Tuesday five weeks, when she was taken up—I cannot exactly say whether she was living alone in the house for some months before—there were many followers—she occupied the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had she any lodgers in the house who slept there at night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—I have heard footsteps in the house at night, of more than one person—I might have heard them the night before she was taken up, or the night before that—there was not more than one bed in the house, for I went in with the officer to search the house, and then was but one.</p>

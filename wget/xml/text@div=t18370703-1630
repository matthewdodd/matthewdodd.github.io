I lived next door to the prisoner last years—I have known him more than a year—I had my leg broken once, and he knew that I was lame—In June last, Mr. Cafe the auctioneer of great Marlborough-street owned me some money for property he had sold. On Friday the 16th of June, I started from house about five o'clock with the prisoner to go to Mr. Cafe to receive the money—I told him what I was going for, and asked him to go with me—when I got to Mr. Cafe's the prisoner sat quite close to me when I received the money—here is Mr. Cafe's memorandum of it—it was 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had a £10 note, four £5 notes, and the rest in cash—about eight in the city—I had twenty—eight sovereigns in my purse, when I left home to go to Mr. Cafe's—I put the notes and money I received from Mr. Cafe on the top of Mr. Cafe's—I put money I had in my purse—the prisoner was close to me at the time, and must have seen where I placed it—we went together from Mr. Cafe's to a public-house in Oxford market—I had no watch, and cannot tell the time exactly—we left my house about half-past six o'clock—Mr. Cafe's is about two miles form my house—we walked very slowly, I being lame—I had a pint of ale of Oxford market, to the best of my recollection, and no more—I was quite sober—to the best of my recollection there was nobody in the room of the public-house abut ourselves—I took out my purse there, took out the notes and handed them to the prisoner, and asked him to put down the numbers, because I had not my spectacles—I handed him a pencil for the purpose—he took the memorandum at some distance from me, and said it was all right, and I put my notes back into my purse, which I put into my left-hand browsers pocket—I did not button my pocket—I kept my hand on the money to keep it safe—we left the public-house together, and went along to the croner of Edgware-road constantly together—I was not interrupted by anybody to the best of my recollection—the prisoner proposed to at the New Inn, Edgware-road, and we stopped—he asked for beer—I do not know whether he drank it, I took</p>

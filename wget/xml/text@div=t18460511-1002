                  </hi>. I live in Horseferry-road, Westminster. The deceased, John Stack, was my husband—he was a labouring man—On Sunday, the 23rd of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was at the prisoner's house—the prisoner, his wife, John Spurling, and several other persons were in the room drinking—we had a bottle of rum, and half a gallon of half-and-half—about a quarter to twelve o'clock Mrs. Houlahan came in rather tipsy, and wanted more drink—the prisoner was tipsy as well, and Stack also, we were all tipsy—I stood up and took Mrs. Houlahan into her bed-room—she got sick, and said she did not like two persons who were in the room—I said I would get them out as quick as I could, and not to mind them—I came into the room, and told them all to go home to their own places—my husband was in the room—when I told them to go home the prisoner seemed not to like that, and began to show insolence to me—Stack did not like that, and the prisoner and Stack had some words together—Stack said he thought himself as good a man as the prisoner—the prisoner said, "I don't know that"—Mrs. Houlahan hearing that, came out of the bed-room—I took her to her room again, and had not been there five minutes before this happened—I did not see the blow given, as I was in the bed-room—my daughter came to me and gave an alarm—I went out and saw my husband lying on the floor, between the stairs and</p>

I was at Mr. Houlahan's house on this night—there was a dispute between Mr. Stack and the prisoner—I was in the back room, when I came out there was a scuffle—I saw the prisoner strike Stack with a poker—that was the first blow I saw struck—I bad not heard any blow given before I saw that blow struck—I had heard a good many words between them—they called each other names—I beard the word "liar"—I was in the bed-room, heard a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, and came out—the blow was struck as I came out—before the blow was struck they were scuffling, laying hold of each other—the prisoner gave Stack one blow with bis fist—I saw that when I came out of the bed-room—that was the first blow I saw struck—then afterwards the prisoner took up the poker and struck him—I did not see Stack strike a blow—I only saw two blows struck, both by the prisoner, one with his fist, and the other with a poker.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a servant out of place. I was at the prisoner's house on Sunday night, and recollect the dispute between Mr. Stack, the pri<lb></lb>soner, and Mrs. Stack—I went there about ten o'clock—they were all sitting comfortably, drinking—Mrs. Hoolahan had a drop too much, and went to bed—Mrs. Stack went into the room with her, and so did I—Mrs. Stack came out of the room, and said to the prisoner, "I have put <hi rend="italic">Kit</hi> to bed"—the prisoner answered, "It is" no more than your being put to bed yourself; out of my place"—Mr. Stack said to the prisoner, "Why did you not have at her?"—Mrs. Stack went down stairs—she returned again, and said to the prisoner, if she could not read she could spell—the prisoner said, "<hi rend="italic">In what in</hi>, Mrs. Stack?"—she said, "Never mind; I defy you or any man to say that you took advantage of me, you dirty scoundrel"—they had very hot words—Mrs. Stack called the prisoner all manner of names, abusing him—Mrs. Stack said she was reared better than him—he said he was reared better than her—Mr. Stack jumped off his chair, and said to the prisoner, "You b—liar," and pulled off his coat, and challenged to fight him—the prisoner had his hand on Mrs. Stack's shoulder, and Mr. Stack said, "All you can do is to give us the <hi rend="italic">sack</hi> in the morning"—Mrs. Stack had said to the prisoner, "You are <hi rend="italic">bouncible</hi> now, you can give us a title"—Stack and the prisoner got hold of one another—I do not know who struck first, but they struck blows—I did not see both strike, but they caught hold of one another—I am sure they both struck—no one interfered between them then—Stack got hold of the prisoner by the throat with his left hand—there was the mark of his four fingers on one side, and of his thumb on the other—the mark was made with his nails—they aggravated the prisoner very much, both Mr. and Mrs. Stack, and <hi rend="italic">Mike</hi> Flannagan and <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Sculley parted them, and he had hold of Stack, putting him out; and directly they were parted, the prisoner took up the poker and instantly flung it at him as he was taken to the door—he threw the poker out of his hand—it quitted his hand—he took it up and flung it at the door—it is a good sized room—the door was as far from the fender as I am from his lordship—they were both very drunk—he threw the poker as if it flew out of his hand—it struck Stack on one side of the head, just above the ear—I think the other two had hold gf him—they let go, and he fell down immediately—I cannot say whether the prisoner intended to throw the poker at Stack or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Westminster Hospital. On Monday morning, the 23rd of March, the deceased was brought to the hospital in a state of stupor—he was not sensible—he had an immense confusion on the left side of hit temple, two small punctured wounds over the contusion, a little above the front of the right ear—they were very small indeed—I was not satisfied with the condition of the man—there was moie than I could account for, and I made an incision, and examined his scull, and found it extensively fractured—that was the day he came in—he died on the Friday—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the scuff was driven in to the extent of about half a crown on the brain—the brain itself was excessively lacerated and inflamed, and the membranes inflamed, and a considerable quantity of matter pressing upon the brain—a blow with a poker would be likely to produce such injuries—I think if a poker had been thrown at the distance of fifteen feet it would have caused such an injury.</p>

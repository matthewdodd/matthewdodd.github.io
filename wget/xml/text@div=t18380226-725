On Saturday, the 25th of January, the prisoner was pointed out to me, passing by my son's home—I went to him, and told him that my son had been robbed, and he was suspected of it—he said he was perfectly innocent—I said if he was, would he go with me, and clear himself at the station-house—he said he had no objection whatever, and went with me—I gave him in charge.</p>

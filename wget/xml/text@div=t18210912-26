The prisoner came on the 30th of March, 1820, to lodge with me, and remained there till the 3d of July, 1820; on that day, he came into tea at the usual time, then went out almost directly - I was serving at the counter, while he was at his tea, and turning my eye to the parlour, I saw the tea caddy moved from one end of the table to the other; I saw his hand drawn from it. He went out directly, and said he should be back in an hour; but he never returned. His clothes are at my house now. About a quarter of an hour after he was gone I went to put the caddy in its place again, and six 1 l., notes were gone - there was 20 s., in silver, which remained. I saw them safe half an hour before he came in, and I had just put it together to pay my rent. I sent to Worship-street, his master sent the word, where he was to be found, and an officer of Queen-square, took him in Great Peter-street, on the 27th of July last. I had not seen him for twelve months, nobody was in the room but him. He slept there with me.</p>

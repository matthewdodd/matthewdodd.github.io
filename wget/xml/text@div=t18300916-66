            . I am Woodley's grandson. On the 10th of July I saw all the prisoners at the house, and old Beason also - they slept there that night, and next morning (Sunday), about eleven o'clock, I found the box, but about six that morning I heard the two Beasons call Puddifoot - I got up, and went down; Puddifoot was then lying on the bed with his clothes on; on the next bed to that I and my grandfather slept on, and in the same room - I do not know whether he had undressed at night; I went down stairs - Thomas Beason, who was coming along the passage, called to me, and said, "Come along old mates, we have got the back cellar door open;" I saw Samuel Beason coming out of the cellar with some scy the handles, which had been left there; the cellar door is inside the house - they called again for Puddifoot, and when he came down, they went away together up the road with the scythes and handles; the window of Beason's room looks on the orchard, and is large enough for the box to be put through - the street door was open when I came down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you went down, the street-door was open? A. Yes; that leads to the road, not to the orchard - the room my grandfather slept in has a door into Beason's room - we go through that room to get to ours; I had not seen the box since the 26th of June; they did not know I was getting up till I came down - they were in my view till they went out, which was in less than a quarter of an hour; they had not got the box - the orchard is at the back of the house; old Beason was left behind - the window is on the first floor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You did not go into the room where the box was after the men had gone? A. No; I went to breakfast - I did not see either of them return to the house; they told me they lived at Bovington.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was it standing on its side, or how? A. On its bottom; the hole was not in it then, for I lifted it up to dust it, and the papers would have fallen out if there had been a hole in it - I lifted it up at one end to wipe the side; I did not tell the Magistrate so because I was not asked - I was not up when they went away; old Beason was at our house the whole day; I do not know where he is now - he was taken up; the box might be got down from the window without my hearing it, while we were busy in the evening.</p>

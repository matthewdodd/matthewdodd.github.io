            . I am constable; on the 13th of March I was sent for to Mr. Mare's in St. Martin's-court, he gave me a search-warrant to search all the people's boxes that lodged in the house; when I came to search the prisoner's box, I found this parcel of things here produced. The prosecutrix said it was her bundle, and he was very much confused, nor can I tell what answers he made just then, he confessed before he went out of the room that he had taken the things, and he said the same before the justice; he had carried away the silk petticoat to another house, he said, at his being asked for it, he would fetch it, so I went with him into Market-lane, there we found it, and I brought it back.</p>

               <p>A woman was in my room with these things in her apron; she desired I would let her lay them down on my box, and she would come up to me soon again; she laid them down; I staid an hour and half, but she did not come; then I took and locked them up in my box, and left the key in it; this was about three weeks before they were missed.</p>

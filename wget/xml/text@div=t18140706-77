            . I am a constable; I live in Bennet-street, Westminster. My house is about forty yards from the prosecutrix's; my house is in one street, and there is an another the back yards joins. I went out in the yard; I saw a man jump from the wall. When I went into Bennet-street, he ran up to the top of the street. A person get hold of the prisoner by the collar; he said, you are a constable take this man into custody. I took him down towards the watchhouse; I heard there was a yard robbed of ne in Lewisham-street. I went into Lewisham-street in the yard of No. 10, I found a shirt, a frock, and a great coat of the prisoner's in the pocket of the great coat, were two keys. The shirt and the frock were taken from No. 15; I found them in the yard No. 13. The next day, I took the prisoner before the magistrate. I produce the property. This latch key opened the door of the empty house.</p>
               <p>MR. PARR. On the night of the 25th of May, I was coming home; I was going to knock at the door of my lodging, a lady called me on the opposite side of the way, she told me there were thieves in the next house; she begged me to go and inform Mr. Denham, the landlord of the empty house; I went in the landlord, and knocked at the door, and while I was standing at his door, I heard the door of the empty house open, I approached the empty house; I saw the prisoner come out, followed by another man; I stopped the prisoner; the other man passed me. I brought the prisoner back, and gave him into the hands of Garner, the constable.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The frock and shirt are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went that way to ease myself, the cry of stop thief was called; I jumped up to see what was the matter. I was not in the empty house, nor in the yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clothier, of 28, St. John-street, Clerkenwell—on Tuesday, 28th January, about 1 o'clock in the night, I was passing along Golden—lane, and the prisoner stepped out from a dark door<lb></lb>way, and hit me a violent blow on the side of my head with his fist, which knocked me down—he kicked me on my hips, knelt on my stomach, unbuttoned my coat, or rather tore the buttons off, and pulled it open—we struggled together—I got him by the collar and pulled him over me, which baffled his intention—I got up, and found three men and two women sur<lb></lb>rounding me—I cried out, "Police!"—a constable came up, and the prisoner ran away—we chased him through several courts into Golden-lane, crying out "Stop, him"—he was stopped by a constable, whose fingers he took hold of and wrenched them back, so that he has been under medical treatment</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186302020036"></xptr>
               <p>ever since—he then sprang at the constable who gave chose with me, caught him by the hair, and dragged him to the ground—I tried to extricate his grasp and he got hold of my hand, put it in his mouth, and bit me on the knuckles, so that I have the marks now—two more constables then came up, and he pretended to be drunk, and laid down, but suddenly he took hold of one of the constables by the legs, and tried to lift him and throw him over, but we caught him—the prisoner then got up and kicked and plunged about—it took four constables to take him to the station—the three women, whom I had seen in rising from the ground, then came to me and gave me a hit or two, but a sergeant and six constables came up and then the women ran away—the prisoner was very violent at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I heard a cry, ran and saw the prisoner kneeling on the prosecutor—as soon as he saw me he got up and ran away through several courts, I and the prosecutor after him—my brother constables caught him—I took the prisoner by the collar—he seized me by the hair, and dragged me to the ground—more officers came up, and we took him to the station—on the way there he was very violent indeed—he bit the pro<lb></lb>secutor's hand, got away from us, and tried to throw me—the top button was off the prosecutor's coat—the prisoner gave a false address at the station—he would not give his name over night—nothing was found on him—I did not see the women as I was running.</p>

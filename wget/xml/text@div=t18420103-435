               <p>—tobacco is purchased in a dry state—that from America is not in the same state in which it is sold, but it is consigned in a leaf state, and the dryer it is the higher the price it brings in the market—the dry tobacco is 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—I believe 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is the highest priced tobacco—there is dry tobacco to be bought at 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have been there thirty years, succeeding an uncle who carried on the business where it has been carried on for t century—it must be liquored before it can be manufactured, otherwise it is not shag tobacco, or returns, or oronoko—it is absolutely requisite to have some fluid applied to it, which of course adds to the weight, and the manu<lb></lb>facturer obtains a profit by means of the difference between that and the dry state—in consequence of suspicion on the 17th of December, I caused my servants to be searched before they left the place—the prisoner had been one of them for several years—I had reason to discharge him once, but he came again on the 17th of July—he was what is called a filler—he received 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I was not present when the officer searched him—he would not be searched on the premises—I gave him in charge of two officers, with strict orders to take hold of his hands—he went to the station—I hare since seen this 3lbs. of tobacco in a bag produced by an officer—the pri<lb></lb>soner had no authority to have tobacco on his person belonging to me—this is in process of manufacture—it is not fit for consumption—it common shag tobacco—the prisoner's house was searched, and a quantity of tobacco was found.</p>

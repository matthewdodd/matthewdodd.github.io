               <p>I am a horse dealer; my man was coming along by the Sessions-house, and he brought the prisoner and the horse to my house about nine on the 9th of August; my man and the prisoner had agreed for a guinea if he could find a person to prove that it was honestly come by; when I saw it, I did not approve of it; I thought it was worth a great deal more money, and not honestly come by; the prisoner said, he could prove it was honestly come by, by Mr. Aldridge, in St. John's-street; I said, I did not desire a better man; then he said, he would go into St. John's-street, and seemed to equivocate; so I took him before Justice Blackborow; the prisoner said, he brought it from Hadley, and I sent my man down, and there was no such person as he mentioned; the Justice committed him, and I advertised the horse according to the Justice's orders.</p>
               <p>Was that the same horse that was afterwards found at your house by Mr. George? - Yes; he had a small star on his forehead, and a little slip on his nose, a short dock tail, about fourteen hands high.</p>

               <p>I met the prisoner between ten and eleven in the morning of the 9th of August with a horse; I asked him if he was for sale, he said, yes; he was leading him in a halter; I asked him the price of it, he told me a guinea and an half; but he said, it would not do for me, he said, it had the running reins, by which I afterwards understood a glandered horse; I told him for that reason it would do for me, because we bought such to kill; my master is a licensed dealer in horses, and a boiler; I agreed to give him a guinea for him; I found when I examined him after the agreement, that he was worth more, worth three or four, and I told the prisoner so, and I did not think he acted honestly; I told my master, and he took him before Mr. Blackborow.</p>

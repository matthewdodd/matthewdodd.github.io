I told him I had; and he said, yonder he goes; and he set off directly into Friday-street, and just at the Old Change, in Watling-street, he dropped them out of his arm. I never lost sight of him only when he turned the two corners, and I got the parcel, and another man ran after him and stopped him, with some more help. I followed him; I found him in the Old Change; they were bringing him back.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the very same man? - I never see his face; but his dress appeared the same; I believe him to be the same man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So you never see this man's face at all? - Not till after he was taken; but then he was never out of my sight, only when he turned the corner.</p>

I am sure the prisoner was the man that took it up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Had you ever seen him before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Court. You pursued him? - Yes. As soon as he took it the porter came up, and I told the porter; we both of us pur<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010084"></xptr>sued him directly down into Friday-street, and he set off running as fast he could, and he ran as far as the corner of Old Change, and he let the parcel slip behind him, and he turned up Old Change; two or three tried to stop him, and by some means or other somebody threw him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been out of your sight from the time that you see the parcel drop? - No, never.</p>

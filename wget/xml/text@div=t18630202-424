                  </hi>. I am a constable of the dockyard division—on 17th January, about half-past 8 in the morning, I was on duty at the Marsh<lb></lb>gate, and saw the prisoner coming towards the gate to go out—I could see by the way he walked that he had some weight about him—I called him into the lobby and asked him what he had got under his coat—he made no answer—I searched him, and found these six files, wrapped up in a packet, in his inside coat-pocket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him how he came in possession of them—he made no answer, but trembled very much—he afterwards said that he found them among the stores—I then found this piece of brass, weighing 7 lbs. and three-quarters, in the back of his trousers—I took him to the station, asked his address, and he said, 2, Windsor-terrace, Maxley-road, Plumstead—I went there with an officer, named Sergeant, and found thirty files in two different cupboards in the room—the shanks of some of them were broken off, and on others the broad arrow was partly hammered out—two of them had the marks of the broad arrow.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN SERGEANT</hi>. I am a constable of Woolwich—I went with Jackson to the prisoner's address, and saw the files and this bar, marked with a broad arrow—I saw him find some of the files in the coal-cupboard, and put them in a basket.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHILD</hi>. I am foreman in the carriage department, Royal Arsenal—these six files are all marked with the broad arrow, and are all Her Majesty's property—they are used in different parts of the Arsenal, and are worth about ten shillings—these thirty files found at the house are the came description—there is the same maker's name on them, and on two of them is still the broad arrow—they are all new—some of them have been hammered where the broad arrow is usually stamped, and some of them have the shank cut off—they are by two makers, Harrill and Johnson—both of them make for the Arsenal—this nut belongs to the elevating screw of an old 23-pounder gun—it belongs to the arsenal—workmen are not allowed to remove such things from there—the prisoner does not belong to my department, but I know he has been employed in the Arsenal in some other department—the screw is worth six or seven shillings, and the thirty tiles about fifty shillings—the prisoner was an unskilled labourer.</p>

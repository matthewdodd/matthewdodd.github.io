               <p>A CLERK sworn.</p>
               <p>In consequence of an information from the counting-house of Messrs. Sutton and Sharpe, I went to Mr. Stevenson's, the Apollo, Tottenham-court-road, and he shewed me a cask of beer in the cellar; the cask appeared to be Mr. Sharpe's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed any quantity of beer? - A. Not that I know of; I know nothing but that the cask appeared to belong to Messrs. Sutton and Sharpe.</p>
               <p>On his cross-examination, he said, two years ago the partners were Cherrington and Sharpe, but that the mark was not the same now as in his time; that Mr. Sharpe had served the Apollo with beer two or three years; that they might have served him with beer in casks marked as this was: he was asked if ullages were not considered as the perquisite of the draymen? he said, no such perquisite was allowed at their house; that ullages are what is left at the bottom of casks.</p>
               <p>- STEVENSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the Apollo, Tottenham-court-road: About three months ago the prisoners brought a cask of ale to my house, and asked if I could do any thing with it, in regard to selling it; I asked them what was the price of it, they told me I should have it for 12s. for if they took it home they should have but a trifle for it; they said, they had made it up from gentlemens houses, out of different casks.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. If it had not been ullages it would have been worth much more? - A. It would have been worth 45s.</p>

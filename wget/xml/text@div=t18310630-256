            . I am a watchman of St. Andrew's. On the 8th of June, about half-past nine o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners together in Shoe-lane; the man had a child in his arms - they were both so intoxicated as not to be able to take care of it; I asked the man to deliver it to me, and I would take him to the watch-house, to protect him and the child, which he objected to, at first, but at last gave the child into my arms; a number of people collected - a woman took the child from me, to take care of it; the man resisted - I took him by the collar, and he dropped a half-crown and a shilling, which I produce; he was very near the

             - the female prisoner was about half-a-dozen paces from him; they were apart when he dropped the money - I am sure it dropped from him; he put his foot on the half-crown, but could not reach the shilling - I did not know it was bad, and wished to put it into my pocket to take care of for him, but he resisted my taking it up; I got assistance - Rentmore took charge of the woman; I saw some coin taken from the woman, but did not count it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you been a watchman? A.Between four and five years - there might be sixty or a hundred persons, or two hundred about - I cannot say, as I was engaged; I cannot say whether it was a fine night or not - it was not raining when he dropped the money; if it did, I do not recollect it; the lamps were lighted - I expect to be paid for attending here, but do not know how much: I have only been a witness once before - I do not know what that was about; it was concerning base coin.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIS. Q.How far was the man from the crowd, when he dropped the money? A. The crowd had not collected till after he dropped it; there is a lamp by Messrs. Pontifex's building - I could see perfectly well.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Did you see the money in the man's hand before he dropped it? A. No - I took him by the collar, and it dropped from his hand.</p>
               <p>EDWARD RENTMORE. I am a watchman, of St. Andrew's. I took the female prisoner to the watch-house, and found and old stocking in her bosom, inside her gown, containing a quantity of bad coin, amounting to 7l. 10s. 6d. - I turned it out, and said it was all bad; she directly said, "I know it is all bad, and I got it all bad."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She was quite sober? A. No, she was drunk; there were about fifty persons present when I took her - she claimed the child at the watch-house,</p>

            . I am ward-beadle, of St. Andrew's. The prisoner were brought to the watch-house - I observed Boyle's breast very bulky, and told Rent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300119"></xptr>more to search her; she resisted very much - he drew from her bosom this stocking, containing thirteen crowns, seven half-crowns, and sixty-eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find any thing else on her? A. No; I found about 7l. 6s. in good money on the man, but no bad money.</p>
               <p>MR. FIELD. The whole of the money found on Boyle is counterfeit; the shilling and half-crown produced, are also counterfeits - they are all of the same metal; the halfcrown appears to be from the same mould as the others - the shillings are three different impressions.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe these two metals are different? A. They are precisely alike, but one has undergone a preparation to fit it better for circulation, to imitate money which is worn and greasy.</p>

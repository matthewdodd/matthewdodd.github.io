Straker—he said that he was traveller at Mathieson's, and I might be sure that he would not be there if the money was not safe—I told him that I did not consider the money was safe for that reason, and that I could not supply any goods without reference—he proposed a reference to some firm of small printers, I think in Aldersgate Street, of whom I had heard before—I told him at once that was unsatisfactory, and we could not give him credit—he then left—I do not think any goods were supplied to Mathieson and Co. after that—a letter-press had been supplied previously—I was not acquainted with it, and as soon as I found it out I stopped more goods being supplied, and it was in consequence of that he came and saw me—I have no means of telling the date—we have not received any payment from Mathieson and Co.</p>

I replied to that letter and eventually kept the bill—when it became due it was presented through our bankers, and returned with a note annexed to it—I afterwards called at Commercial Wharf and saw the two prisoners and another man—I said "I wish to see Mr. Mathieson"—McCarthy said Mr. Mathieson was abroad, but he would bring the manager to me—he went into an adjoining room and brought Walker—I asked him if he was Mr. Mathieson?—he said no, he was the manager—I produced the bill and said "I want payment of this bill"—Walker said "We can't pay it till Monday"—I said "It must be paid"—I called his attention to the banker's note on the bill, that the bill had been presented, and the premises had been found padlocked—McCarthy said that the premises must have been closed when the man called—I then left—the bill has never been paid—before I sent the cabinet I believed that the reference that had been given from the Dudley Iron and Coal Company was a genuine reference, and that Mathieson and Co. were a good firm of merchants—that induced me to send the cabinet—I asked Walker to return the cabinet—he said "We cannot do that"—I have since seen it at the Civil Engineers' Office, in Parliament Street, and a portion of the case in which it was packed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of H. and F.

On Thursday, the 28th March, I watched the prisoner's premises at Commercial Wharf—I saw the Great Northern Railway van deliver three trusses of goods there—McCarthy received the delivery sheet from the carman—the goods were taken inside—shortly afterwards I saw McCarthy speak to a boy out<lb></lb>side the premises—the boy handed him a pocket-knife and he went in the warehouse, where the three bales had been taken—I walked by and saw McCarthy doing something to the bales, I could not see what—McCarthy left the premises about 12.15—I saw him afterwards speaking to Herbert in Thames Street, and a barrow was taken down George Alley to Old Swan Lane—I watched them take the goods out this back way to Messrs. Beeton—on Saturday, 6th April, I arrested Walker in Dover Street, Blackfriars—I said "Mr. Walker?"—he said "My name is not Walker"—I said "Perhaps Mathieson, then?"—he said "Well, what is it you want?"—I told him I and another detective who was with me were police officers, and we were going to take him into custody, and he would be charged with obtaining a quantity of goods from various parts of the country by fraud—he said "You do not say so"—I said "Yes"—he said "I am just going to meet my wife and children, let it be till Monday; make an appointment and I will meet you"—I said "No, I cannot do any such thing"—he said "I was just going to get some money, and in three weeks' time I should have had sufficient to pay all; I have had a lot of trouble this last two years"—I took him to Bow Lane police-station—there he asked me what I thought the magistrate would do with the case at the Mansion House?—I told him I did not know—he said "What is the usual sentence in these cases?"—I said "Sometimes a sentence of penal servitude"—when arrested he was carrying a black leather bag which I handed to Sergeant Green.</p>

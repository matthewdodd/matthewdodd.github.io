               <p>Street, St. Luke's—on 31st March, a woman named Bridges came, about 5.30, and I served her with three-halfpennyworth of rum—she gave me a bad shilling—Miller then came in; I showed it to him—Bridges said she was not aware it was bad, gave me a good one, and left—the constable followed her—I afterwards gave him the shilling.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman.</hi>) On 31st March I was on duty in Old Street, St. Luke's, about 5.30, and saw the prisoner driving towards St. Luke's Church, with Turner and Bridges—he stopped about 100 yards from the King's Head, got out, and assisted the woman out; she went down Central Street, and along Mitchell Street into the King's Head—I followed her, and saw her tender the shilling—she left, and I kept her in sight, and at the corner of Ironmonger Road she met Bryant, who was standing by a doctor's shop—he spoke to her, and they went to the cart, where Turner was—Bryant assisted her in, and then drove towards Shoreditch Church—I got on top of a cab, and followed them—Bridges sat next to Bryant, who was driving, and Turner was on his left—I saw the prisoner take a paper from his right hand coat pocket and give it to Turner, who threw it into a rubbish cart which was passing—I was in plain clothes—I got the assist<lb></lb>ance of some uniform men and stopped the rubbish cart, and found this packet containing six counterfeit shillings, and one lying loose—I took the prisoner to the station, and showed the packet to Brannan—the prisoner said to Brannan, "You don't know me; I met this woman, and she asked me to give her a ride; I did so, and I would you, or anyone else that asked me"—I received this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Ross.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Arundel-street, Strand. On the 8th of October I was in St. Paul's Church-yard—I felt my pocket had been picked—I missed my purse containing two sovereigns, seventeen shil<lb></lb>lings, and a Portuguese and Spanish coin—I had felt my purse in my pocket four or five minutes before—I saw four men pass me—there was a Policeman just before me—Mr. Powell asked if I had lost any thing—I said, "Yes, my purse"—the policeman took somebody into custody—I could not swear to either of the men that passed me.</p>

               <p>coat tail—he had something dark in his hand—I cannot say what it was—he turned it on one side to one on the left of him, who is not here—they were separate—I turned to see for a policeman, and when I turned my head round I only saw Martin—I crossed the road to the prosecutor but before I got to the pavement, I saw the prosecutor go to Martin, and feel his pocket outside—I touched the policeman on the shoulder, and told him to collar Rogers, that was the man who took it out of his pocket—I had followed the prisoners from the Poultry.</p>

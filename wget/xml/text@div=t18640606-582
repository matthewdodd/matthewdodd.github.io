I saw the prisoner in my shop, and asked her what she wanted for the crown and florin which I held in my hand—she said, "Seven shillings' worth of stamps"—there had been an understanding at that time that the crown was bad, and the prisoner took me aside and whispered that she had received it from a gentleman—I gave her in custody—going to the station she said that a person met her and said, "There is 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to go to the Derby"—afterwards she said that somebody who keeps a betting-book at the bottom of Farringdon-street gave it to her, and that she afterwards thought it would be better to buy some postage stamps to send to her mother—I gave the crown to the constable.</p>

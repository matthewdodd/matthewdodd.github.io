                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Oxford-market, Oxford-street—on Tuesday, the 7th of April, I was on my way home from Whitechapel, with the materials for two coats, wrapped in a black wrapper—about half-past six o'clock I had to turn up by a dead wall in the Kingsland-road, it being the nearest way—I saw two or three men standing at the corner of the wall—I went on, and the two prisoners followed me from the corner—they had ftntianr jackets on,—Meredith asked me if I would have a drop of beer—I said, "You are quite a stranger, I will have nothing to do with you; walk on"—they stood back, and in two or three minutes I received a violent blow on the back of my head—I believe it was struck by Meredith—I was senseless a few minutes—it knocked me down, and my bundle rolled into the gutter, and they ran away with it—Meredith ran away with it, I think, but they were both together—in about ten minutes a policeman came up—I went with him to the station, and gave a description of their persons and of the bundle—on the Thursday morning I saw them in custody at the station—I knew them—they are the very two men—the black wrapper which was round my bundle was found round Clune's neck—it has a private mark on it—I have not recovered my property—it was worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 7th of April, between six and seven o'clock, I was standing at my window, which is opposite the dead wall, and saw three men pass my window—after some time they all ran back past the window as fast as they could—the first one had a black bundle under his arm—I did not see which of them that was—they had nothing when they passed before—I think the prisoners are the persons, particularly Meredith—I went out and saw the prosecutor in the mud—I pointed out to him the way they had run.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker of 289, City Road—on Sunday, 26th November, about 2.48 I went out, after securing my house—I returned home about 10.45, opened the parlour door, and had no sooner lit the gas than two men rushed by me—I caught hold of them both; one of them made a blow with some instrument, and I let go of him and held the other till a policeman came—he said "It is all a mistake"—a young woman named Soper, who had accompanied me home, was at the private door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had left nobody in the house—it was my father's house; he had sold the business, and I had removed my family on the Saturday—I was keeping company with the young woman, and she was with me when I left in the afternoon—only some clothes and a few odds and ends were left in the house—we were away eight hours—I did not find the shop door open when I returned; I opened it with my key; I found it just as I left it—the shop is on the ground floor; there are altogether four windows on that floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am engaged to the last witness—I went to the house. with him and remained at the street door while he opened it with a key—I saw two <hi rend="italic">gentlemen</hi> by the parlour door; Call caught hold of them both; one went to hit him with something, and then came past me and hit me with his hand on the side of the face—Call held the other man till a policeman came—I heard something drop which sounded like iron, and directly afterwards a boy picked up this crowbar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and gave it to me; I gave it to the policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The boy was standing outside in the crowd, he never went in; he is not here, he ran away—he found the instrument outside the door, I did not see him find it, but I heard it fall—I had left the house with Call that afternoon; we left in a hurry; I was going home.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi> 218). I was called and took the prisoner—Soper gave me this crowbar and said in the prisoner's hearing that the man had dropped it while struggling with her young man—the prisoner said that it was a mistake—I found a mark on the doorpost just by the lock, exactly the size of this crowbar.</p>
               <p>

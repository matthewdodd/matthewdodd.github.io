            . On the 19th of September, I went to my shop, and found it had been broke open: I missed some old iron that I had bought the night before, which was 41 pounds weight. I went to buy some more, in order to go to work: I went to an ironmonger, in order to buy a bag; there I found some old iron in a scale; there were two pieces of it, that I could swear to be part of the iron I lost. I was there told, they bought it of a woman; and, by enquiring, found it was sent by the prisoner. He was taken up: at one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176410170006"></xptr> time, he said he had the iron at Kentish-Town; at another time, said, he found it in Golden-lane; that is near my shop: I found, where I deal in old iron, with Napper and Pelham, 12 pounds weight of old iron, some part of that I can swear to, (produced in court, and deposed to) which they had from the prisoner.</p>

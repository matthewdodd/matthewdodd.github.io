On the 13th of July, about half-past nine o'clock, the prisoner came and asked to look at some goods; another young man attended to him - I was present - he showed him several articles and ear-rings among them; I saw him put some along side on the counter - his hat laid by the side, near them. I saw him take his handkerchief from his hat, put it over the goods on the counter, and put them into his hat - he then put it on his head; he then went to the end of the counter, and looked out three pairs of bracelets from a lot - he put them on the counter, took off his hat, and covered them with his handkerchief, put them on his head, and put it on again - I told master, who had such confidence him he would not believe it; he called him into the back warehouse, and said, "Jacobs, you have some goods which are not booked;" I said, "Where are the bracelets you had in your hat?" he said, "What bracelets? I have none." I took his hat off, and found three pairs of bracelets and three pairs of ear-rings in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. He has dealt some time with you? A. Yes; eight years, to my knowledge; he has not bought on credit since he failed; we considered him an excellent character - master was in the back warehouse; I never quarrelled with the prisoner, and never said so - I never disagreed with him.</p>

            . I am shopman to the prosecutors; the prisoner came and inquired for goods; I took out two papers of bracelets - he looked at some, but did not decide; he asked if we had any thing else; I showed him some chains, rings, and ear-rings; I said, "There is a small balance on the ledger, perhaps you will settle it now;" he said he would; and while I was gone for the ledger, I believe this took place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was the amount? A. 2l. 13s. 6d.; it was for things we had regilt for him; his hat was about half a yard from me, laying on its side; I did not see him wipe his face.</p>

             I am in partnership with my father. I called the prisoner into the warehouse, and said,"Jacobs, you have got some goods not booked." He made no answer, but laughed. My man said, "I want those bracelets and ear-rings" - he took off his hat, and to my astonishment, turned the bracelets and ear-rings out - he begged forgiveness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Was his handkerchief in his hat? A I believe so; it was a blue one - It is impossible they could have stuck to the handkerchief, they were too heavy - he is a singular man altogether. We have dealt with him to a large amount.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in very broken English, made a long defence; which, as far as could be understood, went to state that he had selected these goods; and, as he usually did, put them into his hat, intending to buy them; he also put in a written paper, stating that they were in his hat without his knowledge. He received a very good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Seymour-street, and am a stationer—I lost a parcel out of my shop on the 25th of Nov, containing nine packs of plain cards, and 144 paint-brushes, called hair-pencils—(he parcel was on a glass case at the back of my shop—on Sunday Mr. King brought the pri<lb></lb>soner's and half a pack of the cards, which I had lost—Jane Esdeile said she had purchased them in Hounds ditch—I asked her where the other cards were—she said she had no others—she then said she had bought them in Chapel-street, Islington, and then by the Small-pox hospital—she said we might search' her place, she had no more—we went with her to No. 2, Drum<lb></lb>mond-crescent, and in a drawer in the room we found a pack of cards, and in the privy we found the hair-pencils and the remainder of the cards—the whole of the property I had lost—I cannot say any thing about Celia Esdeile, only she offered some cards for sale—she has been to my shop, but I had not seen her there—I have seen Jane Esdeile, there repeatedly.</p>

                  </hi>. On Sunday evening, the 27th of Nov., Celia Esdeile came to my shop and offered this half pack of cards for sale—another girl was with her—the prosecutor, who is my brother-in-law, had given me notice that he had lost some cards—I went round the counter, and told Celia Esdeile that she must go with me to Seymour-street—as we were going she wished to call on her mother in Drummond-crescent—she went down, and came up again, and said I was to go down, which I did—I saw her mother there, and waited while she put her gown on—she asked if I had said anything up stairs—I said I had not—she said she was going to chapel—I said it would not hinder her to go to Seymour-street, it was in her way—while I was there she went out with a mug, and came in wiping her mouth, and said she had been for a drink of water.</p>

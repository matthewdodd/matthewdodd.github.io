            . I apprehended the prisoner on the 3rd of April, at the Robin Hood, Windmill-street, and found six duplicates on him - the prosecutor identified the clothes he was wearing - three of the duplicates led me to Chaffer's - and one to Bartram, for a pair of sugar-tongs and two tea-spoons.</p>
               <p>GEORGE TURNER re-examined. I know this duplicate is in my handwriting, it was delivered to the person who pawned the tongs and tea-spoons.</p>
               <p>RICHARD KIBLEY. These articles are mine; and the clothes he had on are mine.(The prisoner pleaded extreme poverty.)</p>
               <p>RICHARD KIBLEY re-examined. He was perfectly sober - I never had the least occasion to complain of his dishonesty before - he appeared in distress - he behaved extremely well before - he has three children and a wife - he never had any employment while in my house, to my knowledge - he told me he had independant property, when he came to lodge with me - I have not recovered the blankets, nor any furniture, except the bolster and two pillows - I had other lodgers in the house.</p>

I am secretary to the official trustees of the Patriotic Fund, which is raised for the purpose of finding pensions for the widows and orphans of soldiers and sailors who were killed in the Crimea, or died in consequence of the war—I produce the original papers referring to a grant to Mary Fullerton—she is described as the widow of Robert Fullerton, leading stoker on board Her Majesty's ship <hi rend="italic">Wasp</hi>, being fifty-two years of age, and having five children, one entitled to relief—the grant was made in August, 1855—payments are made by the different staff officers of pensioners in the different parts of the country where the recipient of the pension lives—those officers send up pay-sheets and receipts from time to time—it appears that Mary Fullerton received the pension for some years in the district of Paisley, where she resided—it is also the practice of the office to require the recipients, from time to time, to make a statutory declaration of identity—that is taken to the pension officer and lodged with him, and by him sent to the office—in the event of a pensioner removing from one part of the country to another, it is the practice for the officer who has paid her to send a transfer-paper to the office of the district where she is going—I produce a document of December, 1871, transferring Mary Fullerton to the Greenwich district—the word "Greenwich" is in this handwriting of Philip Box, who was formerly a clerk in the Patriotic Fund office—he was convicted of frauds of this kind here at the June Sessions.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Staff Serjeant-Major of Pensioners for the Geenwich district, under Major Richmond—I remember the document of transfer coming to me, transferring Mary Fullerton to the Greenwich district—it came by post from the staff officer where she had been originally paid; it is dated 31st December, 1871—after I had received that, the prisoner applied for the payment of the pension in January, 1873—for the quarter ending March, 1872, she received three payments, amounting to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—for the June quarter she received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 64<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in two payments, September quarter, three payments, receiving 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is December, two payments, receiving 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; March, 1878, one payment, receiving 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. June, 1873, two payments, receiving 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on each of those payments she signed the pay-sheet in the name of Mary Fullerton—on 30th June, 1873, I gave her the declaration of identity, and she sent it back by post; she also had one in January, 1871—I can't say how I received that—the declaration contains the words; "I, Mary Fullerton, do solemnly declare "that I was the former wife of Robert Fullerton, and that the following is a correct statement"—on 30th June, 1873, she called and signed the pay-sheet for July—on 31st July she came again, and in my presenoe Major Richmond asked her if her name was Mary Fullerton—she said "Yes"—he said "Sit down, you have been doing wrong and I can't let you go"—she said "I am sorry for it; I hope you will forgive me"—I asked her how she came to sign her name Mary Fullerton when her name was not Mary Fullerton—she said she was receiving the money for another person, some woman she got acquainted with.</p>

I went to the Greenwioh Pension Office on 31st July, and saw the prisoner—I told her I was a police-officer, and said You have been obtaining money by false pretences"—I asked her name, and she said "Margaret Whitehead"—she said "Some months since I met a woman at the Westminster Hospital where I was an out<lb></lb>patient. She asked me if I wished to earn a few shillings by drawing a pension for her monthly. I said yes, and she then told me to go to Greenwich and draw her pension, which I have done"—I asked her if she knew the name and address of the woman she spoke of, and she said "No," but she thought some of the letters she had had from her bore the Dartmouth post-mark, but they were not signed—I read the warrant to her, and she made no reply—she said she had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and sometimes 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for doing it.</p>

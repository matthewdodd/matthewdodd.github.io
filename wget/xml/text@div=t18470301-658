                  </hi>. I am the wife Peter King, of Hyde-street, Green-street, Marlboro'-road, Chelsea—we have two shops, a baker's and a grocer's, di<lb></lb>vided by a parlour—on the 10th of February, about ten minutes after seven o'clock at night, I was in the grocer's shop, and saw the prisoner Ediker in the baker's shop, through the window—I then went in and saw him, with the till under his right arm, in the act of opening the door to get out—I had a strong gas-light in the shop, and could see him plainly—he opened the door and got into the street—Cartwright then came and covered his right arm round him to hide the till—they had the till between them, and ran across the road—I fol<lb></lb>lowed them about half-way across—I have known Ediker from a child, and have known Cartwright by sight about twelve months—I have not the least doubt of them—I was as near them as I am now—they were between two strong lights—my till had been mended with a piece of white wood on the side, and I could see that as he carried it—I noticed some papers in it—it contained some fourpenny pieces, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of halfpence—Cart<lb></lb>wright was never in the shop at all—I had shut the door, on account of seeing the prisoners, before the robbery, and am certain of their persons.</p>

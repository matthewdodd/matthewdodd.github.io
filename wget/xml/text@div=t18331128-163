I said, "What for?" she said, "Give me the money and I tell you;" I said, "I have only one shilling, and I will give you that, for I want nothing of you;" - she made use of a bad word, told me I was a liar, and she would search me - she put her hand into both my pockets, and took out a locket, a penny-piece, and two halfpence - as soon as she took her hand from my pocket, I missed the locket; I refused to let her put her hand into my pocket, but she said, she would, and the less I said the better, as she had people about her, and I heard men's voices - I was in fear; I accused her of taking the locket; she said, she had not taken it; I said, she had as it had been in my pocket; she said, she had not got it, and I should not have it; she then asked for my handkerchief; I said, she should not have it; she snatched my hat off, and took my handkerchief out of it; I asked her for it; she said, I should not have it - she went down, and I after her; when she got near the bottom of the stairs, I heard something drop; I told her I thought something dropped; she said, no, there was not; I said, I thought there was; I called for a light, she got one from the room below, and I found the locket; she took the light into the room, and I went out and called the officer - I was not in much fear when I got down, and the door was open, I did not go out without looking for the locket, as I would run any risk for it, as it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280119"></xptr>given me by a young woman; but I can swear I parted with it from fear.</p>

             (Police-constable). I took the prisoner; I found nothing on her - I knocked at the room-door; they would not open it; I broke it open; I found the prisoner, three girls, and two men there - I turned up the window curtains, and saw the bottom pane of glass was broken, and the paper pushed out - I went into the yard, and found this handkerchief - the prosecutor gave me this locket.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the prosecutor had become angry with her, in consequence of her refusing to remain with him, and charged her with the robbery, which she positively denied.</p>

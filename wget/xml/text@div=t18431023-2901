                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant.</hi>) On Saturday afternoon, the 16th of Sept., about three o'clock, I went into the prisoner's house, No. 36, Dean street, Soho, in company with Sergeant Smith—I found the prisoner in the front parlour, and found this roll of cloth, unrolled, partly lying on a chair, and partly on the floor—I told him I was an officer, and asked who the young man was who had just gone out—he said there bad been no young man there—I told him I knew better, for I had seen a man come in with a large bundle, and go out with an empty bag—he said, "I dare say I can find him for you, if you want him"—I asked him who this cloth belonged to pointing to it—he said it was his own—I asked where he bought it—he said of a dealer—I asked who the dealer was, and where he lived—he said he did not know—I told him he must consider himself in custody on suspicion of having stolen property in his house—he said he thought that we could settle it—I asked what he meant—he saidvhe would give me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I would go no further with it—I refused it—he said he should have thought that 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would have been better to me than to take him—I afterwards took him into cus<lb></lb>tody, and took him to the station—I found a gold watch and chain upon him.</p>

               <p>before his apprehension—from inquiries I have made, I find he has been in Dean-street about twelve months and longer—I saw a man who I knew to be a thief, go into the house with a large bundle, and that made me go in, suspecting it to be stolen property—it resembled a roll of cloth in size and shape—that man's name was George Phillips—I apprehended him the same evening, but there was not sufficient evidence for the Magistrate to commit him for trial—he was remanded twice—I cannot say it was the cloth, because it was in a bag—the cloth was in the parlour where the prisoner carried on his business—there was a shopboard there, and a great deal of other cloth—this piece was unrolled, and a yard measure was lying by the side of it, as if it was being measured—the prisoner appeared very much alarmed when I told him be must consider himself in custody—he seemed agitated when I told him who I was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Henry Robarts, a woollen-dra<lb></lb>per, in Conduit-street, Bond-street. This cloth is his—I saw it last between the 5th and 9th of Sept.—I cannot say positively to the day—it has not been sold—I am quite certain of it—it is worth about 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is there by which you can identify it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The last time I saw it, I cut a slip from it to make patterns for pattern-books, and I have part of that slip here, which exactly matches the end of the cloth—there is a curve which matches it exactly—I know of every thing that I sell out of my employer's warehouse—Mr. Robarts sells—he is not here—if this had been told, it would have been entered in the book—I have examined the book—Mr. Robarts might have sold it in my absence, but it is most probable not.</p>

               <p>(John James Elsden, No. 36, Great Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields, gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

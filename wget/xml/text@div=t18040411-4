               <p>Q. Did he drive the horses, or did he look to the delivery of his goods? - A. He attended the delivery of the goods: On Monday last, the 9th of April, the prisoner went with the waggon to Bishopsgate-street, he was in the waggon; I was coming from the Excise-Office towards Cornhill, I saw the waggon standing against the church in <placeName id="t18040411-4-crimeloc27">Threadneedle-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. This was raw silk, was not it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was the prisoner's duty to attend the waggon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose any of these bales of silk were loose, what would have been his duty then? - A. There was no bale in the waggon but that.</p>


               <p>Q. Supposing that it had been loose, what would have been his duty? - A. To have put it in again, and secured it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your employ with Mr. Willan? - A. My employment is as carman.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it would not have been his duty to have told you any thing about it? - A. He did not tell me any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him no opportunity of saying why he had taken this property to secure it for his master? - A. He did not make any mention at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever attempt to make his escape at all? - A. No, he could not, because I was with him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a book-keeper at the Bull and Mouth? - A. Yes; Dowker gave me information, in consequence of which I searched the prisoner, and found, under his top coat, a quantity of silk under his left arm; there was one pound twelve ounces of it; the prisoner did not say a word, I have had the silk ever since, (produces it;) it is part of the contents of a leather bag containing silk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing the contents of this bag? - A. No, I saw a part of the bag opened.</p>
               <p>Q. That was afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see it before it was put into the waggon? - A. I did not see the bag till it was brought to the Bull and Mouth Inn; the bag had the appearance of having been broke, the end of the bag was drawn as under.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know that silk? - A. Yes, perfectly well; the prisoner came from the Bull and Mouth Inn with a four-wheeled cart, or waggon, to take a pack of silk from my house, which is situated near the church, at the corner of Leadenhall-street; it was put into his charge for the purpose of taking it to the Bull and Mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a part of the silk that was in that pack? - A. I am sure of it; there was a larger deficiency than this, and the next day, upon my writing to Mr. Jefferies, he sent me the remainder, which was found in the privy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This hank came out at one corner, and I put it under my coat to take it home, that it might be put into the bale again; and before I had time, when I got to the warehouse, they took it from me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

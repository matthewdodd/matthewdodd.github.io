On the 29th of September, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop, and bought a pair of gloves, which came to 3s. 6d.; he offered me a 1l. note; I had known him for six months before, from his occasionally coming to my shop; I did not know his name - He used to bring his gloves to be cleaned; I used to mark them G.C.; he gave me those initials. When he tendered me the 1l. note to pay for the gloves, I had some suspicion of it, and asked him to write his name on it - He wrote, "Clarke, Kingsland-road," and returned it to me. I then asked if his name was Clarke, he said, "yes;" he wrote it himself. I then told him I suspected it was a bad note, and asked if he would wait until I sent for an officer - He appeared much confused.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any answer - A.He said there was no occasion for that, and asked to look at the note; I gave it to him, it appeared to me that he wanted to put it into his pocket; he was going to rumple it up - I snatched it out of his hand; I held it up to the light in the shop, he then snatched it out of my hand; I laid hold of his arm, and jumped over the counter; he got off with it; I followed him, calling out Stop thief - I never lost sight of him; I did not see what he did with the note; I overtook him in about one minute; he ran about fifty yards up Barbican and was stopped; then he was brought back to my shop, I asked what he had done with the note - He said he had lost it in his confusion (looking at part of a note,) this is the remnant of the note he offered me-the word Clarke is on it, which he wrote.</p>

            . I am a shopman to Mr. Dobree; I was present when the prisoner pledged the goods; he came in about two hours and a half after, to redeem them; he gave Godden the notes, who handed them to me. I looked at them and observed the name of Stevenson and Co. 4-11-17, on them, in red ink (looks at them), I have no doubt of these being the same - I also observed two of them were dated 26th of September, the goods are now at the shop - He never called for them, or the notes after.</p>

            . I know the prisoner - He lodged at my house in the name of Champaine, or something like it; I changed him a 1l. note (looks at one,) this is it, it has " G. C. - I. C. my lodger," on it. G. C. is his name and I. C. my husband's. On the 18th of December, I received another from him (looks at one,) this is it-it is marked in the same way. My husband is a pork-butcher - He paid it for some chops.</p>

            ; I remembered him immediately - He was taken to the House of Correction, examined in Marlborough-street, and committed for re-examination. On the 13th of March, I was taking him to the House of Correction, in a chariot, he was double ironed-the moment the coach got to Elm-street, close to the prison, he seized me, and seized him; we were in the coach; he seized me in an instant, put a rope round my throat, drove me against the back of the coach, and held me round my neck - He hurt me considerably, and got me off the seat of the coach; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181804010025"></xptr>seized him and called to the coachman as soon as I could; he slipped the rope round my neck, and prevented my calling out at first. During the struggle the iron fell off one of his legs; I held him fast, another person got up and held him on one side, while I secured him on the other. When we got to the House of Correction, I found the rivet of the iron of his other leg filed so as to come completely off-it came off in the House of Correction; the one that fell off in the coach was also filed. On his being taken out of the coach, a man found a knife on the seat, between the seat and his thigh, it was under him where he sat-there was a blood-mark on the cushion, and his hand had bled-there were no marks of blood on the knife. I saw the turnkey find two files on him, which he said, he had used to file his irons off - He said he was sorry for the violence he had used to me, but I must consider his situation.</p>

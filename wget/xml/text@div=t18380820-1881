                  </hi>. I am in the service of Bishop and Pell, wine-merchants and manufacturers. On Friday, the 27th of April, I was in the warehouse, between five and six o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner there—he had been out on business for the firm that day—he was in their service—he returned soon after five o'clock, intoxicated—he came up to where I was, in the pressing department, and used very abusive language—I told him to go away, or I should fetch somebody who should make him—he went from me to Edward Jones, who was about thirty-eight or forty years old—he used very abusive language to him, and Jones told him to go away, and let him go on with his work; and pushed him away, and he being intoxicated fell upon some fruit which was very near his heels—he pushed him with his open hand-Hailes then got up and struck Jones—it was not a very hard blow, not sufficient to knock a person down who was sound in his legs-Jones fell, having had a very bad leg for a year—it was stiff at the knee—he could not bend it—he fell, and his leg was broken—he was taken to the hospital directly—the prisoner did nothing more to him-when Jones fell, Hailes fell also with the intoxication—he hid not received a blow-both fell—they did not fall on each other.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the employ of the same gentle<lb></lb>men—the first thing I observed was Hailes swearing at Jones—they had a scuffle—he struck at him, and they both fell together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Jones was brought in between seven and eight o'clock on the evening of the 27th of April, with a severe compound fracture of the right leg—the bones were broken, and the integuments wounded—it was a very severe injury—he had repeated attacks of inflammation of the leg, and suppuration took place on the separation of the different parts of bone that came away—he remained in a state of great danger for some time, and then subsequently improved a little-about a week previous to his death, an attack of erysipelas commenced in the injured leg, which spread rapidly up the thigh—he died on the 21st of August, between twelve and one o'clock—the erysipelas was the immediate cause of death, brought on by the injury, the fracture of the leg—I feel confident of it, more particu<lb></lb>larly, having made a post mortem examination of the limb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I certainly was struck first by Jones, and when I got on my legs I went to strike him, but I had no idea of so serious an accident—I believe the fall was occasioned by his falling over the handle of the presses-Cleaver struck me three or four times before I hit Jones, while I was attempting to strike at him.</p>

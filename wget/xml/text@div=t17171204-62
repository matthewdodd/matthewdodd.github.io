That he had all his Cloath on but Coat, Hat and Wigg, his Pocket, turned inside out, but one in which was a knife and Fork, the Body was afterwards view'd by several that knew the Deceased and to be the Body of John Hoemg R.in the Surgeon deposed. That there were several Wounds on the temporal muscles, that they were between all to that opening the Head he found a Concustion of Blood upon the Brain, but did not think the Wounds but that he was first what Weapon He could not lay, and then suffocated in the Pond. Many of the these Curcumstances were confirmed by Vuiety of Evidence and many more too long here to relate. The prisoner being called to make Defence, denied his knowing thing of the Murther, and being asked since, about Six a-Clock, as had been proved they went out together what be use of To which he answered. They went to Halborn, adn there Parted, he going one Way, and the Deceased another. Being asked where he was the paid be all Night at the Night Cellar at appeared, they having sent to enquire, he was after Ton of the Clock till next Morning, drinking with Porten, Chairmen, and such like which did for his Diversion, but probably to divert the Horror of his Mind.)

Being asked how his Knife came by the Pond-side where the Deceased was found murdered he alleged, that the Deceased to rowed it of him. The only Evidences he celled were two foreign Women, and Van; the Sum of whole Evidences amounted only to this, That they had known that the Prisoner has sometimes used to Blood at the Nose. By that be endeavourred to account for the Bloodeness of his Shirt, neck and Sleeves, but being asked how they came to be wet and, as well as bloody, he said he let them fall. Another Evidence (a Gentleman that happened to be present when the Prisoner was in the Round-house, and who spared no Pams to trace the Matter) deposed. This be having heard the Deceased had been at Hampton-Court, went, was informed he had, and that Beron Bathmar of the one, and that he had been presented to his Majesty, who him some Guiness also, but what Number he had not learnt, so that it appear'd very probable, it was their Generosity that brought the unfortunate Gentleman to that tragical end. Thus ended the Prisoner's Tryal, for a Murther as barbarous as it was providentially discovered, and traced by Persons who had no other than and Justice, and he to opportunity, that, in Probablity, in one Hour more be might have got out of the reach of the Avengers of Blood.

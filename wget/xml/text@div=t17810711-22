On the 2d of June, about half after ten o'clock at night, my daughter went up stairs to bed. The moment she got into her room she called out. I went up, and found the window open: it was a rainy night; I saw the print of a man's foot upon the table, and likewise upon the floor, and several things in the room were disturbed. Upon this I went immediately to the next house, to alarm them of the robbery; they went into their garrets, and found their garrets likewise had been robbed. There was an empty house next door to them. We sent for the key to search that house, and it was refused us. It was</p>

               <p>"A house to let, enquire at No. 13, Orchard-street." We got a constable and two or three men, who got into the empty house through my neighbour's garret-window. As soon as the were in, they told me there were some goods. I desired them to secure the upper part of the house, that nobody might get out on the roof, and come down and let me in. I went in. We looked into every room; and, in the parlour, we found the prisoner behind the door; we secured him; and up stairs we found the goods. The maid's box was taken away; it was locked; we found the box broke open, and the things scattered: I took all the goods I could, and put them into that box: part of them were the property of Lady Rodney, and some were the property of my maid. Lady Rodney lives on the other side.</p>

               <p>You did not lose any things of your own property? - No; they were my maid's. I went to Lady Rodney's in the morning. Next morning we went to the office in Litchfield-street, and the box was given to the constable. Some of the neighbours said they saw two persons on the roof, but they run away</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Whether you found any thing upon me? - No.</p>

               <p>You do not know whether the window of this room was shut before, of your own knowledge? - Only from what my daughter told me.</p>

I went into the empty house; I went into the back parlour; I went to push against a door that goes into the yard; I found the door go heavy; I looked behind it, and found the prisoner sitting down; I took him by the collar; I called the watch, and gave charge of him.

                  </hi>. The two prisoners were in Messrs. Piper's employ—they came to Eastcheap last Saturday morning at half-past six o'clock, and I sent them from there to the factory with a truck load of lead—I saw them both go off with the truck—there was lead of this description in it—about half-past seven o'clock the same morning I was passing the end of Half-Moon-street, and saw Lock there—that was out of his way to the factory—when he saw me he turned about—I went after him, and asked what he did there—he said he was going to speak to a person at the bottom of the street—he went up Half Moon-street again, and turned into Rose and Crown-court—I followed him, and saw the truck there, and Pamplett standing by it—there was no lead in it then—I asked what business they had there with the truck, as it was out of their way—they said they could not go up the street as there was a cart in the way—I followed them with the truck up Blomfield-street and London-wall—my suspicions were excited, and I went into Bishopsgate-street station-house for assistance—they could see me go in there—I called out "police," and on turning my head again I saw them both running away from the truck—I pursued them up Clark's-place, and saw Pamplett holding his trowsers up to keep</p>

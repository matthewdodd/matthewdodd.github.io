                  </hi>. I keep the Island Queen public-house in Hanover-street, Islington—it is my dwelling-house, and in the parish of St. Mary, Islington—on 14th May I went to bed about half-past 12 o'clock at night—before I went to bed I secured the house—the door that leads into the bar was bolted—the kitchen window was closed—I can't say whether it was fas<lb></lb>tened—the house was closed as usual—about 3 o'clock I was disturbed by a noise on the stairs—I got up and went down to the bar—I found the pri<lb></lb>soner there—he was the police constable on duty—he said to me, "I have found your place open as usual"—I had been called up by the prisoner twice previously, and found the place open—I said the place was secure when I went to bed—just at the time I got to the bottom of the stairs the police sergeant was passing, and he asked the prisoner how he came in there—he said he came in by the kitchen window—he said, at first, that he found the side door open, and after that he said he came in by the kitchen window—I am sure that door was bolted when I went to bed, I bolted it myself, and the window was shut down close—when I found the prisoner in the bar the window was open sufficiently to allow a person to get in—that kitchen win<lb></lb>dow opens into a yard, and that yard communicates with the street by a gate—by going through the gate you could get to the kitchen window; and that gate is only fastened by a string—the sergeant desired me to look round, and I missed from a cupboard 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and about 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper; and from the till I missed a few coppers, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—these two bottles (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>) are mine—I can swear to them—they have my name on them—when I went to bed I left them in the bar empty; now one of them has rum and the other peppermint in it—I had rum and pepper<lb></lb>mint in my possession, and they were near where these bottles were—I had some cakes, similar to those which are now produced—I saw all these things taken from the prisoner—these bottles were in his coat pocket—this money was in his trowsers pockets and his coat pocket—these cakes were in his hat—there is a dust-hole outside my house—when the prisoner was taken he passed by the dust-hole, and had an opportunity of putting anything into that dust-hole—I afterwards found 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant,</hi> 50 <hi rend="italic">N</hi>). About 3 o'clock in the morning, on 14th May, I was on duty in Hanover-street—I heard a noise in the bar of the Island Queen—after waiting a short time, I tried the side door—I found it was closed; but when I tried it, it opened, and I walked in—I found the prisoner there and the landlord—the prisoner was the constable on the beat—he was addressing the landlord, and saying, "I found your place open as usual"—I asked the prisoner how he came there—he said, "I entered by the kitchen window, which I found wide open"—I said to him, "You had no right to enter; you should have knocked on the outside"—I went down stairs to see in what state the back kitchen window was, and it was open wide enough for a person to get in—I told Mr. Puzey to examine his premises, to see if he missed anything—he said he missed 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper, which were in three pint pots, and two of the pots were empty, and the third was nearly so—I said, "This seems a singular affair"—the landlord said he believed no one had been there but the policeman—the prisoner went out at the side door while I and the landlord were talking; and I opened the door and called the prisoner in—the dust-hole is a quantity of rubbish, which lies near the side door—I afterwards found in that dust-hole 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—I desired the prisoner to come to the station, and when there I asked him what money he had about him—he said about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and copper—I told him to put it on the table; and he took from his trowsers pockets 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I asked if that was all he had got—he said yes—I said, "I shall search you"—he then said, "I have got some more;" and he took from the breast pocket of his coat these two bottles, which contained rum and peppermint, and 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—I then took his hat off, and found in it these nine cakes.</p>

On the 8th of March I was residing in Broad-street, Wapping - about eleven o'clock on that evening, I fell in with the prisoner opposite the Royalty Theatre - I was rather the worse for liquor; I asked what I was to give her - she said 5s.; I said very well, if she would give me something to eat out of it - we went to a cook-shop: she then went to <placeName id="t18260406-168-crimeloc901">Cobourg-street</placeName>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in the Commercial-road East. I have a watch which the prisoner, and another person, brought to pawn on the 9th of March, about nine o'clock in the morning - I asked several questions, the prisoner said a man, or her husband, had sent her to pawn it. While I was talking to her, notice of the robbery was brought in - I jumped over the counter and secured her.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>

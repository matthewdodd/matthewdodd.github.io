Two highwaymen came up to my side of the chaise first; then one came on each side; the person who was on my side, said, give me your money and watches, and be quick; I gave him two guineas and two dollars; as soon as I had given him that, they rode off; I cannot say whether the prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of them afterwards? - Yes; there was a chaise before us, which was coming towards us. The gentlemen who were in that chaise, suspecting they were highwaymen, got out as they rode towards that chaise, upon which they turned back again.</p>

               <p>I was in a post-chaise with the prosecutrix; about three o'clock in the afternoon, upon the Edgware road, we were stopped by two men; Miss Barkham was robbed. The prisoner came first up to my side of the chaise; then he went to the other side where he demanded the money of Miss Barkham; he had a silk handkerchief tied across his face; I took notice of him as he passed the chaise, before he stopped us; he had not any thing over his face at that time; I suspected they were two highwaymen when they passed us; I said so to Miss Barkham; I recollected his face when he passed by.</p>
               <p>You say you recollected his face; had you ever seen him before? - Yes; I had seen him several times about the streets of London, and had taken notice of him; I have seen him about with four or five men, who used to be suspected.</p>
               <p>Did you see enough of him before he put the handkerchief on his face, to be sure as to his person? - Yes; and besides he dropped the silk handkerchief off from his face while he was committing the robbery; I am quite sure he is the man; they rode off towards a returned chaise which was coming up; four or five men jumped out of that chaise, and they then turned back, passed our chaise, and rode towards Edgware. The post boys took one horse out of our chaise, and another out of the other chaise, and pursued them.</p>

               <p>I drove the chaise Miss Barkham and Mr. Atkinson were in; two highwaymen passed the chaise, and soon turned about again; the one with a mask on, the other with a handkerchief tied round his face; one came up on each side of the chaise; he that had the mask on said, he would blow out my brains, if I looked back; a returned chaise was coming up; as the highwaymen were going towards that chaise, I called out stop thief; then they turned back, passed us, and went towards Edgware; the other post-boy got behind me, upon one of my horses, and we pursued the highwaymen for about a mile; then the other boy got off the horse, and I continued to pursue them. I never lost sight of them; particularly the prisoner, till such time as he got over into the fields. I overtook them in Hendon town; they galloped on as fast as they could; the man that made his escape rode amongst the country people, with two pistols in his hands, threatening to shoot them; at the same time the prisoner rode up to me, and shot me in the side with his pistol; saying, if I would not go back, he would blow my brains out; I pursued him further, half a mile; then the prisoner's horse failed, and he quitted him, and got over into the field; I still pursued him, and he was taken. At the time he shot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180010"></xptr> at me his face was uncovered; and I then saw him distinctly, and am sure he is the man; after that, when he got over into the field, he was not above a minute out of my fight; he was dressed in a blue coat.</p>

               <p>I drove the returned chaise. I drove up towards the other chaise; when the two men came, they rode about ten yards towards me; both their faces were uncovered; I plainly then discerned the prisoner; I am sure he was one of the men; and there were no other men on horseback there besides those two persons; they turned back; the other post-boy and I rode upon one of the horses for about a mile; then I alighted; the other boy rode on. A man coming up upon one of my horses, I mounted that, and immediately followed them; and I saw one of the men fire at the other boy. The prisoner had a blue coat with blue buttons on.</p>

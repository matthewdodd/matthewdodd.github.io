                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Durham, and live in Peter-street, Westminster. I knew the deceased, and lived in the same house with her, and in the next room—I never heard her surname—I only knew her by the name of Mary—she was the same person upon whom the inquest was held—I lived in the front room, and she in the back with the prisoner—I had been in the house a fortnight—I saw her last, to speak to her, a little after nine o'clock on Saturday evening, the 4th of Jan.—I did not see any difference in her then, to what I had seen of her since I was in the house—she looked very pale—she always looked very pale—between one and two o'clock on that Saturday night the prisoner came home—he awoke me, by singing and stumbling up the stairs—he went into his own room—when he got in I heard him say, "Why did not you let me in before? I will give it to you for this"—I heard no answer given to that—he repeated it twice—I was sitting up in the bed, because there was a noise all the time—I heard the deceased make a strange <hi rend="italic">wheezing</hi> noise—I never heard her speak at all—it was a noise as though she was pressed, and had not the power to halloo—I heard something fall on the floor, and after that I heard a lump like a body falling on the floor, and I heard the prisoner say, "Mary, my dear, what is the matter with you?"—I heard no reply to that, I only heard a groan—the prisoner came out on the landing, and said, "Will any female come to my wife? she is very ill"—he</p>

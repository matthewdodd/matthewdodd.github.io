            . As the Cart was going down Drury Lane towards the New Church, a Man at the end of Prince's-Street asked the Carman if he wanted a Jobb, he staid to talk with him, and let the Cart go on by it self. The Wheelbarrow stood between the Posts, and I believe about two thirds of it was beyond them in the Cart-way.</p>
               <p>The Mother. I had sent my Child of an Errand, and hearing a Noise in the Street, I threw down a young Child I had in my Arms, and run into the Street; a Neighbour met me and said do not be frighted! O Lord! says I, my Child is kill'd! they had set it on a Threshold. I took it up, and its poor Jaws fell in my Arms. <rs id="t17360505-61-verdict305" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Vogle<lb></lb>heim, of Craven's-buildings, City-road. On 7th Feb. the prisoner came to me, represented himself as a baker, and wanted a room to sleep in by day, as he worked at night—I agreed to let him have my second-floor back-room, which adjoins my bed-room—he came at ten o'clock next morning, and remained in the parlour half an hour, and I then showed him his room—he said he should be no trouble, he should merely require some boiling-water in the afternoon; he should not have tea at my place, he merely made it, carried it in a bottle, and put it into the oven to warm—he went up-stairs, and in a quarter of an hour I saw him in the yard without his coat, coming towards the house—about one o'clock I was in the shop, and saw him in the parlour—I went, and said, "Dear me, you are up very early"—he said, "This is Saturday night, and I have had</p>

               <p>two hours good sleep, and I shall have all night to-night"—he said he was going to fetch his clothes and money—my attention was called to the shop, and I never saw him again till he was in custody—at twelve o'clock at night I went to my room, and missed a gold seal and ring, a brooch, a coat, and a pair of trowsers, and other things, worth more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I had seen safe a little before nine in the morning—the room was still locked, and must have been entered with a false key—there is a skittle-ground adjoining my yard, and a fence between them—any person could get over with ease from our place, because there are a great many baskets in the yard, but you could not get from the skittle-ground to our yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I have worked for Mr. and Mrs. Vogleheim thirteen years; I was there when the prisoner came—about half an hour after he had gone to bed I saw him with his coat off, and he asked me the time—I told him, "Between eleven and twelve"—he said, "Call me at two," and then he came back, and said, "Call me at five"—I saw him out in the yard about a quarter of an hour after he went to bed—I saw him go into the parlour about one o'clock, and did not see him again.</p>

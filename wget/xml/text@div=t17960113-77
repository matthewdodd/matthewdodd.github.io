               <p>On the 7th of this month, about seven o'clock, the prisoner came into our shop, and asked me for a pennyworth of apples; after looking at them, he put them down, and said, he did not like them; he thought them too dear, and turned out of the shop; in the course of three or four minutes, he came to the shop again, standing half in the shop, and half out; he reached round, and took some cheese out of the window, about ten pounds, or ten pounds and a half; I sent my son, Benjamin Norman, after him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The prisoner came in first for apples? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And afterwards came back, and you saw him, half in the shop and half out of the shop, and he took the cheese? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you always give the same account? - A. Yes; as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have there not been several persons in custody besides the prisoner? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner was taken, you were not certain he was the man, till your son told you so? - A. My son told me so! I know him from his looks, and my own knowledge; I made no hesitation at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do wicked people go, after their death? - A. I believe they go to hell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do good people go to? - A. To heaven. (He is sworn).</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your mother calling out on the loss of some cheese? - A. Yes; I saw the man take the cheese, myself.</p>

            Look about, and see if you see him? - A. That is him, (pointing to the prisoner); I ran after him, and cried out, "stop thief," and a man put down two bushels of malt, and stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the same man you saw take the cheese out of the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys Q. Had you ever seen this man before? - A. Not before that night.</p>

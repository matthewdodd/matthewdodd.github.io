               <p>Q. Had you a pocket-book - A. I had; I had in that pocket-book a twenty pound note, two one pound notes, a two pound note, and five one-pound notes of the Deal bank. The great notes were bank notes. I am sure I had them in my pocket when I went into Wych-street. I took the prisoner and James Hall there to dine. I laid my pocket-book alongside of me on the table; after we had done dinner I went out with Mr. Hall to pay the reckoning, and just before I got out of the door I missed my pocket-book. I said, d - n it, I have left my pocket-book behind. I immediately went back again to the box where I was sitting, and found the prisoner just coming out of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body been in the box but you three - A. No. When I came to the box I found my pocketbook under the tablecloth; it was closed; I took it up, and put it under my pocket. I did not look into it till the next morning. I had plenty of silver about me for any thing I might want. On the next morning when I looked into my pocket-book, I missed a twenty-pound note, and two ten-pound notes. I have seen one of the ten-pound notes since. I know it by the writing upon it. That night I did not sleep at home; I left my pocket-book at a shipmate's of mine.</p>

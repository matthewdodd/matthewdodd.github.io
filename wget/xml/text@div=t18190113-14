About the 4th of January I hired another servant, not intending to discharge him, some circumstances however induced me to suspect him. I told him as another servant was coming, it would be proper to look at the plate - he produced it and in calling it over I missed three table-spoons, and asked him where they were? He said they should be there, as he had counted them two days ago. I said they must be produced, as it had a bad appearance. On searching further I missed the property stated in the indictment. I said he must produce them; he looked about him, and then left the room - I heard him walking about, and then it ceased. I called the servant, and found he had left the house. About six o'clock in the evening I was informed he had returned; I sent privately for a constable; when he came I went and found the prisoner by the kitchen fire, I asked him for the things, he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out several of them, saying, here they are all, but one desert and two egg-spoons, which are still in pawn - I gave him in charge. He fell on his knees, and intreated forgiveness, saying, that it was the necessitous situation of his wife that induced him to commit the offence. I told him that public justice required that I should not connive at it.</p>

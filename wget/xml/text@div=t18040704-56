               <p>Q. Did he make any difficulty in coming? - A. Surely not: he lived in Somerset-street, Whitechapel, No. 19.</p>
               <p>Q. The present prisoner was charged before the Magistrate at that time? - A. Yes, and after a long examination set at liberty; it was not till after Moore was acquitted, that the prisoner was indicted.</p>
               <p>Q. Moore was tried in April Sessions, and Barrow was indicted the same Sessions - did you do all that was in your power to apprehend him? - A.

I did, I think on the 24th, on Tuesday, he said he had got some small Bank-notes to the amount of one hundred pounds, or upwards; he said he had got them, or should have, I am not certain which; he said he would call again; I did not make any particular answer to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then you did not tell him whether you would, or not? - A. I did not; he called again in the evening, and handed me a roll of paper, and said, there was a hundred and twenty-nine pounds; he described the notes, and said, there were eleven fives, a small bundle of twos, and the others all ones; I asked him respecting the notes, and he said they were notes that had been found; he said he would allow me eight pounds, if I would take them; he said he would leave them, and call in the morning for me to consider of it, and he did leave them; I looked over the notes, and found there was not the number; he said there were eleven fives, six or seven twos, and the rest ones; he called the next morning, I think, about nine o'clock; he asked me if I had considered about the notes; I asked him if there was any danger; he said none, they had been found; I asked him if they had been advertised; he said, not that he knew of; he said he would allow me the odd nine pounds; he had said the over night there were a hundred and twenty-nine pounds, and I said no; he took them in his hand, and counted them in my back warehouse, and he came forward, and said there were only a hundred and twenty-seven; he agreed that I should have them for a hundred and twenty pounds; I then asked him if he could give me change for a two hundred pound note; he said, yes; he gave me two fiftys, and I gave him eighteen pounds in small notes, and gave him the two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. It was nine pounds he was to give you? - A. Give me leave to correct that error; it was a hundred and eighteen pounds I was to have them for.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then, in point of fact, you took nine pounds instead of seven? - A. I did; that was all that passed. In the course of three days afterwards I saw an advertisement or bill stuck up, I cannot say which; the names were erased on the notes I had, which gave me suspicions that they were some of the notes; I did not observe the erasure on the notes till after I saw the advertisement; he called on me the next day, after I had seen this hand-bill, or advertisement; I mentioned to him what I had seen; I told him I had seen an advertisement about a robbery that had been committed at Limehouse, and I was doubtful that these notes were part of them; he said he did not believe they were; before he left me, he said that they might be part of them, but there was no danger; there were no numbers, and the names were all altered, and therefore they might be paid away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him any more before you were taken up? - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Parsley coming to your house for change of a ten-pound note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the notes that you gave Mr. Parsley part of the notes you had received from him - look at these four, and see whether these four were part of the notes you had received from the prisoner? - A. I cannot tell. (Looks at them.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these six one-pound notes that Mr. Lillywhite had from your wife, whether they are any part of the notes that you had from the prisoner? - A. I cannot swear that they are.</p>
               <p>Q. See whether these four, which are cancelled by the Bank, are the same that you paid Mr. Thomas? - A. I cannot speak to any of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any of the notes that you had received from the prisoner? - A. No, they are paid away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you pay the last of them away? - A. Near two months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose possession, when you were tried in April, was the remainder of the notes? - A. I cannot say; I believe they were not all paid away.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you were taken up, how many were in your possession? - A. To the best of my recollection about fifty pounds; they were paid away with other notes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Were you present at any time your husband received any Bank-notes of Mr. Barrow? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember giving change for a ten-pound Bank-note to Mr. Hillingsworth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any of these notes your husband had from Mr. Barrow? - A. I cannot swear to any of these notes; there were all the other notes in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Moore.) I think you have said, that at the time you were tried here, you had fifty pounds of these notes that had not been discovered, and which you have paid away since; I am really very much surprised your countenance did not change, when you told us that; there is much more cogent proof of your being concerned in that burglary as receiver of stolen property; against the prisoner there is no proof but what depends upon the man in whose possession the stolen property was found.</p>

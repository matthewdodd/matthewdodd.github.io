                  </hi>. I am a cutler, of 4, Gough-square, Fleet-street, in the parish of St. Bride. On the morning of 16th Oct. my house was broken into—the kitchen window was shut the night before, but not fastened, my servant told me she neglected to fasten it—she is not here, I only know what she told me—she was the first person up in the morning—I came down about 7 o'clock—she has not left my service—she was not before the Magistrate—I missed two hats, one of which belonged to my son a boy nine years of age, also an oyster-knife, a great coat, three pairs of boots, my servant's gowns, some tablecloths, pinafores, and other things, worth upwards of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 31st Oct. a second attempt was made, in the night of 31st Oct, and on the morning of 1st Nov. the prisoner came to me and said, "Is your name Sharp?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "You have had a robbery at your house a week ago?"—I said, "Yes, what do you know about it?"—he said, "I called to give you information as to who the parties are, and where they live"—I said, "Really you must be one of the party, for the hat you have got on now belongs to my son, and is part of the property that was taken away on 16th Oct."—he took it off, and said, "Yes, it is, it is the only thing they would give me, and therefore I have determined to come and <hi rend="italic">peach,</hi> I don't care what becomes of me, so long as the other parties are taken"—a policeman coming by at the time, I gave the prisoner in charge—I saw this oyster-knife taken from him at the station(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and this duplicate—this is the hat he had on, I swear it is my son's I know it by marks inside it—I missed such an oyster-knife as this, it is one of my make—these boots are mine—I had gone to bed about 12 o'clock the night before—I cannot say where I saw the hat last—I saw the knife on the Sunday, and the boots a day or two before the robbery.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody—I went to Mr. Sharp's house, and he said he had come to inform Mr. Sharp of his house being broken into and robbed on 16th Oct.—I asked him how he knew that, and if he was there at the time—he said he was—he mentioned the word "robbery," and said they would not give him any of the property and he would inform upon them—he said he would go and show me where they lived; that he had been in prison, and when he came out they would not give him anything—he went and showed me a room where he said the parties lived, but I could not find them—he did not know their names—when I said, "How do you know there was a robbery there; were you one of them?"—he said, "Yes, I <hi rend="italic">were</hi>."</p>

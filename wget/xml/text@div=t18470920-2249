                  </hi> I am in the employ of the South Eastern Railway Company. I attend to the goods department at the Bricklayer's Arms station, on the night duty—the goods at this time of year chiefly come up at night—we have two trains come in, one at twelve o'clock, and the Dover train at half-past three o'clock in the morning—they bring market goods; fruit, fish, and meat—the prisoner was in the employ of Mrs. Stansbury, who carries goods from the station in her own carts—they come about two o'clock every morning, and take fruit, and meat—the cart the prisoner was attached to was driven by Neale, the prisoner was guard to it—on the morning of the 2nd of Sept., I particularly noticed two pieces of lead, which had been brought up from Ashford, and were about to be put in the stores—they were the property of the Company—I saw it safe about two o'clock that morning—I afterwards saw the same lead at Aldermanbury—the prisoner and Neale had been at the station before two o'clock that morning—their employ<lb></lb>ment would give them opportunity to take that lead, if they were disposed to do it—they had their fruit in what we term the dock—after I had been told of the discovery of the lead I went after the prisoner—I found him at the east end of the town—I got him to return with me to Aldermanbury—the</p>

                  </hi> I am managing clerk to Mrs. Stansbury, the carrier, at the George-yard, Aldermanbury. The prisoner was in her employ—he and a man named Neale went with a cart to the Bricklayer's Arms—I can<lb></lb>not say whether the prisoner went with Neale on the morning of the 2nd of Sept.—I was going out of Mrs. Stansbury's yard that morning, and met the prisoner in the street, within two yards of the yard—it was from half-past eleven to twelve o'clock—he had a bag on his back, which appeared to con<lb></lb>tain something heavy—I said, "Well, John, what have you got there?"—he said, "A parcel a person gave me at the station, to deliver just down here"—I said, "Who gave you the parcel?"—he hesitated, and said, "That is of no consequence"—I said, "What is it you have got?"—I put my hand to the bottom of the bag, and felt it was very weighty—I told him to come to the gateway, and show me what he had got—he came and opened the bag, and I saw two pieces of lead in it—I said, "Here is something very mysterious here, it has the appearance of <hi rend="italic">rogueishness</hi>, take it to the office up the yard"—he took it to the office, and I had it weighed—one piece weighed 84lbs., the other 36lbs.—he gave no further account of how he became possessed of it—I said I must make further inquiry into it, and the lead was detained at the office—I did not see the prisoner again from that time till seven o'clock in the evening, when Mr. Shaw brought him—the lead was then produced—the prisoner said nothing particular about it that I took notice of—he had said in the morning, when I asked him a second time, that he found it in Neal's van; and another account that he gave in the evening was, that be</p>

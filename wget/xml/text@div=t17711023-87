Mr. Jackson sent the prisoner to my house to hang a bell, on the 19th of October; the bell was to be hung in my servant's room, up two pair of stairs, the wire came down into my bed chamber, up one pair of stairs: a chest of drawers stood in the chamber in which I kept my money; I had twenty seven guineas and a half in these drawers, which I put into a coffee cup, in the drawers, three days before the prisoner came; he was employed from ten in the morning till six in the afternoon in hanging the bell.</p>
               <p>Q. He had occasion to be in both rooms?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes; my wife went up stairs about eleven o'clock, to put her things together, because a strange man was there. The prisoner went to dinner and staid about an hour, or an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230068"></xptr> hour and an half, and then came back and finished hanging the bell, which he completed, when he had done, at pretty near six o'clock; he came down into the public room and staid about ten minutes, drinking a pint of beer; as soon as he was gone I went up stairs and locked my chamber-door. My wife and I went to bed about half an hour after three o'clock; just after I got into bed my wife opened her drawer, and missed the money; when I put the money in I locked the drawer, and gave the key to my wife: nobody had been in the room besides the prisoner, my maid servant, and the glazier. I dressed myself and went to the prisoner's master, and told him of my loss; he said he had discharged the pris oner, and that he did not know his name; a boy in the shop said his name was

I got up early the next morning; and by enquiring of one of the Smith's men, I found he lodged in Red Lion-street, Spital fields; he was at home; I asked him to go with me to a public house, which he did, and there I charged a constable with him: he said he was innocent; we searched him, and found upon him only a guinea and a half and some silver; he gave me the key of his chest, which was at Deptford; we found no money, either in his chest or at his lodgings.</p>

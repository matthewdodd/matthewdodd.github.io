On Sunday night, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was walking along; I passed the prisoner; she asked me if I dropped something; I turned back; she took hold of my watch-chain; and wipped my watch out of my fob.</p>

               <p>THOMAS BEALE, I am one of the patrols. About eleven o'clock, I was coming up George-street, formerly called Diot-street; when I came up to Phoenix yard, three girls came up to me, and said there was a cry of murder; I went down, and saw the prosecutor and the prisoner together. The prosecutor said he had been robbed of his watch; he looked round, and found the watch without the outer case; he said she throwed the watch over a cart, and it fell on the dung-hill. The outer case was never found.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along Diot-street; there were three or four women, with the man under the gateway; he knocked me down, and said I was the person that took his watch away.</p>

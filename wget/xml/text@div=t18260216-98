               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where was this? A. In Brewer's-yard, West-street - I think it was a damp, and kind of winterish evening - I was perfectly sober; I went to the Rose-inn, afterwards, to give directions to my drover, but I drank nothing there - the prisoner came up in front of me in a very indecent manner - she was not there above a minute or two; I did not see her again for a fortnight afterwards; I did not offer to make this up if I got 10l.; she offered it to me, but I ejected it.</p>

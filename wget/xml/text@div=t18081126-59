               <p>Q. Did you at any time in the beginning of this month lose any half boot - A. I missed it on Tuesday the 4th of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that half boot before you missed it - A. It laid in the shop under the cutting board, about four feet from the door. On the Wednesday I was down in my cellar of the adjoining house cutting my bottom stuff, I saw the prisoner go on the street with it on his leg; he has but one leg, the other is a wooden leg; I ran up stairs and stepped before him; I said my man pray where did you come by that half boot; he hesitated for a moment and coloured, and then he said he bought it of a man in Newgate market, that came with a waggon twice a week; I asked him if he knew the man; he said, yes; I wished him to take the boot off his leg, he did; I fetched the fellow to it, they happened to be companions; then I hesitated a few moments and fetched Mr. Ekelsoe, the officer.</p>

            . Q. You are a constable of Hatton garden - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect who the prisoner said he had this boot of - A. Yes, he said it was from a country person that came up twice a week with a waggon to Newgate market.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he should know him - A. Yes. I went with him on the Saturday morning following; he said that was one of the days the man came up. After looking over Newgate market, he could not find any person that he could describe; then he told me he should not know the man if he was to see him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Newgate market on Tuesday morning; a countryman in a smock frock says<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260037"></xptr>to me, my friend I have got an odd half boot, I bought a pair, and by moving my things I have lost one; he asked me seven shillings for it; I told him I would give him five shillings and sixpence for it; he said I should have it; I gave him six shillings, and he gave me a six pence; I brought it home with me and put it on, after I had my breakfast. On the Wednesday evening I was going for a pail of grains, the prosecutor asked me where I got the boot; I told him; I was not afraid to go back with him, I had bought it innocently; he brought the boot forward he has now, and then he sent to Hatton garden office for an officer, and took me in custody.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

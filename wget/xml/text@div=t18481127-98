                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a lodging-house, in Finsbury-square. The prisoners came to lodge there in April—Cabral was represented to me as a Baroness; she was married in May—Rosa acted as her servant—each of them had a bed-room—they boarded with me, and used the rooms of the house as well as other boarders—they had access to the dining and. drawing-rooms—Rosa's bed-room was opposite to her mistress's—having missed many articles, I spoke to Sergeant Brannan, and he came to my house on 2nd Nov.—he went up with me to Rosa's bed-room—some towels, and other things, were found there, between the mattress and bed—some of them were sewn up in an old apron belonging to Rosa—some soap and other things were found there, which Brannan took possession of—I speak Spanish, which is understood by both the prisoners—I spoke to Rosa in Spanish, and told her they were my things—she said they were for her use—I said all that she had for her use was the linen on her bed and one chamber-towel—she did not make any other reply—I then went to her mistress's room, being, called by the officer—it was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning—she was up, but her husband was not—we had to wait till he got up—we then got admission, and found her concealing a silver brooch, which had been lost in Aug. last, under her shawl—there were two towels round her waist, under her clothes, and two pieces of soap under her arms, under her dress—the towels were clean—they had not been supplied for her use; I do not know where they were taken from—I had the giving out of her linen myself—she and her husband had each of them twice a week a clean towel—there were other clean towels in the room for their use—there were some men's shirts found—I have missed other property, which I have not yet traced—she did not say anything about whose these things were—the value of what I found in her room, including the brooch, was about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

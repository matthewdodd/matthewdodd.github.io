               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen; this was a wet day, a Saturday, I met Manning at the gentleman's door, and he asked me to stop a minute to drink, he went into this shop, and as it rained, I went in also, he sold some things, he brought the rest out, as they could not agree. I had an inspection for the morrow, and wanted to go home, he said, shop a bit, and I will go back and get the money; and he went and got it: we went to the Bull's-head, I left him there. I went to my sister's, and came home at night; I saw Manning standing at the end of the court, we went to bed; In the morning I got up and dressed myself in my regimentals, with my knapsack; when I came down my landlord searched my knapsack, and found nothing; he searched Manning and found his property; I advised Manning to confess, that I might not he brought into the hobble, which he did, and I directly told the landlord, and he promised nothing should hurt me.</p>

No; not till I found him - I inquired for his father's residence - I have known the prisoner some years, and he knew me - he has never taken my horse before, to my knowledge - I lost it on Monday night, and found it on Tuesday evening - I traced him to town with it - I heard in the village that he had taken it- he did not tell me he intended to return it - I did not say, at the office, that I did not think he intended to steal it - I said I did not expect he would bring it back - I said I did not wish to hurt him - I do not recollect saying, that as I was in a passion, I gave him into custody - I will not swear it, but believe I did not say any such thing.</p>

            . I am a constable of Shoreditch. The prosecutor applied to me, and said the prisoner had taken his horse out of his stable, and desired me to go and look for it - he stated it to me as a case of felony - I said, "Do you mean to say he stole the horse?" - he said,"Certainly, what else could I mean?" - we met the prisoner in the street - the prosecutor said, "There is the man"- he caught hold of him, and said, "Jem, I want my horse, where is my horse?" - he did not answer - I took him into a shop - the prosecutor again began swearing, and said,"Where is my horse?" - he asked him to forgive him several times - we found the horse at the prisoner's father's stable, with another horse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was walking near his father's house? A. Yes, within one hundred yards of it - he told the magistrate he had come to see his father and mother.</p>
               <p>CHARLES FLANDERS re-examined. My stable-door was not locked - I went out in the afternoon, and came home at eleven o'clock at night - the horse was gone - there is a door to the yard.</p>

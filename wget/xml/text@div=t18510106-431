                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 11, New-street, New Kent-road. On 17th Dec. I was standing with Eliza Cooper at her door, which is No. 4, in the same street, and the prisoner and another man came up—the other man asked us to take something to drink—we both went in-doors with them, and the prisoner's friend sent for half a pint of gin—we were all together in the parlour; I was at one side of the fireplace and the prisoner on the other, and Eliza Cooper and the other man in a row—we drank the gin directly it came, and Cooper was talking to the other man—there was not a word spoken to the prisoner—she did not call him any name—I believe they were perfect strangers to each other—the prisoner took the poker up from the fireplace, and struck Cooper over the left temple, and she fell down directly—the prisoner said, "You b—y cow, I will do for you before you go!"—he was in the act of striking a second blow, when I took the poker from his hand, and he ran away—I followed, and gave him in charge—he was in liquor, but knew perfectly well what he was doing—he held the poker with both hands when he struck the blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistantto Mr. Gill, a chemist, of the Walworth-road. Cooper was brought to our shop on 17th Dec., about seven o'clock in the evening—she had a small wound over the left eye, about an inch long, and about one-eighth of an inch deep—the skin was lacerated, but not cut through—she had lost a good deal of blood—the flesh around was very much swollen as if the blow had been inflicted by some heavy instrument—the poker might have done it—it was not a dan<lb></lb>gerous wound—I have not seen her since—I do not think the poker could have bent in that way—she may have guarded it off with her arm, and that may have bent it.</p>

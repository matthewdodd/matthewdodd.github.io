                  </hi>. I live with my father, Thomas Redhouse, in Southampton-street, Camberwell. The prisoner came in May last to our house, as a nurse, to attend on my mother, who was then ill—when she had been in the house about three weeks, I left the house, and was away for a fortnight—when I came back, I missed fifteen drawings and three engravings of my father's, from a portfolio in the back parlour cupboard, and a handker<lb></lb>chief of my own—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—this fan belonged to my late mother.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 38.) On the 25th of Sept. I appre<lb></lb>hended the prisoner, in a gentleman's house at Maida-hill—I had before that searched a house at Chiswick, in which she had a room, as her daughter told me—in a box in that room I found these drawings—Mr. Red-house was with me, and identified them—I showed them to the prisoner at the station—she did not say anything then; but afterwards, in coming across the Park, she said she was cleaning out a cupboard at Mr. Redhouse's, and took them from there at mere rubbish—I afterwards searched her room again with Sergeant Bevill, and saw him take this fan out of a tea caddy, which was opened with a key which was got from the prisoner—she said a sailor, who was dead, gave her the fan and case.</p>

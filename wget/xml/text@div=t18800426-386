                  </hi>. I live at 29, White Lion Street, Clerkenwell, and am the wife of Edward Richards—at about 8 p.m. on 21st February, I had been to Collins's oil shop, and was at my garden gate with a bag which contained various articles of marketing—I had a purse in my hand which contained about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a small sovereign purse containing three old coins—the prisoner and another young man wrenched the bag from my hand, and one of them caught hold of my purse and twisted it out of my hand—I was held round the neck, and the prisoner put his hand over my mouth—I called for help—the one behind let go of me, I fell, and they ran away—Henrietta Moult came up to me—I saw the prisoner at the station on 3rd April, and he asked me not to charge him and he would give me a sovereign—I was taken there by the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Islington—on 21st February, a little after 8 p.m., I was at the corner of Baron Street and White Lion Street, and saw the prisoner with three or four others at the oil shop corner—the prisoner said, "We will wait till the old b——comes out"—I knew the prisoner by sight, and the prisoner put his hand in my back pocket—I was waiting for my lady friend—I waited about 10 minutes, and one of them said, "You wait and I will keep watch"—the prisoner walked away and came back, and then I missed him again—in five or ten minutes I heard a scream of "Help," from the direction of White Lion Street—I ran down White Lion Street to Mrs. Richards, and saw the prisoner leaving go of her neck and they ran away—I helped her into her house.</p>

               <p>I used to work a few doors from him—Baron Street runs into White Lion Street, no I could see down both streets—the prisoner never said anything to me before, or the others—I cannot say how many there were there—they were all standing in a ring talking—I saw the prisoner's face—he was standing among the others—I don't know who said "the old b——," because I did not stand looking at them—I was cross-examined at the police-court by the prisoner—I did not say that I saw the prisoner and another boy running before him—it occurred three or four doors down White Lion Street—I said 300 yards, because I did not know the length, but when I turned into White Lion Street I was about the length of this room from the prisoner—there was a lamp there—I only saw the side face of those running away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Lieutenant Robert Saxby, of No. 6, Queen Elizabeth Row, Greenwich. He is attended by a medical gentleman—I saw him this morning, he is too ill to attend this Court—on Friday, 24th April, I saw the prisoners; they first came to my master's house about 7 o'clock in the morning—I saw them both, the prisoners are the men—Janes spoke to me and said, "Shall I take the dust away?"—I said that my master did not like it taken away before he was about—he said there were two of them, and they would not be long taking it; French was then standing just by the gate—there was a cart and horse there—I had an opportunity of seeing French at that time—I refused to let them have it, and they came again a little before 10 o'clock—my master was up at that time, and I then gave them permission to remove the dust—there is a short garden from the front of the house to the road—the dust bin is in the back yard—the prisoners had to pass through the passage from the front door to the back door to get to the dust bin—there were several coats hanging in the passage—Janes came in with the basket to remove the dust—French stood by the cart, he did not do anything—they were engaged about half an hour in removing the dust—while they were removing it, my mistress called me—I came up to the passage, and found a coat lying in the passage—I picked it up, and hung it on the pegs again—it was my master's, and the other coats that were there were my master's—when I came up into the passage, being called by my mistress, I saw Trench standing by the cart—I returned to the kitchen again, which is underground, and while there heard persons walking along the passage—my master was in the back garden—on one occasion I heard the person who went along the passage stop short before he got to the back door, and having stopped he turned back to the front door, and went out, without going through the passage—no one came to the house while they were there—the cart drove away—that was about two minutes after I had heard the man's steps come into the passage and return—I went up to shut the door directly I saw the cart go away from the door, and when I came up I saw Janes, who was just coming back with the cart; he asked me if I saw any one drive the cart from the door—(French was not with the cart when it came back; I did not see any more of him)—I said, "Very likely the man that was with it"—he said, "There was nobody with me"—I did not notice the state of the coats in the passage at that time—Janes finished taking the dust, and went away in about ten minutes afterwards, and in about three minutes afterwards my master went in the passage—he called me—I went up and missed a black frock coat, the same that I had picked up—my master went out after the cart.</p>

               <p>missed—I was in the kitchen, at the window—I saw Janes go out with the basket of dust, and come in with it empty—Janes shot the dust into the cart—I was in the kitchen all the time, except when my mistress called me up—I was looking at the cart almost all the time—I was at the window—I did not see the cart go away, I saw it come back.</p>

On Friday morning, 24th April, I received information from Mr. Saxby, about half past 10 o'clock—I, received a description of some person, and in consequence of that I went after the prisoner Janes—I took him about 1 o'clock at Lewisham, close by the railway—I asked him if he had not fetched dust from No. 6, Queen Elizabeth Row that morning—he said, "Yes"—I asked him who he had, with him—he said, "No one"—I told him that Mr. Saxby charged him with stealing a coat, and I took him to the station—I had known him, before—I had not seen him that day—I had seen him in company with French plenty of times—I said to Janes, "Who was the person that was with you fetching the dust away"—he said that he had no one with him.</p>

On Saturday morning, 25th April, I met French in the road, and said, "Charles, I have been looking after you for some time, I want yon for stealing a coat in the Greenwich-road with Janes"—he began swearing, and said that he knew nothing about it—I took him to the station, and Mr. Saxby and the servant were there—Mr. Saxby said, "That is the man that was with the cart," and the servant said, "That is the man that was standing at the cart."</p>

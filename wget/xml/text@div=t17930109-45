               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at these rings now produced by Mr. Rogers? - I saw one, but the others I did not take notice of; I saw it on the 21st as near as I can recollect about two o'clock; at the time I came into my sister's neither of the two prisoners were there, they came in while I was there, there was no conversation in their presence passed about it.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came into your sister's had they any thing with them? - No, but I saw a pillow case at my sister's, I saw it before they came in, I was in my sister's apartment about ten minutes before they did come in, they came in both together.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with either of the prisoners relative to some rings or that pillow case? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q. To which of them said you any thing about them? - To both of them; they had not been in the room ten minutes before I understood that Mrs. Pally had been robbed, I met a boy on the stairs who told me, as such I desired that these rings might be taken off the premises, the two prisoners were then in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the things you desired taken off the premises? - The rings which were left in the room; one I saw, there were four I understood, I could see only one positively, previous to that they took this pillow case away, and before I heard that the robbery was committed, the pillow case was there when they came in first, it appeared to be full, full nearly however, when they came in, Douglas brought a basket, and took it away in the basket, Douglas and Spencer together, I don't know where they carried it; they immediately took the rings away when I desired them, they were given into Douglas's hands, he took them away.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you saw Douglas there the first time? - It was about ten minutes to two; they came in, the pillow case was taken away, they might be absent about a quarter of an hour, and returned, and then I heard of the robbery, and I desired that these rings should be taken off the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them say any thing about these things? - The things were taken away, I had no conversation about what the contents of the pillow case was at that time.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Golden-lane; I am Wood's own sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the 21st of December having any rings at your lodgings? - I had, I have them in my pocket now; there are three, I had them on the 21st of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was at your lodgings that day? - My brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Was either of the two prisoners there? - No, not at all during the day.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw nothing of the white bag then? - No, I have seen Mr. Douglas several times, but nothing further than washing for him; I did not see Spencer there, nor Douglas, while my brother was there; my brother came up to me, and I asked him to fetch me a pint of purl, and in pulling out the money to give him to pay for it, I pulled out these rings in my hand, I heard about Mr. Pally's house being robbed at two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your brother say any thing to you about taking the things out of the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Wood. You hear what your sister says? - Yes, my Lord, and it is a very grievous matter to hear it; Mr. Rogers knows I went to him and related the circumstances, I cannot say positively as to the day.</p>
               <p>Court to Rogers. When did he come to you? - After the prisoners were fully committed, on the 25th of December, he came to me to acquaint me that he saw a bag of a white pillow case at his sister's, and he mentioned the four rings in particular; he mentioned to me, that he saw Spencer in Douglas's room while he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you advertised the reward? - Yes. He then acquainted me also, that he saw Douglas put the white bag in a basket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Douglas. Why did not the man, if he was a fair man go and tell it directly.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a very just observation.</p>

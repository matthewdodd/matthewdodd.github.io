                  </hi>. I am horse-keeper to an omnibus proprietor at Turnham<lb></lb>green. I was in my master's yard about half-past seven o'clock on the 10th of April—the prisoner was helping me there—I had a few words with him that day about his being so long gone from his work—he ran into the stable, got a fork, and ran at me with it—I wrenched it form his hand, and put it down under the stable window—he ran and fetched a second fork, and stabbed me with it—the prong entered my left temple, and he struck me with the fork on my head—the would bled—I was taken to the doctor—I was ill a fortnight—I had not said anything to the prisoner to justify this—we had some words—I had not struck him.</p>

The prosecutor was brought to me—he was in very low and sinking state, having lost a great deal of blood from the left side of the head—the bone was quite here—the danger ensued on the following day from erysipelas coming on—below the wound on the temple there was a puncture which had divided an artery, and accounted for the loss of blood.</p>

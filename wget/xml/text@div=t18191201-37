               <p>JOSIAH PAWNEY. I live with my parents in Sidney-grove, City-road. On a Saturday, the latter end of October, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in the City-road, and saw a stage coach gallopping up the road - the name of Morris was on it; another was behind it with the word Times on it - that was also running.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they racing - A. No, but the hindermost one was gallopping to come even with the other, just at the <placeName id="t18191201-37-crimeloc214">crossing by the New River</placeName>

The Times went on, but this coach stopped immediately; the prisoner drove it. The road is wide enough for three carriages to pass.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man - A. He bled at the top of the eye. The prisoner got down, picked him up, and assisted in putting him into a coach; he was taken to the hospital. I saw him afterwards when I was examined before the Coroner - he was then dead.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance did you see the prisoner gallopping - A. Just by. He pulled up as soon as the man was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you know the man - A. I have often seen him. I do not know whether he was deaf, or whether his sight was bad - he was lame. I have no reason to suppose he was drunk.</p>

            . I am a fruiterer. I stood at my door and saw the Times coach - the other passed from behind it - the old man went to get away from the Times, and fell; whether the horse knocked him down or not, I cannot say, but the hindermost coach was endeavouring to pass the Times, and drove on the man. The prisoner drove it. They were both Paddington coaches.</p>
               <p>Q. If the prisoner kept in the line behind the Times, would he have gone clear of the man - A. Yes; three carriages might pass in the road. The prisoner got down immediately, led the man to the railings, and sat him down. Some gentlemen came round, the prisoner called a coach, gave the man 5 s. and the coachman 5 s. and said nothing should be wanted. I do not know the deceased's christian name.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. On a Saturday morning the deceased was brought to the hospital; there was an extensive laceration of the scalp, and the bone left completely bare; he had also a contusion of the collar bone, a contusion on the eye, and a considerable injury was done to the chest. He lived until the 24th of November, and then died. The accident itself was serious, and I should apprehend dangerous in any case, but his constitution was much impaired by intemperance and age. I have no hesitation in saying, be died from the injury; but at the same time the same extent of injury might not have occasioned the death of an individual younger, and one whose constitution was better - he was deaf and lame. The injury was likely to be occasioned by a stage-coach coming against him. He came to the hospital by the name of

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was his sight impaired - A. Probably it was. He was much impaired in his system.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had rather a restive horse on the near side - I did not see the man until I was close to him. I hallood to him, but before I could stop my horses they knocked him down. When I was on him I was afraid stop till I passed - I then got off, and afforded him all the assistance I could. and am seriously concerned, but I could not avoid it. I was not gallopping. I had been endeavouring to overtake the Times that it might not take up my passengers at the Blue Coat Boy.</p>

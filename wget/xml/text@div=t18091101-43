            . I am a watchman in Great Wild-street, Lincoln's-Inn-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of the 20th of October was your attention drawn to Mr. Davidson's premises - A. Yes; I found the bars of the cellar window were disturbed out of their places. It was about two o'clock in the morning after crying the hour of two, I came round where these bars were disturbed; I saw three men, one made towards me, the other crossed the street, and the other made up Queen-street, I went up Wild Passage into Drury-Lane, and came down Princes Court into Wild-street; I heard them talking and whispering together, with that I went into Drury Lane, where Tooney the watchman was; I gave him the alarm, and we both went together.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got with the watchman did you see any body in the cellar. - A. I heard them talk in the cellar; we sprang our rattles, that alarmed Mr. Davidson and others.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the cellar. A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. How long had you seen the cellar opened before you made the alarm. A. I did not see it open, I saw the bars raised about half an hour before I raised an alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. By being in that state any one might fall through, it was in a dangerous state. A. It was ready for them to get in.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you find him in the cellar. - A. I did; I never parted from him; I saw the bars wrenched.</p>
               <p>Q.From the state of the cellar bars do you think he tumbled in by accident. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the cellar flap that night. - A. I cannot say that I saw it shut, the flap of the cellar was fastened, I found the three bars wrenched off when I was alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing in your cellar. - A. Yes, a great deal of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the wine been carried off. - A. Yes; there were three bottles they had left just close to the iron bars ready to be taken off; they were in the beer cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they had been removed from the wine cellar to the beer cellar. - A. Yes. There was one bottle the watchman found by the other watchman out of the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the watchman find it. - A. No; he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any others removed. - A. No; this lamp was burning among some straw in my wine cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a common burner from somewhere out of the street. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These bars, where were they the night before. - A. They were nailed at both ends, they were placed close to the left hand side of the foredoor to let light in the cellar, that is the way they got in the cellar, by wrenching the bars off, the flap was remaining where it ought to be, only these three bars were wrenched up by which means persons could get down the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this cellar part of your dwelling house. - A. Yes, made under the parlour of my dwelling house.</p>
               <p>Q. What parish is it in. - A.

            ; I am the housekeeper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How lately before had you seen these bars secured. - A. I can swear that I had seen them secure at half after nine o'clock that night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. Q. to Tooney. Did you find the bottles; I found them at the door of oneside, one broke, and one sound just at the corner of the door, they had just been handed out of the street, we gave the bottle that was full to Mr. Davison, I saw my partner give it him. I do not know what became of the other that was broke.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the bottle the watchman gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to that bottle being yours. - A. No, I cannot. It is white wine, I have not tasted it, I missed white wine from my cellar, such a bottle as that is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Whether that is wine or vinegar you cannot tell. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Open the bottle and taste it. - A. It is mountain wine. There were four bottles of mountain wine in the cellar, they were all gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Defence. I was very much intoxicated in liquor, going up Wild-street, Lincoln's-Inn-fields, I tumbled through a hole, I fell upon my head which took my senses away, I did not know where I was till a parcel or people came round me, they told me I got into the place to rob it. If there was another man there I did not know it, he must be there before me, he might have broken into the cellar, he made his escape, if I had not known myself innocent I might have made my escape.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

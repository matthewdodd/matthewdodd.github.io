                  </hi>. I live at 28, Old Gravel Lane, St. George's—I am quarter-master of the <hi rend="italic">Hector</hi>—the prisoner was boatswain of that ship last voyage with me—on the morning of 14th February, between twelve and one I was having a pot or two of beer with him at a public-house—there were two or three females and the man who attends at the bar—we were in good friendship—we left the house together, I was going home—he began talking about the chief officer bringing charges against him—I told him I never heard the chief officer say anything against him—I said I did not want him to go any further with me, and wished him good night—with that he cut me in the face with a knife or some sharp instrument—I could not see where he took it from—he struck me in the forehead, in the eye, and partly on the cheek; there were two or three cuts—I had been drinking, but was thoroughly sober to know what I was about—the prisoner appeared to be sober—I never had any animosity a gainst him—we were always on good terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe two or three months ago there was a disturbance between you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was coming out of Victoria Docks, but we had no quarrel during the voyage—I had not challenged him to fight on this occasion—I made no effort to bite him.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">DANIEL ROSS</hi>. I am a surgeon in Commercial Road—I examined the prosecutor at the station-house—he was bleeding from an incised wound about the centre of the forehead, which took a downward course between the eye and the nose; he had also a punctured wound over the left cheek<lb></lb>bone; both wounds were deep, to the bone—they had been inflicted with some sharp instrument, a knife might have done it—the wounds were serious, but not dangerous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you examined the prisoner at the police-court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, by the direction of the Magistrate; there was rather an extensive bruise on his left arm, and in the centre of the bruise there was an abrasion of the skin, and the marks of teeth, well defined—that was caused by a bite—there were also some slight scratches on his left cheek—the wounds on the prosecutor were clean-cut wounds—I should say they could not be caused by the knuckles, or by a fall on any sharp sub<lb></lb>stance; there was a deep, clean, incised wound, and a clean punctured wound; the same instrument would produce both.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was the prisoner dressed wheu you examined him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had an overcoat on, and I think an undercoat, and shirt sleeves—I examined them carefully, but saw no marks on them—I should say the bruise and bite had been done within twenty-four hours.</p>

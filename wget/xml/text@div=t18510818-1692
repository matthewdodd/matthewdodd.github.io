                  </hi>. I am the widow of the deceased, John Kenton. He was a bricklayer, and lived at Brentford—he was thirty-four years old; he had five children—he was in good health on 3rd July—on that evening, between 7 and 8 o'clock, in consequence of something I heard, I went into Brookshot-road, which is a few yards from where we lived—I saw my husband and the prisoner there quarrelling; it was something about strawberries—I saw the prisoner strike my husband, and knock him down—before that, the prisoner went into his own yard, and stripped off all his clothes but his trowsers—my husband had all his clothes on—the prisoner was the worse for drink—my husband got up, and hit Marshall again; Marshall struck him again, and he turned back and said he did not wish to fight—it was not because he would not, but because he could not fight, and he turned away and went to Mrs. Allen's beer-shop—Marshall went into his own yard—he came out again in about ten minutes, and went to the beer-shop where my husband was—I heard him say as he went along that he would knock it out of the b—y b—r—I saw them come out of the beer-shop, and there was some more fighting just outside—Marshall was knocked down several times—they both fell down together; my husband knocked him down—they continued fighting for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—Marshall at last struck my husband one blow in the forehead and another behind the ear, and knocked him down, and he became senseless—he remained insensible for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I went up and assisted him; the men who were by got some water and bathed him—after that he was able to get up and walk home—I walked home with him—he complained of his head, and went to bed immediately—he never got out of bed afterwards—Mr. Goodchild, the doctor, attended him on the Saturday—he died on the Sunday evening—he suffered very much in his head after the Thursday—his face was all blood, and there was blood in his ear where the blow was given.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber, and lire in Brookshot-place.

                  </hi>. I keep the Hope and Anchor beer-shop. On 3rd July the deceased came to my house between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening with two others and called for a pot of beer—the prisoner came in about twenty minutes afterwards, and went into the tap-room—there were words between him and the deceased, but I was in the bar and did not bear them, they were quarreling—my husband called on the prisoner once or twice to desist from quarreling, and at last begged him to leave the house, which he did, and Kenton followed him—Kenton came back again at a few minutes past 8—he appeared sober, he had had a blow on the left eye—the prisoner came in again about a quarter-past 8, and went into the tap-room—I followed him, I refused to draw him any more beer, and desired him to leave the house—he appeared in liquor—he said he did not wish to make a disturbance in my house or any one else's—I put my hand to his shoulder and said, "Now, Marshall, leave the house directly, I will not have any disturbance here"—he left, and the deceased followed him in three or four minutes, and I do not think it was more than five minutes when I heard a disturbance—I heard the prisoner talking to Kenton when he was there the second time, but I do not know exactly what the words were.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living at New Brentford. I was called to see the deceased on Saturday evening, 6th July, between 7 and 8 o'clock—I found him insensible, and his breathing laboured—there was a bruise on the left eye—I sent him some remedies, and saw him again at 10, he was then in the same state—I saw him again on the Sunday morning, he was still in the same state, and appeared weaker—he was sinking—he died on the Sunday afternoon—I made a post-mortem examination—I found he had been bruised about the upper part of the chest and face, and there was bleeding from the left ear—I removed the scalp, and found that the parts beneath were a good deal bruised—the brain was a good deal congested, and inflamed at the back part—the substance of the brain was somewhat congested—on the base of the brain I found clots of blood, likewise blood on the surface of the brain, at the back-part—I should say the cause of death was inflammation of the brain, caused by the injuries at the back of the head—a blow, or a violent fall would produce it.</p>

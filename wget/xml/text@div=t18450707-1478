               <p>I hardly know how to word the note I am writing to you. At the time of my misfortunes last summer, I, among other things, owed a coal bill, which I have sometime since been summoned for, but which, through the man's in<lb></lb>solence, I swore I never would pay. A few words ensued between me and my landlord last week, and we agreed to move; we were doing so this day, Thurs<lb></lb>day, when, suddenly, our goods were seized for the coal bill and expenses, in all 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. It so happens that I have no money in Mrs. Rogers's hands. We have managed to make up 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at least we will do so, and I have sent to ask you if you will stand our friend once more by sending up a sovereign by return of post, and I will repay you again by post in the course of next week. If you send it to me do it by return of post, as I have a man in possession, which runs up 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day, expenses. Excuse us saying any more, as I am almost too late for the post. We send our love, &amp;c. Please direct the letter to Mr. E. Cooper, at Mr. Jackson's, 82, Friar-street, Blackfriars-road, London"—dated 4th June, post-mark 5th June)—in con<lb></lb>sequence of receiving this letter I went to the post-office at Hadleigh and procured a post-office order for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is it—I enclosed it in a letter addressed as requested in the letter—I sealed it, paid 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and put it in the post-office myself—I never heard from my son, acknowledging the receipt, I wrote again to another place, where he had lived, and this was dis<lb></lb>covered.</p>

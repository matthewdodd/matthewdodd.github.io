In December last, on the 18th, about seven in the evening, I lost the things in the indictment; I had seen them that night about six: my wife went out about six; I was at home, and two children, and some lodgers; the house is mine. As my wife was going out, this woman came in to a lodger of ours; she had been several times before; she came up stairs as at other times; she staid about half an hour; I was at work in the opposite room; she went down about half past six, or thereabouts; about seven, I heard one of the doors slam backwards and forwards; I came down, and found a back window sash lifted up, and left up; a door opened into the passage, that bolted on the inside; and the street door left open; I immediately searched the drawers, and there was nothing gone; I then searched the box, and all my wife's things were gone, but the cuffs of the three gowns: the prisoner had been taken up since for another robbery; I believe it was in March; the next day, the 19th, we took her up, and found nothing upon her belonging to us; and we let her go; when she was taken up again, we found a duplicate of a petticoat which belonged to my wife; I am sure this is the woman; I saw her go down stairs.</p>

               <p>I was going out, and this woman came in; she said, are you going out? I said, yes; she went up stairs; when I came home, I found I was robbed; I had a suspicion of the prisoner, and I went to her room, and did not find her; I came back home; and she afterwards came again to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070009"></xptr>my lodgers the same night; I accused her of it, but we found nothing on her, and let her go; she abused us for taking her up; she was taken up for robbing another person; and when she was searched, a duplicate was found on her of a black petticoat, which is here; I never found any thing else of my property; the two gowns cost me twenty-seven shillings, and the other, twenty shillings; the petticoats were good ones.</p>

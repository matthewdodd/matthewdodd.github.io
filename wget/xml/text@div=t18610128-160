                  </hi>. I am housemaid to Lady Talbot de Malahide—she lives at 3, Lowndes-square, Chelsea—on 30th November, Lady Talbot went out about five minutes before 7, in the carriage—the footman went with her—after she had gone out, the butler went out, and after that I went upstairs to Lady Talbot's bedroom; that was about half-past 7—her ladyship's bedroom is the front room on the third floor—I found the room all in confusion—the two wardrobe doors were wide open each way, the drawer was half out, and the cover of the jewel-case lay outside the drawer; the pincushion thrown down on the floor, and the drawer at the bottom of the looking-glass half open—Lady Talbot's watch, which had been on the dressing-table, was gone—the jewel-case was also gone—I had not been in the room since 4 o'clock in the afternoon—the room was then all right and straight—when I went up at half-past 7, it was to light her ladyship's fire—while I was in the room I heard a door go upstairs, and I went upstairs to my own room which is the front attic—I there found the jewel-close, and the two the two room trays that held the diamonds, lying at each end of it, and what is termed a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, lying by the side of it—I then went into the next room, which is a spare room, that is a front room also; and there I found the window open, the floor all wet, and an upper square of glass broken in the window, near the lock of the window—it was a very wet night, and was raining very hard at the time—I missed my silver watch from my room, from off the fire-place—I had seen it safe at 4 o'clock, when I was up in the room—I saw that the jewel-case had been broken open, by the trays being out—I took the iron thing into my hand that they opened it with—I went down and called the lady's-maid, and she came up stairs and examined the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lady's-maid to Lady Talbot—I was called by last witness on 30th November, about half-past 7—I went upstairs—I found the wardrobe open, and everything in confusion—I had dressed Lady Talbot for the theatre—the things were all right at that time—I left the bedroom about a quarter-past 6—the watch that I missed was on the dressing-table at that time—the jewels were in my charge—I kept the key of them—a diamond necklace was missed on this occasion, two tiaras, two diamond bracelets, two diamond brooches, and a small diamond ornament for the neck; altogether they are valued at about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were other smaller things besides these jewels, but not in the case—all that were in the case, were taken; the others were about the room, but they were not taken—they were of inferior value—they were thrown about—all the valuable jewellery that could be got at was taken, all the diamonds—those strewed about the room had been turned out of the boxes, but not removed—I lost a brooch of my own, it was taken off a pincushion—the house is in the parish of Chelsea—to the best of my belief, this diamond (<hi rend="italic">looking at a ring produced</hi>) belonged to her ladyship's necklace, from the size and purity of it—all I can say is, that it exactly resembles one of those in the centre of the necklace—I had been in the habit of cleaning these jewels for fifteeen years, brushing them almost daily—I think this was about the centre stone in the necklace, because it was the largest.</p>

On the night of 30th November, I went to 3, Lowndes-square, and examined the premises—I went up into the unoccupied room and the attic, and found the window open—a pane of glass was broken near the fastening, and there was some glass on the floor—a person could get from the roof into that room very easily—it was a very foggy misty night, small rain—it was rather windy at times, gusty—being so dark that night, I could not make a very good examination; but at daybreak, I went on to the roof of the house—there is a balustrade in front—I saw finger-marks on the balustrade in front of the houses 4 and 5, Lowndes-square, on the dirt that had become damp on the balustrades—No. 7 is under repair—there were ladders against it, reaching up to the roof—it is a flat roof—the marks were such as a person might make in passing along the roofs, and keeping himself steady—I was shown this <hi rend="italic">jimmy</hi> and the dressing-case—I compared the marks on it—it appears to have been broken open with that <hi rend="italic">jimmy</hi>—some days after this, I think the 3rd December, I received a hat from Meakins, a constable on the beat—I made some inquiries with reference to that—I went to 40, Cambridge-street, Hackney-road, on, as</p>

               <p>—I saw that hat worn by the prisoner at Lewes, on 2d July last—I expressed that opinion before I knew what was inside the hat, and said whose hat it was—I was present afterwards at the hatter's when inquiries were made about it—I had the hat shown to me at the cattle-show about the 11th; the cattle-show finished on Friday, and I went on the Saturday—I think I saw the hat on the Saturday, and on the Monday or Tuesday following I went to the hatter's—I was not there at the time he turned out the lining—I have seen the prisoner on many occasions—I had seen him wear the hat previous to that, previous to the date I have mentioned; I have seen him at Clerkenwell, where he lived—it was through the hat that I knew where he was at Lewes—the prisoner was traced to Hyde-place, from Great Cambridge-street—I apprehended him there on 26th, on Boxing-day, about twenty minutes before 2, his brother, his wife, and a woman with a baby were with him—I saw them come out of No. 27—I said to the prisoner, "<hi rend="italic">Patsy</hi> (that is the name by which I knew him), I want you, you must consider yourself in my custody for a jewel robbery at Lady Talbot's, at Brompton"—he said, "Very well, Mr. Potter, don't expose me here"—he then turned round and saw the four others, who were there in custody of other officers, and said, "Potter, you don't mean to take him into custody? he is innocent"—that was his brother-in-law, who was present—I said, "I shall leave that to the inspector"—he said, "I suppose you mean to search my place," or lodging, or something of that kind—I said, "Yes," and he asked to be present during the search—I took him back into the house and kept him in custody while Mr. Rolls and two other officers made a search—while they were searching a cupboard at the bottom of the stairs, the prisoner said, "I suppose you are looking for tools, but I have done with them years ago," and he said something about jewellery, but I could hardly catch the words—he said, "You knew, Potter, I should not have anything here"—on searching him I found three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I am foreman to Mr. Doyle, a plumber—I superintended the alterations at 7, Lowndes-square—there were two ladders there, reaching to the roof, on the night of 30th November—three days after that, on 3rd December, I was in the back attic and my son drew my attention to a hat in the gutter—I told him to get out, he did so and picked it up and gave it to me—I gave it to the policeman on duty, Meak<lb></lb>ins—I had been into that room several times between 30th November and 3rd December, but had not noticed it—the window is high, and unless I went</p>

               <p>close to the window I could not see it—it had a black hatband on it—if a person had gone up the ladder and had got into the front gutter where the balustrade is, he could not get over the roof so as to fetch a hat, supposing it bad blown off; it is 9 ft. 6in. from the roof to the gutter, and nearly perpendicular—a person could not get along the roof from the front part—the hat was not wet, only just damp—we had a board on the ladders every night, but an expert person could get up even with a board there—I believe this to be the hat.</p>

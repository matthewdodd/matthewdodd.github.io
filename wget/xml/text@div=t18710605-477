H. Etherington,</hi> 25, <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Street, New North Road, and stated:</hi> "I feel it my duty to inform you that I have, with others, witnessed such conduct between your eldest son, that is, Master Clowser, and the servant-girl, as may lead eventually to such a termination as the tragedy now in the public press. Last Sunday week, in the room above your sitting-room, for one hour, might be been your son and the girl, kissing, hugging, &amp;c., and placing themselves in very strange postures, as they supposed unseen behind the blind, but close to the window, &amp;c. As I belong to a certain society, and write for the press, I shall feel it my duty to make this public, &amp;c. In the meantime, if you think well to satisfy me for my trouble, and look into the affair, so as it does not occur again, I think it will answer your purpose, and I shall take no further notice. Otherwise there will be an article on Hampstead Morals, &amp;c. A letter as above will find me.")—I afterwards received this other letter—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated Winchester,</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th May, signed W. H. Etherington, and addressed to Mr. Clowser; it stated:</hi> "I should have answered yours before, but have been travelling, and yours did not reach me till to-day. I cannot meet you at present; however, if you compensate me for my trouble, you nor anyone will ever hear any more of the matter. I have a romantic affair now in hand, in reference to a transaction in Hampstead, that will appear in public print; but if you satisfy me, <hi rend="italic">it's</hi> silence for ever. If you send me a cheque or post-office order for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., all well; but it must be per return, as I leave here on Wednesday.")—On receiving that letter, I put myself in communication with the police, and, on 16th May, sent the registered letter to the post-office, Winchester, containing this post-office order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also received this letter, dated 15th May—(<hi rend="italic">This was signed W. H. Ether<lb></lb>ington, and stated that the pamphlet he was about publishing related to the observance of the sabbath, and the abuses that existed at places like Hamp<lb></lb>stead, and the actions of inhabitants folding positions in church and the town; but that he would re-write it, and omit all that related to Mr. dowser's family, on receipt of an order for</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">to be sent to the post-office, Winchester, before Wednesday evening.</hi>)—I caused the prisoner to be apprehended, and he admitted writing the letter before the Magistrate at Hampstead—I had never seen him before, to my knowledge.</p>

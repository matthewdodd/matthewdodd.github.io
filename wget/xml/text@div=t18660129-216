I live at No. 1, Gilbert-street, Clare-market, about 150 yards from No. 4, Portsmouth-street—about twenty-five minutes to 4 on the morning of 16th January I had occasion to go out for a doctor—I saw the prisoner standing by the side of my door—he then walked towards Portsmouth-street—I followed him—when I came from the doctor's I saw him—shortly after that I had occasion to go to the doctor's again, and I saw him standing a few doors further up, in a doorway—three or four minutes only elapsed before I went to the doctor's a second time—just as I was turning the corner of my street the second time, I heard a cry of "Police;"—I ran back to where the cry appeared to be, and found the window shutters of No. 4, Portsmouth-street down, and the window forced open—I next saw the prisoner in the prison-yard, where he was put amongst other men, and I identified him—I am sure he is the man I saw on three occasions.</p>

About ten minutes to 4 on the morning of 16th January, I was in Bear-yard, Clare-market—that is about 107 yards from No. 4, Portsmouth-street—I heard a shuffling noise in a cab down the yard, and saw the prisoner come out of a cab on the off-side—I asked him what he was doing there—he said, "All right, policeman, I was only making water"—I went to see if he had been doing so, but could find</p>

I live at No. 4, Portsmouth-street, Clare-market, and am a clothier—I sleep in the shop—on 16th January, I went to bed about 12 o'clock—I fastened the place up myself—a little before 4 o'clock I heard a noise in connection with the shutter-bars—at first I thought it was a police-man—I listened, and for a moment all was still—directly afterwards I heard it again, and immediately jumped out of bed, called out "Halloa!" and opened the door—as I did that the two shutters which had been taken down came against me, and I found that the plate glass window had been forced in—the glass was not broken—I missed two coats and a pair of trousers—these are them—they are worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

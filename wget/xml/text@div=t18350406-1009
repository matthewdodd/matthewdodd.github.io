                  </hi>. I am the wife of Isaac Kirk. My son William was playing outside my house on Monday afternoon, the 30th of March, near Mile-end turnpike—the constable afterwards brought me a coat, a cap, and a pinafore, which were part of my child's clothes, and a shovel which be<lb></lb>longed to us.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at Dempsey's-field, Stepney, on the 30th of March, between four and five o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner there walking with William Kirk—I saw him take the child's pinafore off, and lead him by the hand into an unfinished house—I went in three or four minutes, and then the cap, pinafore, and coat were off the child, and he was in the act of pulling off his trowsers—the pinafore, cap, and shovel, were in a bag which the prisoner had—the child's coat was alongside the prisoner—I said, "You rascal, how came you to pull the child's clothes off?"—he said, "I did not"—he then said, "The child told me to pull</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. The prisoner was given into my charge at the station-house by Mason—I took possession of a carpet bag containing a pinafore and cap—the coat the child had on—he had put it on to walk to the station-house—the prisoner had a penny-piece in his pocket—I turned round to the child, who had one penny farthing in his hand, and said, "Who gave you this?"—the prisoner was behind me—the child said, "That boy," pointing to the prisoner—the prisoner said he did not do it, and wavered a good deal in his statement—the bag, he said, was his, that the child had asked him to take the things off, and put them into the bag—the shovel was in the bag—the child is five years old.</p>

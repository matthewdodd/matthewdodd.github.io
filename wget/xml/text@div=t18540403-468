On the afternoon of 22nd Feb., at half past 2 o'clock, the prisoner came to the shop—I asked him what he wanted; he said some brown Melton for a coat—I showed him some, and cut him off two yards of a blue one that I showed him—he offered me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in payment; I asked him to put his name upon it, and he did so—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is what he wrote, "Edward Smith, 29, Earl-street"—I had not change in the house—I went out, but not with the intention of getting it changed; I took the note with me to Mr. Colton's, at the Crown public house, in the Edgware-road—I had my suspicion, and in consequence of what he said, I went to the police station; I gave the note to Dafters, the officer; he returned with me to my master's; the prisoner was still in the shop.</p>

            . I live at Brackless-street, Barbican. I had been along way to the other end of the Town, to Oxford-street, to see a friend; it was on the 12th of June. I came home very late, between twelve and one; I could not get away before; it was a beautiful moon-light morning. I never saw the prisoner until he came up to me, which was at the top of <placeName id="t18160710-25-crimeloc112">Cow-lane, Smithfield</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18160710-25-crimeloc112" type="placeName" value="Cow-lane, Smithfield"></interp>

At the top of Cow-lane, the prisoner came up to me, as I was going along, he came putting his hand on my shoulder, and I told him to go along about his business, and he would not go for some time; and I said, what do you want, what do you mean; if you don't go, I will screem out, and he immediately said hush; he immediately threw me down on the pavement; I don't think he was in liquor; he uatied my clerk at that time; it was tied before that time. I was down; but I could not struggle; I screamed out, and he heard a coach coming, so he ran off. I screamed out, and the coachman jumped off his box a good hit before the coach came up, and the coachman asked me what was the matter. The prisoner took the cloak with him; it was worth very little, it was not worth more than two or three shillings. He was puremed; I left the coachman, and ran after the prisoner, to see if I could find him; the prisoner had got out of sight. I went down as far as Snow-hill, and there saw him. I went down Hoster-lane, and saw him at the bottom of Snow-hill; I am positive he was the same man. I then gave the alarm; I saw him talking to three women, and I went up to him; I did not see my cloak. I charged him with the cloak, and asked him what he had done with it; and he said, he had got no cloak. I have neverseen it since. Then two of the three women went away directly, as fast as they could get away. I am very positive and confident that the prisoner is the man; he went a little way, and I said, if you do not give me my cloak, I will charge the watch with you; and then he walked on a little bit, and then ran away again; but he was secured that night.</p>

               <p>PATRICK CARNEY. I am a watchman, and apprehended the prisoner. The coachman the last witness spoke of, is not here. I took the prisoner at the foot of Holborn-bridge, in Swan-yard; there was a crowd there, and when I went by, I heard of the robbery, and followed the prisoner, and when I was following him, he ran across Snow-hill into Cock lane; he might have heard the charge. I sprang my rattle after him up Cock-lane, and he was not stopped there; but ran up one Mr. Munn's yard, up Cock-lane; I and the City patrole went into the yard, and secured him; he said nothing.</p>

               <p>-HORTON. I am a City patrole. I assisted the last witness in securing the prisoner at the bar. The charge was for robbing the woman. He was on his all fours in Mr. Munn's yards. I secured him. I then brought him to the watchhouse; I went back and saw the woman in the watchhouse, where there were ten or eleven people, and she pointed out the prisoner directly.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lords and Gentlemen, I hope you will take into consideration my doleful situation, to be confined in a prison under irons for what I am not guilty of; I have been at work these twelve weeks past with Mr. Hemmings, who, if called upon, can give me a good character. On leaving my work on Tuesday evening, I proceeded to my lodging at Mr. Fitzeraid's, near John-street; but having a few words with him. I resolved to take lodgings else where, and for that purpose I went out of his house at twelve o'clock at night. Wherefore meeting with this woman, whom, to the best of my knowledge, I never saw before, she accused me of knocking her down, and taking her handkerchief from her some time before. Now, my lords and gentlemen of the jury, I hope you will take these few lines into consideration, as being in a strange Country, destitute of friends to speak for me, and I have no more to add.</p>

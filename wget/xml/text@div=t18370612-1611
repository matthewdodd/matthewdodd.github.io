On the 24th of May I was over the water, and saw the prisoner with a cart and a hogshead of sugar, and a tarpauling over it—I saw the cart stop in Park-street, and three men with it, the prisoner and two others—they got into the cart—I am sure the prisoner was in the cart—they were <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> the hogshead about—one had hold of one end of it and the other the other,✗ working it to and fro—my suspicions were excited by this—I afterward spoke to a policeman, and came up to the cart in Robert-street—the wagon could get round out of that street into the Blackfriars-road—that is not the regular way to the Strand—the regular way is up Holland-street—when the policeman and I made our appearance the three men ran away.</p>

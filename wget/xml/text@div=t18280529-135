I met the female prisoner with my gown on on the 17th of May; she had my boots on her feet; I followed her, and told her the gown was mine - she said it was not; I said it was - that I bought it and made it myself: it was rather too small, and there was a little tear on each shoulder.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 17th of May, at eleven o'clock, the prosecutrix came to me, and said she had met a woman with her gown on her back; I went to her room, and found this gown on her back, and these boots on her feet; the prosecutrix owned the gown, and said she had every reason to believe the boots were hers; the prisoner said they were the boots that came in the bundle, and she bought them of a person named Jones, and was to pay 5s. for it, but never had paid it.</p>

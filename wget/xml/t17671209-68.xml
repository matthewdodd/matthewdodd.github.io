               <p>Q. What is that?</p>
               <p>Allcock. It is what is fixed in the brick-work, that the blast of the bellows goes through into the fire; I lost also 36 pail-hoops at one time, about the 6th of March, they were finished; I had them over night, and they were gone in the morning; I lost a great many more than I put in the indictment; I have laid it for 54 of them; I lost numbers of pail-ears at several times, at least six dozen pair, they I lost about March last; I lost an iron riveting tool, and a trassel gage, I cannot mention the exact times. The prisoner Dollymore is my apprentice; I was first informed of him by an indifferent person, and when I taxed him with it he owned it all; he owned he had taken several ears of pails and pail-hoops, and things from me; that he delivered the tool gage to Linney, and hoops and ears. I searched at Linney's, I found none of them upon him, they are things soon disposed of; I found there a sledge-hammer, my property, but that is not put in the indictment. When Dollymore was examined before Justice Girdler, he owned to all I have said here, as to him; Linney said, I do not think that is a proper person to be an evidence, for he has not told you half, expecting to have been made an evidence; he said he had the goods that the lad had charged upon him, but he had not told half of them that he had taken from me; this I heard; the Justice said, Mr. Linney, you hear what the lad has said, have you any thing to say; Linney said, no, I own I had the goods. The three prisoners, every one, owned to the charge against them; Smout said there, there was a tew iron brought to his house, and he had some pail-ears; Linney said, they had sold the goods, and they were gone, they neither of them said a word in contradiction; they both said they had nothing to say for themselves; Linney said, coming out of the Justice's, if I go for 14 years, you will be dead and d - d before I come back again, and I shall be better than you.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Allcock; I was with the prisoners before the Justice; all the things that my master mentioned that Dollymore had stole from him, Dollymore owned he had taken and carried them to the other prisoners, Linney and Smout; and when the Justice asked them whether they did receive them, they said, yes; then the Justice said, upon your own confession I must commit you. I heard Linney say to the apprentice, you have not told half; the Justice asked them; if they had any thing to say in their defence; they said, no; they had received what the apprentice had mentioned: the apprentice had mentioned things which he had taken and carried to each of them; I saw the truss-hoop gage in Linney's smiths-shop, about May last, he did keep a shop in the Bowling-alley in Turnmill-street, I have worked with it many a time; I told my master of it a day or two after, but he is an easy man, he said he should not trouble himself about it.</p>

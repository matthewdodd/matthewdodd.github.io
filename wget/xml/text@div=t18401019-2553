                  </hi>. I am a news-agent, and live in Chapel-place, Coram-street. On the 18th of September, at seven o'clock in the morning, I was in a field adjoining Hornsey-wood—there was a fight between the pri<lb></lb>soner and Thomas Foy, (I understand was his name)—I was there at the beginning—they were stripped, and fought twenty-two rounds—at the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184010190104"></xptr>
               <p>last round, the deceased got off his second's knee, approached towards the prisoner, and sparred up to him with the intention of striking, but tottered and fell before he struck the blow—no blow had been struck on either side in that round—in the round previous to that he rose as usual, and was not struck at all—he came up with the intention of fighting, and fell down—I did not observe whether he fell against any thing—he was not struck, he seemed to be more pushed against by the prisoner on pur<lb></lb>pose to avoid striking him—they had struck each other in the rounds be<lb></lb>fore that—I saw the deceased struck once by the prisoner, but it was not what I should call a knock-down blow, as he seemed to be falling before—I thought at the time, that blow was struck on the face, but I was not close enough to see—there was not the slightest unfairness in the prisoner's man<lb></lb>ner of fighting—he seemed to wish to avoid fighting altogether—after the deceased fell the last time, he was placed in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and carried home—I did not see him afterwards—I had seen them together on one occasion before at a house, where the deceased quarrelled with the prisoner, but I did not see them quarrelling—I was at the Hunter's Arms, Compton-street, about a week before—there was a quarrel between them there, but I do not know what about—the deceased had other falls in the fight besides what I have mentioned—they seemed to struggle during the fight, and when they fell they fell together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter at different gentlemen's houses. I was in the field near Hornsey-wood, on the 18th of September, and saw the fight from beginning to end, between the prisoner and Thomas Foy—I believe his real name was Thomas Barks—it appeared a fair fight—they exchanged very few blows in the early rounds—I saw them fall on the ground while fighting—the deceased fell undermost several times—they did not appear particularly severe falls—I cannot recollect seeing any knock-down blow—I did not see any marks on the deceased's face—about the seventeenth round, as near as I can recollect, the deceased went back and fell on a bank on the ground without being struck—he fell on the back of his head on a hard piece of clay, or something—they fought about twenty-two rounds—after the fall very little was done—he came up to the four or five rounds, and fell without being struck, I believe—I did not see any blow struck by the prisoner after the deceased fell—at the last round he rose from his second's knee, put himself in the attitude of fight<lb></lb>ing, and fell down without being struck—he was taken home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I saw him on Saturday morning at his lodging in Brighton-street, St. Pan<lb></lb>cras—he was then dead—I went there with the Coroner's Jury—the body I saw there was the body of the man who fought with the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called to see a man at No. 26, Brighton-street, where the Coroner's Jury visited—he was then dead—I was present at the Inquest, and saw the same body—in my judg<lb></lb>ment his death was caused by a broken blood-vessel on the brain at the back of the head—I cannot judge from what it arose—I saw no external marks on the head—it might have been caused by a fall on the back of the head—his eyes were a little discoloured, a blow there would, not be likely to cause the rupture in the back part of the head.</p>

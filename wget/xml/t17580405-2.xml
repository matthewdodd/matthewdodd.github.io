I keep a silver-smith's shop, on the 24th of February, very near five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop, and said he wanted to buy a stock-buckle, I shewed him a second hand one, he bought it, after that he pulled out a pair of silver buckles, which he said he had bought of my man that morning, and he wanted another pair to make a present to his brother, a life-guard-man; I said I had not such another pair, but would make him such; then he took out his handkerchief, and laid it on my counter, with some plate in it, he said his grandmother left it him, his sister, and brother, dividing it, and desired I would weigh it separate, as he had put them in three parcels. I suspected he did not come honestly by it, so I stopped it, and went to justice Fielding for his advice, he shewed me the advertisement he had put in the paper, and sent two men with me, and we went and took the prisoner in Aldersgate-street, where he told me he lodged; we took him before the justice, and there he owned he hid himself in his mistress's house all night, and took the things away in the morning; this is the plate here produced, all but the spoons that he brought and offered to me to sell.</p>

Mr. Lewen being ask'd whether it was light enough for him to distinguish the Person; he reply'd it was, and though he would not swear positively, he did verily believe Anger was one of those that robb'd him. The Prisoner at the Beginning of his Tryal desired that Dyer might be put out of the Court, and not hear what the Prosecutor depos'd, which was done, and being afterwards call'd in, depos'd as the prosecutor had done, varying in no Circumstance, except that whereas the Prosecutor thought it was Dyer that took the Silver out of his Pocket, he depos'd it was Anger that took it, and added, that Anger would have had him took away his Horse, and would have had him shot the Prisoner for not giving them the Silver: And that having done robbing Mr. Lenen, they got over the Hedge and went off. The Prisoner deny'd the Fact, or that he had any Acquaintance with the Prosecutor at that Time; but being noisy, and too outrageous, so far over shot himself, as strenuously to affirm, that he not Dyer, the Evidence, could not be in that Robbery, because they were at that Time both in Custody, having been taken up on Suspicion of another Robbery: To clear up this Matter, the Court ordered the Books of the Jayl of Newgate to be produced, and search'd in Court, and it appear'd, that the Time of their being apprehended together, was near three quarters of a Year distant from the Time of the Commission of this Robbery.</p>

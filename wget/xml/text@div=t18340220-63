            . I am an officer - I took Pearl at his masters' on this charge - he said he had had the duplicates, but he had returned them to Wright, and the reason they were pawned was, they could not get their wages; and he told me where to go and find Wright, and get the duplicates of him, but they were sent to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>MR. MARTIN. There was no money due to Pearl - he was an apprentice, and had 16s. a week - I have known Wright from a child, and know no harm of him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Who paid him while you were away? A. Mr. Davies.</p>
               <p>Pearl. My master knew a fortnight before that they had been taken, and he said if they were not produced the next morning, he would have me taken, as I must know something of them - Mr. Davies did not pay me above once in a month, but Mr. Martin knew nothing of that.</p>

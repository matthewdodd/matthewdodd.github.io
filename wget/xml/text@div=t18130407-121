            . Q. On the morning, of the 4th of April this happened to you, you were returning from the public-house, in the Horse-ferry-road - A. Yes; I worked in that part of the town, for Mr. Copeland. Nothing happened to me until I got into <placeName id="t18130407-121-crimeloc634">Charles-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18130407-121-crimeloc634" type="placeName" value="Charles-street"></interp>

I saw Quick and Williams; I am sure as to the person of Williams; I took particular notice of him. They asked me, if I would take any gin. I said it was rather late; I wanted to go home; I said if it was not late, I would have no objection. They caught me on each side; Williams on the left, and Quick on the right. I looked at Williams; because he was the tallest; he is as tall as I am. When they first laid hold of me, I was at the public-house door; then they dragged me to the Coach and Horses yard. I kept my foot to the stones, as I went along, to prevent their dragging me along.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out at this time - A. No, I did not. When they got me to the Coach and Horses-yard, Quick gave me a dig in the neck, and he tripped me up. I was no sooner on the ground, than he laid his hand on my neck, and his other hand upon my mouth. When I was down Williams bound my feet, and laid one hand upon my belly.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean that he tied you with any cord - A. No, he put one knee on my knee, and the other knee upon the small of my belly; then he took eighteen shillings, and the two foot rule, and tore the pocket away at the same time. They ran away immediately. I jumped up, and pursued them both. Quick was the nearest to me; I laid hold of him; Williams got away. I saw Williams between eleven and twelve o'clock, in the yard of this Sessions-house; he was going to carry Quick a pot of beer, and a pipe of tobacco. I told the patrol he was one of the men. Williams was the man that took my money away. I described Williams to the patrol, and to Orton, to be a man of a sandy fair complexion.</p>

            . I am a patrol. Cogan was attending to prosecute Quick, he came to me in the Old Bailey-yard, and told me, (pointing to Williams,) that was the man that robbed him in Charles-street, in company with Quick. I and Roberts took Williams in custody. I searched him. and found nothing.</p>

            . I was constable at the watchhouse. Quick was brought to the watchhouse. Cogan said he had been robbed by two persons. Cogan said he should know the other man amongst a thousand; he was a tall thin young man, with long hair; he had a large brown surtout coat on. On Saturday, when Cogan was attending to prosecute Quick, he came to me in the Court-yard; he said he had seen the other man that robbed him, he was positive to him. He pointed out Williams to me. In consequence of that, I and Oram laid hold of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Williams - A. On the Saturday that Cogan was robbed, I saw Williams twice on that day, in company with Quick, and on Saturday last, I saw Williams carrying a pot of beer through the Sessions-yard, to a prisoner. I told Roberts, I recollected that to be the man that I had seen twice with Quick; on the day that Cogan was robbed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to see Quick. I asked him what he was in custody for. He said it was a row, between him and some man in Charles-street. He would not tell me the particulars of it. I came here, to hear the trial, along with four men that worked at the same office. I am innocent of the charge.</p>

            . I am a printer. I work in the same office with the prisoner, at Mr. Auld's, Greville-street, Hatton Garden. On Saturday night, the 3d of April, after we had done work, the prisoner took a walk with me up to St. Giles's. It was about ten o'clock, when we went; we were paid late at the office. We went to the Cart and Horse, public-house, Tottenham-court-road; we stopped until twelve o'clock we then went to the Compasses, White-hart-yard; there we had two pints of ale; we stopped until one o'clock, and came away together, to the top of Gray's-inn-lane. We parted there. I saw him go towards the City.</p>

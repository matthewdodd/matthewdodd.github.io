                  </hi>. I carry on business with Richard Saunders, in Lead<lb></lb>enhall-street, as drapers. On the 4th of August, we sent out five pieces of cloth by a person named Brogden—one of them measured fifty yards—it was a merino, three-quarters wide—we had it in the shop from the 30th of July—we then purchased it of Martin—it was given to Brogden about one or two o'clock in the day,—(we had nothing to do with Mr. Manning—he called there on business of his own) he came back, and said there was a piece missing—we sent round to the different pawnbrokers—a person named Barnes came with the prisoner and this piece of cloth—here is four yards and a half of it—the piece of cloth we sent out cor<lb></lb>responds with this—fifty yards were sent out.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is there particular in the make? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The substance, the closeness of the texture, and the fineness of the quality depend on the make—there is something in the make of this which is different from all we have in the warehouse—I am certain it is the same piece of cloth.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 136.) On the afternoon of the 4th of August I took the prisoner into custody, and on going towards the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's he said he had this in his possession three weeks—that he had bought it of a man in the lane, and gave 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I asked where he lived—he said his brother lived in Goulston-street, and he lived in Petticoat-lane, but he did not know the number, nor the name of the party.</p>

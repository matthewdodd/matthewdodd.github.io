Pickford, the carriers—I know the defendent, by seeing him at our place at Leicester—on 26th March, about 7 in the afternoon, he brought some carcases of sheep, and a calf in a cart—it is usual to lend butchers hampers and cloths, and make a small charge for their use—meat intended for the market is wrapped in cloths—he asked me to lend him a hamper, I did' so—it did not look very good, and I said that it was a strange calf to send to London—I am accustomed to see a good deal of meat at our establish<lb></lb>ment, and in my judgment it was not in a fit state for human beings—he said that it was all right, and proceeded to pack it up—I asked him to whom it was to be consigned—he said to Mrs. Matthews, the widow—we keep printed labels of the different meat salesmen in London, and I tied on the hamper one of the labels of the widow Matthews, and asked the prisoner what name I was to put on it—he said, "J. Wildman," and I find "J. Wildman" on this card—a clerk in the office wrote it, as I had got something in my hand—the meat was despatched to London about half-past 2 in the afternoon, by the Midland Railway—the meat salesmen pay for the meat at our office in London, and it is remitted to us—the defendant called a few days afterwards, and asked if there had been any return for the meat—I told him that it had been condemned; he made no observation—the condemnation ticket was handed to him by our agent.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>). On 4th April, I went down to Leices<lb></lb>ter, by direction, and met with the defendant at 24, Milestone-lane—he told me that he had been a butcher nearly all his life—I told him I was a detective officer, and had come from London to make inquiries concerning a calf which he had taken to Messrs. Pickford's office in Kink-street, consigned to Mrs. Matthews, of Newgate-market, which was condemned as unfit for human food, and that most likely a prosecution would follow, and he might be one of the parties prosecuted; if he chose to give me any information concerning the calf he might, but if he did say anything I should most likely use it against him—I took down in writing what he stated—he read it over, and signed it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said that on 26th March, Mr. Wildman, of Dane-hill Cottage, Leicester, called at his house, and said that he had a culf he wanted him to look it; that he went to Mr. Wild<lb></lb>man's and saw the calf; which was killed and dressed; and Wildman told him it was more dead than alive, which was why he killed it, and asked his opinion whether it would do to go to London to be sold, as the sheep was which he had sold to Wace, of Newgate-market: and he said that it was; that the kidneys were taken out, and it was put in Mr. Wildman's cart, and Mr. Wildman and he brought it to Pickford's office in Kink-street; that Mr. Wildman's son helped him to pack it, and he requested Mr. Beach to write "J. Wildman, Leicester," upon it—he said that he saw the pluck, and the whole of the sound, and did not see anything the matter with the calf; it was fit for human food; that Mr. Wildman said that it was eating it's head off, and that was why he killed it—I saw Mr. Wildman there; he is here to-day—he was in Court when the prisoner was examined before the Alder-man—the prisoner did not call him as a witneas.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I told you to ask Mr. Wildman whether the calf had any physic. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You never asked me anything of the kind—you said something about the weather being wet, it was very wet while I was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I have never been before a jury in my life, except as a witness. When Mr. Wildman called at my house it was almost dark, and I thought the meat was good for human food. I asked him whether he had given it any physic, and he said, "No." I examined the heart, liver, and lights, and found them all sound. I said, "The best way will be to send it to London by the horse and cart. His son and I directed it, packed it up and sent it to London, and Mr. Shelly took Mr. Wildman's address. I heard no more about it till the detective came down. The most I can say is that it was an oversight; I should not have sent it if I had been aware that it was unfit for human food. I did not slaughter it; Mr. Wildman's son and another man killed it and dressed it, and the skin went up to the skin-market. All I did wan packing it up and sending it to market. Mr. Wild<lb></lb>man is here and will not deny it.</p>

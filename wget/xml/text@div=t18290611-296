The prisoner came to me, and said she had been turned out of a situation for being out an hour too late; I took her in, and gave her a lodging from Friday till Monday, the 30th of March, when she said she should get a situation; she said on Monday that she was afraid she should not get a situation till the Saturday - I said she might stay, but she left me that day without notice; I missed this property from my bed-room up one pair of stairs - I had seen them about an hour before they were taken; I saw them again on the 16th of April, when the prisoner was before the Magistrate - my sister's things were found on her person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you lend me this property to go to my sister's, to borrow a sovereign to pay your rent? A. No; you said you had no sister in town; you did not lend me 5s. on the Saturday night before; I was not taken to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's sister. The prisoner occupied part of a room; I lost a shift, a scarf, a petticoat, and a pair of shoes, on the 30th of March - they had been safe in my room an hour before; the prisoner gave me no notice of going: I did not see her again till I was before the Magistrate - she had my petticoat on; my shift and scarf were found at her lodging by the officer - my shoes have not been found.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are you? A. An upholdstress; I had known the prisoner at Ipswich; she was a servant - she was not an unfortunate woman, to the best of my knowledge; I met her in the street at Pentonville - she said she had lost her situation, and she came to tea; the next day, she said she was an hour too late, and lost her situation; I did not lend her these things; there was nothing particular happened at Clerkenwell the other day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did not you lend me the body linen and the shoes, to go out walking with you? A. No, I never did.</p>

            . I am a constable of Clerkenwell. I was in this box on the 15th of April last, and the prisoner came into this Court; I took her into custody on the charge of robbing Mary Ann Bird - she had this veil on her bonnet; this cloak I found at No. 20, Speldhurst-street, where she told me she lived - the stockings she had on the prosecutrix claimed, but they were not taken off; this shift was on her - this scarf was at Speldhurst-street; the bonnet I found at Bell-street, Paddington, where she had exchanged it for another.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are you not in the habit of visiting these young woman? A. No; I have seen them repeatedly - I did call there once while you were there, to inquire for a person who was charged with taking a watch; I did not stop five minutes - I saw you there, and from that I knew you; you told me you came here to give yourself up to me.</p>

             go for a quartern of gin, and you drink it with them? A. No; I never drank with them- I did not drink tea there; there were two brokers in the house, West and Evans, who I believe had sold her a bedstead - I do not recollect Mary Ann Bird saying if she were ruled by the officer, she would send you out of the country for life.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH OADBY. I am a constable. I was with the witness Stephens when the prisoner was taken; she was very candid in telling where the things were - we took her the next morning to the place.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not I say they lent me the property as soon as I saw you? A. Yes, but the prosecutrix contradicted it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was my misfortune to be se<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110129"></xptr>duced at an early age, by a gentleman, by whom I became pregnant; the offspring of my indiscretion did not survive its birth, but I was left before that event to earn a subsistence as I could; I did apply to my parents for forgiveness, but without success: at length I obtained some employ in the hat business, but unfortunately continued an acquaintance with the prosecutrix, which I had commenced before, and on the Sunday evening, from which I date my present misfortune, I called on her - she invited me to take a walk with her; she lent me some articles of body linen, as security for which I left some of my own with her: a quarrel afterwards took place between the prosecutrix and a lodger; the prosecutrix was conveyed to the watch-house, to release her from there - I lent her 5s. to give the watchman: on the following day she said she was distressed for a sovereign to pay her rent, and asked my assistance - I said I had a sister in service, but my dress was not suitable for me to call on her, and the prosecutrix lent me her bonnet, cloak, and veil to go to her; on my way I met the gentleman who first drew me aside from the path of rectitude - every other idea was then forgotten, and I spent a week or two with him, previous to his going to Liverpool, to which place I certainly should have accompanied him, but for these very articles; having disappointed the prosecutrix, I was ashamed to carry the things home myself - I met her lodger, and asked her to take them, but she refused; I then came to this Court, to see the officer, who I was aware knew her, to offer him the articles, to deliver to the prosecutrix, when I was taken into custody for an offence of which I solemnly protest my innocence. Since I have been in prison I have heard the heart-reading intelligence of the death of my mother; let all these circumstances be considered, and let my youth and the miseries I have experienced in my short career, plead in my behalf, and I trust you will not consign me to further disgrace on the accusation of one more experienced in crime than myself.</p>

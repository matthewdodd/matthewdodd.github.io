                  </hi>. On Tuesday last, I was at a beer-shop in the parish of Hillingdon, kept by Turner—I had been there ever since breakfast-time—I had just taken my money from the rail-road, and went there to breakfast—there were several persons there—the prisoner was one of them—I had seen him before—I am sure he was one of the men at the beer-shop—I went into the yard round the back part, and laid down on a truss of straw to go to sleep, having been up all night—before I went to sleep, the prisoner came and laid down by the side of me, and began to feel my pockets about—it was about one o'clock in the day—I am positive he is the man who was near me—nobody else was within sight at that time—he asked me to get up and come in-doors—I told him I could as soon I had had a little sleep—he had not been working with me, but I knew him, having worked with him the year before—I did not go into the house with him—he went in-doors, and a few minutes afterwards he returned and laid himself upon me—he caught hold of me and pulled me over on my other side; he pulled my hand out of my left-hand pocket, and put his own hand in, and put his elbow on my neck, and squeezed it, and very nearly choked me—he pulled two half-crowns, sixpence, and seven halfpence out of my pocket—as soon as he got from me, I got up and said, "Very well, Thomas George!" he said "What now? "—I said, "You know what, you have been and taken 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.9 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., out of my pocket"—he then began to call a crowd round me, and they threatened to beat me and <hi rend="italic">punch</hi> my head—he asked one of the crowed if he saw him take any money from me—that man had not been present—nobody was in sight at the time—the man said, "No"—as soon as the crowd came round me, I made my escape to get a warrant—I com<lb></lb>plained to the constable, and the prisoner was taken up next day, about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you lay it to John Sailor, before you laid it to me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not lay it to any other person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not John Warren come and put his foot on you, and awake you? and did you not lay it to Sailor and then to Warren? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not true—I laid it to you, because nobody else was there—you did not turn out all your pockets, and show what money you had—I never saw one Anderson—I have not got my money again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> He accused me of it—I never touched him at all—I did not take his money at all. I had a watch in my pocket, and money also—I had just laid out some of it. I work hard all the summer; look at my hands, I am not like a man who would pick pockets. I am as in<lb></lb>nocent as any living man. When he was lying down, two brewer came and rolled about several tubs of beer, and moved him; and he lays that to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Henry Osborn, and keep the Post Office, at New Charlton—on 19th February, about 7 or 8 o'clock in the evening, a person came in and asked for ten one shilling postage stamps—I served him—I put the stamps on the counter—he put something on the counter, snatched up the stamps, and ran away—it was an imitation half-sovereign—I left it on the counter and ran after the man—a man named Pritchard was passing the door at the time and he ran after the man—it was a foggy night, and he escaped round the corner—the prisoner is the man—I saw him again on the 25th August in my shop—he came in with a man who I found out afterwards was a constable—I noticed that the man who took the stamps was very high shouldered and had a short neck—the constable did not ask me any questions—he said "Good morning, Mrs. Osborn"—I turned round and said "I know you, young man"—the prisoner said "What for!"—I said "You are the man who stole my stamps in the winter."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer and live at 151, Powis Street, Woolwich—in February last I was passing the Charlton Post Office—I saw the prisoner run out of the shop—he nearly ran into my arms—I asked him where he was running to—he passed on ahead—I took a full view of him and ran after him, but he escaped—Mrs. Osborn came out and complained of the loss of the stamps—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I saw him again when I went up to Woolwich Police Court—he was with another young man in the yard, and I picked him out—it was dusk when he ran out of the shop—I can't tell the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter carrier, and live at Coburg Place, New Charlton—one evening in February I heard from Mrs. Osborn of the stealing of some postage stamps—J don't know the date—I saw the prisoner in the morning of that day as I was coming home from my duty—he was about 50 yards or so from the Post Office, leaning over a gate, and afterwards, about two o'clock, saw him pass my shop, which adjoins Mrs. Osborn's—he was walking then—I did not see him after that, but on the evening of that day I heard of the loss of the postage stamps.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). On 19th February Mrs. Osborn made a complaint to me about the loss of the stamps, and gave me a description of the person who had stolen them, in consequence of which on 25th August I got into conversation with the prisoner when I met him in Woolwich—I had not met him before that—I took him ultimately to Mrs. Osborn's shop, conversing with him as I went along—I was in plain clothes, and I don't think Mrs. Osborn knew who I was at the time—she said "That is the young man who stole' my stamps"—he was afterwards placed in the station yard with another man similar to himself with a hunchback—the witness Prit<lb></lb>chard was called in and picked him out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, in the employ of the West India Dock Company. I have seen the prisoner employed there—I saw him coming from the place where the tea was, and I saw him take off his hat, and press something down into the crown of it, which rustled like tea—I followed him down into the yard, and gave information to a principal of my depart<lb></lb>ment—I saw no more of him till he was stopped.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Thames police-constable, stationed at the West India Docks. In consequence of information from Mr. Trimmings, the principal of the warehouse, I stopped the prisoner going out of the gate—I asked what he got in his hat—he said, nothing but his pocket-handkerchief—I pulled off his hat, and in his handkerchief was 1 1/2lb. of tea, all of one kind—I have compared it with the tea at the warehouse—it corresponds exactly in quality and flavour—I found 6 oz. more in his coat pocket, and 5 sheets of paper in his browsers pocket—in another pocket was some tea-paper—he told me he took this tea form a chest that was turned out to dry—I saw the chest where the tea was—they were in the act or re<lb></lb>pairing it—he said he hoped I would allow him to take it back, and he would give me a sovereign—I said I could not—he then said, "Allow me to take this dry part of it back"—I said I could not.</p>

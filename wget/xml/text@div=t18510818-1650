The prisoner was in my employ, and had authority to receive money for milk, which she ought to account for to me the next day—she has not accounted to me for any money received from Mr. Dixon on 22nd June, or the two following Sundays—on 18th June I asked her if Dixons had paid her for three weeks—she said they owed it—I asked her if she was certain they owed it, and she said they had not paid for three weeks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker's boy, and carry bread about for Mr. Savory, of the New Cut, Lambeth. On Saturday, 7th of Nov, I met the prisoner and another boy—they offered to help me to. carry the bread—I had received my wages just before that, a sixpence and seventeen groats—they asked whether my master paid me, or paid my mother—I said he paid me—we got on to Bridge-walk, Lambeth, and the prisoner said, "I will lay you sixpence I will put you down in wrestling"—I said, "No, I shall lose my money"—he then threw me down and got on me—when I got up, my money was gone and my trowsers unbuttoned—I told him he had it—he ran away, and I did not see him any more till he was taken on Sunday morning—I am sure he is the person—I felt his hand about me, but I did not feel it in my pocket—no one else could have taken the money.</p>

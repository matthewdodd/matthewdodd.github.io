I received information from Mr. Reeve, a pawnbroker. The officer came and took the prisoner, before I knew any thing of the matter. His apron was taken off, and a skin was found under his waistcoat, bound round his body; our manufactory is in the adjoining house.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for by a young man, belonging to Mr. Reeves, of Snow-hill; he said a man was waiting to pledge a skin; in consequence of this, I went to the prosecutor. I shewed the skin to Mr. Bird. I took the prisoner into the back premises, and unbuttoned his clothes. I found another skin round his body; while taking it from him, he put something in his mouth, and swallowed it; I supposed it to be a duplicate. I found a part of another duplicate, which had droped in the shop.</p>

               <p>MR. BIRD re-examined. His wages were 34 s. a-week, and he could get 5 s. or 6 s. more at over work - I believe he has a wife and three children.</p>

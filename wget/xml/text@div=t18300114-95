               <p>MRS. PARKER. These are my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Your lodgers have not come forward? A. No; the prisoner did not say I gave her a book which one of the lodgers claimed -I never heard of that; Mr. Anderson was my lodger - he has left me, and I do not know where he lives; there was no quarrel with the prisoner about a pair of boots - Mr. Anderson said he had lost books and a pair of gloves; the prisoner did not say I gave her a book - there was one left on the side-board, and I said, "Take this up to Mr. Anderson, and this key;" she did not say I gave her the book - she was taken in consequence of the box being brought from her lodging: I made the charge against her on the Saturday - these boots were found in her box, which had not been kept at my house; she did not suit me, and I did not wish her box to be brought.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My mistress had a false key which opened the gentleman's desk - she took three books out, and a history to read; she gave me a large book to carry into her room - the gentleman was three and I gave it into his hand; in a day or two he missed another book out of his desk - I went and got half a dozen books, and asked him if either of them was it; he said No - In a day or two he missed another: as gentleman then came to dinner with him, who wanted to borrow a book of him - he could not find it. and asked my mistress if she ever took any books from his desk; she said No - he called me up, and asked me if she did not give me that book to give him; I said Yes - my mistress said was not I ashamed to tell such a story; I said no it was no story. for she had done so - he then told me to go down stairs; these boots my mistress made me a present of for a Christmas-box.</p>

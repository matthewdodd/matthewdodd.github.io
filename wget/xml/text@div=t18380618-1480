                  </hi>. I follow the bonnet blocking business. About a quarter past ten o'clock on the 15th of May, I was in Goswell-street, looking into a shop—I felt a tug at my pocket—I turned round, and saw the prisoner—I then went to the other end of the window, and looked in again—he followed me and took my handkerchief out of my pocket—I turned round the moment I missed it, and found it in the prisoner's coat pocket—he was walking very quietly up a court—I told him he had my handker<lb></lb>chief—he said no, he had not, that he had no occasion to take mine, he had one of his own—I was taking it from him, and the policeman came out of a shop, and took him.</p>

            . I deal in harness, and live in Charles-street, Manchester-square. On the 9th of June, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going along Castle-street, Oxford-street, the prisoner, Bays, was trimming lamps, he asked me if I bought harness and hammer-cloths.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any thing particular to induce him to speak to you - A. I had a harness in my hand. I told him I did. He said he had seen me about several times, but was afraid to speak to me; I said he need not be afraid of me, I bought any thing; he then said he had a hammer-cloth and harness to sell, but they were on the cross, which means stolen - I said I would buy them. He put his ladder down, took me over to 14, Adam and Eve-court, which was opposite, he knocked at the door. the prisoner Stokes asked who was there? he said, "it is me," and went into the room, Stokes was there lying on the bed, he pulled the hammer-cloth cut from between the bed and the sacking; he was going to pull the bag which contained the harness, from under the bed, when Stokes said, "don't you touch it, your hands are oily." She pulled two cushions out; I asked for the harness, she said it was in the next room. I said let me see it, if you have got 20l. worth, I will buy them. She unlocked the next room, and Bays pulled out a sack from under a halfteaster bed, which was turned up, in which was the gigharness. I asked him if he had any thing else; he asked me if I bought shiners - I asked what he meant? he said glasses. I said I had a better sale for them than any thing else; he said he wished he had spoken to me before, as he had sold the glasses belonging to the hammer-cloth and cushions, for 16s., and that he had sold between forty and fifty pair within six months. He said the hammer-cloth and cushions belonged to him, but the harness was another man's, but he would sell them both - He asked 5l. for them. We went to where his ladder was, in Castle-street, and agreed that I should have them for 4l. 15s.; he asked me when I would fetch them away, and said that he should be at home to tea in an hour and a half. I said I would call for them then. He said he did not live there, but in Rebecca-court, Well-street. I went to Lord Denbigh's, gave information, and then went to Rebeccacourt, where I found him at tea in the parlour, with a woman; we then went together to Adam and Eve-court for the things, I found them put together in the same room-Stokes was there. While I was putting them into my bag Foy came and took them. The harness was there under the bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. You said you would buy it of them - A. Yes; I had heard Lord Denhigh's coachman had lost a hammer-cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. You seem well acquainted with technical phrases, how came you to know cross meant stolen - A. I had heard so.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>JOHN WYATT. I am a constable. I went with Foy, having received information from Spendlove, and confirm his testimony.</p>
               <p>JOHN GRIFFITHS. I am the landlord of No. 14, Adam and Eve-court; I let the apartments to Stewart's wife; Stokes rented the back room of them.</p>
               <p>BAYS'S Defence. I found the sack and harness in the road.</p>
               <p>STOKES'S Defence. I went out and gave Stewart's wife my key to feed my birds; I returned at one o'clock, went to bed, and found the cushions under the bed; Bays afterwards came into my room with Spendlove; he said he should come up again and remove the things.</p>

I remember 17th April—I saw Wilder that day—he is ostler to Mr. Dally, who keeps the Magpie inn at Harmondsworth—I know my masters's saddle room—corn and oats are kept there—on 17th April, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I went in to tea, and as came back I saw Wilder in the yard—I went towards the gate and saw he had a bundle under his arm—he was coming towards the tap room in a direction from the saddle room—-when he saw me he tried to shift the bundle, which had oats in it—it was in a red handkerchief—he tried to put it under his coat—he went towards the stable—I followed him, and he went into the saddle room and dropt the handker chief into the bin just inside the door—he came out of the saddle room without the handkerchief, and he went into the taproom—I went outside the gate, and while he was in the taproom I went into the saddle room, and saw the red handkerchief that he had had under his arm, and I could feel there were oats in it—it was in the bin where he dropped it—I did not look in it—I afterwards spoke to my master, and he went into the saddle room—he then sent Master George, his son, for the policeman.</p>

Groves was in my service—he came to me on 17th April, and told me something, in con-sequence of which I went to the saddle room—I saw some oats tied up in my ostler's handkerchief, a red handkerchief—it was in the bin—I put my hand in, and found they were oats—the bin is near the door—the corn room is right through the saddle room—you have to go through the saddle room to get to the oats, but these were in the saddle room, in a bin where they keep brushes and other things—I left the handkerchief there, and sent to the policeman, and he apprehended the prisoners with the oats on them—I then went to the bin again, and the handkerchief was not there—I cannot say that I remember any of the prisoners being in my tap room that afternoon—I was busy, and had a good many letters to write—I have examined these oats produced—I believe them to be mine—I left nine sacks of oats at home when I went away with three horses to Cheltenham, and when I came home the oats were nearly all gone—there was about a bushel left in the bin, and in the handkerchief I should think there was about a pottle—I examined the oats in the bin after the handkerchief was found—I have compared them with what were in the handkerchief, and I believe them to be mine—they were the same sort in every respect—I know the handkerchief that was produced by the policeman—it is the same I have seen my ostler have in his possession.</p>

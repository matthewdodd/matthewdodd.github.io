                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Mr. Thomas Green, an oil and colourman, in Leather-lane. I misted nine brushes on the 16th of October, between seven and eight-clock in the morning—I saw them at Hatten-garden, a week or ten days afterwards, in possession of Johnson—I had put them just within the door hanging up—they are marked with the price by myself—I know them by my mark—I had only sold three—they were together a one bundle—I had seen them safe the day before.</p>

On Wednesday night, the 15th of October, I was on duty in Gray's lnn-lane, and met the prisoner one hundred and fifty or two hundred yards from the prosecutor's shop—he had three brushes offering for sale at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, to persons passing in the street—I asked hew he came by them—he would give me no satisfactory answer—I took him and found six more brushes stuffed down his trowers—two down one thigh and two down another, and one in each trowsers pocket—he then said he had given 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pair for them, and wished to get his own money back again—I heard him offer them at the corner shop in Grays Inn-lane—I heard him say, "Do you want to buy any brushes?"—the man said, "No"—the prisoner was going to walk away, and I took him—he said he had bought them for the lane at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pair, and wished to turn his own money by soiling them for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—he was in liquor.</p>

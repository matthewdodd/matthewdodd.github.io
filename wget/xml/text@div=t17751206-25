               <p>Mr. RECORDER said he could.</p>
               <p>COURT. In pleas in abatement there are two issues, and they are always tried upon separate charges to the Jury. Besides, charging them with both issues at once would lead ot this absurdity, that being charged with both they would be obliged to find upon both; and yet, if the first finding was for the prisoner, they could not go to the second, that finding being a bar. They are distinct issues, and must be separate charges. The counsel for the prosecution was therefore ordered to put in a replication.</p>
               <p>The trial was then adjourned over to the Monday following, when Mr. LUCAS, counsel for the prisoner, moved to withdraw his plea, which was done accordingly; and the trial came on upon the second issue of not guilty.</p>

             sworn.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. ELLIOT.</p>
               <p>You were surgeon on board the Vansittart upon her voyage? - I was: we left England at the latter end of May 1773. The prisoner and the deceased were both passengers in the Vansittart.</p>
               <p>Whether in the course of the voyage from England to the Cape of Good Hope, there was any difference between the passengers and the prisoner? - There was a dispute between <rs id="t17751206-25-viclabel109" type="occupation">Captain</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17751206-25-victim553 t17751206-25-viclabel109"></join> Fergusson and Captain Roche while we were at Madeira.</p>
               <p>Was that the first dispute, or was there any former difference, in the course of that voyage, between the prisoner and the rest of the passengers? - I know of no particulars: I always understood the dispute to be between Captain Fergusson and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Where did the prisoner mess during the voyage? - Part of the time at the captain's table; but afterwards, by the general concurrence of the captain and the gentlemen passengers, the prisoner was dismissed from the captain's table: that was about a month after.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any thing particular passing between the prisoner and the deceased before they arrived at the Cape? - They did not speak to one another from the time of leaving Madeira.</p>
               <p>Did they avoid each other? - Captain Fergusson always avoided Captain Roche: I have seen Captain Roche make wry faces at Captain Fergusson as they were walking the quarter deck.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any particular expressions between Captain Roche and Captain Fergusson? - Captain Fergusson has told me often, he would not have any connection with captain Roche: the quarrel at the Madeira's was between the prisoner and Captain Fergusson.</p>
               <p>When did you land at the Cape? - We landed on the 4th of September 1773, and we left the Cape on the 3d of June.</p>
               <p>Can you relate to the Court any thing that you remember, with respect to the charge against the prisoner, upon the 4th of September? - Upon the 4th of September, the same day we landed, we were sitting in the common hall<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060050"></xptr> at Mr. Charron's, with the other passengers, when there was a message brought in.</p>
               <p>Mr. LUCAS of Counsel for the Prisoner. I submit to the Court, that no message ought to be given an account of that was delivered in the absence of Captain Roche?</p>
               <p>Was Captain Roche present? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the message will not affect him.</p>
               <p>There were sitting in the room Mr. Grant, Mr. Grant's mother and sister, Captain Fergusson, Captain Fergusson's brother, Mr. Dun, Mr. Brodie, Mr. Charron, and myself; it was rather later than six, when a message came in, that one Captain Matthews wanted to speak with Captain Fergusson.</p>
               <p>Who delivered the message? - I believe Mr. Charron: the message was repeated twice, upon which Captain Fergusson went out of the room: I had not the smallest idea of what afterwards happened, and therefore paid little attention to it; in a very few minutes after that, Mr. Charron brought intelligence that somebody was fighting; upon which we all went out: when I had got a few yards from the door I met Captain Roche turning the corner of the street, sheathing his sword.</p>
               <p>How far was that from the house you came out of? - Not above three or four yards, I believe: I walked past him, and turned the corner of the wall, and went up to Captain Fergusson, whom I found supported by Mr. Grant; he was then about fourteen or fifteen yards from Mr. Charron's house. I found him entirely speechless, lying upon the ground, Grant had hold of him; his pulse was sunk; and he had, in short, every symptom of a dying man: I helped to carry him to Mr. Charron's house, where he died in a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the body? - The next day: I don't think I shall be able to remember all the wounds; but the wound that was the cause of his death penetrated above the left pap, passing over the third rib in an oblique direction.</p>
               <p>Explain what you wean by an oblique direction? - Passing from the left to the right, rather inclining downwards; the sword had stuck against the third rib, which had made it slant a little, and passed through the intercostal muscles and the pleura.</p>
               <p>What is the pleura? - A thin membrane like a web, that lines the cavity of the breast; it penetrated the perecardium, and then wounded the aorta (which is a large artery that comes immediately from the heart) about half an inch from the left ventricle; which was the immediate cause of his death: there were several other wounds, all upon the left side, excepting one wound that extended from his forehead towards the crown of his head, which seemed as if struck with the sword.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any wounds except upon the left side? - None except that upon the forehead.</p>
               <p>Now describe the place in which you found Captain Fergusson lying? - It was about fifteen yards from Charron's house, behind a dead wall, round the corner.</p>
               <p>Which way must Captain Fergusson have turned? - Coming from Charron's house he must have turned to the left.</p>
               <p>Did you see Captain Roche after the commission of this fact? - No; not after I met him turning the corner, sheathing his sword.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay at the Cape? - Till the 17th of the same month.</p>
               <p>Did you make any enquiry respecting Captain Roche? - I went with several of the gentlemen to the governor's house on the evening of Captain Fergusson's burial, which happened upon the 5th: we went to desire the governor would cause all diligent search to be made after Captain Roche.</p>
               <p>But you never saw Captain Roche after that day to the 17th? - No.</p>
               <p>Were any application made, to your knowledge, to the fiscal for the apprehension of Captain Roche? - Yes; and there was a reward offered for apprehending him, but I was not present at any applications made to the fiscal.</p>
               <p>What position must the body have been in to have received those wounds you have described? - I cannot possibly say; the wounds were upon the left side.</p>
               <p>But could wounds have been given in the parts you have mentioned, and the sword have had that direction which you have described, if Captain Fergusson had been in a state either of offence or defence? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Captain Fergusson left-handed? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060051"></xptr>Cross Examination by Mr. LUCAS.</p>
               <p>Whether Captain Roche had applied to Captain Fergusson to make up the difference between them? - If any applications were made, they were made to the military: I was only surgeon of the ship; I never heard any thing but a report.</p>
               <p>But did Captain Roche make any application to you to accommodate the difference? - Captain Roche spoke to me after we left the Madeira's, and I spoke to Captain Fergusson; and Captain Fergusson said he did not know of any dispute subsisting between him and Captain Roche.</p>
               <p>What was Captain Roche's application? - I don't remember the particulars; only he wanted to know what was the reason that Captain Fergusson did not speak to him: I know of no other cause. Captain Fergusson told me he had settled every dispute with Captain Roche at Madeira; that he would have no further connection with him, and there was no fort of quarrel subsisting between them.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Captain Fergusson's sword drawn? - His sword was lying by his side; and it appeared to be twisted at the side, and a bit of it broke off about an inch or two.</p>
               <p>Had Captain Roche any wound? - I cannot say; I only saw him as he passed.</p>
               <p>Were there any appearances of blood upon Captain Fergusson's sword? - I don't think there were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant DAVY. What was the disstance of time between Captain Fergusson's being called out by the message, as from Captain Matthews, and when you saw him lying under the wall? - I fancy not more than five minutes; it was exceedingly short indeed.</p>
               <p>Had Captain Fergusson any cane? - I did not see any.</p>
               <p>Was Captain Fergusson dim-sighted as well as short-sighted? - He was dim-sighted: he had a particular defect in one of his eyes, and the other eye was short-sighted; there was a defect that lessened the sight.</p>
               <p>Which was the eye that had the defect? - I cannot remember.</p>
               <p>Did Captain Roche know that Captain Fergusson was dim-sighted? - I never heard that from Captain Roche.</p>
               <p>But must not every man have seen it on board the ship? - It was perfectly visible to every body.</p>
               <p>Was it dark or light when he went out? - Candles were lighted: I fancy it is dark there between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>At what distance was Captain Roche from you when you first perceived him? - He was not two yards from me, I believe.</p>
               <p>At what distance did you see Captain Fergusson? - About the same distance: Mr. Grant had just lifted Captain Fergusson up by the shoulders when I came up.</p>
               <p>Was it quite dark, or was it twilight? - It was past twilight.</p>
               <p>I believe you know, that at the line, or near it, it grows dark sooner than it does here? - It does.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough for a man, who had no defect in his eyes, to see a sword's length? - I don't think it was; because it was exceeding dark indeed.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you first saw Captain Roche, did he appear in a hurry, as if making his escape? - He was walking fast, and was putting his sword in the scabbard.</p>
               <p>Do you know what hour Captain Roche came on shore? - Only from hearsay; when I came on shore, which was at two o'clock, I left him on board.</p>
               <p>Mr. LUCAS. How long was it after you left the house before you saw Captain Roche? - He passed by the door almost directly.</p>
               <p>Consider you came out of a room lighted with candles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you never made the observation, that when a man comes out of a lighted room into the street, it appears much darker to him than it does to one that has been some time in the open air? - I am sensible of that; but it was some time before I entered the house again, and that convinced me of the darkness.</p>
               <p>How long was you out of the house in all? - I suppose not more than five minutes.</p>
               <p>- MOODY sworn. Examined by Mr. MACDONALD.</p>
               <p>You were the surgeon's mate, I believe, in this voyage in the Vansittart? - I was.</p>
               <p>Captain Fergusson and Captain Roche were two of the several passengers, I believe, on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060052"></xptr> board the Vansittart, of which Captain Young was the commander? - Yes: we sailed from England in May 1773, and arrived at the Cape in the September following; we touched at the Madeira's in our way.</p>
               <p>How long were you between the Madeira's and the Cape? - I cannot be positive as to the time.</p>
               <p>Now after your departure from the island of Madeira, in your passage to the Cape, did you hear Captain Roche speak about any disputes or quarrels that had happened between him and Captain Fergusson? - Yes; I heard him mention the disputes, at different times, between him and the passengers of the Vansittart: I have heard him say there were disputes between him and Captain Fergusson; but he did not mention the nature of them.</p>
               <p>That there were, or that there had been? - That there were still subsisting between him and Captain Fergusson.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing of what he would do or intended to do upon it? - He said nothing in particular till the night we arrived at the Cape of Good Hope: I had heard him say several times before our arrival at the Cape, that he should with to shorten the race of the Fergussons.</p>
               <p>How many times have you heard him make use of that expression? - I cann ot be positive to the different times.</p>
               <p>How lately before your arrival at the Cape was it that you heard him say he wished to shorten the race of the Fergussons? - I cannot be positive how long it was before we arrived at the Cape; but I have heard him, at different times, make use of that expression.</p>
               <p>I would with to know of you, whether upon the quarter deck you observed any thing particular in Captain Roche's behaviour? - I never observed any thing in particular; I have heard other people speak of it.</p>
               <p>As you have heard him say several times that he wished to shorten the race of the Fergussons, did he give any reason why he wished that? - He said he believed Captain Fergusson to be the cause of the disputes between the passengers and him.</p>
               <p>Then there were disputes between the other passengers and him? - There were.</p>
               <p>And was that the reason he gave why he wished to shorten the race of the Fergussons? - Yes, that was the reason he assigned to me.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him before they landed at the Cape say any thing more? - I never heard any thing particular till the night we arrived at the Cape: Captain Roche sent a message to me after I was gone to bed, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, that he desired to speak with me directly, as Mrs. Roche, his wife, was indisposed in his cabin; I dressed myself and went up to Captain Roche's cabin; he desired me to walk in and drink a glass or two of wine with him, and said he had something particular to communicate to me: I told him I came to enquire for Mrs. Roche, as I understood she was indisposed; he said he had something particular to say that would not detain me, so I went in: he began recounting a great many of the particulars of the quarrels that were between him and the passengers on board, and particularly Captain Fergusson, whom he said he believed to be the principal instigator of the disturbances that subsisted between them. He afterwards asked me if I had heard whether Captain Fergusson would accept of a challenge in case he should send him one? I told him I was entirely ignorant as to the dispute that was subsisting between him and the passengers; that I had heard nothing whether he would or would not. He told me then that the next day he should go on shore, having agreed for a lodging for himself and his wife, and he was determined to call upon Captain Fergusson and chastise him, as he expressed it. He asked me at the same time, as he did before, whether or not I had heard that he would accept of a challenge? I told him I was entirely ignorant. He said he did not believe that Captain Fergusson was a coward: that he would accept of a challenge if it was given him; but he said, if he did not by G - d he would run him through the body. This was, I think, on the third of September.</p>
               <p>This was the night before your landing? - It was the night we arrived at the Cape: they went on shore the next morning.</p>
               <p>Was this before any body was gone on shore? Yes, I believe it was. Captain Fergusson was killed the next night. After Captain Roche had told me this he went out of the cabin<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060053"></xptr> about twenty minutes, and Mrs. Roche seemed to be much affected with what he had said.</p>
               <p>Counsel. I know what you are coming to; it is not proper to mention what Mrs. Roche said. - Captain Roche told me at the same time that he was going to borrow a sword from Mr. Edgeworth, one of the passengers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Edgeworth is a military gentleman, is he not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he say that sword was for? - He said he got that sword with an intention to chastise Captain Fergusson. I saw Mr. Edgeworth give him a sword next morning.</p>
               <p>Did any conversation pass at that time between Captain Roche and any one? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>I believe you was on board the ship when Captain Fergusson was killed? - I was.</p>
               <p>What time did Captain Roche go on shore? - Between three and four in the afternoon, I believe.</p>
               <p>What time did Captain Fergusson go on shore? - I think about ten o'clock in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>When did you go on shore? - I did not go on shore till three, four, or five days afterwards.</p>
               <p>You never saw Captain Roche afterwards? - Never, till I saw him in England.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination by Mr. HOWARTH.</p>
               <p>You, I understand, was surgeon on board this ship? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who recommended you to that employ; you know Mr. Cairncross? - I was taken out by Mr. Cairncross.</p>
               <p>Cairncross was the friend and countryman of Captain Fergusson I understand? - I don't know whether he was.</p>
               <p>Were they strangers to one another, or pretty intimate? - I was never with them: I messed differently; I was in a different company on board the ship.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see them speak to one another? - It was very seldom that I had an opportunity of seeing them.</p>
               <p>Do you believe they were acquainted or not? - Mr. Cairncross must be acquainted with every one on board the ship.</p>
               <p>Were Cairncross and Fergusson both countrymen? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>Are you a countryman to Cairncross and Fergusson? - Yes, I am a Scotchman.</p>
               <p>And their countryman? - I never heard any thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Now, were Captain Roche and you pretty intimate? - There never was any particular intimacy.</p>
               <p>Then you were pitched upon, not being the intimate friend of Captain Roche, to be sent for at this late hour of the night into his cabin, and there passed this long story you have told us: did you mention it to Cairncross your countryman? - I did not at that time.</p>
               <p>But did you not mention it to him the next morning? - I did not; Cairncross went on shore early next morning.</p>
               <p>Did you mention it to Captain Fergusson? - No; I never spoke three words to Captain Fergusson:</p>
               <p>Did you mention it to any body? - Not at that time.</p>
               <p>How long after did you mention it? - I mentioned it to several people on board the ship after we failed from the Cape.</p>
               <p>Did you before Captain Fergusson's death mention it to any body? - They were all gone ashore next morning.</p>
               <p>What time did they go on shore? - In the forenoon, between ten and eleven, I believe.</p>
               <p>Had you no opportunity to tell it to Captain Fergusson before he went on shore, or to mention this to Captain Young or any body? - I might have had an opportunity, but I did not think it necessary; there were so many disputes subsisting between him and the passengers that I did not chuse to do that, as I thought it might be productive of bad consequences.</p>
               <p>You heard a gentleman talk of going next day to chastise Captain Fergusson, saw him borrow a sword for the purpose, and heard him say he would chastise him when he went on shore, and yet you never mentioned this? - More of the men saw him borrow the sword.</p>
               <p>Why did you not mention it to Cairncross or Captain Young, or some of the officers? - I had no opportunity; and I could not think it would be productive of any good if I had done it.</p>
               <p>Why did not you go even that night and desire Captain Roche might be put under an arrest?</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060054"></xptr>
               <p>- I did not chuse to meddle with any of the disputes between them.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard Captain Fergusson say any thing about Captain Roche? - I never heard him say a word about him.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear him talk of any memorial he intended to present against him? -</p>
               <p>No.</p>
               <p>Did you see Captain Fergusson go on shore? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Serjeant DAVY. I believe Mr. Cairncross was a total stranger to Captain Fergusson till he went on board the ship? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner Roche is a land officer in the East-India Company's service? - Yes, I heard he bore a captain's commission.</p>
               <p>What was Fergusson? - I heard he had the same commission of a captain.</p>
               <p>Who was the commanding officer of the land forces on board the ship? - Colonel Kay.</p>
               <p>I suppose there were soldiers on board? - Yes, there were.</p>
               <p>Then the senior officer I suppose had the command of the officers and soldiers that were on board? - I don't know how that was.</p>
               <p>I suppose you had heard orders given on board to the men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>From the senior officer to the junior officer, and the junior officer to the men, I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Colonel Kay was on board at this time? - He was.</p>
               <p>How came you not to acquaint Colonel Kay, or any other commanding officer, of these threats? - I never thought of acquainting Colonel Kay of it.</p>
               <p>Then you thought no harm would happen? - As it was well known so many disputes had subsisted during the voyage, I thought it unnecessary; if he had done it before there was any disputes, I should have thought it my duty.</p>
               <p>What did you understand when he said he would chastise him? - I understood, if he did not fight him he would run him through the body, as he told me.</p>
               <p>Did not you think the danger the man was in worth communicating to the commanding officer? - Yes; but as there had been disputes, I thought they were sufficiently prepared against any danger of that kind.</p>
               <p>How came you not to inform Captain Fergusson of it, that he might be prepared? or it might have been better to have informed the commanding officer that he might prevent it? - It was a neglect to be sure; but I did not think it at all necessary for me to do it; I thought it was the necessary consequence of malice he bore to Captain Fergusson.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Was any deposition taken from you at the Cape? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. Why, after the death of Captain Fergusson, did you not immediately go on shore and make a full discovery after what you knew had happened to Captain Fergusson? - I was obliged to be on board the ship, the surgeon was then gone ashore.</p>
               <p>Was you ashore at all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay on shore? - Two or three days.</p>
               <p>How came you not to make an information of what you had heard? - I was never called upon.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. After having heard Captain Roche declare the preceding night that he was determined to chastise Captain Fergusson, and for that purpose borrowed a sword of another officer, because he thought his own not good enough, why did not you, when you heard of Captain Fergusson's death, go on shore and make an information before some magistrate of what you had heard, or why did you not do it when you was on shore? - I had mentioned the circumstance to people on board; when I was ashore I never was called upon.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you the only person that heard him say this in the cabin? - I was.</p>
               <p>How should it be known that you could give any information at all, if you did not mention it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant DAVY. You can tell us whether there were not other interrogatories put to the witnesses at the Cape? - I don't know any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Whether it was publickly known on board the ship that Captain Roche had made use of threatening expressions? - I heard it was publicly known all over the ship that he had long before that made use of threatening expressions.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. MACDONALD.</p>
               <p>I think you was the commander of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060055"></xptr> Vansittart on her voyage outwards in the year 1773? - I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. MACDONALD. Please to tell any thing you know relative to Captain Roche and Captain Fergusson? - I received Captain Roche, by order of the Company, in the latter end of April 1773: I was to carry him to Bombay: we sailed a few days afterwards. There were many disputes before we arrived at Madeira between Captain Roche and the passengers, which I understood when we came to Madeira to be fully settled. After we had left Madeira some little time, I really cannot say how long, Captain Roche desired I would carry a letter to Captain Fergusson, containing a concession for some offence, and begging pardon for what had passed. Captain Fergusson said he had so often offended, and so often asked pardon, that he was determined to make a memorial to the governor and council at Bombay. Captain Fergusson said he could not, nor would he accept his concessions, unless Captain Roche would sign some paper which was drawn up. It was sent to Captain Roche: he did not sign it; what his reasons were for not signing it I cannot say, and no concession was accepted. The day before we got into the Cape, Captain Roche came to me upon the quarter-deck, and told me he had been addressing himself to Captain Fergusson to know whether he meant to give him satisfaction on shore as a gentleman or not, and that Captain Fergusson would make him no reply, but that he was determined to make him speak to him on shore. The next day about eight in the evening we came to an anchor at the <placeName id="t17751206-25-crimeloc110">Cape of Good Hope</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17751206-25-crimeloc110" type="placeName" value="Cape of Good Hope"></interp>
                  <interp inst="t17751206-25-crimeloc110" type="type" value="crimeLocation"></interp>
                  <join result="offencePlace" targOrder="Y" targets="t17751206-25-off107 t17751206-25-crimeloc110"></join>: the wind blew strong, so that we did not dispatch a boat on shore; but Captain Fergusson asked me when a boat came, if I had any objection to his going on shore in that boat. He went on shore about ten or eleven o'clock with my third officer. About noon the wind rather moderated, and I chose to go on shore myself. Captain Roche applied to me for an order that he might have a boat whenever he chose to go on shore; I ordered my first officer to let him have a boat whenever he wanted it. About four o'clock I went down to the water-side to see if I had ever a boat on shore, and I saw my own boat coming on shore with Captain Roche and Mrs. Roche. Upon their landing I went on board in the boat, and Captain Roche and Mrs. Roche walked up the wharf towards the town with my purser, I went on shore again at near seven: just as I was entering the door of the house I lodged at, two of the passengers, Mr. Pemberton and Mr. Brodie, who are writers in the Company's service, came in great confusion and told me Captain Roche had assassinated Captain Fergusson in the street: I was a good deal struck, and made some enquiry, but they told me Captain Fergusson was then expiring.</p>
               <p>Were you present at any time when any applications were made to the governor? - I went that very evening to the governor, and told him one of my passengers had killed another in the streets of his town; he said he was sorry for it, but he would order diligent search to be made to bring the parties to account for what they had done.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay at the Cape? - From the 3d at night till the 17th in the morning.</p>
               <p>Did you at any other time during that period make the same applications to the governor or fiscal? - Yes; Colonel Kay and some more of the passengers told me they should be glad to accompany me to the fiscal, to desire that Captain Roche might be apprehended, if possible, and brought to justice for killing Captain Fergusson. Upon the evening Captain Fergusson was buried, which was a few days after his death, we went to the governor, and told him that we imagined that diligent search had not been made, or else in so small a town Captain Roche must have been apprehended and brought to justice. The fiscal assured us that it had, and that very diligent search should be made.</p>
               <p>Did you make the same applications at any considerable distance of time after that? - I believe not many days before I left the Cape; I believe four or five days: I made a morning visit to the governor, as I did frequently, and in conversation I told him I thought it very extraordinary; the governor said, we cannot hear any thing of Captain Roche: I said, I think it odd in your small place: the governor assured me, that if he apprehended him he would keep him till an English man of war came in, and send him over.</p>
               <p>Did you hear of any reward being offered? - I was told by the passengers that Mr. Fergusson his brother had offered a reward.</p>
               <p>Did you, in company with any one else, make any enquiry at the house of one Vanderpool,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060056"></xptr> whether he was there? - I am not clear whether I was there with the fiscal or not; I do think I walked up to Mr. Vanderpool's door and left them there, when the fiscal commanded Vanderpool to come out.</p>
               <p>When you carried this letter from Captain Roche to Captain Fergusson, did Captain Fergusson make any observations what Captain Roche's behaviour ought to be? - Not as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Did Captain Fergusson say whether he would or not fight him? - He said he was tired of Captain Roche's behaviour, he had offended so often, and asked pardon so often, that he would accept of no concessions from him, but he would make a memorial to the Governor and Council at Bombay.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination by Mr. DAVENPORT.</p>
               <p>If I understand you right, Captain Roche made repeated concessions to Captain Fergusson, who as often resisted them? - On board the ship there was no offer of concession.</p>
               <p>From the conduct of both whether you understood that Captain Roche was ready to make all proper concession, and that Captain Fergusson would not accept of any? - I did not attend to any particular conversations upon it, nor did I know they had quarrelled, until Captain Roche informed me so.</p>
               <p>Then there were concessions as large, and as often repeated as the affronts were given, to your knowledge. - Not to my knowledge; I never heard of any.</p>
               <p>As far as you know? - As far as I know.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any fresh quarrels after Captain Roche offered to make concessions between him and Captain Fergusson? - I don't.</p>
               <p>I will ask you how Captain Fergusson went armed when he went on shore? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you see him with a cane? - I don't recollect seeing him with a cane, or having any thing else in his hand; I did not observe.</p>
               <p>He went on shore four or five hours before Captain Roche? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know from the governor or fiscal that Captain Roche had sent on shore to the governor or fiscal to desire that some steps might be taken to prevent any assault, or any thing happening between him and Captain Fergusson? - I never heard that.</p>
               <p>How many boats went on shore after Captain Fergusson went, and before Captain Roche went? - That I cannot tell, whether four, five, or six; my chief officers could answer that best.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was it after Captain Roche and his lady went on shore that you heard of the death of Captain Fergusson? - About four he went on shore, and it was near seven when I heard of it.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. COX.</p>
               <p>I believe you was a mate on board the Vansittart? - I was.</p>
               <p>Have you heard Captain Fergusson say any thing, and what in relation to his conduct with Captain Roche?</p>
               <p>Mr. LUCAS. What Captain Fergusson said is no evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. COX. What we mean to prove is, that Captain Fergusson declared before he went on shore that if Captain Roche should challenge him he would not fight him.</p>
               <p>Court. I don't see the relivancy of that evidence, if it was given. To be sure, nothing that Captain Fergusson said in conversation before the time of the wound being given, when the prisoner was not present, can affect the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant DAVY. I submit to your Lordship upon a question, whether the wound was given in consequence of a challenge or no, that it would be evidence; for the question would be, whether Captain Fergusson did or not to go out to fight this gentleman in a fair duel? Now we will shew that Captain Fergusson declared he would not fight him.</p>
               <p>You have not heard any thing said by Captain Roche upon the subject at any time, have you? - I don't recollect I have.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any applications made to the fiscal with regard to this affair? - Upon the evening that Captain Fergusson was buried I went with Captain Young, Colonel Kay, and several other gentlemen, passengers, and officers belonging to the ship, and waited upon the fiscal and governor.</p>
               <p>Mr. LUCAS. I submit to your Lordship, that the conversation between the fiscal and governor is not evidence?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060057"></xptr>Mr. COX. I only examine him as to the application to the fiscal.</p>
               <p>Court. As to the slight in such a country as that, where the judge never hears them, but hangs them up directly, right or wrong, the slight can be nothing: their manner of trial is surprizing; if the party is a low man, he is committed to prison, and they send and take examinations; if they are satisfied he is guilty, they give orders for him to be hanged: if he is a gentleman, they put officers over him, but they don't see him or hear him, and he is to wait till he knows whether the fiscal, who is an arbitrary judge, hangs him or not; that is what a gentleman swore who has been at the Cape.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. If they want evidence, then they examine the party accused.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant DAVY. My Lord, we have gone through all our evidence, except the depositions taken at the Cape.</p>
               <p>Court. They cannot be admitted here,</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord,</p>
               <p>I am very happy that I have now an opportunity of justifying my conduct before a jury of Englishmen. The governor and the judge at the Cape, the most arbitary country in the world, were perfectly satisfied of the propriety of my conduct, and they discharged me: I have witnesses to make that demonstrable before your Lordship. I have also evidence to be produced to shew the manner in which I was treated by Captain Fergusson. As an officer I was compelled to support my honor, and I did not draw my sword till after I was knocked down. I received a violent cut upon my head, and had my arm dislocated. My Lord, I will now call my witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court. Call any witnesses you think proper to the fact; we cannot suffer any witnesses to to be called as to what passed before the fiscal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As to the matter of fact, my attorney has got a list of witnesses, which I beg he will call in.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. LUCAS.</p>
               <p>Was you at the Cape of Good Hope in September 1773? - Yes; I went out from England in the Britannia; I went afterwards into the Dolphin man of war.</p>
               <p>How long have you been out of England? - About two years and a half: I went to the Cape in the Earl of Sandwich.</p>
               <p>What time did you leave the Earl of Sandwich? - The second of September, at False Bay, about eighteen miles from the Cape: I left the ship on the second, and went to the Cape the same day: I staid there four or five days.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing particular upon Saturday evening the 4th of September? - Yes; I was at a punch-house at the Cape, called the Naked Man. At about six o'clock in the evening I went through the Company's gardens, and I saw a tall man following a gentleman up who was dressed in red.</p>
               <p>How was that tall man dressed? - In light blue: I saw him knock the short gentleman down that was dressed in red.</p>
               <p>Who was that short gentleman that was dressed in red? - As far as I could hear afterwards it was a captain belonging to the Company's service; it is that gentleman (pointing to Captain Roche). I saw him knock him down with a cane or stick, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>What was the short gentleman doing there? - Walking along, and the tall man following him; the tall man came up with a pretty good step and knocked him down: I heard the short gentleman hollow out,</p>
               <p>"Don't use me so, but</p>
               <p>"let me have satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"The tall gentleman drew his sword directly.</p>
               <p>Did you see whether there was one blow or more with the cane? - I think two or three with the cane; he fought with his sword and cane.</p>
               <p>What hand was his cane in when he fought with his sword and cane? - In his left hand, and his sword in his right.</p>
               <p>How long did they fight? - Two or three seconds, or so.</p>
               <p>Had the short gentleman drawn his sword, or spoke to him before he received the blow with the cane? - No; he was walking along and saying nothing.</p>
               <p>Did you see the short gentleman's sword drawn? - Yes, after the tall gentleman had drawn his sword.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060058"></xptr>Cross Examination by Mr. Serjeant DAVY.</p>
               <p>Who drew his sword first? - Captain Fergusson.</p>
               <p>When the short gentleman said to him,</p>
               <p>"Don't use me so, but let me have satisfaction," then the tall gentleman immediately drew his sword? - Yes, and the short gentleman got up.</p>
               <p>But did not draw his sword after he was knocked down till the tall gentleman, Captain Fergusson, drew his sword? - No.</p>
               <p>How long had you seen the prisoner before Captain Fergusson came up to him to knock him down? - Not a minute.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him a quarter of a minute? - Yes; he was walking, and a black boy with him.</p>
               <p>Then perhaps you saw him before he turned the corner? - I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>How near to the corner was it that he was knocked down? - About ten yards.</p>
               <p>But he had passed the corner before you saw him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many yards? - About three yards.</p>
               <p>Then you suppose him to have walked seven yards after you saw him before the tall gentleman came up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And then the tall gentleman came behind him softly and knocked him down? - He walked up a good pace.</p>
               <p>Without making a noise? - He made no noise, he never spoke.</p>
               <p>And knocked him down without speaking one word? - He did not say a word, that I am sure of.</p>
               <p>The other fell to the ground immediately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Quite flat upon the ground? - Yes, quite at length.</p>
               <p>How long did Captain Roche lie upon the ground before he got up again? - Not long: as soon as he was down he cried out, and desired the other gentleman to give him satisfaction, and not take his life away.</p>
               <p>Did the other strike him after he was down? - No.</p>
               <p>The first blow knocked him down? - He hit him two or three times before he fell.</p>
               <p>Then the first blow did not knock him down? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he turn about after he had received the first blow? - No.</p>
               <p>He tried to run away? - No, he kept going on till he tumbled.</p>
               <p>After he had received the first blow he did not turn back to see who struck him? - No.</p>
               <p>He received a second or third blow before he turned round, and still kept walking on till the third blow brought him to the ground? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And all that time he did not lock back, nor turned his head, nor said one word? - No.</p>
               <p>So when he was down upon the ground then he desired to have satisfaction? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that before he got up again? - As he was getting up.</p>
               <p>And he did not draw his sword till after the tall gentleman drew his? - No.</p>
               <p>And when he had drawn his sword, what happened? - They pushed at one another with their swords till I saw the tall gentleman fall.</p>
               <p>The tall gentleman did not use his cane? - Yes, sending off with the cane.</p>
               <p>But of course he was pushing with the sword all the while? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Consequently he stood, I suppose, rather inclined to the right with his sword, and was only using the cane to fence off the other's sword; he kept the sword pointed towards the small gentleman, I suppose, - Yes.</p>
               <p>So the other stood towards him too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They were all pushes; the short gentleman struck no blows upon the tall gentleman, but all was by way of pushing? - I saw him strike no blows.</p>
               <p>So then all the wounds the small gentleman could be able to give must be with the point of the sword? - Whether it was pushing or striking I could not tell.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you never saw so serious a transaction in your life between two gentleman; it was an interesting thing for you to take notice of: methinks you should be able to tell us whether it was pushing at one another, or striking as if they were cudgelling with their swords? - I cannot tell which way it was.</p>
               <p>May be you was never asked the question before now? - No.</p>
               <p>I believe so; then that makes no part of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060059"></xptr> tale: you don't know whether they were beating one another with their swords, or pushing at one another? - No.</p>
               <p>How long might they be set to one another before the tall one fell? - About three seconds.</p>
               <p>It was light enough for you to see? - It was the dusk of the evening, neither light nor dark.</p>
               <p>Do you think you was twelve yards from them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You could see the cane as well as the glittering sword it was so light? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You could see them perfectly distinct and clearly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You could have seen them if you had been twenty yards off, I suppose? - I don't know whether I could or not.</p>
               <p>Then it was not quite dark? - No.</p>
               <p>Only a little duskish? - Yes, only a little duskish.</p>
               <p>Did any words pass except what you have mentioned,</p>
               <p>"Don't use me so, let me have</p>
               <p>"satisfaction?</p>
               <p>"were there no names called, or was there not a word after that? - No, not as I heard; I went away as soon as the tall gentleman fell.</p>
               <p>Was any body so near to them besides yourself? - There was one gentleman close by them.</p>
               <p>Can you tell that gentleman's name? - No.</p>
               <p>Suppose I help you to the name: did you ever hear it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it Mr. Grant? - I cannot rightly say.</p>
               <p>How came you not to stay? - Because I had other business to do.</p>
               <p>It was no affair of yours? - No.</p>
               <p>A couple of gentlemen murdering one another was no affair of yours? - No.</p>
               <p>You never saw such an affair before, I dare say? - No.</p>
               <p>Where were you going? - To see whether I could get a vessel.</p>
               <p>You was not in employ at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Where did you lie that night? - At the punch-house, the Naked Man.</p>
               <p>But as it was no affair of yours you did not say a word about it that night to any body? - I did not trouble myself about it afterwards.</p>
               <p>You was right; what is a little blood to you: you did not mention it at the punch-house, did you? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>And when other folks talked of it you did not say you had seen it? - No.</p>
               <p>You say you left the Sandwich upon the 2d? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was two days before you saw what passed between these two gentlemen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The day you left her was Thursday the 2d; this happened on Saturday the 4th? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How near is False Bay to Table Bay? - About sixteen or eighteen miles.</p>
               <p>When did the Sandwich come to Table Bay? - The very day I left her.</p>
               <p>When did you leave the Cape? - The Tuesday afterwards.</p>
               <p>In what ship? - I came back to my own ship.</p>
               <p>When did you run away from the Sandwich quite? - I never left her; I came home in her.</p>
               <p>Who was the commander of the Sandwich? - Captain Neal.</p>
               <p>When did you leave the Sandwich to go from her quite? - I left her twice in all.</p>
               <p>When was the first time? - The 2d of September.</p>

               <p>When was the second time? - The day after I came back was the 7th or 8th; I went again on board of her, and came home in her.</p>
               <p>Mr. LUCAS. How came you on board the ship again after you left her? - The first time I came of my own accord.</p>
               <p>The second time how came you on board? - I was apprehended and brought back.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant DAVY. Did the little black boy stay to see them fight? - No; he ran away.</p>
               <p>When? - After Captain Roche was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Before he got up again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After the tall gentleman fell, what did the short gentleman do? - He went away and left him, and I saw no more of it.</p>
               <p>Did you leave them the moment he fell? - Yes.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. HOWARTH.</p>
               <p>You were on board the Sandwich East India-man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know the last witness, Goodwin? - Yes; he was a foremast-man on board that ship.</p>
               <p>Do you remember that ship coming to an anchor in False Bay? - Yes.</p>
               <p>About what time was that? - To the best of my memory, the 1st or 2d of September.</p>
               <p>I believe you kept the purser's accounts? - No; I wrote the chief and the second mate's journals there: I kept Captain Neal's accounts after that.</p>
               <p>Did Goodwin leave the ship at False Bay and go on shore? - Yes; they came to an anchor in the evening: when the boat went on shore for provisions, I believe he went in it, and did not return: he came back to the ship on Monday evening the 6th, I believe; he had been absent Saturday, Sunday, and Monday evening: he asked me to request Mr. Tilly to forgive him, and he would come on board again; and he came accordingly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant DAVY to GOODWIN. When did you come to England? - I came home directly from the Cape in the Sandwich, at about six weeks after last Christmas was twelve month: I have been two voyages since that; I went first in the Barbary Brig, a merchant ship, to the coast of Guinea.</p>
               <p>How long was you in England before you went out again? - About six weeks.</p>
               <p>During that six weeks did you hear any talk about this affair? - No.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you returned to England from Guinea? - Seven or eight months: I returned from the coast of Guinea pretty near twelve months ago; I staid here five weeks, and then I went to the Bay of Honduras in the Friendship, a merchant ship.</p>
               <p>During these five weeks had you not heard any thing of the murder at the Cape of Good Hope? - Not in England: I staid eight months at the Bay of Honduras, and returned from thence about five weeks ago.</p>
               <p>When you returned to England five weeks ago, where did you go? - To my lodgings in East-Smithfield.</p>
               <p>There you have lodged ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you first mention the particulars you have told to day? - As soon as I heard of the prisoner at the bar being confined for it, which was about three weeks ago, I came up to him.</p>
               <p>Who did you hear it from? - I heard a gentleman that sat in the house read it in the news paper.</p>
               <p>Who was that gentleman? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was any body present when the gentleman read the paper to you? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>You did not speak to that gentleman or any body else about it? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you at Newgate more than once? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you tell what day you saw Captain Roche in Newgate? - No.</p>
               <p>Is it within three weeks ago or more? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>That is the first time that ever you mentioned to any body what you had seen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And then you went of your own accord to see him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What part of Newgate was he in? - In a room at the top of Newgate.</p>

                  </hi>. On the morning of the 28th of April, I was in Morgan's-lane, Bermondsey street—I was employed, with others, in emptying a privy—I was coming out of the house, and heard the ladder thrown from the cart—I put my bucket down in the house and ran out—I saw five men near the cart, dressed in sailor's clothes—we asked them they did that for—they said, because they liked it and they would do it again if they liked—the prisoner said that—I am sure he is the man—he made a blow at me—I had not made a blow at him first—my partners ran to save, and then Hagger <hi rend="italic">pitched into</hi> him, and then I and Green well began fighting—we had three rounds—he then put his hand into his pocket—I did not him take the knife out,</p>

               <p>but I saw him open it right before me, and he stabbed me in the left side—my master came out and shoved him off me, and he ran away, hallooing "Police" several times, and Hagger followed him—this was after we had fought two rounds—I was on the ground when he opened the knife—with one knee up and the other down—he had run after me and pushed me down, and then presented the knife at me and stabbed me in the left side of my body while I was on the ground—he was on both his knees, kneeling on me with one knee on my leg, and I had one foot on the ground—the other knee was kneeling—as soon as he opened the knife he rushed it into me—my master picked me up—I told him the prisoner had stabbed me, and then he ran after him—I can swear I did not ran away after he opened the knife—I could not stir—I laid on the ground till he stabbed me.</p>

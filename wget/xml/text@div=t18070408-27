               <p>Q. When did you lose this coat or how. - A. On the 1st of March it hung behind the stable door in <placeName id="t18070408-27-crimeloc163">Mason's-yard, Duke-street, St. James's</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18070408-27-crimeloc163" type="placeName" value="Mason's-yard, Duke-street, St. James's"></interp>

               <p>Q. Are you coachman. - A. Yes; I left the coat<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080018"></xptr> there when I went out at three o'clock in the afternoon, and when I came in at half past six I found the coat gone. The prisoner at the bar was the first man that came into the stable after I came; I asked him if he had seen my surtout coat, he said he saw it there at four o'clock in the afternoon; he said he saw nobody take it away; he is a <rs id="t18070408-27-deflabel164" type="occupation">servant</rs>

The next morning I found him in the stable, cleaning one of my horses; I said to Mr. Dean it is very odd who took my coat, the prisoner looked very much confused, I taxed him and another about it; I asked him where he lodged, he said at first in Pall-mall, but he did not know the name nor the number, and then he said he lodged in Titchfield-street. I told them I would take them to Marlborough-street and put them upon their oaths, and make them swear whether they knew any thing or not of the coat; then I went to breakfast. I left word with two men in the yard not to let him go to breakfast without watching him; a man that is here watched him and brought him back with the coat. He came up to me and said, coachman, I did take your coat, but I hope you will not hurt me; I told him no, I would not, I would give him what the law would allow him.</p>

            . I am groom to Mr. Stepney. I watched the prisoner from Mason's yard to the Lemon-tree the corner of the Hay-market; he stopped there about twenty minutes; I watched him from there; when he came out to Buckingham-court, Charing Cross. He went into a public house, he waited there ten minutes, and then he came out with the coat on his arm; I laid hold of him and told him it was the coachman's coat; he said he knew it was; he was going towards Westminster with the coat.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

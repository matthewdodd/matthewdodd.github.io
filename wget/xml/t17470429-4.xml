               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Penton . There was the Duke of Marlborough coming through the Mall, with his two Daughters; not knowing the Gentleman, I asked the Prisoner who that Gentleman wa s, he told me it was the Duke of Marlborough ; after I had asked him this Question, then he said to me, Did not you see four Fellows go before, I have spent my Money with them, now they want to shab me off, with that he said he should be glad of my Company , if I would go and drink with him; he very much insisted on it, with that I told him I had no Money to spend, and I was going home, that I had been out for most Part of Day; with that he asked me if I would go a-cross Hyde-Park with him, to a Friend of his in Grosvenor-square , or Grosvenor Street ; as we were going over the Park, he amused me with the pleasant moving of the Clouds in the Air, and began to sing a Song as he was going over the Park; when I came near to the Place where I was to go with him, he asked me if I would go to see the Place where the Men were buried that were shot, as soon as ever I came there, he knocked me down; after that , he took away my Hat and Wig, and Penknife out of my Pocket, I had no Money; and as I lay upon the Ground, he clapped his Knee upon my Stomach, and said, if I would not consent to let him buggar me , he would kill me.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174704290005"></xptr>Penton . I got a Serjeant to take him; being pursued, he dropped the Wig as he was running away; by struggling, I got away from him; the Soldiers heard the Cry of Murder; I was not a great Way from the Magazine in Hyde-park.</p>
               <p>Court . So the Soldiers came to your Assistance?</p>
               <p>Penton. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. How many came to your Assistance?</p>
               <p>Penton. I cannot say how many.</p>
               <p>Court . Was he taken immediately?</p>
               <p>Penton. He was taken that same Night after I was conducted out of the Park.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing more to say with Respect to the Robbery?</p>
               <p>Penton. No more to say.</p>
               <p>Court to Penton . What are you?</p>
               <p>Penton. I am a Barber and Peruke maker; I live along with Mr Taylor; I went out, not being well, to take a walk.</p>
               <p>Corneliu Smith. I am a Serjeant. I was in the Magazine Yard on Friday last, and about a Quarter after Eight in the Evening, I heard a prodigious Cry of Murder several Times ; I charged three or four Men upon Guard, immediately to take their Arms , and we made up to the Place where the Cry of Murder was, and when I came there, I found this

             had given of him, brought him Prisoner to me; when he was brought to the Guard. I charged him with this Robbery, and he said he was not guilty of it, I told him I could not discharge him, he was certainly the Man .</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to think he was the Man?</p>
               <p>Smith . By the Description Penton had given of him, as having white Stockings and black Garden, very clean his Stockings were; then after I had searched him, I said you had better confess the Fact a considerable deal , than to keep it in your Breast; I have got an Account where Penton lives, and I'll send to him To-morrow Morning. I said to him if you will confess I'll discharge you from your Confinement; at last, says he, Serjeant , will you be true to me? I said I would; he said, then I would speak with you in the Court; then we went into a square Court within side of the Magazine, when we came there, he said you must give me your Hand, and swear to be true to me; so I gave him my Hand and Oath, I said, by G - d, if you will confess the Robbery, I'll discharge you from your Confinement; with that he said, I have got the Hat about me , with that he put his Hand behind him, and brought out this Hat; so I said, where is the Penknife? he said he had dropped the Penknife getting over the Tenterbook Gate ; so he wanted me to discharge him, to be as good as my Word; so I said I could not, so ordered him into the Guard-Room.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to make him these Promises?</p>
               <p>Smith. I did it in order to bring him to a Confession .</p>
               <p>Court. What to swear by your Maker, that if a Man will discover , you will discharge him; then to tell him you could not do it, but to bring him here for the Reward; if there was no Reward, it would be a different Case; you did a very ill thing, to make an Oath and then to break it: What Foundation have the Jury to believe you, but that you are upon your Oath? You are telling them that you have no Regard to an Oath .</p>
               <p>Smith. So I ordered him into the Guard-Room , and told him I could not release him; the next Morning I went to the Tenterbook Gate , to find the Penknife, according as he said he had dropped it; I could not find it there, then he said he had dropped it out of his Pocket in running, but could not tell where it was .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send for Penton the next Morning ?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes, but he was not forth coming, nor could not be found till the Prisoner was before the Court Martial .</p>
               <p>Q. What Direction did Penton give you to find him ?</p>
               <p>Smith. At Mr Rocher's , or in Cuper's Gardens .</p>

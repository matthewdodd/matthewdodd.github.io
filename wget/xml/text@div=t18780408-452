I am a solicitor of the High Court, and a com<lb></lb>missioner to administer oaths—this is my signature to this declaration, which was made before me on 16th February, 1876, by the defendant to the best of my belief—the jurat is written by my clerk—the body of the document was filled up when brought to me—this other declaration of 3rd August, 1876, was declared in the same way; I believe by the prisoner.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor of 9, Bridge Street, Blackfriars—I act for Mr. Chambers, of Newport, Monmouthshire, who lent the prisoner 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in January, 1876, less 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. interest—this is the deed of sale, and this is the receipt signed by the prisoner—the money was not handed over to him till 22nd February, as the securities were not perfected—I made the trustees parties because I heard of settlement—this is my cheque endorsed by the prisoner—certain securities were realised, and part of the money repaid—we commenced to realise in June, 1877—to that time the loan re<lb></lb>mained unpaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>.

               <p>

I did not take proceedings on 26th May because Graham was in Holloway Prison, and Mr. Maynard told me if I brought a charge against him it would be said I did it for the purpose of closing the prisoner's mouth—I sold out the furniture at Kelsall Lodge—that person (Mrs. Clark) was there as a servant—I did not leave his wife in an almost dying condition, with nothing to lie on—most of the furniture had been cleared out before by the landlord and for rates and taxes—I did not leave Mrs. Graham and four or five children without clothes, blankets, or bed—the beds and blankets had been taken away—I sold what was left—I did not tell my men to smash up a dozen seltzer-water bottles—I have received altogether from the prisoner 259<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. down to the sale—he paid the first loan of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before I advanced money on 13th November, 1876—he also paid another bill of sale for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., also 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I realised 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the sale at Kelsall Lodge, and 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on his furniture in Poultry—the furniture was taken to Hollingsworth's after 6 in the even<lb></lb>ing, because we are not allowed to take it away in the day-time—it was not taken in the middle of the night—I saw the men there at 6 o'clock—I have still some securities, including some deeds which are valueless—Mr. Maynard holds them—these are the deeds (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also realised 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on a bill of exchange—I have another bill for 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., also the lease of Kelsall Lodge and several dishonoured cheques—I have not sued on them—they are post dated—I took them knowing they were post dated—I know nothing of the advertisement of "Money lent without security to male or female at 111, Newington Causeway," nor the branch office, 117, Caledonian Road—I never paid a Mr. Cox any commission—I now claim 234<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I claimed 780<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against Mr. Appleby's estate, who was tried at this Court for a bankruptcy fraud—my claim was not reduced to 114<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but to 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in addition to a bill of sale, which was allowed—I cannot give you particulars, I have not the papers—I appealed to the Lords Justices, who upheld Mr. Spring Rice in his decision against me—I was tried at this Court for conspiring with Appleby, and ac<lb></lb>quitted—I deducted 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for interest out of the first loan of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were other loans—I bought the prisoner's furniture for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and let it</p>

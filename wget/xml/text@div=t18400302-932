                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Benjamin Nevill. On the 24th of February I got into a Holloway omnibus at Moorgate-street—about two minutes before I got in I took my purse out of my pocket to take out a sixpence to pay my fare—I put the sixpence into my glove, and put the purse into my pocket again on my right side—I had done that openly in the street, so that any one might see that I had a purse—when I got into the omnibus I saw the prisoner Brown sitting near the door on the left-hand side—I was wishing to sit between him and the door, but he put his knees towards the door, and that occasioned me to sit on the other side, about three from the door—that brought me to sit next the prisoner Stanley—I feel convinced it was him—he sat on my right-hand, where my pocket and money was—the omnibus started immediately, and Stanley annoyed me by looking under my bonnet very much—when we got to York-place, City-road, a lady got out who had sat between me and the door—I then moved towards the door, and Stanley followed me—when he looked under my bonnet I turned my head from him—I continued in the omnibus till we got just beyond Islington church, when Stanley got out—Brown was then sitting on the opposite side to me, and he said he would get out at the next turning, but he did not stop till he got to the turning—he said, set him down, any where would do—the omnibus did not stop much before it got to the turning—I went on beyond Highbury—I missed my purse before I got there, but I did not discover that my gown was cut till I got out—from the time I got in at Moorgate and my missing my purse, no one, except Stanley, had been sitting on that side of me near enough to get my purse—and after he left no one sat near me—a woman sat on that side, but she was quite up at the other corner—I lost between 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say to a few shillings—I know I had two sovereigns in my purse, and one was an extremely bright one, of the present reign.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ward-officer. On the 24th of February I was in Bread-street, between two and three o'clock—I saw the two prison<lb></lb>ers together—I followed them—they went on to Moorgate, still in com<lb></lb>pany, and there Brown left Stanley, and got into a Holloway <hi rend="italic">buss</hi>—Stanley walked on, and crossed to the opposite side of the way—the <hi rend="italic">buss</hi> moved on a few paces, and then Stanley got in—I followed the <hi rend="italic">buss</hi> to beyond Islington church, and there I met Brown coming back towards town, but there being a wind in the road there, I did not see him get out—I said, "I want to speak to you, young fellow"—he made some answer I did not understand—I took him into a cheesemonger's shop, and searched him—I found on him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., one sovereign of which was a very bright one—I found on him a knife and two keys—I took him out, and he said, "Why don't you lay hold of my arm?"—I said, there was no occasion for that—as we walked on I turned my head, and saw Stanley on the other side of the way—I said to Brown, "Why don't you walk on faster?"—he then slackened his pace, and Stanley went across Islington burial-ground—Brown said he was going to Holloway, to see his cousin—I asked him why he did not go on with his journey—he said he had changed his mind.</p>

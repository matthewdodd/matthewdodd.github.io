                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Union-passage, St. George's.

I have taken so many at different times, you shall answer for all"—I gave them into custody, and gave the officer the half-crown—I was walking from the sitting-room to the bar that evening, I put my foot on something—it was a small bag with a half-crown in it, of the same date as the one I had taken—I gave that to the same officer—it was inside the bar, as if it had been thrown over the counter.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt. Did you at any time belong to the ship Inflexible? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you at the Cape of Good Hope the same time that the Naiad was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The ship's company frequently mixed on shore? - Yes, at Penguin Island.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time see any thing pass respecting the prisoner on board his own ship? - Yes, our ship used to attend the sick on shore, so I went on shore one day, and I saw one

             pull a paper from under his head, and he said to a man, one Glass Isaacson, give this to M'Grath, on board his own ship; and we went to the shore and carried Glass Isaacson in our boat, and put him on board the Naiad, and the prisoner came upon deck, and he asked me down to dinner with him, and while we were at dinner this Dutchman came down and spoke to the prisoner, and told him he had a paper for him, and he desired him to give it him, and I saw him give him a paper, and he told him that was the will of Mr. Dalton that was on shore, who sent it to him.</p>
               <p>Did you take that paper into your hand, or look at it at all? - No, I did not, it would be of no use, I cannot read; and the prisoner told his messmate to put it into his chest, it might be of service to him another time.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060095"></xptr>There were on shore upon this island the crews of several ships? - Yes, there were seven or eight sail.</p>
               <p>Was it possible for a person from one ship to witness a will at another? - I think so.</p>
               <p>Did they mix promiscuously together? - Yes, the crews of several ships were together all day.</p>
               <p>I suppose they drank together and eat together? - They did.</p>
               <p>Did you within your own experience ever see a will witnessed by two persons, one belonging to one ship and another to another? - I do not know that I have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Have you known the prisoner any time? - Yes, I knew him and

             both in New York.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - It is five or six years ago now, as near as I can tell, it was in the summer time.</p>
               <p>How long was it before Dalton died? - I believe it was four years before he died, that was when I first knew him.</p>
               <p>When you went to the ship who did you ask for? - I asked for M'Grath, he answered me by that name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. I understand him that he knew him four years before he died.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Where was this paper given to you? - At the Cape of Good Hope, between the 11th of December and the 8th of March.</p>
               <p>What did you mean to tell me that it was summer time? - I thought you asked me what time of year it was that I knew him.</p>
               <p>I asked you what time it was this transaction had passed that you have been relating? - It was between December and March.</p>
               <p>How long was it before his death that that paper was sent from him to the ship? - I cannot say, I do not know when he died, or whether he is dead yet or no.</p>
               <p>Did he go by the name of M'Grath? - He answered me by that name.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to call him M'Grath? - I cannot tell whether he went by the name of M'Grath, but I knew him by that name that he went by in New York.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. He went by the name of M'Grath in New York constantly? - He did.</p>

               <p>Was you on board the Naiade, at the time the prisoner was? - I was, he was very attentive as far as ever I knew.</p>
               <p>Did he behave well in the station of a seaman? - Very well.</p>
               <p>Had he the reputation of honesty? - I never heard any thing against his character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. My Lord, I have omitted a material question, which the witness Davis can perhaps answer; it is stated in my instructions, that the prisoner and the deceased were sister's children. Do you know whether the prisoner was nearly related to the deceased? - I always heard so.</p>
               <p>Was it understood so at New York? - It was.</p>
               <p>Jury to Doctor Graham. What time did he come away from the Cape? - He died on Friday the 17th of December, 1783, on the same night he was landed from the ship.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Was he landed in the morning or the evening? - He died a few hours<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060096"></xptr> after he was landed; he was landed I think about four or five in the evening, and he died that night.</p>

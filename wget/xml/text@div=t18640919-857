I am a paperhanger, 22, Hungerford-street, Com<lb></lb>mercial-road—on the night of 16th August, about 12 o'clock, I saw the prisoners and the prosecutor, and knowing him, I tried to get him away from them—I was in the King and Queen having a drop of beer when they came in—the prosecutor was the worse for liquor—we left the house, and were going home, and when we had got about 100 or 120 yards, just round the corner, the prisoners came up and asked for some money to pay for their lodging—Goodwin said he had got no money, not above three halfpence, and he gave them three halfpence, and Duggan deliberately struck him, and said, "Take that, you <hi rend="italic">sod</hi>," and knocked him down—he then went to pick him up, and Robinson rifled his pockets—Two was standing looking on—I heard money jink, and something passed from one hand to the other—I don't know what it was—I did not interfere till they had gone away—I then, followed them, and gave them in charge to the first constable I came to—my wife was there at the time, and she was ready to go into fits—they threatened to knock her down if she interfered, and called her names not fit to mention—she followed the prosecutor home.</p>

I am the wife of last witness—on the night of 16th August, about a quarter to 12, I went to the King and Queen to look after my husband—while I was there the prosecutor came in, followed by the three prisoners—Duggan asked him for some beer, and a pot was called for—the prosecutor paid sixpence for it, and had two penny pieces out—I can't say whether he had any other money in his hand at the time, but there was a shilling dropped—I don't know who picked it up—the prosecutor left with me and my husband, and the prisoners followed—we walked a few steps up Leary-street, till we came to Albion-place, when Duggan asked Goodwin for some money to pay for his lodging—he gave him twopence, and said that I was all the money he had—Duggan said it was only three halfpence, and he struck him, and knocked him down—he then picked him up, and held him with his hands down by his side, and then he put his hands in his pockets—Robinson went to his assistance, and I heard money jink—Two stood by—he did not go to his assistance—when Duggan knocked him down I called him a wretch for so doing, and he then put heavy threats on me and my husband, and said he would serve us the same—I made no noise—I was afraid in consequence of the threats—eventually the prisoners went away—my husband followed them—I am positive they are the men.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother John. We are ivory comb-manufacturers, and live in Fleur-de-lis-street—we gene<lb></lb>rally have some thousands of dozens of pieces of ivory like these—they are turned by circular saws—on the 22nd of September we took stock, and again on the 11th of November; and we had lost sixty-nine gross of these pieces—they are worth about a guinea a gross—Jackson, of Gun-square, Houndsditch, cuts the teeth in the combs—on the 9th of November I went to Jackson, but nothing was shown to me then—on the 11th of November I went there again, and saw a number of our pieces—I knew them to be ours—Jackson showed me fifty-nine dozen—I recog<lb></lb>nized forty dozen, which were ours—I knew them by the way they were cut, and the various sized saws employed—they are cut different to the general way of cutting—some are cut upright, but these are not—we had different qualities of ivory, and these are of different qualities, cor<lb></lb>responding with ours—on Saturday morning, the 15th of November, I went with the officer to Edward-street, Kingsland-road—we went to the first-floor back room—I saw the prisoner there—I had known him many years—Hanley asked him to account for the pieces at Jackson's—he said they were his own; that he had bought a variety; and told us where he had cut them up—that in one instance he had bought some clumps of a sailor who came to his house; in another instance he had bought a tooth of Mr. West, in Charles-street, Hatton-garden; and these pieces were the proceeds of that tooth; and he produced a receipt for about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he did not know the sailor, he had never seen him before—he told me he would show me part of the proceeds of this tooth, and we walked into the front room—he then took a handful of pieces out of a drawer-case, and showed them to me—I said, "Why, David, these are my pieces"—he said, "If you say that, you will say any thing;" and he swept the whole of the contents of the drawer-case on the floor—I said, "David, if you had come by these honestly, you would have taken me out some of the tip pieces"—he said there were no tip pieces, for he had run the stuff—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240127"></xptr>
               <p>but I found some tip pieces among them—I said, "David, here are some tip pieces, for here is the saw-race at the end"—he said he had got them all out of the tooth he had bought—I said it was nonsense to talk so, for I could show him five or six different sorts of stuff which they came out of; and I showed him the proof I had that they were mine—I found thirteen dozen in the prisoner's drawer-case that are mine—I certainly could not have sold them in the state they are in—the prisoner said he had them cut up by Pyer, a horn comb-manufacturer, in Fashion-street, Spitalfields; but they are cut by different-sized saws, and, when we got to Pyer's, he had but one saw.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. Are you extensive manufacturers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the most extensive manufacturers in the three kingdoms—ours are not patent saws—there are numbers to circular saws to the same description as ours for the slabbing of these pieces, but I sincerely believe we are the only persons who use them for rounding them—Mr. Simmons does not use them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this piece—(<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>)—it is done in the same way as yours, is it one of yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not really think it is—I do not think it is done by our machine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not this one of the circular machines? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it has been abused—I do not think it could be used—it appears to have been used, and I cannot tell how many more there are—many thousands of elephants' teeth are cut in London every year—I knew the prisoner in the trade—I had not seen him on our premises during the time we lost ivory, from the 22nd of September to November—they might hare, been stolen on the 1st of October, and have passed through many hands—Captains and sailors bring elephants' teeth sometimes—this piece has not been done by a machine similar to ours; it has been broken in' the rounding—a proper machine would not have done so—there may be other machines of different sizes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that amongst the hundreds, thousands, and per<lb></lb>haps' millions of pieces that are in circulation, you could swear to any without a private mark on them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is a private mark on some of these, that satisfies me, that you are not aware of—I had to make some very fine ones out of a very fine tooth—these are some of them—if any other maker had made fine work, they would not have the same appearance to a comb-maker—I am a practical man in the trade—I am satisfied that I cannot be deceived—I can swear to the grain, and the quality—these are not African; they were cut out of a Bombay hollow,—it is not like ivory; it is more like pearl—there may be some of the same colour and quality, but every tooth carries its own grain.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in possession of different descriptions, of elephants' teeth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, one tooth would not exhibit different grains—we have eight saws of different dimensions, and I found pieces corre<lb></lb>sponding with the dimensions of each of our saws, and they correspond with the grain to the ivory we had—I learned at Jackson's that the prisoner had taken some there—the wheel that has been produced would not produce the same appearances that there are on these pieces.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a comb-manufacturer, and live in Fashion-street. I have known the prisoner many years—about seven weeks ago, he came and asked my leave to cut up an elephant's tooth, which he had bought of a sailor—I allowed him to do so—the only saw I had fit for use, was this one—it was too thick, and I told him he might get it made thinner—he did so, and cut up the ivory on my premises, into comb-patterns of this de<lb></lb>scription—he got two other saws beside mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You had but one saw fit for use? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I am a horn comb-maker—I told Hanley the prisoner brought another saw, and that it broke on the fourth cut—this saw is about six inches in diameter—it was nine inches when new.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this a machine that would cut the edges in the way these are done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not used in our trade; but the circle corresponds with the cut of the ivory.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hardware-man, and live at No. 156, Brick-lane, Spitalfields. I know the prisoner. About five weeks ago, I gave him five gross of ivory pieces, to make into combs; and about three weeks ago, I gave him seven dozen—I had them from Mr. Weston, who has been dead six or seven weeks—I lent him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it you gave the first parcel of ivory? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About five weeks ago, and the second about three weeks ago—I gave them both in my own house—Weston lived in Great Garden-street—he brought all this ivory to my place at once—I have not been to his house—I have heard he is dead, from persons who came to me to sell things—Mr. Gardner told me so, when he came to sell me some combs—the officer called on me—he told me the prisoner had stated that he had some ivory of me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not deny to the officer, that you had ever had any dealings with the prisoner in ivory? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not afterwards change the story, and say that I had given him four or five dozen of pieces to make into combs—I did not say I had them of a man of the name of Weston, to whom I had advanced 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not say it was eight dozen I had had of Weston, and that I never had any dealings in ivory, except this eight dozen; either with the prisoner or Weston, or any body else—I did not say, on the second examination of the prisoner, I was ready to swear I had frequently given the prisoner pieces of ivory—I said I was then ready to state the case as I have now.</p>

               <p>

I live in Brick-lane, and am a boot-maker—at the latter end of August, or the beginning of September, I went into my brother's shop—I saw Weston there—he brought in a small parcel, tied in a blue handkerchief, and gave it to my brother—I walked to the end of the shop to see what it was, and they were little square pieces of ivory—I heard him ask my brother for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some money passed, but I cannot say what.</p>

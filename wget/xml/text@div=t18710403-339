                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live at 5, George Street, Deptford—on Sunday night, 19th March, about 11 o'clock, I was in High Street, Deptford—I met a woman there—I had never seen her before—I walked with her for about five minutes—when we got to the corner of a side street, five men ran out upon me and knocked me down—I was per<lb></lb>fectly sober—the prisoners are two of the men—Parker put his hand over my mouth, to keep me from calling out, and he kicked me on the legs very much—when I got up, my mouth was cut—a stone was thrown at me while I was on the ground—Rutherford was there—he helped to take my money—I had 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my trowsers' pockets—I missed that when I got up—I did not see what became of the woman—after the men had attacked me, they went into a house in Stanhope Street—I did not take the number of the house, but I looked at it, and marked it with a stone—I went away and got a constable, and went back with him to the house—we knocked, and a woman came to the door—we went in, and the men ran out the back way—they were in a back room, and I saw them come out at the door of the back room, and run into a back yard with a fence round it, 4ft. or 5ft. high—I saw Parker getting over the fence, and the constable caught him before he got over—Rutherford had a candle in his hand, which he blew out when the constable went into the yard—the constable and Parker struggled together—I tried to help him—Rutherford got over the fence—I saw him afterwards, because he threw several bricks at the constable—I saw him on the other side of the fence after he got over—he was 6 yds. or 6 yds. off, throwing tilings at the constable—the other men all got away Parker got away from the constable, and ran out of the house, and the constable after him—he caught him again in Stanhope Street.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Five men knocked me down—I know them all—I had not seen them before, but I could identify them all—I picked Rutherford out of six or seven men, on the Thursday after—I suppose I was lying in the road about five minutes, and I kept looking at them all the while I was</p>

               <p>down—I suppose the house was 200 yards from where I was knocked down—the whole five of them went into the house—I can't say how many ran out at the back—I could not count them, they ran so fast—there were not ten—I think only five—all the men that were in the house ran out—the prisoners were the only two that were taken—there were some lamps in the street where I was knocked down—I followed the men when they ran away—I don't know whether they saw me or not—I lost 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and copper—I had given a shilling to the woman—it was about half a minute after that that I was knocked down—it was about a quarter of an hour after that I found a policeman—I took the first policeman I met to the house, and all the men ran out at the back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After I was knocked down, the men walked away, and I walked in a different direction, till they got about seventy yards off, and then I turned round and followed them.</p>

On the night of the 19th, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I saw the prosecutor in Hale Street, Deptford—he com<lb></lb>plained to me, and took me to 28, Stanhope Street—I knocked at the door—it was opened by a woman, and I saw a number of men rush out into the back yard—Parker was there—I seized him as he was getting over the fence—he struggled, and got away—he ran through the house, and I cap<lb></lb>tured him again—I saw Rutherford there—he got over the fence and got away—he threw several bricks at me—that was in the street, after I caught Parker—he followed me as I took Parker to the station—he threw the last brick at me close to the flour mills, and then ran away—it hit me on the right side—I was unable to take my duty for eleven days.</p>

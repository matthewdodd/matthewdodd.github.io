                  </hi>. I am a broker in South-place, Lower-road, Islington, which is about 100 or 200 yards from South-street. On Friday the 17th of March, about three o'clock, I was at the bottom of South-street, and saw the prisoner walking up and down the street—he went into the pro<lb></lb>secutor's gate, and stood at the door a minute or two—he then opened the door—I cannot say what with, I was not near enough to see—he went in, and shut the door—he remained in the house a few minutes, and then turned out again, pulled the door to, and looked up and down the street—he then went in again for a minute or so, and came out with a chimney<lb></lb>glass on his shoulder—he pulled the door to, and came down the street with the glass on his shoulder—I walked towards him, and met him, and said, "My man, where are you going to take this glass to?"—he replied, "I am going to take it to a street in Hackney-road"—I said, "Where did you bring it from?"—he said, "I brought it from Brooksby-street"—I laid hold of him by the shoulder, and said, "We will go back to Brooksby street with it"—we walked on together till we came to No. 25, South-street—I pushed open the gate, and went up to the door, and said, "Cannot you open that door?"—he said, "No, I cannot"—I said, "I think you can, you have undone it before"—he hesitated a little while, and I said, "You have got a key in your pocket that will undo it, I am certain"—he pulled a key out of his pocket, unlocked the door, and we went in—I did not stay there long—I came out again with him into the street—I turned my head round, and saw the constable at the bottom of the street—I beckoned to him—he came up, and I gave the prisoner in charge—I stopped to fasten the door while the constable took him—I kept the key—we took the prisoner and the glass to Islington station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Islington. On Friday afternoon, the 17th of March, at three o'clock, I was at the corner of South-street, and Beale beckoned to me—I went up to him at No. 25, and he gave the prisoner into my charge—I took him into the parlour of No. 25, searched him, and found three keys in one of his pockets, and another key in the street door—I said, "How could you think of coming into the house with these false keys?"—he said he did it out of distress, having a sick wife, and two small children, one only six months old—he pointed to the place where he had taken the glass from, over the mantel-shelf—he attempted to make a rescue at the corner of Popham-street—I searched him again at the station-house, and found two large skeleton keys in one pocket, and a turn-screw in another, and three large screws—I took the same glass before the Magistrate, and the prosecutor identified it—I went back to the house with the key I had taken out of the door, and I opened the door</p>

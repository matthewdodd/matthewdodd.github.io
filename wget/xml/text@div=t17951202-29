               <p>I am a sailor: I belonged to the Diana, when this affair happened; I know the prisoner Bassett; he is <rs id="t17951202-29-deflabel151" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17951202-29-defend385 t17951202-29-deflabel151"></join> to Mr. Bryant, a lighter-man; I was with the deceased all the day through; he was mate of the same vessel; we were about to shift our vessel from Glasgow wharf to Miller's wharf; there were two of the coal craft lying about the vessel, that we could not get clear of; Gerard, the mate, jumped over, and cut the craft adrift; there were three men in them; it was at night, and darkish, that I could not tell who they were: the three men came and shoved the mate down in the bottom of the coal craft.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time see either of the prisoners at the bar? - A. No; I could not discern them; we had a rope fast to the tier; the mate ran away towards the rope that our vessel was swinging by, to get away from them; they cut the rope, and the mate got it bent again; after they cut it, we got the ship Diana, hauled up a-breast of Miller's wharf, and then our mate came on board; and when we came to <placeName id="t17951202-29-crimeloc152">Miller's wharf</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17951202-29-crimeloc152" type="placeName" value="Miller's wharf"></interp>

               <p>Q. Are you able to tell the jury who those men were? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them make use of any expressions at the time? - A. Yes; I heard one of them say, the bugger is dead now.</p>
               <p>Court. They had taken him out of the water? - A. They were about getting him out at that time; I made answer, you have killed him among you.</p>
               <p>Court. They did take him out of the water? - A. Yes; they called to me to come and take him out, and I told them I was afraid they would serve me the same sance; I went down upon the craft afterwards, and saw the prisoner Basset; when I had hold of the mate's arm, and I spoke to him, and told him it was certainly him that had done it, he made no answer that I heard; but we were all in confusion getting the corpse away. When we got him out of the water, he was dead; what became of the prisoners, I don't know; I carried the corpse up to Mr. Nesbitt's.</p>
               <p>Upon his cross-examination, he said, it was counted a very ill-natured thing to fet each other's craft adrist; he said, the deceased was very seldom engaged in any quarrels; he had not had any quarrels till that night since he had been here, but that he had seen him wrangling sometimes; he said, they had got him out of the River before he got into the coal craft, and that it was so dark, he could not see the colour of their coals.</p>
               <p>- MITCHELL,</p>
               <p>A boy of thirteen years of age, was then called, and deposed, that it was so dark he could not see who the men were that were on board the coal craft.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. My Lord, I don't wish to press a case in which I cannot identity the persons.</p>

I saw both the prisoners that evening; the first thing was, I was walking along, and they asked me to go with them both; I told them I had a home of my own, and I asked them where did they think their home was; and they followed nine up to the entrance an Alley which is called Castle Alley; then they give me a sudden snatch, about two yards up the Alleys, I am sure I was forced up the Alley by intervals they had both a hold of me then he then seized hold of my left hand, and the either my light, and pinned both my arms down. Then a man came up, and clapped his hand upon my mouth, and stopped me from taking my breath. Then they held me in that way; I could not call out; the holding my mouth stopped my breath entirely. I was then held so until they drew the purse out of my pocket. The biggest of the prisoners, Sibley, drew the purse out of my pocket, with two one pound Bank of England notes in it, a duplicate of a watch, and about ten or eleven shillings in silver; there was a key also, in the breeches pocket were the purse was. It was very dark where they stood I know they and the same women by their talking to me and my answering them in the Highway. There was a lamp at the end of the passage, and in the Highstreet also. They then ran away, and when I recovered myself, I called stop thief, The man that had held my mouth bolted out of the passage. When I called out stop thief the watchman sprang his rattle, and the man and one of the prisoners were apprehended before I got out of the passage; that prisoner was Sibley. The other women was just by me when I went out, and I gave charge of them all; they were close together and was in the watchhouse when they were searched but I did not see my property.</p>

            . I am a watchman at Whitechapel, my stand is opposite Castle Alley. On the 31st of July at about half past eleven, I was at the corner of Reddich street, standing with my back against a door with my coat over my light, and I saw two women and a man ran over from the opposite side from Castle Alley; they ran accross the way in a very great hury; I heard the cry of stop thief, and I followed this party about twenty yards. The whole three name close out together, and the man attempted to cross the road again; with that I sprang my rattle; the man crossed the road, and the woman going straight on. By the assistance of an extra watchman that was going along, we took the whole three into custody. When I came close to them, the man attempted to cross the road, but we secured them. I pursued the man; the other watchman stopped the women. It was not three, minutes from the time step thief was called until they were all taken into custody; they were never out of my sight I had sight of the whole three until they were apprehended; I was present when they were searched and none of these things were found on them.</p>
               <p>JOHN BOUTLE. I am headborough of the parish of Whitechapel. I remember when the two prisoners were brought with the man to the watchhouse. The prosecutor charged them with this robbery. I snached them all three; I found nothing at all on these women nor did I find any thing on the man that relates so this charge, I found on him a watch-chain, a guinea in gold a three-shilling bank token one shilling and two sixpences.</p>
               <p>(It came out in the course of the trial that the bill of indictement; against the man spoken of as an accomplice with the prisoners, was thrown out by Grand Jury.)</p>
               <p>Timothy Root. Re-called. Did you tell, the Grand Jury that you believed that the man who was apprehended at the same time with the prisoners was the man who gagged you - A. I did tell them I believed so.</p>
               <p>Q. And do you now believe so - A. Yes, I know so.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 14, Pye-street, Westminster—I have been living with the prisoner as his wife for twelve months—I left him in consequence of going to the hospital for an accident I met with at Charing Cross—I came out a week before this occurred—I saw the prisoner when I came</p>

               <p>out—he promised to meet me at half-past 8 o'clock on the evening in question—I neglected to meet him—I met with a friend and got drinking—I was rather intoxicated, and I went home to go to bed—somebody who lodged in the house knocked at the door and asked for a light—that was about half-past 1 or 2 o'clock, I think, but I cannot say exactly—my room is the back parlour—I thought I heard the prisoner's footsteps, and I said, "Here is Jim coming, come in"—I thought be would strike me, seeing me drinking with this man—the man had a bottle of gin in his pocket—I said to him, "Come in," and blew the candle out—I had been drinking with him from half-past 8 in the evening, till that time—it was the same person that knocked at the door for the light—I told him to come in and fasten the door—the prisoner asked me to open it—I did not take any notice—he said, "Sarah; I know you are indoors; if you don't open it, I'll burst it open"—he did burst it open, and ran over to the fire-place, and took up something and struck me in the arm—he also struck me on my head—I cannot tell whether I struck him or not—I ran away as well as I could—I did not see any knife—there was a short-bladed knife in the room which I had used in having my supper—I cannot say whether I left that on the bed, or where it was—I was taken to the infirmary.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of St. Margaret's workhouse—I saw the prosecutrix there on the Thursday afternoon—she was exceedingly exhausted, apparently from loss of blood—she had a wound on the left side of her head—it had been bound up by the medical man at the hospital, and I did not disturb it that day; she also had a wound about an inch and a half in length on the right arm, and a small wound on the left arm, also a very large graze on the left arm as if from a fight; and she was bruised consi<lb></lb>derably about the back and lower part of the person—the wound on the arm was an incised wound, and that on the ear also—it must have been done by some sharp instrument—after she had been in the hospital two or three days she lost a very large quantity of blood from the lower part of her person—that was partly the result of the bruising—the incised wound was not a deep wound, nor that on the ear either—part of the ear was cut completely through.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's sister—about a quarter-past 3 o'clock on this morning, the prisoner knocked at my door and said he wanted to speak to me—he told me he had been home, that my sister was at home, and that there was somebody there that had a poker in his hand, and he wrenched the poker out of his hand—I asked if he had struck her with it—he said, "You will see her to-morrow morning, and she is a perfect object."</p>

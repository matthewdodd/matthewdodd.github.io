On Saturday, the 16th of February, 1822, at eight o'clock in the evening, I left the building, and went in doors to supper, having locked the door. I returned in about an hour and twenty minutes, and found a square of glass broken from the front window, and the screw which held the sashes together taken out; the window had been opened: I found my box forced open, and a great coat, two coatees, and an eye-glass taken - four calico shirts and other things were gone, but I did not miss them for six months, as I only wear them in the summer. I found a garden ladder against the wall; they had escaped out at a back door, which had marks of a chisel on it. On the Monday following Clarkson produced my things to me.</p>

            . I am private watchman to Sir William Curtis. In February, 1822, I belonged to the Police. I was going on duty with my brother officer, on the 18th, and in consequence of information from the prisoner's brother, I watched a house in East Barnet-lane, about a mile and a half from the prosecutrix's, and about six or seven o'clock in the morning I saw three men and two women come out of the house, and go up the lane together; we stopped them, and asked what they had in their bundles; the prisoner had a bundle, and said it was working clothes - we took them off his back, and he immediately ran away; the other two were secured: one of them had a pump. I knew the prisoner before - he is a labourer, lived in East Barnet-lane, and worked in brick-fields. Harland claimed the bundles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You met five persons in company? A. Yes; they did not see us till they came up to us: all three dropped their bundles, and the prisoner ran off; I saw his face for full two minutes, and saw him before they came up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has he been at home since? A. Not that I have heard - I have not inquired for him. I swear positively to him - he had a short jacket and breeches on. I did not see him again till the 17th of last May. My brother officer has left the duty, and I do not know where to find him.</p>

            . I am an officer of the County-Court, at Uxbridge. On the 16th of May Clarkson and an officer came to Uxbridge; Clarkson gave me a full description of the prisoner, as being five feet five inches high, light hair, sandy whiskers, rather freckled in the face, and had been to sea. He was apprehended on the 17th; he has been about Uxbridge for the last two years.</p>

I ran after him as hard as I could down Shoreditch, calling Police! and calling out that I was robbed - he gained ground on me, and turned up Church-street; I pursued him thirty or forty yards - I was rather confused, and do not know his features; but the appearance of his person and clothes were the same - he was never lost sight of, though I lost sight of him; he was taken in a few minutes afterwards - I saw my watch at the station-house, and the prisoner was there also; he only staggered against me, and laid hold of me - he did not strike me before he got the watch; he did it so momentarily that I had no apprehension of it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

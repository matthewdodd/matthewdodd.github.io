                  </hi>I live in Retreat-place, Water-lane, Hackney—I am a cow-keeper. The prisoner is a sweep—on the 4th of June, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was at the Peacock public-house, at Homerton—the prisoner was there—the persons there were playing at skittles—there was a quarrel between the prisoner and a young man of the name of Henry Potter—they fought—they had five or six rounds—some one on the ground said Palmer had drawn his knife, and I said they should not fight any more—I merely said so in the ground—Palmer was within hearing of it—I said if they liked to fight they might, but I would not have any foul play—I said I would bet Potter to fight him for 5<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>, if they liked to fight fair—the fight was then over, and Potter sat down on the bench—I was standing by the side of the ground, and in the course of three or four minutes I received a blow from the prisoner in the left eye—he had some knife or other sharp instrument in his hand, but I cannot say what, as I did not see it—I did not hear him say any thing—I did not think I was going to receive the blow, it came so unawares to me—the blood came from the wound—I put my hand to my eye, went into the wash-house, and washed it—Potter came into the wash-house, and asked me what was the matter—I held up my head, he saw my eye, and ran out into the ground to see whether the prisoner was there—some one bad taken the prisoner out of the ground—when✗ he struck me he came in front of me—they got some warm water to bathe my eye, and some one</p>

                  </hi>I live at Homerton. I am a member of the College of Surgeons at Edinburgh, and Apothecaries' Hall. On the 4th of June I was called to the Peacock public-house about eleven o'clock at night—Mr. Stapler was bathing his left-eye—I found the lower eye-lid was cut, and the integuments and the upper part of the eye very much swollen—the pupil was very much dilated, and quite insensible to light—it appeared to have bled a great deal—I directed him to come to my sur<lb></lb>gery, and there I dressed his eye—he has been under my care ever since—I have no doubt but that he has lost the sight of his eye for life—I attri<lb></lb>bute that more to the blow than to the cut—I saw a slight scar above the brow of the same eye—the wound on the lower eye-lid was in my judg<lb></lb>ment occasioned by a knife or some sharp instrument—I have seen the same sort of cuts occasioned by falling against some sharp instrument or against the edge of a chair—I do not think such a cut would be occasioned by a fist or by the feet.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. What was the depth of it? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. It might be about a quarter of an inch or deeper at the upper part—I have seen clean cuts made with the fist on the cheek, but not on the eye, because the parts about the eye are more protected—I thought at one time that the eye-ball had been penetrated by the knife, but I find it had not—the eye exhibited marks of having received a blow from some such thing as a fist, and a very heavy blow it must have been—it is barely possible that this cut might have been inflicted by the nail of the man's thumb.</p>

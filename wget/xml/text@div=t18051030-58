               <p>Q. In the beginning of October last did the prisoner at the bar make any application to you? - A. He came to me on the 3d of October.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300061"></xptr>Q. What appearance had he? - A. He had the appearance, in language, as well as outward appearance, of being what he wished to appear to be; he described himself to be the son of an opulent West-India planter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he dressed like a gentleman? - A. He was; he spoke bad English; he then told me that since his arrival in town, he had dined with some friends of mine, and amongst others mentioned the name of Sir 
               <persName id="t18051030-58-person686">

            ; he likewise named another gentleman who dined there as well as him, and that they spoke very favourably of me, that they had many of them bought horses of me, and they had proved all to be what I had said, that he was in want of horses, and would be obliged to me if I would exert myself to suit him; that he should want as many as six horses, but that his present anxiety was for me to get him a pair of the finest horses I could produce; he said money was no object, he wanted them for the purpose of making a present to his father for the goodness he had received from him; these he was extremely anxious to have procured as soon as possible; with regard to himself, he would stay till he had been served for his father, but that he should want four of the same description for himself; I said I was obliged to my friends for recommending me; and that such an order for them to be so particularly good as he described, perhaps could not be done so soon as he expected; I mentioned that, that he might not think I was inactive; he seemed very much pleased that I paid so much attention to him; he he then said, putting a card into my hands at the time, that he had taken an accompting-house for the purpose of transacting business, in Savage-gardens, Crutched-friars; it was a very fine card; he then told me that he had lodgings at the West end of the town and after so long a passage as he had, he felt it extremely inconvenient to walk backwards and forwards every day, that would I, in the mean time, before I served him with the horses he had mentioned, lend him two horses, one for himself, and one for his servant. Upon the face of his story, I said yes; I let him have a bay mare, which I valued at forty guineas, and a bay gelding for his servant to ride, which I valued at twenty-five guineas; he then told me if I could have them ready by four o'clock in the afternoon, when he came from Change, it would answer his purpose; and at four o'clock in the afternoon a person calling himself his servant, called for the horse and mare, to whom I delivered them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that person call again the next day to bring the horse and mare to bait? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing that passed between you and him, did you go, while the horse and mare were baiting, to Savage-gardens? - A. I did; I went into the house for the purpose of satisfying myself whether he was the man he represented himself to be; I found it was a respectable good house; when I went in there was a tailor measuring him for cloaths, and a bootmaker waiting to measure him for boots; and there was another, a very respectable tradesman waiting there, and furniture of all sorts was coming into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no occasion for going into all this, I wish to be confined by rules of law, having seen all this you spoke to Mr. Wright? - A. I felt hurt at my going there and intruding myself, and when I was satisfied I told him the reason of my calling on him was, I thought I should be ready to shew him such horses sooner than I expected; I went away fully satisfied; this was on the 4th of October; I think they called once more on me to bait; it was the next day or the day after.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see your horse and mare again? - A. I think it was about the 14th of October; afterwards the horse and mare were brought to my stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Mr. Simpson before they were brought to the stable? - A. I had; I saw him on the 14th; I had the same horse and mare returned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Though there is an anxiety that every person giving evidence should be heard, yet, at the same time, public convenience requires that we should not always state the whole in the hearing of an indiscriminating audience, though there are some who come for good purposes, at the same time, I certainly shall not state all the reasons and distinctions of the law which may enable persons like the defendant to go on in such iniquitous practices unpunished, or with less punishment than the crime deserves. There is something in the proofs of this case which, perhaps, might encourage base minds. I think it much more convenient to stop here, rather than such mischievous minds should be enabled to practise much more mischief.</p>
               <p>Court. The laws of felony are so very nice that we would not wish an indiscriminating audience just to observe the brink of felony, by shewing where the lines lay; I was aware that the learned Counsel himself, knowing, as he does perfectly well, the law, that in his own opinion the case could not be brought within the pale of the law, it was necessary to have the evidence adduced, to form a judgment. It seems to me that a felony is not made out; at the same time it appears to me that the prisoner is a bad man. It is our duty to see that the strict line of the law should be observed by us; the Judge is to protect the prisoner as well as the public. I can only add, that the facts made out by the story of Mr. White does not come within that nice discrimination of the law, which, perhaps, if I was to state to you those nice distinctions,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300062"></xptr>before Monday morning there would be many more depredations upon the public.</p>

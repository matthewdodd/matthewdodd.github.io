               <p>John Thomas. About 9 at Night, the Prisoners came to my Master's House, and going into the back Yard; they call'd for a Tankard of Beer. It being, as I thought, too cold to sit in the Yard, I ask'd them, If they would not go into a Room? But they said, No; and so I carry'd a Silver Tankard to them in the Yard, and was going to fill a Pint for another Customer ; but was not got down more than three or four of the Cellar Stairs, when I heard a Noise in the Passage, upon which I step'd up again, and found the Prisoner Cave there; he was going out, but had stumbled in the Dark against some Tobacco-Boxes which were in the Passage. I stopp'd him for the Reckoning, as thinking he was going off without paying. He said , he had not paid, but his Friend was behind. My fellow Servant,

            , call'd to me, and said, May be he has got the Tankard ! Upon which, I ask'd Cave, What he had got under his Coat? He said, Nothing; but feeling about him, I found the Tankard, and call'd my Master to take care of him, while I went to secure the other Prisoner, Turner, who was endeavouring to get away backwards, for we have a back Door into Fetter-Lane, but it happen'd to be fast; and so I seiz'd him, and brought him to my Master, who ask'd him, why he went to run away? And he said, he was afraid of Trouble; but that he had no Acquaintance with Cave, any farther than that he had seen him once before, at Reading-Fair, and met him again accidentally, and so came to drink with him.</p>
               <p>Cave. I went to the Cellar-Head , to deliver the Tankard safe to the Man that brought it to us ; and desir'd him to give me Change for the Reckoning.</p>
               <p>J. Thomas. He was got two Yards beyond the Cellar-Head, and instead of offering to deliver the Tankard, he deny'd that he had it when I charged him with it.</p>
               <p>Turner. I had seen Cave once at Reading-Fair,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173310100003"></xptr> and meeting him again by Temple-Bar, we went to drink together, and the Tankard being empty, he said he'd take care and deliver it to the Man we had it from. I knew nothing but that he was an honest Man, and therefore thought he intended to do as he said. The Jury <rs id="t17331010-1-verdict5" type="verdictDescription">

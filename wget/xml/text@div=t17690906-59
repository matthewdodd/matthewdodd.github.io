The maid got up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060037"></xptr> first in the morning, went down, but came up in a great hurry, and said, For God's sake get up, the house is broke open. I got up and ran down. This was about half an hour after five. I found my bureau in the back parlour broke open, and the window-shutter of the fore parlour broke open, where the thieves got in. All the rings that Mrs. Gibson had in the back parlour were gone, and a gold watch case, all my plate, and two five-guinea pieces, with several medals, and a great many other things were gone. All the things mentioned in the indictment were taken away. I never saw any of the things again, but the two five-guinea pieces; they were found where the prisoners used day and night, as I am informed.</p>

I got up about half an hour after five, and found the fore parlour open. The sash was up, the shutters were open, and the bolt was wrenched and bent back. There were tallow candle droppings all about the floor. I ran up stairs, and desired my master to get up. He came down. We found the beauset broke open, and all the plate gone.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to give the information?</p>
               <p>Graham. They had got some money, and I had not what I should have of it, so I went and gave the information. I was in the street at the time this robbery was done, to see if any body came.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the plate?</p>
               <p>Graham. I do not know. I never disposed of any of it. I only saw the gold watch case, and three or four rings. I saw some of the money. There was a quantity of gold, seventeen guineas, and two large pieces; I heard say they were two five-guinea pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with them?</p>
               <p>Graham. Not above a month of six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. What business do they follow?</p>
               <p>Graham. I do not know what either of them follow.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Graham. I am a cabinet maker.</p>
               <p>Q. What share had you of the money of this robbery?</p>
               <p>Graham. I believe I had not above nine guineas of it. My quarrel was not about this robbery, it was about another.</p>

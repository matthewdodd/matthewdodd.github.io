            . I am a watchman, of North-end, Fulham. On the 30th of August, just after four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner at North-end, with a barrow loaded with two sacks and a basket; I asked him if he was going to market - he said No; I asked what the sack contained, he said half a bushel of onions and two bushels of potatoes: he left me, and in consequence of what my fellow-watchman Jenkinson said, I placed myself in the road, where I thought the prisoner would pass - he came that way; I asked him about the sacks, he said he had a few potatoes; Jenkinson came up; we searched the sacks, and they contained apples and pears, no onions nor potatoes; there was upwards of seven dozen peaches in the barrow - he was about a half a mile from Aylesbury's premises.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hammersmith. On the 30th of August. I saw the prisoner in custody; I took off his shoes and went to Mr. Aylesbury's garden, and saw footmarks just under the peach and appletrees; I compared the shoes with the footmarks, they corresponded exactly: next morning I got the peach stems from Mr. Aylesbury, and compared them with the parts of the tree; the fruit appeared to be knocked off, and it corresponded; I have one here.</p>

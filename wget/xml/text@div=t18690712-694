                  </hi>. I am a solicitor's clerk, and live at 92, Elsted Street, Wandsworth—on 1st July, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was going home—when I got into Rodney Road, the three prisoners came behind me—I was seized by the throat by the little prisoner and thrown on the ground—we had a struggle, and the police came to my rescue and seized Edwards and Smith, and I believe saved my life—I had money in my pocket, and I felt a hand there—I was much hurt, and am suffering still—I have no doubt about the prisoners, but Edwards was not so near to me as the others—when I first saw him he was about six paces from me, he did not come nearer at any time—they both had white handkerchiefs on.</p>

About 1.30, on 2nd July, I was in Rodney Road, and Waldron and another man, with a white handkerchief round his neck, came up to me—when they saw me they turned and went down Dale Street—I met two constables and gave them instructions—shortly afterwards I heard a scuffle at the bottom of Dale Street, and saw the constables I had been speaking to with Waldron and Edwards, in custody—I took Edwards from him—Smith stood close by his side—I called a constable, who took him—I asked Smith what he was doing there—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "I think you are concerned in the attack upon this man"—he said, "I saw them scuffling, but I never touched them—Edwards said, "I helped him up, and told him he had better go away, as he had lost no money."</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Great Leonard-street, and am in the employ of James Patten, a carman, of 29, Windmill-street, Finsbury—in the afternoon of 30th July, the prisoner came to my master's and said he wanted a brick-fart, to cart some timber from Cannon-street to the Curtain-road for Mr. Rawlins, his uncle, or father—he brought a horse with him, and I allowed him to take one of my master's carts and harness—he did not bring it back—I afterwards saw it in Mr. Austin's, possession—it was worth 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On the 10th of December, at night, my wife heard a noise, and awaked me about two; she said she thought somebody had got into the house; I thought it was the horses in the stable, and we took no notice of it; but coming down in the morning, we found the house was broke open: all was safe when we went to bed. They had broke in at the parlour window; the shutter was broke open, the screw that was to keep the sash down was forced up and bent: my bar was broke, and a box of halfpence taken away. I missed six silver spoons, a pound of tea, a bottle of gin, a red leather trunk, and some table linen. I never got any of my things again but the trunk. I never saw the prisoners till I saw them now. The trunk and an iron crow, which they left in the bar, are here. (Produced in court). The crow about fourteen inches long. The trunk was left in the street, about three or four doors from my house.</p>

On the 14th of December my window shutters were wrenched open, and the sash put up. I had seen it was fast over night about ten, when I went to bed. My wife was alarmed by the noise of breaking the beaufet between one and two in the night, in the lower parlour fronting the street, close by the window: we lay, in the back parlour. She got out of bed and left me asleep. She opened the door and there saw a man in the fore parlour. He d - d her, and said he would blow her brains out; upon which I awaked, and came out into that parlour, but he was gone. I found my bureau and book-case open, which were shut over night, but not locked; all the drawers were taken out: they had taken away a silver watch, capped, and jewel, a coral, set in silver, two guineas, a pair of knee-buckles. I found a pistol, an iron crow, and a chissel lying in the window. (Produced in court).</p>
               <p>Mary, his wife, gave the same account; but had so slight a sight of the man she did not know him.</p>

               <p>Q. How could you come at the shutters, there being rails?</p>
               <p>Pearce. We reached over the rails with our iron crows. After I was in, Underwood handed Wharton in. I struck a light, and Underwood put the shutters to. We took a silver watch, that hung over the chimney-piece. I took two guineas in gold in a metal box; a child's coral, and a pair of knee-buckles; and, in breaking open the beaufet, we heard a noise in the back parlour, and made our escape out at the window, and left an iron crow, a chissel and pistol, in the house. We both ran home with the things we had got, and Underwood made away with them. When the door was opening I ran away first; Wharton said something about d - ning, but I was out. The woman said hey hey, or something like it. We dropped the candle, I believe, in the room.</p>

On Saturday the 19th of May instant, I kept my door open till pretty near twelve at night; (as my business runs pretty late on Saturday nights) then I bolted and locked my door, and fastened my window shutters; after that my wife and I were sitting by the fire side till between twelve and one: we heard the window light breaking; that was the glass over the door. I then judged my house was going to be attacked; I said to my wife, If my house is attacked, we had better wait till they enter, for may be they may, at another time attack us, when we are not so properly prepared. I proposed to stand it till they entered: we retired from the shop into the parlour; then I heard them picking the glass out of the frame, and it was falling down piece after piece. I pulled off my shoes, and went up stairs and brought down my musket and sword; I had kept my piece loaded sometime; as several houses near me had been broke open lately, I judged they would soon attack me. I put a little fresh powder in the pan, and rubbed the hammer. After watching some time, and hearing pieces of glass still falling, I heard, about one o'clock, a brushing sort of a noise; I judged they were then entering into the house. I said I believed they were then come in. I stood watching, with my parlour door in my hand. I had an inward door to prevent people from coming into the shop; that was double locked. I said, I am sure he is in, for I hear him move backwards and forwards in the passage. I had double locked the passage door. I presented my piece low to hit his legs, not to kill him. I snapped it, but it did not go off; finding that, I pricked him with my sword in his left arm.</p>
               <p>Q. How had he got in?</p>
               <p>Andrews. He got in at the fan light over the door. He informed me afterwards they put him in with his feet foremost. My wife had the candle, but, upon my opening the door, I knocked it out of her hand. The prisoner, finding my sword had pricked him, surrendered, and said he would tell me all he knew. I got him in my arms and held him fast. My wife went out at the back door and called murder, thieves! and some neighbours came: Mr. Gosset came to the door, and said, Let me in; and after that came another neighbour: there came in a man, a stranger, that I did not like. As soon as a light came, I heard something fall, which was this snuff-box, (producing one, with tinder in it) which I believe was put in over the door. I asked the prisoner what he would discover, and how long he had been in the gang; he said twelve months, or upwards. I asked him how many there were of the gang; he said fourteen or fifteen; I asked where they resorted; he said upon Salt-petre-bank; I asked him how many were in the gang that attacked my house; he said four besides himself. When Mr. Gosset and Mr. Stockbridge were come in, I asked these questions again, and then he gave the same answers. I thought it necessary to be upon him as soon as ever he was in; had I given him time to have opened the door, the rest might have come in, and been too powerful for me.</p>

Here, my cock, says I, take this, so he took it; then directly he demanded my watch, put his hand in my pocket, and pulled it out; he clapped his hand in this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040056"></xptr> pocket, and said, What have you here? says I, it is a pen and ink, that I settle my accounts with; says I, My cock, take this, and mind and cast your accounts up against to-morrow morning; I asked him if he would have it, and he said no, and I said, I wish you a good night; it was a fine moon-shine night, as clear as day-light.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they long enough with you for you to be able to distinguish them exactly? - Yes, Collins had a crape about his face, about his nose, the other had nothing.</p>
               <p>Are you positively sure of the two men? Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Why you say Collins had a crape on his head? - Yes, but just as he was going away from me the crape sell off; I could swear to him if it was only by his speech and person.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed then? - With a light-coloured coat and waistcoat, and a light-coloured great coat over it, with flapped hat.</p>
               <p>He never was nearer to you than the horse? - I sat on the tail of my cart, he came near to me, I could swear to him by his speech and his person; it is hard swearing to people, but he is the man, and the other I will swear to.</p>
               <p>Jury. Pray do you say that the crape fell off his face? - Yes, just as he was drawing round to get upon his horse.</p>
               <p>Now as to the other who had not the crape, you say you have no doubt? - Not the least in the world, he was dressed in rather a light-coloured coat, and one about the same colour underneath it; I did not take particular notice of his hat; they did not stay with me above three minutes, they were in a great hurry to get away.</p>
               <p>Was this in an open road where you had all the benefit of the moon, because the moon does not shine upon some roads that are open? - The moon shone bright.</p>
               <p>Did the moon shine on their faces or on yours? - I was on the side that was the lightest a good deal; the prisoners were taken up last Tuesday was se'nnight, I gave information that same night; if I could have got a horse I would have tried to have taken them myself; I knew them immediately when I saw them again, I fixed on them; there was another with them when they came to be examined.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Collins's counsel. There were three together when you came to examine, and so you took two out of the three? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Nobody else was present? - No.</p>
               <p>What did the people say at the office? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Did not they give you a little hint? - No, only asked me whether that was not my watch.</p>
               <p>What lane is it? - It is a road that turns up to the Duke of Leeds, and the other turns up to a wood.</p>
               <p>A little lane, ha? - Aye.</p>
               <p>Trees of each side set, is not there? - Aye.</p>
               <p>So it was in that lane you was robbed? - No, I was six or seven yards beyond it, I was in the high road.</p>
               <p>Trees there of each side, is not there? - Yes, little low pollard trees, and they stopped me just against the first pollard.</p>
               <p>Had the man that got off his mare a round hat or a flapped hat? - Mine is a tilted cart, he stood below me, close to me.</p>
               <p>He did not look you up in the face? - Once or twice.</p>
               <p>That was all the time you had an opportunity of seeing his face? - Only just as he was getting on the horse.</p>
               <p>At that time he had a crape? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which had the crape? - This here Collins.</p>
               <p>How high over his mouth? - As far as his nose.</p>
               <p>Then you could only see his chin? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is the only opportunity you had of observing him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And this not above three minutes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You should be cautious; you see here the whole robbery was not above three minutes, the man might see your face, but you could not see his with a flapped hat and a crape over his eyes and nose? - I could only see his chin.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In a light cloth coat buttoned, and waistcoat and great coat.</p>
               <p>All light-colours. - Yes.</p>
               <p>Nothing remarkable in the coat? - Like a low country farmer.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did you find any thing on his person? - I did not search his person.</p>
               <p>I wonder at that too. - Mackmanus searched him.</p>

               <p>He lives there, and has a number of men working there? - I saw one at work; I took the horse out of the stable, which the gentleman that was robbed said was his; the horse is in custody.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at that watch Mr. Shadbold. - It is my watch, I will swear to it; I have had it this 14 or 15 years.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Collins. This man Thorpe, came to my house about half an hour before, I asked him to dinner: I had a hackney coach, and I found the pistols tied up in a bundle, and a pair of gloves, and several little things in the coach: this man bought a horse on Friday, at market, and he asked me to let him stand in my stable.</p>

Last Monday, about six o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my shop and asked me for some scrapings of butter; I told her I had none; then she asked me for half a quartern of sixpenny butter; I served her; she gave me three farthings; then she asked me for some bits of cheese; I gave her some; then she asked for a halfpenny worth of cheese; I turned my back to her for it, in the mean time she concealed a cheese under her cloak, and laid down a halfpenny, and was going out of the shop; my servant said, What is that she has got? I looked on the pile near where she stood, and missed a cheese: I went out after her, and found the cheese under her cloak; I brought her and the cheese back into the shop.</p>

               <p>on 22d November, about half-past 5 o'clock, I was with my sister in Holborn—I had a chain round my neck with a locket to it worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner pulled my chain and broke it—I heard it begin to crack—I held him, called police, and gave him in custody.</p>

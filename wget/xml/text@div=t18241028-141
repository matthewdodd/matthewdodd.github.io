            . I am a shopman to Mr. Aldridge, pawnbroker, Orange-street, Bloomsbury. On the 21st of October, about half-past six or seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner brought this cloak to our shop - ! asked where he got it, he said, from Mr. Jones, of No. 10, Lamb's Conduit-street. I am confident of his person - I communicated my suspicions privately to Mr. Aldridge, who came out and questioned him, and asked if he had any objection to his going with him, he said</p>
               <p>"Oh! it is all right." Mr. Aldridge said," I do not think it is, and you shall go;" he immediately darted out of the box and ran away. I pursued and overtook him at the corner of Theobalds-road; he said</p>
               <p>"There is no occasion to trouble you about this, let this lad (meaning my apprentice) go with me." I said</p>
               <p>"Very well let the boy go;" but I followed at a distance; he went in a contrary direction, and took him up a court; he then began to run - I followed; he went up a ladder, but finding himself closely pursued came down and ran into Holborn, where I collared him, and gave him in charge - I am certain he is the man. I only lost sight of him in turning the corner; he had asked for 1 l. on the cloak, and said</p>
               <p>"Is it worth that." I said Yes, more; he said</p>
               <p>"Well, give me 2 l." I thought it worth between 7 l. and 10 l., but understand it is only worth 6 l. I would have lent 4 l. on it.</p>

            . It is mine, and is quite new - it cost me five guineas - I should have asked 6 l. or six guineas for it. I have enquired about the prisoner, and believe he is rather weak in intellect. I know his father well, and have learned that when nine years old, a fall from a horse affected him very seriously, and he has been able to learn nothing. I understand he is the dupe of a gang of rogues who set him to plunder shops, while they share the profit of it. I believe he really is weak in intellect; his father who has seven children does not wish him to be at liberty.</p>

            . I live in Bucklersbury. On Sunday evening, the 14th of October, about a quarter to ten o'clock, I was alone, coming from Sherbourne-lane, through <placeName id="t18321018-65-crimeloc371">Ball-alley</placeName>

I cannot run, having the rheumatism, but in about three minutes I saw the prisoner in custody, and Skinner produced my watch, with the glass broken.</p>
               <p>Cross-exmained by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it a dark night? A. Yes; there is a bit of a gas-lamp there - I was not altogether sober; I had drank a little elder wine and a little gin - I might take four or five small glasses of gin, and about a pot of beer.</p>

            . I am waiter at a tavern in Swithin's-lane, which this alley comes into. I was standing at master's door, which is by the side of the alley, and saw the prisoner standing before Warner; what he took from him I cannot tell, but I saw him run away, and Warner hallooed out Stop thief! he turned down George-street, which is opposite - a watchman there made him turn back; I caught him in my hands, and while I held him I saw him throw the watch down - we had a scuffle; I fell, and he got away - I took the watch up, and the watchman, who was about one hundred yards off, secured him; I am certain he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was a dark night? A. Yes, but there was a gas-lamp right opposite where it was done- I did not lose sight of him at all till he was re-taken, except for a moment while I was down; the prosecutor's face and the prisoner's back were towards me at the time of the robbery; I was near a light when I fell - we scuffled for four or five minutes, but the watchman is a very old man, and could hardly walk; the prisoner saw him, and then turned back - it was not him who took him; he was about thirty yards from the end of the court at the time; the prisoner had a green sparrow-tailed coat, which was buttoned; I could see the colour of his coat when I was in front of him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any other person near the prosecutor? A. No, I saw nobody but those two.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was in Oxfordcourt, leading to Cannon-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I ran, and saw the prisoner run by, and several pursuing him, calling Stop thief! I followed him one hundred or one hundred and fifty yards, and stopped him; Skinner did not see him that night, that I am aware of - he spoke positively to him at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were other persons running? A. Three or four - it was a dark night; he was ahead of all the rest that I could see - he might be following some body, but it is not very likely.</p>

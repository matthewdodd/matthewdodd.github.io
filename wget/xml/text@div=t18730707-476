I am a paperhanger, of 11, Meadow Place, South Lambeth Road—I let out two rooms in lodgings—the prisoner called on 1st May, about 7 p. m., and my wife called me up and said that the prisoner required board and lodging—I said that I should require a reference or a week or two's rent in advance, and asked him about his having no luggage—he said my luggage is coming in the morning; I have just arrived from India, and hold a situation in the India Office, and at 20, Great George Street, Westminster—upon the faith of that I let him have board and lodging—he stayed till 31st May, when I gave him in charge—he blackguarded me most furiously when I asked for my money—the rent was 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and my wife supplied him with food—he assigned various reasons for not paying, that the gentleman at the office had got the gout, and that he had been so long away that they did not recognise him at the office—I thought he was a swindler and gave him in charge, for he took away from me what my children and I wanted.</p>

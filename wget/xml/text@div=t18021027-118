               <p>Q. Do you both occupy the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And both live in it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other partner? - A. No; I sleep in the one-pair of stairs: On the 10th of October, about one in the morning, my wife waked me, saying, there was a noise up stairs; I jumped up in the bed, and listened, I heard some person walking without shoes over my heard; I heard a watchman's rattle spring in the street at the same time; I immediately jumped out of bed, and went to the window of the front room; I then opened the window, looked out, and asked what was the matter; the watchman said, there is a ladder; I looked down, and saw a ladder like a lamplighter's ladder, upon the leads of the shop window; the ladder reached to the two-pair of stairs window; my wife said, they were making their escape backwards; I learned that somebody had jumped out of the two-pair of stairs window backwards; I then took down one of the pistols from the mantle piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it loaded? - A. Yes; I lifted up the fash of my bed-room window, which he had passed by; I put out a pistol with intent to fire, but did not see any body, the pistol missed fire; I then shut down the window again, and took down the other pistol; I then went to the window of the front room, got out upon the leads, and took down the ladder; I put it down to the watchmen, and desired some of them to come up that ladder; two came up into the front dining-room on the same floor that I sleep on; I told them to follow me up stairs; they followed me up into the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the room where you heard somebody walking, the warehouse? - A. Yes, both back and front; we then went up into the garnet, but we could not find any body; we then went down stairs, and I let in another watchman, and opened the yard door, and told them I was sure we should find one there; I then saw the prisoner at the bar lying on the ground; I presented a pistol at him, and told him, if he did not tell me where the rest were, I would blow his brans out; the pistol being full cocked, went off by accident.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mean to shoot him, when you had him in your power? - A. No; it was quite by accident; the flags entered the wall, about three inches above his head; the powder searched hisforehead a little, and he put his hand to his face, he cried out, O Lord, O'Lord; I was afraid I had shot him, but when the smoke went on one side, I saw I had not; he desired the watchman to take him to the watch-house; he complained that his arm was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. That appeared to be so, did it? - A. No, his shoulder was wrenched; he had jumped from the two-pair of stairs window, which is between 20 and 30 feet from the ground, and he had fell upon the gutter at my bed-room window, and forced the holdfast out; his arm was not broke, but he was very much hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the ladder long enough to get upon the leads? - A. Yes; and then from the position of the ladder, he must have assisted himself by the ball irons; the prisoner told me he had brought the ladder from Lord John Cavendish's, near Vigo-lane; there were two ladders locked together, and he had picked the lock, and brought it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that your front two-pair of stairs window was shut down? - A. It was shut down within six or eight inches; it is left open, because the moth is apt to breed quick; but if there is air, they don't breed so quick.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen it? - A. I was in the warehouse sending some goods down the well after eleven o'clock that night.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are positive that at that time it was down within six or eight inches? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any property? - A. I found eleven gowns removed from the rack in the twopair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these gowns had been upon the rack the night before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they lying? - A. There was one gown open on the floor, and the other ten were upon it, ready to tie up.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from where you had left them? - A. About a yard and a half; they were the bottom her in the rack, it was quite full, and they were all pulled out.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not have pulled out that parcel yourself the night before, without having known it? - A. No; one of the gowns was opened, the ticket taken off, and the other ten laid upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of those things? - A. The officer has got them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't with to give the Court any further trouble, I am guilty of the fact.</p>

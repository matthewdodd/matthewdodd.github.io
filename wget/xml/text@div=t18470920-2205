                  </hi> I lived with the prisoner—I left him last Friday three weeks—on the Saturday week after that, I went to his lodging, with Sarah Newley, to get my things—Mrs. Hablett was there—I asked her where my husband was—she made use of improper words, and told me he was no husband of mine—that was true—she went away, and fetched the prisoner—I was in doors, with Mrs. Newley, when he came—he told me to open the door—I did so, and he directly knocked me down with his fist—I had not done anything—he went out—Mrs. Hablett told him to go in, and serve me worse, and not let me stay there—he came and knocked me down again—when I came to myself I felt blood trickling down my face, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner with the tongs in his hand—I do not know where he got them from—there was a fireplace in the room—I went on my knees, and begged for mercy—he said he would finish me at once, and struck me across the loins</p>

                  </hi> I live in Union-court, East-lane, Greenwich. I went with Mrs. Northorn—she put her hand on the knob of the prisoner's door and it came open—it was not locked—the prisoner came—they had lived together as man and wife for a fortnight or three weeks—he said she had no business there—she said her things were there, and she wanted them—he hit her directly—she hit him—he knocked her down—I saw the tongs in her hand—I did not see her strike him with them—I got away, and did not see him strike her, as I had a young child with me—she got up the first time she was knocked down—when she got up he hit her, and she hit him again—she did not hit him before he got the tongs that I know of—I saw them <hi rend="italic">punch</hi> one another before I saw him with the tongs—I went away, and left her on the ground—he had the tongs in his hand then, but if he hit her with them it was after I went.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 151.) On Saturday evening, at eight o'clock, I went to this house, and found Mrs. Northorn sitting on a chair, and some man washing her face with a sponge and water—she had two wounds over her eye—I took the prisoner, and asked him how he came to ill-use her in that way—he said, "It serves her right, the b----y wh----; I wish I had killed her"—she said at the station he had struck her with the tongs, but did not particularly say whether he hit her on the eye with them—he said nothing—he was perfectly sober—I went to the house, and found the tongs smeared with blood, and some hair adhering to one end of them.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, in High-street, poplar. I was called, and found Mrs. Northorn in a very excited state, bleeding from a wound in the forehead—there were other contusions about her body—I believe these tongs would produce what I saw, and also the wound on the eye—one blow with them would make the two wounds—each finger of the tongs would make one—the wounds were only an inch apart.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that Mrs. Northorn had burat his door open, and refused to go out; that on his attempting to put her out, she struck him on the nose with the tongs; that he took the tongs from her, and struck her across the back with them, but that he never struck her on the face, except with his fist.</hi>)</p>

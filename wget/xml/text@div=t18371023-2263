                  </hi>. I live in Oxford-street, with William Broome, a linen-draper. On the 10th of October, about four o'clock, the prisoner came and asked for a yard of flannel—I observed her pay for it, and walk away—about an hour afterwards I went to the station-house, and these handkerchiefs were there—they are the property of Mr. Broome.</p>

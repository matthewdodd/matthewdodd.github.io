                  </hi> I live at No. 10, Queen-street, Poplar. On Sunday night, the 18th of Oct. I went into the Black Horse public-house, High-street, Poplar, to look for my father, and saw the prisoner Luck and the prosecutor, Sheik Adsgil, there—I then saw a man named Carty throw the prosecutor on a from, and Luck put his hand into his bosom, took out a hand<lb></lb>kerchief with money in it, and gave the money to Watts—the prosecutor had said, when they were all there together, that he had a half-sovereign in gold, and ten shillings in silver, and Luck said, "Stand some gin"—he afterwards led the prosecutor out, and said he would find the man that had got his money—he took him as far as Coombe's. then caught him by the throat, threw him down, and ran away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to Mr. George Perkins, a bootmaker, at 88, Bishopsgate-street—on 9th March, about a quarter or ten minutes to 11 in the morning, I was behind a desk in my master's shop, and I saw the prisoner take a pair of boots off the stand just inside the door—he put them under his coat, and walked out—I called my master, and then ran about twenty or thirty yards after the prisoner, just past the Bull-yard—I never lost sight of him—a policeman stopped him; he dropped the boots, and I picked them up—they were worth 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

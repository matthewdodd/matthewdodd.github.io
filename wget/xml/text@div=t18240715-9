On the 5th of May, about eight o'clock at night I went out, and left nobody in my room - there were people in the house. I locked my room door. I returned about nine, and found it broken open, and the bed clothes gone - I was told a black man had taken them. I went to the prisoner's lodging about half-past eleven o'clock, and found them; I did not know him before.</p>

            . On the 1st of May the prisoner took a furnished room at a house of mine, and remained till the Wednesday night, and then left. He came in on the 5th of May, about a quarter to ten o'clock, and asked my wife for a candle; she refused, and said she would go into his room, and see that all was safe - we went up, and the prosecutrix's property was in his room; he said they were his own. About eleven o'clock I heard of this robbery, and the watchman took him.</p>

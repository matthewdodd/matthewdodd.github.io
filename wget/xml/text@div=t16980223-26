It appeared that the Deceased being Travelling in the Country on Horse-back, met the Prisoner; who crossing his way, rode full against the Deceased, and gave him the Bruise: Some of the Evidence deposed, that the Deceased complained very much of the Bruise, and had vomited above a Gallon of blood: About a Week after the Surgeon who opened man said, that the Bruise had occasioned the Blood to congeal at his Heart, and prevented its due Circulation through it, which was the occasion of his Death; which might probably sooner have happen'd, if it had not been for his Vomiting and Purging of Blood. But the Prisoner's giving the Deceased the Bruise not being very plain, and withal one who rid along with the Prisoner when the Bruise was supposed to be given, declared he saw no such thing, and abundance of Gentlemen giving the Prisoner a very good Character, the Jury brought him in <rs id="t16980223-26-verdict147" type="verdictDescription">

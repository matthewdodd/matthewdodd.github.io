                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Toome, who is a baker, and lives at No. 8, Litchfield-street. In December last, he was in gaol, and I conducted the business in his absence—the prisoner was a servant in our employ—I paid him wages weekly—he had 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he never gave me any account of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received on the 11th of December, nor of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the same day, nor of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 18th of December, from Bundy—it was his duty to account for the sums he received every evening—it was the custom while my husband was in gaol.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had he been in the service of your husband? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About eleven months—my husband went to gaol on the 31st of October—I do not know whether the attorney has the papers from the Insolvent Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know William Dockerell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not certain of the name—I have heard the name of John Frederick Fulford—I do not know a person named Grant—my mother's name is Loader—I have a certificate of her being unable to attend here—these three charges were named before the Magistrate, but they were not gone into—they were certainly mentioned—(<hi rend="italic">Dockerell called in</hi>)—I do not know that man—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a man named Grant</hi>)—I have seen him about twice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now did you prefer any charge but a charge of embezzling a sum of money received from a person named Murray? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; all these five—we also preferred a charge of horse-stealing against the prisoner—this is the paper I produced before the Magistrate—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—my hus<lb></lb>band's name is to it, and this is my mother's mark—she cannot write—it is an account of the sale or transfer of a horse and cart to my mother—the trans<lb></lb>fer was made last March—it is the same horse we charge the prisoner with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183802260185"></xptr>
               <p>stealing, and which was in my husband's possession, (though sold to my mother in March,) till the latter end of September or October—my mother's name was on it some weeks previous to my husband being arrested; but it remained in our possession—I did not miss it till the 26th of December—my husband by this agreement parted with the horse and cart to my mother in March for money, but is was left in our posses<lb></lb>sion till he went to prison—the prisoner's name was never on it, to my knowledge—my mother's name was put on it on the 2nd of November—stop, don't let me make a mistake, it was the 11th of October—my hus<lb></lb>band went to prison on the 31st of October—I can't tell when the broker came in—Grant was not employed by me or my husband to paint my husband's name out of the cart—I don't know who did it—I know my mother's name was put on it—it was the only name that had a right to be on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it was not your husband's horse and cart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not, but he was informed it was his as long as he had possession of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was Mrs. Freeman's debt contracted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The bills will prove—I cannot explain about these bills because they are the prisoner's own making out—he ought to have delivered the proper bills—these are not in the book in the same sums as in his bill, because he has received various sums—he has made out a bill received by him previously, and not accounted for it—it is brought forward in our book as not being paid—I sent her a bill of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I received a paper from her, made out by the prisoner, that she only owed 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so that my book will not tally—there does not appear a bill of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due from Mrs. Tills on the 11th of December—that is plain enough—on the 16th of December, here is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. against Mrs. Bundey—I have a son twelve years old.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I ask you, whether Grant was employed to take your husband's name off the cart, and paint on Mrs. Loader's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know any thing about that—I was not in great distress when my husband went to prison—not particularly—I did get on—ray husband returned to the In<lb></lb>solvent Court all the property he had—the broker came to the house about a fortnight after my husband went to prison, which was in November—the prisoner's wages were 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—my husband was in prison till the 6th of January—the prisoner's wages were paid in the meantime—I paid them—I have no voucher for it—it is not the custom with us to have receipts for wages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, was the prisoner ever paid by you at any time 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for wages? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my oath he had, every Saturday night, what he had not drawn in the week—sometimes he would have 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. sometimes 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., according to what he wanted—I never took any voucher—I did not enter it in any book—it is not the custom to do it—it is never done—we do not keep any book to put down those sort of things—I keep no books but what we call a ledger and day books—we have no book for entries of payment of flour, no further than the miller's own books—I have nothing to do with that—when we have flour in, it is put down on one side of the book, and when they receive the money, they put the money down on the other side—we keep no book at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the prisoner, at any time, to raise money for you and your family, while your husband was in prison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—he was always too destitute himself, to be able to do it—he did not find corn for the horse</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183802260186"></xptr>
               <p>without my giving him money first to do it—he never pawned his coat to get corn for it—he never paid me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a lump—I swear that positively—he never produced an account to me, to the amount of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., paid for me—nor of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, paid for my husband—he never produced an account to me of the sale of the truck, nor of the horse and cart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you, at the end of November, in distress to carry on the busi<lb></lb>ness for want of money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not more than common—I was in daily difficulty just then, but the creditors were such they would not allow me to be in particular distress—it was a dispute between my husband and his half brother, on which he was arrested—his brother sent him to gaol—I do not recollect any particular distress at the latter end of November.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, at any time, in the presence of Grant, tell the prisoner that you could not go on unless he could assist you with money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—the prisoner never went to his friends at Romford, to borrow 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me nor my husband—I never heard it—we might have been several times without bread or flour in the house, but I was obliged to find money to get it—I never had any assistance from the prisoner's friends—I always paid the prisoner 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he was always in my debt—my husband was sup<lb></lb>ported in prison the same as other people—very frequently I have not been able to supply him myself with money—he has been short of money, but he has had friends to do it, but I always paid the prisoner his wages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he make out a bill of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and produce it to you, or did you ever have in your possession a bill, made out by the prisoner to that amount? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had a bill, hut it was not owing to him—the prisoner gave me the bill—I think it was on the night he left me, but I am not quite certain—I do not know where that account is—I did not take any notice of it, because it was not due to him, nor any of it—it was owing to the man who lent me a sack of flour, but the bread was so bad I would not pay the bill—it was a bill for flour and bread, which I had borrowed—it is the custom of bakers, when they borrow bread one of another, to return it back in bread—the account was made out in the prisoner's name, but I did not consider I owed it to him, and told him so—he said it was in his name, and he should expect to have the money for it—he did not tell me he had pledged his credit with the man for the flour—his credit would not fetch a sack of flour—he could not demand the money for it—he gave me the bill, but. It was a mere form—I will not say on my oath, whether he asked me for the money or not—when it occurred I had no idea of this, and it passed on as a trivial thing—I think, the last time I saw him he demanded money on account of that bill—he certainly did not request me to pay him the amount of the bill—when he brought it he might mention the payment, but never after—he never sent Grant to me to request the payment of it—I never sold the truck to the prisoner for 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, after your husband went to prison, did you and the prisoner and Fulford carry on the business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I carried on the business, and they served me as journeymen—there were two horses, a cart, and a truck, at times employed in the business—there was money to carry on the business when my husband went to prison—I found money the whole time—there was no money left in the house—if the horses were without food, it was because the prisoner had spent the money which he had for that purpose—he was always supplied with what he asked for for them—he never took away the horse and cart by my desire, nor with my knowledge.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183802260187"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not more than once explain to the prisoner, that you could not carry on the business without means, and ask him to get what money he could on the horse and cart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—I did not ask him, after the name had been altered on the cart, to take them away, that they might not be found on the premises when the broker came—I never knew that they were gone, till he went away, on the 26th of December—I went round to the stable the night after he left, and then, for the first time, found the horse and cart gone—I cannot tell how long before I had seen them safe—I should say it was nearly a month before—I thought the horse and cart was being used in the business, but the cart was out of repair—he had put me to the expense of 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to mend the wheel, and then he said it wanted more repair, which he said would cost 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the bill was 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—so the next time when he said it was out of repair I said, "You must do what you can without it, you must use the barrow, I am not going to spend so much money on the cart, there is a barrow, and there is a boy"—I did not tell him to do what he could with it—I did, not tell him to remove the horse and cart before the broker came—there were two horses and a cart—they were not all assigned to my mother—one is the property of my sister—she bought it—it never was mine and my husband's—she bought it last April, and we used it from that time—my sister lived in the Strand—the horse was at our stable, and we had it from April till my husband went to prison, and till the 26th of December, when I missed the whole—the prisoner never pawned his coat to keep the horse alive—he did not pawn it for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., about the 13th of November, to get food for the horse—I did not borrow 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of him on the horse and cart—nor fivepence—I never did so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever send anybody to collect accounts besides the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not from these customers—the boy has distinct customers from the man—I never sent any strange person besides the prisoner and the boy to receive accounts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner receive these accounts, and pay himself during your difficulties as well as he could? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he drew money from time to time in the course of the week, did you allow him to retain money which he had received in col<lb></lb>lecting as money drawn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—he had it always over the counter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said you knew Dockerell who was brought into Court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw him until now—Fulford was a boy in the bakehouse as well as the prisoner—I suppose Grant is an acquaint<lb></lb>ance of the prisoner's—I never made any communication to Grant at all—when Mrs. Freeman was applied to she had paid several sums—up to the 26th of December she owed by the books 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at which time it appears it was only 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I think I should know the prisoner's hand-writing—I believe this to be his handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some bills</hi>)—by these it appears he received 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mrs. Freeman—he has not accounted for that sum.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the prisoner ever come to you while you were in Whitecross-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—on the first Sunday after I was arrested he came there very much intoxicated, with my horse and cart at the gate—he drove my wife there—he was so tipsy I was glad to get rid of him—his Evans, a baker, arrested me—he is a customer now—I dealt with him—his debt was 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he arrested me—it was for rent over due—the rent of No. 8, Litchfield-street, Soho-square—I was to pay him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year rent for the house—I had lived there twelve months, as near as possible—I will swear I had been in it twelve months, or thirty years if you wish it—I was nearly born in the house—I was there twelve months as Mr. Evan's tenant—I cannot tell what month I went in, without my books—I could prove by my books—Mr. Evans is my half-brother—I was arrested at my house in Newport-street, some time in October—the latter end or middle—it was he who arrested me—he took me out of my cart that very evening when the prisoner was driving me to my house—I had just done my business—I was not driving to Whitecross-street for the purpose of being met—we had quarrelled—it was a very extraordinary quarrel—it happened about two months before I was arrested—he had never arrested me before, and never thought of such a thing I should hope—I cannot tell the amount of my debts—you have got my schedule—I cannot tell you, I have so many things on my mind—I cannot tell within 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nor 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hand over any thing to your creditors besides debts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—the furniture was taken at a valuation—what little there was you will find—the horse and cart has not been mine for twelve months this March—I had sold it to my wife's mother, in this shape, I had had some hundreds of her, and when I wanted more, she would not let me have it without compensation for it—the gentleman who wrote the note is here to prove she lent me 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—I could not get more money without letting it go that way—I owed my brother 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for rent—nothing else—I bought the business in Lichfield-street of him—I cannot say when—I think it was about six or seven months before I went into the house—I purchased the business before I went into the house—the reason I did not go in was because I had another shop in Pimlico, and could not attend to the two businesses till I disposed of the one at Pimlico—the prisoner came to me more than once in prison—he came about four days previous to my coming out.</p>

                  </hi>. I was employed in the baker's business before Mr. Toome went to prison, and was there with the prisoner after—there was no money left in the house to carry on the business, to any knowledge, after Mr. Toome went to prison—there were only two or three sacks of flour—Mrs. Toome, the prisoner, and myself carried on the busi<lb></lb>ness as well as we could after he went to prison—a horse and cart was employed in the business, and there was one horse at grass, at Mr. Strange's at Harrow—I recollect the horses being without food, and the prisoner got the money to furnish them with food—sometimes he asked Mrs. Toome for it—one Wednesday in particular he asked Mrs. Toome for money—she said she could not give him any, she had spent the last for a sack of flour—the prisoner said he would get some—he came down stairs and got a blue coat, and went to Long-acre, and pawned it for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went with him—laid 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of it out for corn—he told Mrs. Toome so—and he had the other 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for himself—I heard him tell her so, and she said, "Very well"—I heard him tell her he had pawned his own coat to get food for the horses—I was standing in the shop at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, I do not suppose you remember when Mr. Toome's name was taken off the cart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two or three days before he went to prison—I remember the horse and, cart being taken from the stable—Mrs. Toome knew that it was taken—I think Mr. Jackson was the broker who came—an execution was coming in—he said the things should go in Lagdon's name, and they should not touch her, nor the goods, nor the children—she was crying, and said nothing.</p>

               <p>down to his brother to borrow some money, and he went by the coach on the Sunday—I never saw the money paid—I saw five sovereigns and some silver put on the table on the Monday after—at that time there was no bread or flour in the house—Mrs. Toome was in great distress at the time, to have the means of carrying on the business—I have never heard Mrs. Toome apply to the prisoner for money to carry on the business with—I never heard her apply to him for assistance—on the Monday following the prisoner was gone somewhere, and two strange men were employed to carry on the business—to do what he did, to carry out bread—there was no flour in the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, what bread could they carry out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She sent for a sack of flour to Mr. Grennall, the baker, in the prisoner's name.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner about four months—I knew him when he was at Mrs. Toome's—I know he was desirous of disposing of the horse and cart—I do not know of the actual sale of the horse for 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at Smithfield—I went with the prisoner to see Mr. Toome in the gaol-that was about the middle of November—we saw Mr. Toome—I did not speak to him—the prisoner did—I did not introduce myself—Mr. Toome asked the prisoner if he had sold either of the horses—he said no, they were unsaleable—that he had been offered 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for one, and he said, "It I was you I would take it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at Mr. Toome—is that the person you have spoken of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I heard him say that—I did not hear him say any thing more—that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> An appraiser—I keep a house, No. 44, Grey-street—that is where I lived when I appeared at the Police-office—the prisoner did not tell me what he was going to Mr. Toome about—he did not introduce me—I was standing close by during all the conversation—it was quite clear that I was with the prisoner—the prisoner was sober at the time—he walked there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time of day did you go to the gaol? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was after dinner-time, about three o'clock—I had met the prisoner at the bottom of Holborn-hill accidentally, and he asked me to go—I was going that way—he did not tell me why he wanted me to go—I was going over the water, and went with him—he said he was going to see his master—I had no<lb></lb>thing to do with the transaction—I had never seen Mr. Toome in my life, that I know of—I was not introduced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You stood to overhear what passed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not stand to over hear, but I did hear—I dare say the prisoner was with him half an hour-that was all I heard—the prisoner went into the prison first, and I stood between the bars—Mr. Toome came to the bars with the prisoner, and said that—I did not go inside the gaol—I waited for him—Mr. Toome came to the bars, and shook hands with the prisoner, and said what I have stated—that was all I heard—it was at parting he said it, when the prisoner came away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the use of your accompanying the prisoner there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We were both going over the water together afterwards—I did not know from the prisoner when the horse and cart were taken to Romford—I have heard the prisoner say it was at Romford—I heard him say so at Marl<lb></lb>borough-street Police-office—I knew nothing of it till then.</p>

I am the prisoner's brother, and am a farrier living at Romford—I have lived there all my life. I attended at the Police-officer as a witness on this occasion—I remember my brother's bringing me a horse and cart down to Romford—that was in November—I really am not able to tell the day of the month—it was brought down, at first, with the intention of being turned out a little while—the cart had my brother's name</p>

               <p>on it—a few weeks afterwards be came down to borrow some money, and I advanced him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—that was on the security of the horse and cart—I can-not tell what day of the week it was—I afterwards purchased the horse and cart of him—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money, in addition to the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., be<lb></lb>sides the mare's keep—it was six or seven weeks in my keeping—the mare was lame—I blistered her, and turned her into a large farm-yard, belong<lb></lb>ing to Mr. Talbot—I have brought her up with me this morning from there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The mare is in your possession and you consi<lb></lb>der yourself the owner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not surprised at his having a cart with his name on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I rather doubted it at first—he told me he bought it for a debt from his master, for money he owed him—it was worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it an old one? It was very much out of repair.</p>

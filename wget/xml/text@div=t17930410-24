               <p>Q. Do you remember at any time in March, the waggoner, the defendant, coming to your master's? - Yes, on the 7th of March, about five or half after five in the evening; some oats and beans came in Mr. Reed's waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what quantity of oats and beans you was to receive? - No, not in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what you did receive? - Nine sacks of beans.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with these nine sacks of beans? - Put them up in one part of the warehouse by themselves.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. All that you received of Blinco you put into your master's warehouse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards before there was any mention of a loss? - To the best of my recollection it was not till Saturday night; I was not acquainted there was any deficiency before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then on Saturday night you told your master there were but nine sacks; did not your master accuse you? - Of what.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a sack deficient, and you told him you never received but nine? - Yes. I know the situation that I left the sacks in; and they were all right as I received them.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master was very angry that you had not ten sacks to produce, therefore of course you told him you received but nine? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Who was with Blinco? - The man that was with him is not here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You would have had to make up the ten sacks good, unless you had thrown the blame on Blinco? - It was no mistake, because I knew how I put them.</p>
               <p>Q. I only ask you the question? - Yes, to be sure I must.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it was the best way to say there was only one nine sacks? -</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there not a bill of parcels delivered? - Not that I see.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you mean to swear that there was not a bill of parcels delivered with these goods? - I will not swear there was, or was not.</p>
               <p>Court. Will you swear they did not deliver a bill of parcels? - They did not to me, I will swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man that delivered these beans? - Blinco.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you count them when they were delivered on Thursday? - I did not, no more than place the beans in one part of the warehouse by themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you neither count them, nor receive a bill of parcels? - I know there was no more than nine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You might have put up ten, and somebody might have slipt out one from your warehouse, as well as any other place. Is not that possible? - It is possible.</p>

               <p>I deal in corn. On the 7th of March, about half past five in the evening some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100028"></xptr>corn was delivered by Blinco and another man, whom I have never seen before nor since, he ran away; there came in the waggon twenty quarters of oats, and ten quarters of beans; I delivered the key to Vowel and told him where to put them, but I did not see the beans delivered myself; I went in the moment they were unloaded, and I found there were ten sacks together, but one was a sack of oats, which was taken away from the other side, and put to the sacks of beans.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any bill of parcels? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any quantity of oats? - Yes, but I had only five quarters left there; fifteen were put at another place; the bill of parcels I have got here, it was sent to Mr. Reed again as a receipt. On Saturday night Mr. Reed applied to me to know if I had received my beans safe, I told him I believed I had, as there were ten sacks together; but when I came to examine again more particular I found one sack of oats short.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You yourself signed the bill of parcel, that all was right? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted that when you found it not all right, you expected Vowel to make good the sack of beans? - I should not look to him for the sack of beans.</p>
               <p>Q. Vowell had access to this warehouse of your's? - The key was never out of my possession after Vowell stowed them, till Mr. Reed told me he suspected the carman stealing the beans.</p>
               <p>Q. The beans have never been found I believe? - Yes, they have.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know either of the prisoner's at the bar? - I know one by sight very well, the eldest man of the two Hoskins, he works in the market as a porter, and comes into my house frequently for a pint of porter; the other is a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing Hoskins in the evening of the 7th of March? - Yes, he was at my house the 7th of March, by himself first about six o'clock in the evening, it was on Thursday; he came again afterwards with the waggoner that stands there, it was in less than half an hour after the first time, the waggoner came in and asked me to let him leave a sack of beans; I asked who it was for, they did not give an answer in a proper manner as they should, and I said take it away, I will have no such a thing in the house; they took it away again, and put it in the waggon again; and went towards Aldgate, and then it was offered for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the waggon the time the waggon was at the door. How many sacks were in the waggon at the time? - I cannot tell what quantity; then they brought it back from Aldgate and pitched it at the door about a quarter of an hour after, as I have a stand at the door; I made them take them again off the bench for fear they should break it; and then Hoskins took it on his back, carried it along the street, and he was stopped by the patrole, I did not see him stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Blinco? - I don't know, he was not with him at this time; the patrole stopped him in the street in about two minutes with the sack of beans and brought him back, and they were pitched at my door; and the patrole asked me to take it into my house, I let him, I have brought it in a coach here to day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You never see Blinco before? - No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. And this was the 7th of March, therefore you are not certain Blinco is the man? - I am not; Hoskins I know very well; it was Blinco and another man that came first, Hoskins was employed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100029"></xptr>by them to carry them, Blinco is the man that came to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain of that - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You never see him before in your life? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him afterwards till you had the hearing before the justice, I believe that was the Saturday following two days afterwards; and then you was not certain Blinco was the man, you saw on Thursday? - Yes, I am certain Hoskins was not with him at first, but Hoskins was the man who was afterwards found with the beans.</p>
               <p>Court. Who asked you to leave the sack of beans? - Blinco asked me that.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole of Whitechapel High-street. On the 7th of March last, at night I took the prisoner Hoskins with the sack of beans on his back, he was going on; I asked him what he had got there? he said beans; says I, where are you going? he said, to Mr. Johnson's, with that I told him I should stop him on suspicion, he said he would take me to the place where he took them from; he went back to the Seven, Stars Whitechapel, the house of Mr. Turner, and pitched them on the pitching block; about half an hour after, I saw Mr. Turner. Then I took Hoskins to the Rotation office; Mr. Turner had them delivered to him, and has had them ever since. (The sack produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>HAYTER REED sworn.</p>
               <p>The sack has the same mark, as those I sent with the waggon that night; but I believe no man living consistently could swear to corn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You say very fairly that no man living consistently could swear to corn; your name is Hayter Reed, what is your partner's name? -

            , I have no other. I read to Blinco the note which I sent with him, twenty quarters of oats, and five quarters of beans, which makes ten sacks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Blinco. The gentleman he signed the note when I delivered the corn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hoskins. I work in the market unloading and loading; I was at Mr. Turner's, and they came up with the waggon, and stopped at the door, one George Green was with them, that is run away, they came up and called for a pot of beer, they took a sack of beans out of the waggon, and carried it backward to Mr. Turner, and Mr. Turner told them the beans should not be there, and they carried it out again.</p>

               <p>I am a coachman; I drive a stage coach, I come to speak against the prisoner Hoskins, what was said to him at the time they gave him the beans out of the waggon, at the Rose and Crown, Aldgate, High-street, Mr. Fisher's, the man Hoskins came into Mr. Fisher's and asked Mr. Fisher if he wanted a flyer? he told him he wanted no such thing, this man directly Hoskins goes out, and he told the man it would not do there, he should take them to some others; he takes them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100030"></xptr>out of the waggon and goes to the Seven Stars.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the other prisoner there? did you see him at this public house? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other man with the waggon besides this man Hoskins? - There was; some man gave him the sack out of the waggon, and it was carried to the Seven Stars, about three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did you hear about it? - The words that was said when it was delivered out of the waggon by the other man was, that he was to bring the money to him at the Magpie and make the most of it; he took them and offered them for sale at the Seven Stars, to a man at the door, and a man bid him eight shillings for them; they were not sold.</p>

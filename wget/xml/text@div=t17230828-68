             depos'd, He saw the Prisoner in the Court after 9 a Clock, and the Prisoner own'd he was looking into the Cellar for some of his Acquaintance, but seeing none there, he went home. There were also 2 Hammers produc'd in Court one that was found in the Chamber the next Morning, which was supposed to have been borrowed by the Prisoner, of one Mr. Peed, who lodg'd in Mr. White's House, and the other one, that some Time after had been given by Mr. White's Maid to Mr. Peed's Servant; when he sent for it instead of his own. Mr. Peed depos'd. That the Hammer produced in Court, and sworn to be found in the Chambers, was very much like his Hammer, but he would not positively swear to it, but his Servant was more positive, having taken Notice of its being mark'd with a P cut in it, and that when she went to Mr. White's Maid for Mr. Peed's Hammer, did take Notice to Mr. Peed, that the Hammer Mr. White's Maid had given her, was not Mr. Peed's Hammer, differing in the Handle, tho' there had been a P burnt upon it.

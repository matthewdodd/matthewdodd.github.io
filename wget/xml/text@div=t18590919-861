                  </hi>. I am signal-man at the Barking-road Station, North Woolwich line—on Sunday night, 28th August, the prisoner came down the steps on to the platform and asked me what time the next train would go to Woolwich—I told him in 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour—it was then about 5 minutes past 9—I left him and went into our own room—the bell was on the platform at the side of the signal post—the prisoner was eight or ten yards from it—I had used it 3 or 4 minutes before for the last train; we use it for all up trains.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alfred Tunstall of Canning-town—I was on the platform on this Sunday evening, and saw the prisoner there about five minutes to 9 o'clock—he asked Terry about the train to Woolwich—I saw him watch Terry into the porter's room—he watched Mr. Steward, the station-master, up stairs, and immediately got up and went out directly—he</p>

               <p>just turned round the signal-post—it stands by the side of the stairs, and he had to go up the stairs—he did not pass it; he sat about two yards from it—I did not see the bell after Terry put it down—a porter came across and made an alarm that the bell was gone before the prisoner had been gone three minutes—after Terry went into his room there was no person there but the prisoner and me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see the persons coming out of the up train? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I went to take my husband's supper into the porter's room—and stood by Terry's side when he collected the tickets—there were many people—there was another train there, but the bell was gone then—I last saw it just as the train was starting, after discharging its cargo of people, and after the other people had got in—I did not see the prisoner go through the door, but I saw him get up and go up the stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter at the Barking-road station of the Eastern Counties Railway—I was at the top of the up stairs, on Sunday night, 28th August, and saw the prisoner on the down platform—he walked towards the stairs to the booking-office, came back, picked up the bell, and walked up the stairs with it into the room—I laid down my lamp and followed him; but when I got into the road I could see neither man nor bell—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

Q.</hi> Had you known him before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, by sight, but not byname—I have never spoken to him—the railway is crossed by a bridge—to go up the stairs would be the right way to cross the line to proceed by the up train; but it would be the down train to go to Woolwich—the prisoner was taken next morning—a policeman brought him to the railway-station, and I said directly that he was the man.</p>

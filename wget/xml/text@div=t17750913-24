On the 8th of August, I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner, and the accomplice, Wood; when I had taken them to the Compter, I examined them separately; they confessed that they entered the house on the 7th, and took two leaden weights and some brass, and that the prisoner and Wood went afterwards, and sold it to one Hughes, for seven-pence halfpenny.</p>

               <p>Prosser. None at all. It was taken from an uninhabited house belonging to the merchant taylors; they confessed, that on Saturday they entered the house again, and took four other leaden weights, which were sound upon Wood.</p>

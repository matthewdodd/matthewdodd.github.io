               <p>Q. What time was he in your employ? - It is nearly two years since he came to my employ, he came to learn my business, I am a bedstead maker, we had an agreement between us, he was to give so much money to learn the business, it was an agreement by word of mouth, and I suppose it was six months before he could pay me the money as fast as I requested it, and about six months he offered a watch he had to me as a part of the payment of the money, which I took the watch, and gave him two guineas and a half for it, so we continued, and I sold the watch to Mr. Flemmell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. This man has lived in your service two years? - He came to learn my business.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he industriously applied himself to the business in order to learn it? - He has.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer the watch to you openly as an honest man? - He did, there was another man in the court that he offered it to, but that man hung back, and I had it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he say he came by them? - He told me that a man his wife did washing for owed some money, which he thought it right to detain the things, and it so happened that the man could not pay, and he offered him this watch for some money in part of payment. The prisoner served me duly and truly for two years.</p>
               <p>Q. If he should happen to be discharged should you take him into your service again? - Yes.</p>

I was a-bed in the house when the mob came; there was only my mother and me and another fellow servant in the house. I went to bed about eleven o'clock and went to sleep; my mother waked me. I got up and did not know which way to get down stairs the mob came up so fast; my room is adjoining to my master's; I was getting up at the head of the bed to get my petticoat and tumbled into my master's dining room where I saw the prisoner; I was very much terrified; I knew the prisoner a long time before; I went down stairs as soon as I could; the prisoner is one of Mr. Clark's runners; he was in the house that night and had change for half a guinea.</p>
               <p>What were the mob doing at that time? - They broke the stairs below; they made their way up stairs as soon as they could.</p>
               <p>What was the other part of the mob doing to the house? - They broke all the window frames and the brick wall down, and then they threw out the furniture, some of it was carried to the fire on Tower Hill, and some people carried some home to their own habitations; I did not go to see the fire.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>When did you first charge this man? - My mother first charged him, and Mr. Sherwood's runners took him.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect when he was taken? - No.</p>
               <p>You and your mother told this immediately, I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was taken up immediately, I suppose? - No, he was not; he was before the justice about a week after.</p>
               <p>Instead of going before the justices to charge this man you ran away and left him there without making any charge against him? - No, I did not go away, nor my mother, till we gave charge against him;

            , the constable, was the man who was with the prisoner at my master's house, at nine o'clock that evening, when I changed him half a guinea; I went and fetched change for half-a-guinea.</p>
               <p>When you got up, when the mob came in, you were very much frightened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why did not you go the next day to the justice? - We went to Benjamin, the constable, he was afraid to take him up; my mother did not know there was to be any law then.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the justices more than once? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not charge him then, did you? - Yes; we said we knew him.</p>
               <p>Then you was not there once when you run away? - No, I did not run away.</p>
               <p>Do you know a constable of the name of Whitway? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know the other constable you told it to, I do not mean Benjamin? - I do not know a constable of that name; I told it to no constable but Benjamin.</p>
               <p>Did not you go in company with Lebarty, your mother, Mr. Whitway, and the prisoner? - Yes; I went with a man, I did not know his name was Whitway.</p>
               <p>At the time you went with him, Lebarty, your mother, and the prisoner, did not you at that time run away and would not make a charge against the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not your mother and all of you refuse to make a charge against the man? - Yes; my mother did, because she wanted to speak to her master; Mr. Sherwood's runners said my master was coming, and he was not come; the two runners of Mr. Sherwood well knew where my mother lived,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280240"></xptr> because they had some apprehension my mother knew something against the prisoner; my mother went with Mr. Sherwood's runners the first time they came about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you went away without giving a charge? - Mr. Sherwood's runners ordered us over the way till my master should come to us; we waited there from six till seven, and my master never came; my mother and I went both over the way, the justice said he did not want to hear what I had to say, but he heard my mother.</p>
               <p>When your master did not come you went over the way to the justice's without him? - Yes; the next day I was examined at the Rotation-office in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Where was this? - I cannot tell, I was a stranger; I did not know the place.</p>
               <p>To what justice was it you went, if it was not to Whitechapel, and where did he live? - I do not know the justice we went to then, but the next day I was examined at Whitechapel Rotation-office.</p>
               <p>Don't you know where it was? - No.</p>
               <p>Counsel. I mean a week before this when you went with Whitway to the Rotation-office, and you and your mother went away and the justice discharged him? - I went with two of Mr. Sherwood's runners; I do not know where to.</p>
               <p>You know Mr. Sherwood very well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown. How soon after your master's house was demolished did you first see your master? - I did not see him at all for four or five days after his house was destroyed; I did not know where he lodged or where he was; my mother and I went the next day to find him out, but we could not.</p>
               <p>Where did you first tell this story? - In Whitechapel, at the Rotation-office.</p>
               <p>When was the prisoner taken up? - I do not know.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the mother of the last witness. I lay at Mr. Lebarty's the night the mob came. I came about ten and went to bed about eleven o'clock; I went to sleep; when the mob came I jumped out of bed and opened the fore window; no sooner had I opened the window but there was a boy at the window; we had put lights in the window. I said I would open the door if they would not break it; before I could get to the top of the stairs the mob were up stairs; we lay in the back room; the mob thrust us into Mr. Lebarty's bed chamber; some boys opened the door of the fore room up one pair of stairs and the prisoner took a gun from the boy, and swore he would blow my heart out unless I would tell him where my master's money and papers were! after that another boy brought a sword or cutlass out of the same closet; the prisoner took that and pulled it out of the sheath; he held it over my head and said, he would split me in two if I did not tell him where my master's money and papers were. I said, gentlemen, don't do any mischief and cause murder, if you will go down stairs with me I will show you; the prisoner said I must stay a little till they had done their business there and then they would go down with me; we staid till they had destroyed what was in that room and thrown the furniture out of the window; I saw the prisoner beat out the frame of the window and throw the bed out I had laid on. He said D - n you, you old Papist bitch! come down stairs and show us where the money is; he several times called me a Popish bitch! I went down stairs; he followed me; I showed him the bar where Mr. Lebarty kept his liquor and money; I saw the prisoner go into the bar, and I came out immediately; that was the first opportunity I had of getting out of the house, and I saw no more of the prisoner; the back part of Mr. Lebarty's house was broke; whether he went that way or not I do not know; I saw him in the street by himself on the Sunday following in the forenoon. I knew him directly, because the chief thing I did in the room was to observe him. On the Sunday afternoon my daughter and I were in the house of one Mrs. Roberts, in East Smithfield; the prisoner then passed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280241"></xptr> the door; I immediately told Mrs. Roberts that was the man who used me ill at Lebarty's; she said he is one of Justice Clarke's runners, and his name is

            .</p>
               <p>What did your daughter say upon that? - I believe she was in the yard playing with Mrs. Roberts's boy. That was not far from where I lodged. I went home and set down his name. On Monday I went to seek for Mr. Lebarty, and left word that I had seen one of the people who had been concerned in pulling down Mr. Lebarty's house, and had got his name; I went to one Mr. Brumett, a milk-man, in St. Catherine's, where I thought I might hear of Lebarty, and to a Jew officer, at the top of St. Catherine's-lane; I believe his name is Benjamin. As I was returning home, I met the beadle of Aldgate parish, and told him of it; he said why did I not go and make an information at the justice's. I went to the justice's; there was a guard of soldiers; I attempted to go in; they would not let me; that was on the Monday forenoon after the house was destroyed. My daughter was with me, there was a guard of soldiers brought from the Victualling office to Justice Clarke's in East Smithfield, to take a parcel of prisoners. I did not find Mr. Lebarty, till the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>When did you give the first information against the prisoner? - On the Wednesday at the Rotation-office in Whitechapel, which is almost opposite the church, I went with Lebarty; the Jew constable and the prisoner were there; as soon as I saw him, I said that is the man I saw in Lebarty's house, who pulled down the window. Lebarty, I, and my daughter went to the Rotation-office together.</p>

               <p>Was your daughter with you when you endeavoured to get admitted to Justice Clarke's office? - She was.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing more? - I was sitting at the Fountain in the Minories; two of Justice Sherwood's runners came in a great hurry, and said Justice Sherwood had sent them for me.</p>
               <p>When was that? - Some time after, I believe it was a week after; they said Lebarty was there waiting for me; my daughter was with me then. When I went there Lebarty was not there; I said I would not stay any longer, and then I was made a prisoner of, and was detained from my washing, in the publick-house, by these runners; I was kept till ten at night; then the justice examined me, and I swore to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Was your daughter examined then? - She was.</p>
               <p>How long did your examination last? - Not a great while.</p>
               <p>How long did your daughter's last? - Not long; we were only sworn that he was the person. I am certain and sure that he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You did not know him before but by sight? - Only by sight, my daughter knew him for many years.</p>
               <p>Why did you enquire of any body else if you daughter knew him? - My daughter was not in the room when he used me ill with the gun and sword. She said she saw one of Justice Clarke's runners there, but then I did not know his name.</p>
               <p>You knew Justice Clarke and Justice Sherwood too? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You have been before them both before now? - No, I have been before Mr. Clarke, not Mr. Sherwood.</p>
               <p>Your daughter has known this man's name for these two years? - Yes, I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Why did not you apply to her? - She was not present when I saw him and he presented the gun and sword to me.</p>
               <p>Did not you go to Mr. Clarke's to complain? - Yes, but was not admitted into the office. I did not go before Monday.</p>
               <p>From the Wednesday to the Sunday, you never went to enquire after him? - I was not able to hold up my head hardly, I was so ill used in Mr. Lebarty's house.</p>
               <p>How came you to recollect so readily that your daughter was at play at the moment the prisoner went by when you was at Roberts's? - I am not sure she was at play, I was stagnated at the sight of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280242"></xptr>If your daughter knew him before why did not you call her? - I was too stagnated at seeing him. I was at the Rotation-office, I believe it was on the Wednesday, and on the Thursday se'nnight.</p>
               <p>Was your daughter there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not you recollect your daughter and you going away, and you would not give evidence? - No; I was there but I did not give evidence nor my daughter, because Mr. Lebarty did not choose to have any thing to do with the matter.</p>
               <p>She knew the reason I suppose as well as you? - It was not the reason because I would not give evidence, but because Mr. Lebarty would have nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>So you and your daughter went away without giving any evidence? - We saw the prisoner, and said he was the person.</p>
               <p>When you saw the prisoner there you made no charge against him nor your daughter? - No.</p>
               <p>He was discharged? - No, he was not in custody, he was doing his duty, he had prisoners in charge I believe.</p>
               <p>How soon after this was it that you chose to give evidence against him, it was a week after was it not? - I cannot tell, the justice's runners came to fetch me, it was some time after.</p>
               <p>That was the 22d I believe? - I do not know, I saw no more of him till I was sent for.</p>
               <p>If this man was so well known to your daughter, and the name told you by Roberts, how came you to go and get a pen and ink to write it down? - That I might not forget it.</p>
               <p>But Roberts said he was one of Mr. Clarke's runners, and your daughter said the same, and she knew the name? - She knew him, I do not know that she knew his name.</p>
               <p>You knew Justice Clarke's office, and Justice Sherwood's office, and all their runners very well I dare say? - No, I do not; I have been at Justice Clarke's office.</p>
               <p>Have you all your warrants at Justice Clarke's office? - I never had a warrant in my life.</p>
               <p>When you was so industrious to tell this in St. Catherine's-lane, why did not you go to the justice's? - I did not know the nature of law, I could not get in at the justice's.</p>
               <p>When the runners came for you you say you was in prison, what was that for? - They said they would keep me till they went and took

I was greatly hurt in Mr. Lebarty's house; I did not talk about the rioters all that time that I know of. My nose began bleeding from that time to Sunday; then it stopped bleeding, and I went out to Mrs. Roberts's.</p>
               <p>Was you speechless all that time that you spoke nothing about it? - No, but my nose kept bleeding; I had a blow on the back of my head; we might speak that there were such riots, but not to any purpose.</p>
               <p>When did she tell you she saw one of justice Clarke's runners there? - On the Friday she told me she saw some runners, some butchers, and Jews, in Mr. Lebarty's house.</p>
               <p>Though she told you on Friday she knew one of Justice Clarke's runners was there, you never once asked her if she knew his name? - No.</p>
               <p>You have heard I suppose there is money to be got in this way? - I never heard there was money to be got this way, I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>If you convict this man you are entitled to fifty pounds? - I do not want the fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Who told you you were not to wish to have the fifty pound, the attorney? - No,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280243"></xptr> I heard the runners were to have fifty pounds for taking them.</p>
               <p>Did not you expect to have some of that fifty pounds? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you hear no talk of it? - No.</p>

               <p>What did the man do with the gun and the sword? - Threw them out at the window.</p>

            ? - I have seen them before. On Thursday the 15th of June, in the morning, they came to the King's-Arms, East Smithfield, opposite Justice Clarke's office; they and Lebarty came together, and began to relate the matter about the prisoner to me and some others; I told her I had seen him that morning, and if I had known it I would have stopped him. I understood she was going up to the Rotation-office about some other business concerning the rioters.</p>
               <p>Who said so? - I do not know, I believe all three, that they were going up concerning the examination of other rioters. I was going up there myself. I told her to go up and I would endeavour to find Downs, and if I found him I would bring him up.</p>
               <p>What did they say to that? - They said it was very well; if I found him to bring him up. I went to his house; he happened not to be at home; as I was going I saw him on the opposite side of the way; I beckoned him; he came to me; I told him what the woman said; he declared he was innocent, and went with me voluntarily. When he came there the women were at the Rotation-office; there were some altercations between them, but the particulars I cannot remember; there were Justice Sherwood and Justice Clarke; I related the story to them; the magistrates ordered me to bring the prisoner up; I did so. When I brought him up, I thought the woman was following me; when I came up she was not there. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280244"></xptr> magistrates asked where the woman was who was to make the charge? I went down to look for her, and the woman and her daughter and Lebarty were all gone out of the house. The magistrate then dismissed him, and desired he would be ready to be called for whenever he was wanted. He told them he would. He then went away about his usual business, and I heard no more about it till the Wednesday following, which I think was the 21st, then the woman went down to Mr. Sherwood's and laid an information, and Mr. Sherwood's people came and took him. He was at large all that time up and down with the prisoners; he is a servant to Mr. Newport.</p>

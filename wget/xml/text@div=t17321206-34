In the Morning my Maid told me the House had been broke open. I went into the Parlour, and saw the Walnut-tree of my Scritore was broke, but the Lock had not been open'd. My Sister said she heard a cracking Noise in the Night, and cry'd out, Who's there? My Wife had left her Lace in a Band-box, and her Velvet Hood and Manteel in the Parlour over-night, and they were carried off. The Shutter of the Kitchen-Window had been taken down and set aside, and the Casement left open. A Gentleman hearing of the Robbery, asked me what I had lost? I told him; he bid me be easy, for the Thief was taken, and all the Goods upon him. By his Directions I went to Justice Newton, and told him the Particulars. The Prisoner had been examined before I came, and was gone to a Publick-House just by. The Justice had given Orders for the Goods to be advertised. As soon as I saw the Things I knew them, and own'd them to be mine. I went to the Prisoner at the Ale-house, and found my Hat upon his Head. I took it off, and said, Friend, how came you by this? He said he had it among the rest of the Things that were given him by a Man that he met in the Hay-Market against the Opera-House.</p>
               <p>- Garbet. (The Prosecutor's Servant) I was last up but one; I went to Bed between 10 and 11, and all the Doors were safe then. I came down about 7 in the Morning, and found the Shutter of the Kitchen Window was taken off the Hinges, and set aside, and the Casement ('tis a Sash Casement) stood open. I mist several things before my Master came down.</p>

I had just gone past One, and was leaning on a Post, speaking to my Brother Watchman, when the Prisoner ast me with a white Bundle; he was got 2 or three Doors before I took much Notice of him. But then I call'd to him to let me see what he had got, or I told him I would knock him down. He begun to creep off, and at last he run. I followed, and near Cecil-street he run into that Watchman's Arms. We took him to the Round-house, and next Morning he and the Bundle were carried before Justice Newton.

What will you give? says I, why 6 d. says she. I told her I would go for a Shilling; and so we agreed. I went with her, and when we came to the End of Pall-Mall, she said she knew where she was, and would not trouble me to go any farther. As I went back, I met a young Man over against the Opera-House.

                  </hi>. On Sunday morning, the 29th of Nov., I went into the coal-cellar under Mr. Hunt's flour-loft—I saw there four half-quartern cot<lb></lb>tage loaves—I called in the officer—he marked them, and they were left as they were found—two of them were covered with a skittle-frame, and two with a shovel—I went there the next morning, and two loaves were gone—I went on the Tuesday morning and still found two loaves there—I directed Beavis to clear the cellar for coals, and in half an hour afterwards the other two loaves were gone—I went to the cupboard in the tap-room, which is usually locked, and the key kept by Beavis—on that occasion it was unlocked—I saw two loaves there, covered with a bag—I took the officer into the tap-room, and in the presence of Beavis I opened the cupboard and took out one loaf—I asked Beavis if it was his master's—he said he did not know—he afterwards said be got it from the baker's man to mind—I gave the loaf and Beavis to the officer.</p>

I staid there as late as 29th of Nov.—for the week preceding that day I had noticed a black bag come down out of the floor above, into the coal-cellar—bread came down day after day for several days together—it came down with a string from the floor above, and flour too—I could see the string and a man's arm at the time—that was all—I did not look into the bag at all—that has happened when I nave been there alone—it sometimes came when Beavis was not there—it came down from above sometimes when Beavis was in the cellar—on the Friday morning he was out in the yard when it came, and he came in afterwards.</p>

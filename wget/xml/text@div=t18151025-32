            . This oil cloth was just inside the threshold of my shop door. I was standing at my door, on the 14th of October; I had occasion to go into the shop; in about a minute, a person stepped up to me, and asked me if I had lost any oil cloth; I then stepped to the door, and missed this roll. In consequence of the information this person gave me, I went with him in pursuit of the thieves.</p>
               <p>JOHN BLACKLOWE. On the 14th day of October, I was coming down <placeName id="t18151025-32-crimeloc179">Barrack street</placeName>

I turned round, and saw Wallis take a piece of floor cloth from his side, and give it to Price; they then ran across the street, and into a small court, called Kemp's court. Mr. Cox's being the first broker's shop, I went in there to enquire. We went after them, but could not find them then. I was speaking to a friend at a few minutes after seven, in Wardour street, on the Monday morning, and they both passed us; we followed them through a good many streets, and at last, with the assistance of an officer, we took them in Hopkins-street.</p>

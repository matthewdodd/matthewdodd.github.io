I live at 34, Doughty Street—on 21st January, about 9.30, an alarm was given to me by my son, and the prisoner Williams was brought back by the constable, Maynard, with two blankets, a counterpane, and a fox's tail—the tail had been taken from the hall, and the other things from the second floor front room.</p>

On 21st January, about 7.30, I was on duty, in plain clothes, with another constable, in Doughty Street—I saw the prisoners there together—they were running across the road in the direction of Mecklenburgh Square from Mr. Holland's house—I ran after Williams and stopped him, with a bundle under his arm containing these articles—Walker kept running on, and was pursued by the other constable—I took Williams back to the prosecutor's house—as I was going along I took this fox's tail out of his pocket—I found that a bed in one of the upper rooms had been stripped—I had not the slightest doubt about Walker being the man I saw with Williams—there were no marks on the street door; it was a common latch, and access could easily he had from the outside.</p>

               <p>On the 22d of July last, in the morning, I had been in company with my brother who came from the country, to shew him his quarters in Smithfield; it was past twelve, I was coming down to the Strand to my lodging in Buckingham-street; my landlord and landlady were gone to bed, I could not get in; it was between one and two; then I went to the Prince's-head to get some beer, and they were gone to bed; then I thought I would walk about till morning, and walking towards Charing-cross, this woman met me, and asked me where I was going; I told her I was locked out of my lodging, and was walking about till my landlord got up; she said she had got a very good room, she paid three shillings a week for it, and I should be welcome to go and stay there, and stay two or three hours, and longer if I chose; she said it was at Westminster; I asked her if it was a quiet lodging; she said it was, and I should be very safe; she took a key out of her pocket, and she told me that was the key of her room, and no one had a right there but herself; I went with her to <placeName id="t17870912-75-crimeloc358">Old-pye-street</placeName>

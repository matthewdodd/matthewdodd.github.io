                  </hi>. I live in Alford-terrace, Chelsea, and am the son of George Todd. I heard something, and went to some vacant ground at the back of where the prisoner was living, on the 29th of April—I saw some scaffolding, and various other articles on the tiles of a washhouse belonging to a house occupied by the prisoner—they were my father's—I desired the prisoner to</p>

               <p>go with me, and we went to this vacant ground—I asked him if he lived at that house—he said he did—I said there are things at the top of your wash-house, which have been taken from Alford-street—he denied it—I said, I knew where they came from, when they were taken, and who took them—I wished to go round to see if there was anything else—in going, he said there might be a batten he had used for a running-rail—he then wanted to pay me for them, which I refused—I went to my father, he desired me to get a policeman, and I did—the prisoner had worked for us about two years ago—I saw these articles safe about a-week before—two of these had been used at running-rails—he had no business with them.</p>

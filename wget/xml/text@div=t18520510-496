                  </hi>. I am proprietor of the Adam and Eve Tavern, Duke-street, Chelsea. On 17th April, the prisoner and another person came to my house—the prisoner asked for a pint of porter—I served him, and hit companion paid for it, tendering a counterfeit shilling—I tried it on the counter, returned it him, and said, "This won't do, it is a bad one"—his companion took it up, said they were very sorry, and gave me a good shilling—they drank their porter, and went off—I followed them, and gave information.</p>

I received information, and a description from Wood, in consequence of which I found the prisoner and two other men in Little Chelsea—I said, "Which of you has got the <hi rend="italic">swag</hi>?"—that is a cant phrase, those sort of people know what it means—on my asking that, the prisoner commenced running—I ran after him—he ran in the direction of the workhouse, down by a wall, and when he got near there I saw him take a purse from his trowsers pocket, and throw it over the work-house wall—he continued running, and ran nearly half a mile—I then took him, and told him he could not have thrown the <hi rend="italic">swag</hi> into a safer place, it was secure there—he made no answer to that, and I took him to the station, went to the workhouse, and on the way there met the sergeant with the purse—it had been found.</p>

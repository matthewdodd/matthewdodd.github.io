He had not been gone long before she mist the Guineas and Ring, she acquainted her Master with it, the House was soon in an uproar: and in about an hours time the prisoner came back again, and taking her Master aside to speak to him, the old Glove, but nothing in it, was found behind the Door where the prisoner stood. The prisoner in his defence said, that he had no occasion to use any force to throw her down, for she was always willing; and that when she pretended she was rob'd, they had been very familiar together, that he had lain with her 20 and 20 times, and when he kept a Sutlers Booth in Hyde Park she was continually running after him: but having lately pickt a Quarrel with him, she prosecuted him out of spight.

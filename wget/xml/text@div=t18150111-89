             the key of the street door - A. That is in general left open when I came home. I am not a married man. I returned a little after ten; I found the street door open.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you find the door of your room - A. Locked, as I expected it to be.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got into the room, did you find the things as you expected them to be - A. No, the covering of two beds were tied up.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there two beds in that room - A. Yes, and the covering of the two beds were tied up; it was all level upon the bed when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any body in the room; is Shorter here - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whoever had done this, had they taken any thing away with them - A. No, only removed them, and tied them up. One of my lodgers came, and informed my sister that my room had been broken open; I run off as hard as I could; this was half after ten that I received the information. This room that I left at two o'clock, I slept in, and worked there; I did not go into the room until I had the information, and instead of going up stairs, I went to the side front window of the one pair; I could see the window was shut of the one pair. My sister cried out to me Tom, he is coming out of the window; I saw the prisoner about half out of the window of that room that I found my things tied up in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any body in that room when you found the things tied up - A. I saw the prisoner come out of the one pair of stairs window; he slid all the way down on the tiles, and when he came down, he fell on the stones; I and my brother run up and secured him before he could rise off the stones.</p>

Then I went for an officer; when I went for the officer the officer was not at home; and when I came back the prisoner was rescued, and had got into his landlord's house opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the man before - A. Yes, he is a bootmaker, and in the course of ten minutes or of a quarter of an hour, we got him again. I think he went into the room with a false key, the lock was not injured at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the bedding altogether - A. About thirty-eight shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you left there on Christmas-day when Satchell went out - A. Yes, I was left there about half past two; the prosecutor left the room about two, I left it at half past two. I went to spend my Christmas at the same place with Satchell. At five o'clock I returned to the room, I found every thing safe. Then the bedding was in its proper place, it was dark at that time, there was no day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear that any thing was amiss in your room - A. At half past ten, at the same time that Satchell did. When I came there the bed clothes were tied up in one bundle on the ground, and the other bundle tied up on the bed. When I left the room at five o'clock, the bed was laying as it would do as I left it at half past two o'clock, it was not tied up in a bundle then, that was done by somebody without my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the room to see if there was any body in it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any closet that would conceal any thing - A. There was a cupboard where rabbits were kept. I never saw the prisoner until he was in custody; I did not see him come out of the window.</p>

            . I am a lodger to Mr. Satchell, I lodge in the two pair, in the room over my landlord. About half past nine I was sitting quiet by the fire, I heard a key go into Mr. Satchell's door; my door was a-jar. I heard a noise as if a key was going in his lock, I heard the key go in a very slow manner, I took my candle, and called at the top of the stairs. I went out on the landing, and called out who is there? Nobody answered, I saw nobody, nor saw no light. The key had been put in more gently than ever I heard Mr. Satchell put it in. About ten oclock I had occasion to go out to the chandler's shop, and on my returning, going up stairs past my landlord's door, I heard a latch go up, whether it was up stairs or down stairs I cannot say; it was within side of my landlord's room, I thought it was within side of my landlord's room, I thought it was an old man; I knocked at the door, and said, who is here? No answer was given. I said to the old man, as I thought it was, you are not so deaf but you hear me, I tried the latch, and the latch seemed forced against me. I then know there was some one in the room that had no right to be there. I knew there was a dog in the room; I said to the dog, you mind! I run out of my landlord's house, and gave information. I saw the prisoner sliding down the tiles when I returned from giving my landlord the information.</p>

            . I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner. I found the bundles tied up in Satchell's room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in liquor when this happened. On Christmas morning my master sent me a pair of shoes to do; I promised my master I would get them done on the day following; he told me to borrow a last of Mr. Shuter, I drank freely indeed that night with an acquaintance, I was very much intoxicated; I did not lose my recollection; I knew I had these shoes to make; the liquor took that effect on me, I knew it would make me ill on the day following. I considered I should not be able to make the shoes, I thought of getting Shuter to assist me in making the shoes against the next morning. I went up to the room, and knocked at the door, the door was opened by an old man; I asked him if Shuter was at home; he said, no, if I wanted him he would go and fetch him. The man went out, and whether he locked the door or no I cannot say; I went in and fell asleep; how long I was there I do not know; when I awoke I knew where I was. I really thought Shuter locked me in by way of a joke. I went to the door for the purpose of coming out; I raised the latch for the purpose of coming out. I felt the lock, there was no key in it. I then thought I would get out of the room as well as I could; as for entering the room for any robbery, I am as innocent as a child unborn. My prosecutor has worked for the same shop that I have worked; it is out of his power to say he ever knew any harm of me.</p>

            (to Shuter.) Did the prisoner come up to you that day to borrow a last - A. He did, about eleven o'clock, he was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. When you went into the room about half past ten o'clock, had you a light with you - A. I did not go into the room myself, until after he was gone to the Compter, and when I went into my room, I found the things tied up, nobody had been in the room before me. There was no person in the room when I went in.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I was going home; it was between twelve and one o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 28th of March last. I was alone, and when I got near Somerset-house I was attacked by the prisoner he was in the front of me when I first saw him, it was a star-light night and the lamps were a light; he took hold of my great coat and opened it; he laid hold of my under coat with one hand, and pulled at my watch with the other he did not get my watch out at this time. I then looked him in the face and said, you rascal, what do you want to rob me of my watch. He gave me no kind of answer whatever, but made a second pull at my watch, and gave me a blow which knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what he struck you with - A. I believe with his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. And you fell to the ground, did you - A. Yes, and I felt the watch go at the same moment; I felt him pull it out, he ran across the way towards the church, towards Drury-lane way; I immediately got up, crossed the way, and cried out stop thief, and pursued him; the watchman came up and ask'd me who had robbed me, I pointed the prisoner out to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner when you pointed him out A. Somewhere on the opposite side of the way where he had ran to.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he standing still then or running - A. He was standing still, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near him when you pointed him out to the watchman - A. Yes, I was; I said, that is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner near enough to hear you say that - A. Yes, he was; the watchman that I had pointed him out to took hold of him by the arm, upon which he gave him a push and ran away, the watchman pursued him and a number of other people.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he run. - A. Up into Little Drury-lane; I did not see him stopped until he was brought back again, it was not more than five minutes before he was brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when you saw him - A. At the bottom of Little Drury-lane, coming back to the watch-house, one of the witnesses bringing him back; he then went to the watch-house; I identified the prisoner at the bar, I have not the least doubt but the prisoner was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your watch again. - A. The outside case was found about half an hour afterwards, I did not see it found, I saw it brought in the watch-house by one of the watchmen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it again. - A. I described it before ever I saw it; it was a silver gilt watch, horizontal, capped, jewelled, and seconds.</p>
               <p>Q. The watch itself you never saw again, did you. - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose he was searched at the watchhouse. - A. Yes, and nothing found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has got the watch-case. - A. The watchman that picked it up.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon this night, between twelve and one o'clock, where did you happen to be. - A. I was going out of the Strand up Drury-lane; when I had passed what is called Little Drury-lane, I then heard a watchman's rattle; I did not notice it, it was behind me; I did not notice it till I heard it violent and incessant, and then I turned round, I saw a person advancing out of the Strand up Little Drury-lane, running very fast; I stood still for a moment when he was coming near where I was I made a slant crossing the way, he altered his pace, when I was within half a dozen yards, and walked; I sprang forward and laid hold of him; he told me that he had not done any thing, then I said I'll see justice done you, you must go with me, you shall not stir away. In a short time the watchman came up and a number of people behind him, I did not loose him till we got in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Hodgson in the watch-house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose he charged the prisoner with having robbed him of his watch - A. He did, and shewed the marks in his face where the man knocked him down; his face was all dirt and his head was scarr'd, I left him in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you consider Mr. Hodgson as drunk or sober - A. He was very correct in what he said he did not appear as sober as he would be in a morning, he said he had been drinking a glass, he gave as clear a statement as he now has done.</p>

            . Q. You are a watchman - A. Yes of St. Mary-le-strand. I heard the rattle spring, I was at the end of Catharine-street in the Strand; I ran to this side of the Church, and the prisoner ran up little Drury-lane; I saw nothing of the prisoner till he was brought to the watch-house. After Mr. Hodgson said he was knocked down I went to look if there was any thing there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Mr. Hodgson say he was knocked down A. At the lower part of Somerset-house gateway.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at the spot that he mentioned, or thereabouts, find any thing - A. As near as possible it could be mentioned I found this watch-case; it was just outside of the kennel in the coach road.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at that watch-case, and see if you know any thing about it - A. This is the outside case that was on my watch at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not aware of its falling on the ground at all - A. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing particular that you know it by - A. Yes, there is a satrin paper at the bottom of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you that little Landscape in it - A. Yes, that was inside of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. to Linder. How long after the rattle sprang the first time did you find this - A. About half an hour, just upon the stroke of one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Now upon the spring of the rattle there was a good many people about, was there not - A. I did not take notice of any more than another time.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hodgson. You admitted you had been drinking that evening - A. I had.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you your senses about you at that time - A. I believe I had as well as I have just at this moment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My prosecutor was drunk at the time he had me taken to the watch-house. That gentleman stopped me; my prosecutor said he was one of my companions, he thought he knew as much about it as I did; and when my prosecutor had me taken to the watch-house, I said, sir, if you are in liquor I am not, I was going home.</p>
               <p>MR. HILL. I said to this poor man I will have justice done, and so Mr. Hodgson concluded from that I was one of the party.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was nothing more than Mr. Hill saying that he would have justice done him, I conjectured that he might belong to him.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a chain was it - A. A gold chain, a gold seal and a gold key.</p>

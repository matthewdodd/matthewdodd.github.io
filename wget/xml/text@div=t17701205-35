               <p>Tompkins. There were different things lost. I had no suspicion of her till she took some sugar, or some trifling thing, then we searched her box; we found some soap, which I believe to be mine, and some caps and things of my wife's.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Tompkins. I am wife to the last witness. When we searched the prisoner's box, we found those things of ours that are laid in the indictment. [producing them.]</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to search her box?</p>
               <p>Tompkins. On account of the sugar; and Mrs. Jubello had missed her ruffles: so I insisted upon the maid's boxes being searched. She said very little for herself; hardly any thing at all. She lived with me three months, and behaved very well; we had a good character with her, and I hope this is her first offence. Her father and mother are honest, industrious people.</p>

Yes; I have seen him; I first saw him, I think, in the month of December last, at our accompting house; he represented himself as an assistant surgeon in the navy, and said he wanted an agent; I told him that we never took any gentleman unless he was recommended - unless we were recommended to him. I asked him if he knew any surgeon in the navy; I asked him if he knew Mr. Duncan, a surgeon in the navy; he said he knew him perfectly well. On the 7th of March he called again, I was not in the office when he came in, I came in afterwards, when Mr. Wilson, my partner, shewed me a letter which was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260035"></xptr>brought by him.</p>

               <p>Q. What past upon that - A. Mr. Wilson went out, and this person represented himself to me as an assistant surgeon in the navy; he said he required an advance of twenty pounds, and that he had pay due for the Wrangler, gun-brig, from the 17th of November last; he said there were no blank bills on board; he could not draw for his pay.</p>
               <p>Q. These bills are usually printed bills - A. They are government bills. I then filled up a power of attorney; and filled up a bill for three months pay; he took the power of attorney with him, and the bill, having first signed it, before I gave him the draft on Messrs. Masterman and co. for twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that draft, and tell me whether that is the draft - A. Yes; this is the draft.</p>

             was his real name - A. I never asked him at all his name; he went by that name with his acquaintances currently; I never knew him by any other name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did he make any application to you on the 24th of April - A. On the 24th of April he spent the evening at my house; he wanted the loan of seven shillings, he said at first; he then consulted himself, he said that was not sufficient; he applied for more, he asked me if I would give him the discount of a fifteen pound note, drawn upon Messrs. Masterman and co. He had spent his evening down stairs, it was past eleven o'clock at night. Then he produced that bill, he asked me to give him the money for it; I should be sure of getting the money for it; they were his bankers.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he say on whom - A. Messrs Masterman, Peters, and co. I went to my almanack, the Commercial almanack, I there proved there was such a bankers. He gave me the draft; this is the draft. I held the ink stand in my left hand when he signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him sign it - A. Yes, he wrote his name on the back of it in my presence; I should never take a bill of this description without seeing a person write his name on it in that manner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have no doubt at all that this is the bill that he presented to you - A. I have no doubt of it in the least; I told him that I had paid away my money that day, as I do on a Monday; I said if he was a mind to have two pound he might have it, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260036"></xptr>rest if he would call the next day. Indeed I had no doubt of the goodness of it. I let him have two pounds; on my keeping the bill he seemed satisfied; I told him if he would come on the next day he should have the remainder, as he was in the habit of coming mostly every day.</p>
               <p>Q. You let him have two pounds - A. I did, and he went away. I sent the bill to Messrs. Masterman's by a person of the name of Fisher; I told him to go to Masterman's, and tell them to give the money for that bill; he went and brought me a fifteen pound bank of England note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner tell you, or did you understand from him that he was to call the next day - A. I left it to his option to call when he liked, when I had the money there it was for him. He did not call the next day; I sent after him frequently, and had heard of him; he did not come for near a month.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come - A. That I cannot be positive. He came on a Wednesday, about one o'clock, I must not be positive whether it was in May or June, I think it was in the latter end of May; thinking every thing was just I did not notice it. When he came in again I asked him why he had not called for the money of the bill; he with an oath said he did not know that he gave me the bill, having many of them in circulation about, perhaps I dreamed of it, or he had drank too much that night, and did not recollect it. Very little passed more than that; I said I had sent to him by various people; he said they had told him of it, they came to him the night before, and he had then come for the money.</p>
               <p>Q. You say upon a former occasion you advanced him two pounds - A. Yes, and on the Wednesday I paid him the remainder thirteen pounds in bank notes - in two bank notes.</p>

The person that was last called, Fisher, he was not so clean dressed as now, I think I recollect his eyes; I took notice of him before he got out of the house, on account of my suspicion; we were particularly busy at that time, and I dare say the man will recollect that I looked particularly at him when he went out of the door.</p>

When we got to the watchhouse we told him it was for a forgery; he made a little reply. I searched him and I found this piece of paper in his right hand waistcoat pocket. On Saturday, the next morning, as we were going up the coal yard, in our way to the office; he requested me not to produce the paper, he said it would hang him; he said no more; I made no answer to it.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly aware of the situation I now stand in; I am of a respectable family and connections, I have had a liberal education given me. With respect to the witnesses, they have taken an oath to speak the truth, and nothing but the truth. I shall make a few observations with regard to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260037"></xptr>Wilson; I do not know what Mr. Wilson means to insinuate, that I forgot to call, or did not call upon him for a month after I tendered him the bill; I mean to say when that bill was given to him; it was given to him for him to keep it till the two pounds was paid, not to after it upon his peril. He said I have been every day at his house, I have not; he keeps an Odd-fellow's lodge; as he kept an Odd-fellow's lodge, I went there on the Monday. I am well aware of his inviduous temper; if I shall lose my life, I shall not merit it at his hands, though I shall not be the first life that he has lost. My lord, I beg pardon, I hope that you will not think that my disagreeable situation makes me have any antipathy against him as a man; no, but as a man, he ought to have said nothing more than the truth. What could he mean by saying I had more in circulation, but that it might prejudice the jury against me. I did not intend to make another observation; Mr. Mc'Inerkery made an observation, to say that I called on him in December, I beg his pardon. I was cast away with captain Bartan, in the Crescent, on the 14th of September. On the 8th of January, I was appointed gunner of the Wrangler, gun brig; I could not be there in December. With regard to Blackman, the laws of the country requires that witnesses should speak the truth; why not he speak the truth, as well as any other man. He said when he took the paper from me, I said I was afraid I should be hanged; why should I be afraid I should be hanged; when I am tried by a liberal and impartial jury. I have been ten years in the navy, and three years in the light dragoons. I have always conducted myself as a gentleman.</p>

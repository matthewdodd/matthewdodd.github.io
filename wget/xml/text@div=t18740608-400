                  </hi>. I am an out-door officer of Customs, at the Red Lion and Three Cranes, bonded wharf—on Thursday morning, 14th May, about 7.45, I saw a man coming down Three Cranes Lane, which leads from Thames Street to the wharf—he had a cask on his back or left shoulder, it appeared like a sherry cask—he laid it down by the vault door, and left—I did not ascertain whether there was anything in the cask, I should imagine from the way in which he carried it, that it was empty—the proper hours for opening the bonded warehouse is, 8 o'clock in the summer time; that is the time we usually open at Red Lion Wharf, there being a great number of locks to take off, we generally start before 8 o'clock, so as to get done by 8 o'clock—the place where the cask was put down, is called the Bridge Vaults—there are two storeys to those vaults, the base<lb></lb>ment and the first floor, the Crown has one lock on the door and the Customs another—I believe wine was, stored in the basement, inside a kind of cage—and on the first floor there were two compartments, one containing wine and the other spirits, there is an iron door separating them, with a Crown lock and a wharfingers lock on it; there is a door leading into another compart<lb></lb>jment where there is a large hole and crane for the delivery of goods—I saw Mr. George in the lane at the time the man brought the cask down—did not notice whether he spoke to the man, I was some distance off—George asked me if I would unlock the door against which the cask was standing—I did so, and he unlocked the Company's lock, and put the cask inside—I may have passed the remark "a racking operation I suppose," and he replied, "Yes"—I don't know whether he said it was a racking operation or whether I did—he then requested me to take the lock off the iron door up stairs—I did so, and left him there—about 4 o'clock that same afternoon, I saw George again by the entrance to the Three Cranes Vaults, on the other side of the lane—he asked me what time I was coming the fol<lb></lb>lowing morning—I said at 6 o'clock—the builders were at work there at that time, and they commenced work at 6 o'clock, and it was necessary for me to be there to attend to the locks—George said he should be there early, about 6.30 o'clock—I have been on duty at this wharf, two years—I have never known George come there before at 6.30, not round that side, his usual time was shortly after 8 o'clock—next morning, the 15th, I saw George shortly after 7.30, he came into my office and asked me to take the lock off the wine floor, so that he could get in the Bridge Wine Vaults; he said that he had reported to Mr. Brown that he had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187406080014"></xptr>
               <p>found a cask, and he really had not looked for it the evening before, and he wanted to get in as soon as he could before Mr. Brown came round, so that he should not be found out in a lie—I did not open the lock at that time, I did when the wharfinger's-constable came, about 7.45, and George went inside—he then asked me to open the door of the brandy vaults, the iron door on the first floor; I did so, and he went inside, I left him there—I afterwards asked him if he had found the cask he was looking for—he said the first cask that he had got his eye upon—at noon that same day Wiggins came to my office—Mr. Cockerell, another locker, was present—Wiggins wanted a lock taken off the spirit place—Cockerell went with him to unlock it—about four o'clock that afternoon I examined the the spirit floor with a lantern—I began at this time to have a suspicion with regard to the cask that it was not right—on examination I found nothing in the shape of a cask in the spirit place—I locked the iron doors, and went into the wine place, and there found it stowed among the tier of wines—I called Cockerell, and pointed it out to him—we ascertained by smell that the cask contained brandy, and was apparently full—I put my initials on it—on Saturday the 16th I reported to Mr. Hughes, the Surveyor of Customs, and after about 1 o'clock, I kept a watch from the warehouse opposite the vaults for half or three-quarters of an hour, I then saw George come to the door leading to the vaults, the same door that the empty cask went in—he took the company's lock off and stood by the side of the door—I then lost sight of him for a few minutes—I then saw Wiggins go in at that door with Pechell, one of the labourers—I then saw a van drive down and George standing by the tail of the van, apparently speaking to Wedge, the driver—the van then went lower down the lane and came round under the loop-hole—Wedge went on to the floor, and came down and said to George that the lock was on—George said "Go for the locker"—Wiggins left, and came back again with Cockerell—they went in at the door—about a minute or two afterwards I saw Wiggins rolling the cask along to the loop<lb></lb>hole under the crane, and Pechell with him, the hooks were then hooked on to it, and then it was lowered into the van—George was standing by the van at the time—I could not catch the words that passed, but apparently he was hurrying them along just as he would on an ordinary occasion—he apparently spoke to the men at the loop-hole—I had given Cockerell instructions to call, the surveyor when he took the lock off—I went down into the lane, the van was just about starting—I stopped it, and spoke to Wedge, he produced this paper to me—it is not usual to remove brandy without an order from the Customs—Mr. Hughes, the surveyor, was then present—I seized the cask—Mr. Major was sent for, the cask was examined, and was found to contain brandy—someone, Mr. Brown, I think, asked me what it was all about—I told him to ask Mr. George, he knew all about it, he had just delivered it—I then gave George into custody for the illegal delivery without payment of duty—I told Wiggins that I gave him in custody for assisting in the illegal delivery of a cask of brandy; and Pechell being there, I said "And you too"—Pechell said "I am only a labourer act<lb></lb>ing under orders"—I don't think Wiggins made any reply, but wanted to go and get his coat, he said to Pechell "Don't go"—the four were taken to the station, and the cask to the Queen's warehouse, and was pointed out to Darby.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">He-examined</hi>). Directly the prisoners were given in charge I went into the vaults and noticed that bungs had been taken out of several casks, I put a mark on those casks directly, since then stock has been taken by the Custom House Officers and there is an extra deficiency beyond the Crown allowance in those particular casks of rather more than 27 gallons—This brandy has been tasted and tested by two gentlemen in the trade specially called in—I know a little about brandy, I tasted the samples after they had been drawn and I have no doubt at all it is the same brandy.</p>

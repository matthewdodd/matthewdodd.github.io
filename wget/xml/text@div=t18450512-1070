About half-past eight o'clock on Monday night, the 5th of May, I was on duty in York-street, Westminster, and heard cries and screams of,"Murder!" which led me to the prisoner's house—he keeps a green-grocer's shop there—I saw a crowd outside—he was holding a woman by the hair with his left band, and with his right was firmly grasping a soldier who was trying to prevent him from injuring her—I took bold of the prisoner and succeeded, with the soldier's assistance, in separating him from her—she turned out to be his wife—I told him to be quiet and mind what he was about—he went into a back room, and I thought the affair was over—he came out in less than a minute with an iron poker and struck me with it on the top of my head, as my head was down raising up the woman—I said, "Have you a mind to murder me?"—he hit me over my arm, cut me on the temple, and knocked me down—my hat was off—I had not attempted to interfere with him when he came out of the back room, before he struck me—I did not know he was behind me—I was very much hart and have not yet resumed my duty—I saw a surgeon the same evening—as I was getting up the prisoner took a knife and made a blow at me with that—it cut my boot—he was down at the time—I had thrown him down—we had a long struggle after that—he nsed very threatening language, and aaid several times that he would murder me for entering his shop.</p>

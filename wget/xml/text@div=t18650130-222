                  </hi>. I live at East Ham—on the evening of 26th December, about 5 o'clock, I was in Spitalfields—I saw the prisoner there—I had seen him several times before—I asked if he knew a friend of mine of the name of James Walters—he said he did perfectly well, and if I would go with him he would show me where ho lived—we went together to a public-house—we did not stay there above six or seven minutes—we had a pint of ale, and left the public-house together—the prisoner was then joined by two men and a woman—they turned back with the prisoner and me, and when we got into the middle of Wood-street, the prisoner assisted the others to knock me down—they pulled my handkerchief and jacket off, and turned my pocket out, and took out three half-crowns and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have not seen them since—I have no doubt at all about the prisoner being the man—I went to the police-station the same night—I afterwards saw the prisoner sitting outside a public-house—I don't know the name of it—I went over and spoke to him, and the policeman was alongside of me—I said, "Do you recollect seeing me last night?"—he directly jumped up and thought to make his escape, but I caught hold of him, and he was taken into custody.</p>

On 27th December, the prosecutor gave me a* description of a man by whom he had been robbed—I went into Wentworth-street, and saw some persons standing outside a public-house—the prisoner was among them—I told the prosecutor to go over, and if the man was among them to take hold of him—he went over, and directly took hold of the prisoner, and said, "This is the man"—I crossed the road, and took him—I told him the charge—he said, "I was not out of my father's house yesterday from about 2 in the afternoon till about 11 or half-past 11 at night."</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 28, George-yard—I only know the prisoner by seeing him on Boxing-day, in Mrs. Campbell's house—there were several of the neighbours there; Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, the two daughters, and I and the prisoner—we went in there about 2 and came out about 11 at night—they were singing and drinking, and enjoying them<lb></lb>selves round the fire—I am sure the prisoner was there all that time—I was there all the time, except when Elizabeth Campbell and I went out for beer—the first beer we went out for was at half-past 2—that would not take us above two or three minutes—we went out again about 3 or half-past—every time we came back the prisoner was still there, sitting by the side of Mrs. Campbell.</p>

               <p>"Give me my watch." At that instant Bradley hove himself on my left shoulder, and by the weight of him on my shoulder, and having hold of the other, I was forced on the ground. Bradley attempted to rescue Ward, but as I recovered from my fall, I immediately caught hold of them both again, and held them - I was waiting for a friend. I called out for him, and he and the watchman came up instantly. I never let them go till I gave them in charge; Bradley had tried to rescue Ward as I was trying to secure the other man who got off with my watch. It was worth 8 l. together.</p>

             came after me and asked me, if I had not lost my handkerchief. I felt in my pocket and missed it; then I said I had, and it was a red and white one. I went back and saw the handkerchief in his hand as the people had hold of him, (produced in court and deposed to) marked T. P.</p>
               <p>James Mills. I happened to go into the chamberlain's office between one and two on the second of June; coming out again the prisoner was between Mr. Pilgrim and I; I, being behind, saw him run his hand into Mr. Pilgrim's pocket and take out his handkerchief. When I detected him he threw it down on the ground. The prisoner wanted to run away. Mr. Pilgrim came back and owned it, I had it in my hand when he came back. He insisted that the prisoner had taken it, but he denied it. I believe I laid it upon his hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>As I was going home I saw several people going into Guildhall, so I went, thinking to pass a quarter of an hour there. They were making free several young men. The office was ordered to be cleared ; a great number went out together ; going down stairs there lay a red handkerchief, and I was going to pick it up, but a man said, it is none of your's, and I said, it is none of your's; he then said, I suppose you picked somebody's pocket of it. A gentleman came out and said, you ought to carry him to the alderman, because a gentleman has lost several bank notes in a pocket book. Then this gentleman said he had lost his handkerchief ; so they took me before alderman Chitty, and he asked the man whether he was a housekeeper, and he said he lived in Bear-and-Ragged-staff-yard Whitechapel. I sent a person there, who said no such person lived in that place.</p>

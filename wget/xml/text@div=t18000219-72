               <p>Sykes. That made us suspect him, and then I desired he might be asked where he had lived in town, and I found he had lived with Mr. Foss, in Essex-street, and upon enquiry there, I found he had lived there about six weeks; I discharged him, and after that, a washer-woman brought a duplicate, which she said she found in the pocket of his great coat; after which we found one of my great-coats missing; in consequence of which, he, not having taken the things away, which the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180002190054"></xptr>washer-woman had to wash for him, I desired, if he came, that he might be stopped, and that I might be sent for; he accordingly came about the 21st of January, and I was sent for; I asked him how he could think of being guilty of stealing so soon after he came, for the duplicate was dated the 1st of January, and he only came on the 24th of December; he said, he had done it for want, and that he intended to get it out again; soon after this, the constables came, and I gave charge of him; they searched his pockets, and found upon him, four tea-spoons, and a duplicate of a pair of shoes; upon the constable taking out the tea-spoons, I said, Richard, whose are these? they are your's, sir, said he; how came you by them? he said, he was very apt to put things in his pocket; I told him, so it seemed; he said, he had put them in his pocket by mistake, and that he came for the purpose of returning them to me; I told him, I thought it was a pity he had not mentioned it before the constable took them out of his pocket.</p>

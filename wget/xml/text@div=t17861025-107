               <p>Was it at Charing-cross that the coachman got in? - No.</p>
               <p>At what time did the coachman get into the coach, and shut up the blinds? - The blinds were shut up.</p>
               <p>What time was it that the coachman got in? - It was the latter end of the night, which I suppose to be three o'clock.</p>
               <p>You know you were together about seven hours? - More than ever I was out in my life; it was ten o'clock when I first set off, we were half an hour drinking a glass of ale; I lived at that time in Denmark-court, No. 14.</p>
               <p>Now you live on Saffron-hill? - Yes.</p>

            , that was going out of town at three; but if I had been going on business of more consequence, that villain would have prevented me.</p>
               <p>How many pints of ale did you drink together? - I drank a glass of ale, but if I had got quite drunk, it is no reason I should be robbed of my property.</p>
               <p>By the time you parted in the morning, I believe you was pretty drunk? - I defy them to say so that I was drunk, or yet to say that they can disprove me, whether I am man or woman.</p>
               <p>How many fares were taken up, and how often did you ride on the outside of the coach? - They took up two fares, and the prisoner was behind.</p>
               <p>First you went out of town? - Yes, but they broke my command; I am not drunk now, I am rather confused at you; I wish to be as partial to the prisoner as any one, and to them all; I do not wish to be severe to any, and I pity the unfortunate, but I have been cruelly treated; I leave it to the Judge of the Court.</p>
               <p>Where did you first find this man? - He was first taken by one Lucas; he was taken the Sunday after.</p>
               <p>How often have you taken him up, and how often has he been discharged? - Once he was taken up by the constable before he was brought to justice; a second time he was taken up and brought before Mr. Justice Croft, then he was set at liberty; and after that he was taken up and discharged, at last he was committed.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not you swear that this young man's brother was the person? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you never had him in custody for this offence? - No, I never had him in custody; I gave him a challenge of it, and he went and charged the watch with me; I accused one brother in order to bring the other brother before me.</p>
               <p>Did not you positively swear to that brother before the magistrate? - No; he was not carried before any Justice, I went at the hour they ordered me, and he never came.</p>
               <p>Court. After you was used in this manner, who did you go to the next morning? - To the same place where I lived before, in Denmark Court, No. 14; I lodged with a woman that lives on the second floor; Mrs. Holmes keeps the whole; I was with her taking care of her child.</p>
               <p>How came you by the bundle? - I had been out that evening a visiting in Mincing-lane, No. 25. I took the bundle out with me to work; the gown was half made and half unmade.</p>
               <p>Who was that young woman you was going to see? -

               <p>Do you know any thing of the brother of this young man being in custody? - Yes, one morning; as far as I can recollect, she stopped him somewhere in the street, the watch was charged to take him into custody; I believe he was in custody all night, and the next morning the young man was brought up, and she never appeared; he was discharged.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I have been a farmer in the country, but now I am a <rs id="t17820911-11-viclabel62" type="occupation">coachman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17820911-11-victim155 t17820911-11-viclabel62"></join> in London; I lost my watch on the 19th, about eleven or twelve I had been out in the country with another coachman; I was not in place, he treated me, I was got a little merry, I was as sober as I am now, but higher spirited, and a young girl meets me which was catched last night, she asked me to go home with her, and she took me to the prisoner's apartment; I treated her with some gin, I know the house, and I know the door, I was as sober as I am this minute, I sent for some pork, and something for her supper, and in comes this other girl; and as we set at supper they asked me which I would like to stay with, and I told them: she was very well dressed then, she had fine black hair, and she looked very clever I thought.</p>
               <p>Court. Give your evidence with decency, because remember one thing, that no part of this does you any credit, you stand in a very aukward situation? - I staid with the prisoner, the other girl went away almost directly, I bolted the door fast, and we went to bed, we had not been long in bed before I went to sleep, Sir, and I awoke about three quarters of an hour, and she was dressed and stood in the middle of the room with my breeches in her hand; when I went to bed I looked at my watch, and I put the key into the pocket along with the watch, for fear she should see any thing of the watch, and it should tempt her, and I saw the money in my pocket, I counted it, there was a new guinea, the last years coin, that I had hoarded up a long time.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you leave your breeches when you went to bed? - I put them under the bolster; she dropt the breeches; I had not so much power to rise as I should at another time, and I went out of the room but could see nothing of her; I found my money and my watch gone; I went to the door and asked the people what I should do; says a man do not you move yet, hide yourself behind the door, stay and see if she will not come back, so I got and hid myself: and in about an hour in she came, then I took her; I found nothing upon her, we took her to the constable's at the watch-house, and she would not acknowledge, but going along she acknowledged the man that had the watch, and that she gave it to that other girl, I have had nothing of my watch or money again.</p>
               <p>What time did you go to bed pray? - It might be twelve, or between twelve and one; we set up a good while eating and drinking, we drank about two quarterns of gin and a pot of beer: when people are in such humours as them they do not take notice of such things.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that after the other girl went out of the room you had your watch and your money in your pocket? - I looked at it, whether she heard the rattling of the chain I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. You really took out your money to count it, and to see it? - Yes, Sir; I turned my back the other way and I took it out to see it, I saw the guinea, and the shilling laying like that, and I just wised it into my pocket again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, this man came down to New Prison to ask me if I knew any thing of the watch, I said I knew nothing of it; he said he would not touch a hair of my head. I have no witnesses.</p>

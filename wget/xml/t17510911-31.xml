I met her in Chancery-lane the Thursday following; and told her, she did not use the gentleman well to disappoint him; she said she would meet me in half an hour at the Chambers; I went about my business, and at the time went to the Chambers; there I found her in great disorder ringing her hands, crying saying her master was rob'd; I saw the rooms were very dirty, the bedding taken away, and the feathers scatter'd about; there lay a few feathers upon the mastress; the glasses, which were large panes of Crown-glass, to the book, case shatter'd to pieces, 10 or 12 of them; all the books taken out except a few small ones, which were at the top where the glass was whole. She said the windows were unbar'd; I look'd upon them and said they could not have been opened without hands from within, having all locks to them, being then fast lock'd.

                  </hi>. I am twelve years old and live at 3, Mitre Street, Blackfriars, with my father and mother—on Saturday, 7th July, I was in the garden which joins the prisoner's yard at the back—she has lived there a great many years and mother knows her—her yard has a chicken house against our wall—it has a sloping roof nearly to the top of our wall, which is 7 or 8 feet high—I saw the prisoner on the roof of the chicken house about 12 o'clock, with a beer can in one hand and a dead cat in the other, she said "You have killed my cat"—I said "I have not killed it, not hit it once"—she said "I will have your b-life"—my mother then came up and the prisoner threw some stuff at me over the fence, from the can—there was no cover to the can—some parsly was growing there, and I was about 6 feet from her—just a little spot went on my neck—I did not notice my mother at that time—I was stooping down sweeping the yard—I was not looking up towards her—the prisoner was not directly behind me, she was on one side—I did not see her throw anything, but I felt something on my neck, and when I looked up I saw the mouth of the tin, which was in her right hand—I did not hear her say anything more—I went in to my mother who was in the kitchen washing the breakfast things—I was pricked on my neck, but the mark has gone away—my clothes were burnt—these are them (<hi rend="italic">producing a felt hat and a pair of trowsers and a waistcoat, all covered with red stains, and a shirt with a great number of holes burnt through it</hi>)—my mother was in the house when I felt the stuff on my neck, and I went into the kitchen to tell her—the shirt and waistcoat have not been washed since—I had no flannel or linen of any kind under my shirt—I had no marks on my body, only one on my neck—my mother has kept the clothes since—I took them off an hour and a half afterwards, and I have not had them since—I cannot swear to this can.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of the last witness, and live at 3, Mitre Street, Lambeth—the prisoner's house faces mine, and the chicken-house is against the end of the wall of my garden, which is about 12 feet long and 8 or 9 feet wide—the fowl-house comes nearly up to the wall, and the bottom of the fence stands on the wall—the top of the fence is about 7 feet from the ground—the wall is 5 feet high and the fence 2 feet—the roof of the fowl-house comes to about 1/2 foot from the top of the wall and the width of the sloping roof is 2 feet or 2 1/2 feet; it is made of wood and there is plenty of room for any one to stand there—on Saturday afternoon, 7th July, about 12.15, I heard a disturbance in my garden; it was after dinner, because I have my dinner early on Saturday, and it was an hour or an hour and a half after dinner—I heard the prisoner hallooing at my boy, but did not hear the words—I went out and saw the prisoner on top of the chicken-house—I said "Whatever is this disturbance about?"—she said "He has killed my cat with poison, I will have his b——life"—a woman in the pri<lb></lb>soner's yard spoke to me at the same time, but I did not hear what she said—I do not know whether my boy heard the prisoner say that, he was stand<lb></lb>ing near the dust hole, he was very near—I made no answer, but told him to finish what he was doing and make haste and come indoors, and I went into the kitchen, but before that the prisoner said "I will burn him and his b——garden too"—I said that if she did such a thing she would suffer for it—she made no answer—I left the boy sweeping the path and went in, and about three minutes after that he came in to me and said</p>

               <p>"Mother, Mrs. Barry has thrown something over me, and it is burning ray neck"—his hat looked red, but not so bright a red as it is now, because it was not dry—I did not stop to notice his other clothes—I ran down the garden with the hat, and jumped on a box and saw Mrs. Barry standing on the chicken-house, and said "Whatever have you thrown on my child, you wicked woman <hi rend="italic">?"</hi>—she said "I did not do it"—I said it is all over the place, everything in the garden where it was, is burnt up"—she said no more I went into the Kitchen and locked at the boy to see whether he was burnt and he had a little mark just by his collar—his clothes were all coming to pieces, as he moved his arm they tore into holes; his waistcoat turned white and his hat turned red; his skin was not burnt, but his shoulder looked red.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not tell the boy at the time that it was vitriol, but I did after I took him to the Court on the Monday—his clothes have not been washed since, they had been washed before—I wash every other week—the holes were in the clothes when I took them off the boy, as they are now—there was just a little mark on his neck like a graze—I told him afterwards on the same day that she said she would have his b-life; he was mad to drive the cats about, and 1 thought it better to tell him to prevent his driving other cats—I told him that before I took his clothes Off just before I came back with his hat—a man and woman were in the pri<lb></lb>soner's yard at first, but not when she used that language—when she first spoke to me those people spoke to me and I told them it had nothing to do with them and to mind their own business; I could just see their faces over the wall; they were afterwards witnesses at the police-court; I do not know their names; I did not see them when this conversation took place—I said at the police-court "There were two other people in the yard, but they could not have heard what she said"—I took some of the stuff off his hat with my fingers, it looked a pale red, it did not burn, I wiped it off directly—some weeks before this the prisoner said "How tiresome he is to the cat," or something like that—she complained that he would run out and halloo at her—I said "He don't harm the cat, it is great folly of you to take notice of him, it is the only way he has got, because the cat rakes up his flowers"—the cat never annoyed me—I do not think I said at the police-court "The cat annoyed me by pulling up my flowers;" I think my boy said that—the Magistrate asked me what the cat did in the garden and Isaid that she pulled up the flowers—the prisoner and I have always passed the time of day from the windows and have been friendly up to a week or two ago, when this happened to the cat—I think the cat looked starved.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Stones End, close to the police court—I examined these clothes before the Magistrate on 17th July—the hat is stained by some strong acid, sulphuric, probably; and what would produce that appearance on a felt hat, would most assuredly hurt the human skin—there is no brown or red on the shirt, but the holes are such as acid would produce—I say the same as to the waistcoat and trowsers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It must have been a strong acid to produce that effect on a black felt hat—I know something about acids, but am not an analyti<lb></lb>cal chemist—I cannot give you an idea how long acid would be acting on this hat, it would depend upon temperature and other causes; probably in a quarter of an hour, in the ordinary condition of the atmosphere—I cannot tell how soon it would turn red, whether immediately or not; sulphuric acid would not discolour the shirt but it would gradually rot—a strong acid would destroy the fabric in half an hour—the trowsers are burnt through but not the lining—acid which burnt through trowsers of this kind, would, if it fell on the skin, produce inflammation of the cuticle, and great pain, undoubtedly—if inflammation set in it might last days or weeks and lead to serious consequences of health and life—if inflammation was set up I should expect it to last much longer than twenty-four hours—I do not think the mark would disappear in forty-eight hours, but it would depend upon the amount of inflammation—I saw the boy on the 17th, there was then a small mark on his neck to which I attached no importance; it might have been a little <hi rend="italic">exema</hi> of the skin, or a little graze; it was a little <hi rend="italic">papillice</hi>, not like a burn; I do not think it was produced by acid—it was not like a burn from acid, and if such as injured this hat, had fallen on human skin it most have injured the skin also.</p>

It is not usual to keep acid of this strength in tin, it should be kept in a glass—I wish to observe that the acid, though trong, relatively, must have been diluted, and I understand that the prisoner was cleaning tins—the acid might be strong enough to burn this shirt while on the boy's shoulders and yet be absorbed by the shirt and not be strong enough to burn his skin.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SAFFORD</hi>. The acid might not burn his skin because it might be intercepted by the fabric—the cloth might be destroyed and yet the skin escape injury—the cloth would absorb the acid; it would depend upon the quantity; if there was not enough to penetrate, then the skin would escape, but it would effect the skin if the quantity of acid was large—it is possible to throw acid on the clothes and destroy them without injuring the skin—acid of this strength placed in a beer can soldered together, would destroy the metal, but I cannot say in what time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Pure sulphuric acid would burn a hole immediately almost like flame, and it would be more likely to injure the skin—if material saturated with acid of this strength touched the skin it would at once cause inflamma<lb></lb>tion, but if it was diluted it would gradually destroy the material without injuring the skin under it—the speed with which the material is destroyed entirely depends upon the strength of the acid—weak acid would not be so likely to destroy the skin as strong acid—sulphuric acid is made enormously strong, but a very weak solution would not burn a shirt into holes—twenty drops in a quart of water would not affect the skin—the area of the spot injured would make no difference in the inflammation, it depends upon the intensity of the acid—the shoulder of the shirt is lined, and the lining is</p>

                  </hi>. I am a comb maker, and work at 2, Mitre Street, next door to Mrs. Gettis, at the back, on the first floor—on 7th July I heard a disturbance, looked up, and saw Mrs. Gettis and Mrs. Barry quarrelling—I knew them as neighbours, but not by any particular acquaintanceship—the prisoner was standing up on something in her yard with a cat in one hand and holding the railings with the other; she accused Mrs. Gettis' boy of poisoning the cat, and said that if she got hold of them she would pull all his flowers up—he told her that she was a liar, and that he did not poison</p>

               <p>the cat—I said to Mrs. Gettis "I know your boy has been very spiteful to the oats about here lately"—I did not hear Mrs. Gettis say anything—I did not see Mrs. Barry throw anything, but I did not see her all the time—I saw nothing in Mrs. Gettis' hands; I think she was nursing a child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When my notice was attracted the prisoner was on the railings and the boy was close to the dust-hole, about 8 feet from the wall—I also saw Jeffrey in the prisoner's yard—I did not hear Mrs. Gettis accuse the prisoner of throwing something over her child</p>

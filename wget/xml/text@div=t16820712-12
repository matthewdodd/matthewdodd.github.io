This having passed for the space of two Months, at last they hapned to meet in Covent-garden, where, in a Tavern, after they had drank several Bottles of Wine, much Discourse hapning, they began to talk about Manhood; the person killed saying, He fear'd no man with a Sword, so be it he had a Stick: and as for Dod's Sword, he said, It was so simple a one, that he could put it by with his Hat. Whereupon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16820712004"></xptr>Dod taking it up, began to Fence against him with the Scabbard on, making Offers and Passes, till at last the Scabbard, as he pretended, fell off, though many were of opinion he pulled it off: He thrust his Sword into the Body of Catling eight or nine Inches, and likewise gave him another Wound, and then breaking his Sword, fled; Catling dying before the Chyrurgeons could dress his Wound.

                  </hi>. I am clerk at the Westminster Police-court—on 13th February, a charge was preferred there against a person of the name of Purdue—it was upon an information—I have the information here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is an information signed by two witnesses in order that a (summons might be granted against Purdue for perjury; a summons was then issued—the information contains the allegations of perjury—the matter came on for hearing on 13th February, at the Westminster Police court—the defendant then gave evidence on behalf of Purdue.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I submit that the summons ought to be produced, that being the only evidence of the nature of the charge which Purdue was called upon to answer.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">for a walk, but that the dog did not go near Ryan</hi>)—This is the usual information that Magistrates require, of two witnesses before issuing a summons—Purdue was told what he was charged with; I read out the summons to him—the charge was communicated to him by the reading out of the summons—the information was not read out; it never is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

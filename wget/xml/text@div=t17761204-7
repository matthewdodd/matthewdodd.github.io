             said he saw a man come up the yard; I came to the window, and in a few minutes saw a light and presently the door opened, and I saw Fennelson in his shirt; he looked out at the door as if he looked for some body, then he went in again and came out with a large lump of sugar; Lyons then appeared, and took the sugar and put it in a sack. Fennelson went in, and Lyons took the bag and went off; I gave a sign to the men to go out after him; I went out and saw a man about half way down the passage, close to the wall, endeavouring to conceal himself; I laid hold of him and the bag and brought him into the house, where we found Fennelson; we secured them and sent them to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How long has the prisoner Fennelson lived with Mr. Blunt? - He lived there before I came there.</p>
               <p>Whether the employment of a miller in a sugar-house is not a place of the greatest trust? - No; I know no distinction, the servants are all intrusted alike.</p>
               <p>I believe in general, the people employed in sugar-houses are foreigners? - There are foreigners in sugar-houses.</p>

               <p>Whether the majority are not foreigners? - I cannot say, in our house, whether the majority is on the side of the foreigners or not, they are all, I believe, Irishmen and Dutchmen.</p>
               <p>Pray is not the yard from which you saw the sugar conveyed a common yard? - It is a yard that belongs to Mr. Blunt, other people have across to it, there is a way through it; I seized Lyons with the bag and the sugar in his hands; Fennelson put it into the bag, he appeared to let it fall.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Blunt.</p>
               <p>Was you appointed by the last witness to watch the prisoner? - Yes; I stood at the window and watched, I saw Lyons come up the yard; we stood and watched, till Fennelson came down from his bed-room; he opened the door and looked out, and the other shewed his face to him, then Fennelson went back and brought the sugar and put it into the bag, while Lyons held the bag; Lyons then took it up on his shoulder and carried it away; we catched him under the gateway.</p>
               <p>Did you find the sugar in the bag? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What quantity of sugar was there? - I cannot tell, I did not weigh it; I took it to be about a quarter of a hundred weight.</p>

               <p>How long have you lived with Mr. Blunt?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177612040012"></xptr> - Two years the seventh of August last; I am a German.</p>
               <p>There are a greater number of Germans at Mr. Blunt's than of any other nation?  - Yes; the most of us are Germans.</p>
               <p>Are not Germans apt to be very much offended, if any people of another nation are employed? - I never heard of that.</p>
               <p>Is the miller in a sugar-house the head servant, or a common servant? - He has his work by himself; he is to grind the sugar, and when he has done it to help the other servants.</p>
               <p>Is he not much more trusted than the common men ordinarily are? - I cannot say that; I cannot say he is any more trusted than another is.</p>
               <p>Was there ever any quarrel between him and the Germans in the house? - No; I cannot say that there was.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning was it you saw him bring out the sugar? - Between five and six.</p>

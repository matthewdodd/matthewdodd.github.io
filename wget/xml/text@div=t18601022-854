                  </hi>. On 20th September I went with Inspector Bryan and some other officers to Old-street, St. Luke's, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoners in a pony cart—the pony was stopped—I said, "Well, Mr. Pritchard, I have received instructions from the authorities of the Mint to pay attention to you as being dealing largely in counterfeit coin"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "Come out of the cart"—he did not do so; Inspector Bryan pulled him out, and Harvey and Elliott seized Thomas—I had seen him pull his right hand out of his pocket</p>

               <p>and drop a parcel at the bottom of the cart—I put my hand in Pritchard's right trousers pocket and found this bag with a counterfeit half-crown and a shilling in it, wrapped separately in paper—I showed him the coin and said, "What do you call this?"—he said, "I called at Mr. Hunt's coffee-house this morning and had my breakfast; I had change and got it there"—I said, "Very well, I shall inquire"—he then said, "O no, I did not; I did not know it was bad"—I went to the cart and picked up the parcel which Thomas had dropped—it contained six counterfeit shillings wrapped in paper—I said to Thomas, "You were not so successful as you were that evening when we apprehended Jack Derby; you got away in the crowd"—he said, "You've found nothing on me, you can do nothing with me."</p>

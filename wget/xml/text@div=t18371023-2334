                  </hi>. I am the wife of Gabriel Barnett—he keeps a shop on Great Saffron-hill. The prisoners came on the 18th of October, and asked to look at some waistcoats—I showed them some—Knapp tried them on—Langdon told me to go outside and get another one, and as I came in I met Langdon going out—I showed Knapp another—he said that would not do—I said I had a very handsome one—I went to look for it, and it was gone—it was on the counter when they came in, and no one could have taken it but Langdon—I asked Knapp where his friend was—he said, Gone to work—I said he had taken a waistcoat—I left Knapp with my father while I went to get an officer—I have not seen the waistcoat since—it is lost—Langdon was taken the next night—I could not swear to him, but he owned that he took the waistcoat, and I believe he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was sent for, and took Knapp—he had no money at all—as I was going to the station-house, he said it was not him that stole the waistcoat, it was the young man that was with him, and gave me directions where to find him—I went the next night, and took him near the spot that Knapp told me—near the Victoria coffee shop, Chamber-street, Whitechapel—I asked if his name was not John Langdon—he said, "I know what you want, I have done wrong, I must suffer for it; are you the man that belongs to the shop?"—I said no, I was an officer—he said he sold the waistcoat in Petticoat-lane, for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

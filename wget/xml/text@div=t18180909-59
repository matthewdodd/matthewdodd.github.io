On Saturday evening, the 25th of July, about eleven o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and bought a shoulder of lamb, which came to 3s. 1d. He tendered me a 1l. bank note, I asked him his name and address, he said, "John Sergeant, 15, Ratcliff-highway." I told him I supposed it was a bad one, and questioned him farther where No. 15, Ratcliff-high way was; he then said he lived up a little street, near the Black Dog, public-house, but the name of the street he did not know, as he had not been there long. I asked him where he took the note? he said he took it of a gentleman on Tower-hill, for work; and that he had worked very hard for it. I rubbed the word London, and told him again I thought it a bad note; he told me not to deface it, but to give it him again. I told him I did not think it prudent to return it to him, as it was bad. I sent my boy for an officer. I took him myself to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to run away - A. No; he went out of the shop, but did not attempt to go away - He knew I had sent for an officer. I was near enough to prevent it,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090029"></xptr>if he had attempted. I left him at the watch-house. As I returned I met Jackson, the officer, and returned with him to the watch-house, and put my name on the note. I had kept it in my pocket all the while. I then told him I should send an officer to see if it was his right address; he then said I had bullied him at the shop, and therefore he was terrified, and that his name was Jeremiah Bryan, and that he lived at No. I, Little Prescott-street. He said he had found the note on Tower-hill, about thirty or forty yards from the pump (looking at the note), this is it; the prisoner put his mark on it, and I and Jackson signed it. Jackson told the prisoner he had better mark it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not stop in your shop twenty minutes and outside, when you sent for the watchman - A. I sent to a person at the top of Old Gravel-lane, to come and see if he knew the prisoner - He came, and said he did not know him. I do not know whether the prisoner was outside or not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From the time you intimated to him that you thought it bad, was you near enough to see him if he ran away - A. I think I was. He told me I had better go to his address; I thought proper to go to the watch-house first. He offered to go any where with me. I never parted with the note till I had marked it.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he gave you the address had you told him you suspected it was bad - A. No. I had said nothing to intimidate him before he gave me his address.</p>

            . I am constable of St. George's in the East, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house. I saw Curtis sign the note, and requested the prisoner to mark it-(looking at it)-this is it. I asked the prisoner where he took it? he said he took it of a gentleman on Tower-hill for work. I asked him what part of Tower-hill the gentleman lived at? He gave me no answer. I asked him the gentleman's name? he said he did not know it, and then told me he did not get it of a gentleman, but found it on Tower-hill. I asked him why he said he received it of a gentleman if he found it? he said he thought it better to say he worked for it than that he found it. I took it to the Bank Inspector.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CHRISTMAS. I am a bank note inspector. I look at the note-it is forged both in paper, plate, ink, and signature. It is not Consett's signing.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER CONSETT. I am a signing clerk of the Bank. The note is note signed by me.</p>
               <p>(The note put in and read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found it on Tower-hill on the 25th of July, as I returned from work. Not being a scholar, I did not know the amount, but thought it was a note, and took it to Curtis, who said it was forged, and that I had been there before with forged note. I was confused at the charge, but did not attempt to run away.</p>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. On Tuesday morning, at two o'clock, I was passing up Wych-street, on the right-hand side of the way, towards the Olympic theatre; I saw four or five men scuffling or fighting on the right-hand side, and on the left-hand side I saw two men, who proved to be the prisoner and the deceased - I saw Read push or strike James in the chest - he instantly fell; I ran, and took the prisoner into custody, and sprung my rattle for assistance; Lewin came up - I told him to look to James, and said I believed he was dead; I directed Lewin to bring him to the station-house if he got better, to give charge of the prisoner; I took the prisoner to the station - James was brought to the station, and Spencer followed; James did not seem much hurt at the station-house - he said, in the prisoner's hearing, that he had lost his handkerchief, and that the prisoner was not the man who struck him; I said, "If you choose to give charge of him I will answer to his being the man who struck you;" James was the worse for liquor - there is no doubt of the prisoner being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290078"></xptr>the man who struck him; there was an oyster-shop open on the right-hand side of the way, which threw a light on them, and I seized him immediately - I was within ten yards of them when the blow was given; after James was brought to the station I turned his head back to the gas, and saw on the back of his head the cut he had received by the fall - it did not appear very serious.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were assembled? A. About five on the right-hand side, and two on the left - it was in a narrow part, near Newcastle-street, but still it is the widest part of the street; I was coming from the Strand towards Newcastle-street - the light was nearer to me than the prisoner - it threw a reflection on the two on the opposite side; what took place might have been seen by the persons in the oyster-shop - the deceased would be as likely to see the person who struck him as I; I did not tell the Magistrate I had locked him up because he would not give the prisoner in charge; they were all three taken before the Magistrate, and fined 1s. each - Spencer did not request me to send for a medical man to the deceased; it happened near Lyon's-inn, under the dead wall - there was a general fight on the right-hand side, but on the left I did not see James strike at all.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were the deceased and the prisoner separated from the others? A. Yes; the light from the oyster-shop reflected on the dead wall - I took the prisoner at the deceased's feet, as he fell; there was no other person so near - the inspector locked them up for being intoxicated; after the prisoner was discharged from Bow-street, he said that it was perfectly right, and that he had struck James; and when I took him on the Corner's warrant, he said he did push him down, but did not think any thing serious would happen to him - I saw his hands go against the deceased's chest, and he instantly fell.</p>

            . I am a nurse to the Middlesex-hospital. I remember Charles James being brought there on the evening of the 1st of November - Spencer called two or three times to see him; he seemed rather in an insensible state when he was brought to the hospital - he was attended by Mr. Pagson, the house-surgeon; he died on Thursday, the 8th of November.</p>
               <p>MILWOOD PAGSON. I am house-surgeon at Middlesex-hospital. Charles James was brought there; I attended him - his death was occasioned by the injury done to his brain; there was a slight would on the back of his head, but which was not connected with the fracture: on the post mortem examination an extensive fracture of the skull was found, and the bone slightly depressed; I do not think the fracture to be produced by a fall - it must have been from a blow, or by falling on the head, and coming in contact with some hard substance; the fracture began on the right side of the head - there was a concussion of the brain, which would be produced by a violent fall against a hard substance; the only external appearance was the wound on the back part.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the pressure of the skullbone on the brain produce death? A. No - there was a clot of coagulated blood on the brain, and a fracture opposite it, on the other side; I should say the two together produced death, but not the wound on the back of the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the concussion and fracture arise from the same act as produced the mark on the head? A. I should say they were different - I do not think the fall on the pavement produced the mark on the back of the head.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The fracture on one side, and the concussion on the other, would arise from the same cause? A. Yes, that is very common; the wound on the back of the head was very slight, and might be occasioned by a fall or blow.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Suppose the fall to have produced the fracture and concussion, would he be likely to be insensible from it at the time? A. He might or might not- it is probable.</p>

            . I am a working-jeweller. I saw the whole transaction; I was perfectly sober - I was standing at my door at two o'clock in the morning, when the prisoner's party forced the deceased and Spencer against Ruthven's shutters; Spencer lifted up his hands to resent it, and he was immediately bit between his eyes, and knocked down, and likewise James - they had not given the slightest provocation; they were coming along quietly, arm-in-arm - the deceased retreated across the road, on the defensive - and about the curb-stone the prisoner hit him on the bottom of the throat, and knocked him down on his back, against the curb-stone; the prisoner appeared one of the party who first attacked them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was a late hour to be at your door? A. I am later than that sometimes - I have two shops; there were four or five in the prisoner's party - the pavement is narrow; Spencer and James were arm-in-arm, and would be likely to force persons off the pavement.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did they attempt to force any body off? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had supped at the Angel inn, and was walking home, but had nobody with me - there was a fight in the street before I came up, and the deceased fell against me.</p>

               <p>Q. The exact quantity of this particular bale you don't know, I suppose? - </p>
               <p>Court. Is your warehouse within the gates of your yard? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Do you know the quantity nearly that is in this bale? - Ten pieces, about one hundred and fifty yards, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this deposited? - In the warehouse, which is over the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you describe the situation of this warehouse? - All the buildings adjoins, and this warehouse was connected with other warehouses, which join my house.</p>
               <p>Court. If I understand you right, there are gates to that yard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In that yard one side is the stables, over which is the warehouses, and the other side is your dwelling house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Who else, within this court yard, is in partnership with you? - Not any concerned in the business.</p>
               <p>Q. There are some other persons that live in the same yard with you? - None but tenants to me, who keep the tavern business.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not other persons accountable for the loss of these things besides yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there none of your own family concerned with you? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. You pay rates? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. In what parish? - In two parishes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what parish was this warehouse, where this cloth was removed? - It stands in both parishes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what parish is that part of the warehouse, from whence the cloth was taken? - In Christ Church.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - It divides in the warehouse, but the locks that were broke open were most certainly in the parish of Christ Church.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whe ther that part of the warehouse, from whence these goods were removed, was not in St. Botolph, Aldersgate? - I believe myself it is in Christ Church parish.</p>

               <p>Q. About ten o'clock at night on last Tuesday sevennight do you recollect observing any men come there? - Yes; I observed five, I see them walking backwards and forwards in the street, and taking great notice of the Bull and Mouth inn; and I went in doors, and when I came out again I went of an errand, it was between nine and ten; I saw two of them at the top of the street, and one of them said to the other, it will not do to night, and the other said, yes, it will, but it must be later. To the best of my knowledge Booth is one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice him particularly? - I think he is one.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you an opportunity to observe him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take notice of, the dress or the face? - I took such notice as I think I should know him again.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed? - In much the same dress as he s now; I think he had a light coat on the night that I see him.</p>

               <p>Q. What waistcoat? - I did not take notice. I thought he was after the Bull and Mouth inn; I had seen several men, for above a fortnight, taking notice of the Bull and Mouth inn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before? - Yes, I see him the Friday before in Aldersgate-street, him and a tall man, walking backward and forward.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a belief that you are almost certain; only you don't choose to swear to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt in your mind? - I have do doubt but he is the person.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw five men talking together. Are you sure that the men that you saw afterwards, at the top of the street, were two of these five? - Yes, I am; three of them went down the street, and two went up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. What time did you go to bed? - Between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you disturbed? - Yes; I did not hear nothing at all about it, only my father did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This was a dark night, past nine o'clock, and you had never seen the person before. Did not you state, be fore my Lord Mayor, that the person of Booth was dressed exactly as he is now? - Not to my knowledge, I don't think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a dark night? - Not a very dark night.</p>
               <p>Q. The moon was in its last quarter I believe? Pray, in what line of life are you in? - I live with my father and mother.</p>
               <p>Q. In Bull and Mouth street? - Yes, my father is a shoemaker, and I work at the binding of shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live at home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you again what my Lord asked you just now; consider, this man's life is at stake; and tell the jury whether you can take upon yourself to swear that he is the man? - No, I don't wish to swear.</p>

               <p>Q. That is a fact you must recollect, because they were taken up soon after the robbery. You spake then as you do now, of five men; was you as positive to these men being two of that five as you are now? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hesitate? - I don't think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a very material point, because where it depends on identity of a person,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170241"></xptr>it is very material to know whether you was at all times as positive? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never any doubt on your mind? - Never. When I went in before the Lord Mayor, my father said, now, look round, and see if you know either of these young men; and I looked at Booth directly.</p>
               <p>Were they in irons? - The other had, but not Booth.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing passing at Mr. Willan's last Tuesday sevennight, at night? - On Wednesday morning, about two o'clock, I had had some difference with my family, which kept me up till that late hour; I went up then to go to bed, and I went to my window to shut it down, and I observed two men standing by the side of Mr. Willan's door, directly I see one of them open it, as if he had a key to it; directly I see another man come out, as if he came to my door, and I heard an expression, it will do, George.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said that? - I cannot take on me to say. With that it struck me there was no good going on there; I see three of them enter the stable, and they immediately fastened the door after them; there was another seemed to watch outside. I continued to watch, and I heard them pass through the stable to a pair of gates that is a little above the stable; I thought I heard the bar of the gates taken down, the found was like the found of the bar being moved; I then soon after saw a light in the lost, pass backwards and forwards, over the stable, in a warehouse above, where the goods are deposited; I then thought that they meant to rob, and I watched an opportunity to get out, that was when the watchman came down the street, about half after one, and the man walked away. I should inform you, that the man that was watching got up to the lost door, and peeped through, and seemed to me as if he spoke something, but I drew back, because he should not see me. When the watchman came, I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get up to this door? - By means of the window, where the bars are underneath; he got up as far as the window by means of the bars. I went out, and told the watchman what I had seen, and asked him what he should do; he seemed to hesitate, that it was out of his beat; I told him he must not stand about beats in such a case as that; I told him to wait there, while I went down and alarmed the inn; and I went down and alarmed the inn. I knocked at the gate, and told the porter that opened the gate; he is the chamberlain or porter. I waited some time watching; when the three men that I see go in rushed out at the gate, where they had taken down the bar; I immediately ran after them, and pursued them, and I cried out, Stop thief; and the last man cried out, Stop thief likewise. When I came within three or four yards of the last, he was then turning the passage that leads into Little Britain, as he turned round he fired a pistol right at me, which alarmed me very much, and rather struck me so that I could go no further; it was two or three minutes before I recovered myself, and the watchman came up, and sprung his rattle. I lost fight of him then; I then ran down into Little Britain, and the watchman had got the prisoner Booth in custody. I ran the way that I supposed he ran that fired at me.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he gone in Little Britain? - He was at the bottom of the Britain, I suppose it may be about one hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What was become of the watchman that was with you? - He followed after, I believe, and assisted.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no opportunity of seeing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170242"></xptr>the face of the man that you followed? - No, I did not.</p>

            You don't know as to his person at all? - I cannot identify his person; when he was in custody of the watchman he was very much confused; he said he was pursuing the thieves, and that he belonged to the inn, and that his master had been robbed. They then took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. If I understand you right, you did not mean to speak, nor never did mean to speak, to the person of the man, whoever he was; and the pistol was not tried till he came into Little Britain? - No; is was fired at the entrance of the passage, at the top of Bull and Mouth-street.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no pistol found on Booth, I believe? - Not that I understand; there was a search made, and none found.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any body running between you and the prisoner? - I saw no body at all.</p>

               <p>I am wife to the last witness. I live in Bull and Mouth-street, opposite Mr. Willan's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at your door at one o'clock the night of last Tuesday sevennight? - Yes. Mr. Stanhope and I had a little difference, and I went to the door, because I would have no more words; and there were three men came past, and one of them said to me, what do you stay here for? I said, that was my business, and not their's. I think Simmons was one, but I could not swear to him, because it was moon light, and not so very light for me to swear to him. He asked me why I did not go in? I said I should when I pleased; and told him to go about his business. He asked me if I had lived there long? I told him eight or nine years; he then asked me if I knew old Mr. King, the grocer? and I told him, that I believed he dropped off his horse at Islington; he said that was right. He asked me if I knew Mr. King's son? I said yes; and he asked me if knew the opposite King? I told him yes. He asked me if I knew Mr. Wilson? I told him I knew every one in the street; and then Mr. Stanhope desired me to go in, and I went in, and shut the door, and the dog was out, and scratched at the door, and I went to let him in; and the noise of the door induced Mr. Stanhope to look out of window, and he came down stairs, and desired I would come up and see, for he was sure somebody had gone into Mr. Willan's place; and when I went up stairs, I see the light below, where the horses were, and I heard a kind of a bar taken down from the large gates, and then I see the light afterwards in the lost above, and the light, came up to the far end of the lost, which is the warehouse, a very great light, and then Mr. Stanley said, he would not stop any longer; and he ran down stairs. I said he had better stop a little, for the watchman was coming, and I would tell him; then he went up the street, and met the watchman about No. 17; he said it was not his beat - My husband went and alarmed the men of the inn; and in the course of that time there were three men came out of the gate; I see them come out, and they ran up the street towards Little Britain. When they came out, I cried out, Stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came out had you an opportunity of observing them? - I had not of the two first, but I had of the last. I believe that to be Booth; I think so; then I heard the report of the pistol; and the man that was the last made a slip, and something like a pistol struck, and I saw a flash come from it; and then he ran up the street, and there was the report of another; and then Mr. Stanhope drawed back.</p>

            Whereabouts was the man when you heard the report? - At the gateway; it flashed in the pan, it did not go off; I did not see any thing more of them till they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any more people abou there? - No, I did not see any thing but a man without, that got up and whiltled to them through the bars, at the left door.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you believe the last man was Booth? - I believe so, I am not quite certain.</p>

               <p>Q. From what you see you believe it to be Booth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was standing at the door, conversing with Simmons about five minutes. How far was you from him? - About the distance I stand from you; he stood across the kennel, behind the gate.</p>

            Then you do not mean to say positively that Simmons is the man, but you believe him to he the man? - I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Whoever was the person that was talking to you, he went down the street? - He did, towards St. Martin's-le-grand.</p>
               <p>Court. You speak of four men; three that were in the stable, and one that was outside; did you know him that was outside? - No, I could not know him again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How came you to be standing at the door at that time of the morning? - My husband and I had a few words.</p>

               <p>Q. This was in Bull and Mouth-street; there are some gentlemen in the city that know that street better than I do; I don't live in the city. At one o'clock in the morning you was standing at the door; was your husband in bed? - He was standing at that time with the street door in his hand, intreating me to come in.</p>

            He was not up stairs at all at the window? - No, not till he shut the door, and opened it again to let the dog in.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time this past, your husband was standing with the door in his hand? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. How many inches happened your husband to be from you at the time you had this conversation with Simmons? - If I had a person standing by, taking measure, I might have known it.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband was as close perhaps behind you as that gentleman is before you? - He was behind; I believe he might.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he must have heard all this conversation between you and Simmons? - I dare say if you ask him he will tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. This person that may or may not be Simmons, he asked you if you knew Mr. King? and he was as far off as this gentleman by my side? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. He spoke loud enough for you to hear what he said to you? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband was behind you as close as that gentleman is before you? - If you will come to the purpose I will answer you; I did not come here to talk family affairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this person said, does Mr. King live here? - No; he asked me if I knew King? and what then, that is not to the purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. When he asked you if Mr. King lived there, what answer did you make him? - He did not ask me that; he asked me if I knew him? I said I believed he was dead. I said, yes. Then he asked me if knew Mr. Wilson? I said, yes; and I said I knew every one in the street.</p>

I says to Duckham, mind be drops nothing; and he said no, I am not going to drop any thing; and we took him to the constable of the night at the watch house.</p>

My partner being just behind me, said, perhaps you are the man, and took hold of me. I turned round directly and said, very possibly you are; he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170245"></xptr>intimidated indeed, very much shocked, and we afterwards conveyed him to the watch-house.

            What was the colour of Booth's coat when he was taken? - I am sure he had a blue one on.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure that the person that fired the pistol was the person that you collared? - I cannot take upon myself to say which of the men it was; the other man ran up towards Butcherhall-lane way; there was none past me at all but this man.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see Stanhope? - I cannot say, for I went directly to the watch-house with the prisoner we had got, I and my partner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him? - The officer did when we carried him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any pistol? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search? - Yes; we came back and looked about the place, but could find none.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you are employed by Mr. Willan about his premises, the Bull and Mouth? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the warehouse? - Tuesday evening before it was broke open I did, about seven o'clock; I was working all that day, and when I left work it was about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the bales there deposited? - I did, three; one was deposited close to the warehouse door, a little on one side, on the left hand side of the door, and the other two were deposited to it against the front wall; they were perfectly safe packed with strong cordage.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Willan. Early on Wednesday morning, about two o'clock, when the alarm was given, I observed a pack cut open. I did not go into the warehouse the same way the theves broke in.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170246"></xptr>Q. Whereabouts was that bale of goods which you see cut open? - At the end of the lost near to the harness maker's room; they had taken the cloth, almost the whole of it within three parcels of that bale, and carried it to the further end of the lost towards the door, near the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to know where this particular bale had been deposited the night before? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the other two bales? - They were standing at the right hand of it. There was a place cut with a knife in one of the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the wrapper that contained this cloth? - The wrapper stood where the bale was cut open.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was the cloth that was taken out from the wrapper that had contained the cloth? - About forty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did you observe in the warehouse? - I found a dark lanthorn, a black bag, and an iron crow made out of an old file; I delivered these things to the constable who is at the door now.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed where the persons came in? - I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not go in the way you believe the thieves came in? - I did not; I believe they came in at a place called the Dunghill Gate.</p>

               <p>Q. Mrs. Coleman, now mind, I warn you that you speak the truth; recollect that you are sworn, and that you have been on your oath before; you have given evidence on your oath, and I am going to examine to the same facts; if you deviate, if you don't swear to what is the truth exactly, you may hear of it hereafter.</p>
               <p>Court. You are called here to give your evidence on oath, and you are told that you have been examined before, therefore a caution is given you to speak the truth; if you prevaricate and do not speak the truth you will be liable to be punished, both here and hereafter, therefore let this be a caution; perhaps you are going to say now what may be the truth, perhaps what you said before may be the truth; you stand there in a very suspicious light, therefore now be cautious.</p>

             at that bag; do you know that bag? examine it carefully woman, look at it? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't ask you yet? - Yes, sir, I believe it may be the bag; but I never see it open till I see it open at the house it come from, at Cow-Cross.</p>
               <p>Q. That was subsequent to this robbery? - A gentleman came on Saturday morning and said, is Mr. Simmons at home? and directly asked if he was a hatter? I shewed him his work shop, and all his tools. He said he was sorry for him to be in trouble, he would soon be out, it was only for an assault, or quarrel; he came again in about half an hour, and said, I have been to the Mansion House, and he said, I am all of a muck sweat; he untied a black thing in the handkerchief, and said to the mother, do you know this black bag? if you would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170247"></xptr>come and speak to it your son will soon be released out of trouble.</p>
               <p>Woodman. I never said such a word.</p>
               <p>Coleman. His mother said she could not leave the shop; then the mother said to me, you go and speak for him: she directly said she believed it was the boy's bag, or cloth. I went with the gentleman, and he took a coach and took me to the Hall. I came before the Lord Mayor, and I said, when is this poor man to be released? he said never mind, you will be paid for your trouble. He came with this bag before the Lord Mayor, and I said I had seen a black cloth under the bed, the gentlewoman's bed, but I never see it open in my life.</p> 
               <p>Q. Now you are sure that that man that stands by you said, that if you come and swear to this bag that this young man would be released? - I would not take a false oath for my life and soul.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to swear to the bag before the Lord Mayor? - The old woman said that she believed it was her son's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell my Lord Mayor that story as you do now? - I said the very same; I think I said what I say now; I said it was the bag that I had seen, cloth or whatever they call it. I was very much troubled about my own brother, who was gone for a sailor, and I had been drinking rather more than what I should, and I really cannot tell what I did say.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it on the evening that he was there? - It was in the morning, and I drank more than what I should, because I could not do my business at all after.</p>

            Therefore you don't know of your own knowledge that that was his bag? - No; nor I cannot swear that it was his bag, nor I never saw it opened no more than what the mother said.</p>
               <p>Court. You swore positively to this bag before the Lord Mayor, and I am confident if you had been in liquor, as you say, you would not have been examined at all there.</p>
               <p>Woodman. I was the person that went with this bag, and I said, is your name Simmons? to the mother-in-law; she said yes; I said directly, is your daughter at home? I come just to ask a simple question; I untied my handkerchief and I opened this bag, and I asked the mother-in-law if she knew this bag, that was all I said.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to the mother-in-law against these people? - I only went to get the bag identified. I don't know whether it was the mother or no, but I was directed by my brother officers.</p>
               <p>Court to Woodman. What did you say to her to induce her to go with you? - What I said to her was this, when I asked about the bag the mother said she could swear to it; and this woman came out of a little back room, and she said, I can swear to that little black bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her what she was going to swear about? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Johnson. This is the key of Simmons's own door, which I found upon him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you sometimes carry a key of your door in your pocket? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reward if a man is convicted of a burglary? - I don't know that ever I received it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a constable? - Five or six years.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know what the reward is? - I have been told it is forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if one man is convicted and forty pounds got by it, what is got if two men are convicted by it? - Double; that was not my intention of shewing the key.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Simmons. I leave it to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Simmons called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

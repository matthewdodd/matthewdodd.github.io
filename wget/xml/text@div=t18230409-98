             - I had known him some years; I said I was sorry to tell him his father was charged with pawning Mr. Knight's property, to the amount of 17 l., and I was ordered to take him into custody for stealing them; he was agitated. I found nothing particular on him. He walked with me to Duke-street, and he was unwell; it was necessary to take him into a house - he was lamenting the distress he had brought on his wife and family. I asked him whether it was a fair question if his father was wicked enough to induce him to rob his employers; he said No, his father did not. I asked him whether the property was pawned - he said he pawned none, but met his father by appointment in different places, generally in the street, and his father gave him what he pleased, but he knew nothing of any pawnings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was Mr. Knight present at this conversation - A. Yes; I suppose he heard all that passed. I said nothing to induce him to confess. We had a shilling's worth of brandy and water between us three.</p>

             re-examined. I have made a mistake - I did miss these articles about a week before. I have seen his father at my house, but do not know that he ever came beyond the passage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You was present at the time the marshalsman speaks of - A. Yes. I was so agitated that I hardly knew what I did, and the prisoner was much more so agitated. I heard conversation to the effect stated by Hawkins. He said his father met him by appointment to receive goods.</p>

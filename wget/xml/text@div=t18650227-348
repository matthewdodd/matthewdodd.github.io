                  </hi>. I am station-master at the Forest-hill station of the London and Brighton Railway—the prisoner was booking-clerk on the up-line and Brown on the down-line—on the evening of 16th August I took the money from the prisoner which he had received during the day, and asked him if the money from the down-office had been brought over—he replied, "No"—I told him it was time it had, as it was getting late, and I wanted to leave—I did not receive it that night, I left—I went to my office next morning, and found that the prisoner was not on duty—I made in<lb></lb>quiries, but have never received the money—I did not see the prisoner till he was in custody a fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had the prisoner any authority from you to receive the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have been station-master two years to-day—the prisoner was in the office before me—his father has been in the Company's service twenty years, and I have known him about fifteen years; his wages were 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—it was my duty to pay them—I received them from the Company to pay him—I have not paid him his full wages for the last nine months—I have paid him as little as 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—there had been deficiencies in his accounts, and I had had to pay money for him—it was ray duty to report it—I have withheld considerably more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from him—he did not complain of it, and tell me that he would not stop any longer—his father did not come to me and complain of my withholding money—I gave the prisoner leave of absence for four days four or five months ago, and he came back—his father did not come and complain of my stopping his son's wages on the representation that there were deficiencies, nor did he say, "If there are deficiencies in my son's accounts, report them'—I did not say that after so long I dare not do it—I mean to say that I paid every farthing of the deficiencies out of my own pocket—I. deducted them out of his wages—he was not responsible for the work of the clerk who precedes him, only for what the clerk pays over—I check the whole of the accounts in the morning, and the returns are sent to London—when the prisoner left he left about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the till—the accounts which he left on the up-side were correct; those were his own accounts—two other clerks named Graves and Watts, resigned; that was not because I stopped from their wages on the representation that there were deficiencies, nor did I threaten to do so—I never stopped any other clerk's wages—when the prisoner's accounts were made up, if they came to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he had not enough</p>

               <p>money to pay it, I had to pay the Whole amount to the Company in the morning—I stopped half-a-crown from his wages some weeks, and some weeks 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., sometimes 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he has sometimes come and asked me to let him have half-a-crown more, and I have done so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an eating house keeper, of Vere-street, Clare-market. On 7th Nov., about 8 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came—I had a bladebone of mutton in my shop, he offered me 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for; it was eventually agreed that he was to give me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I put it in paper, and gave it to him—he tendered me a good half crown, and I gave him two good shillings in exchange—he then said, "I did not mean to give you 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it"—I said, "You did"—he said, "I will not have it, "and put 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. down on the counter, one underneath the other—the underneath one was a bad one, and not one of those I had given him—I said, "That is not the shilling I gave to you, you have substituted a bad shilling in the place of my good one"—he said he had no more money about him, only a few halfpence—I sent for a constable, and the prisoner said, "You can search me, I have got no more about me"—(he had taken up the bad shilling)—while he was being searched, I heard the sound of coin dropping on the floor, and then saw him putting something into his mouth, which he pushed down his throat from the outside—three counterfeit shillings were found on the floor—he was then taken into custody.</p>

I was called to Mr. Symes house, and found the prisoner there—he said, "You can search me"—I was going to do so—in pulling off his great coat these three bad shillings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) fell from him on to the floor—as I was picking them up Mr. Symes said, "He is swallowing something"—I did not like to put my hand into his mouth, so I took my truncheon out, upon which he said, "Don't ill use me, it is too late"—I took him to the station, and he said, "That money you have got is mine"—I found on him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a pocket book.</p>

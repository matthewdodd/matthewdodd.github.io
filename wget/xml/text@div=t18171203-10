I got in through the next house, and found the back door open - I had left it bolted-the bolts were drawn. I found two drawers by the door, which had been taken from a chest in my bedroom.

               <p>SAMUEL MILLER. I am an officer of Whitechapel. On Monday evening, the 17th of November, about ten o'clock, I saw the prisoners standing at the corner of Wentworth-street, Brick-lane - I knew them before. Harmer saw me, and rather retreated; I thought I saw something in his hand, I ran after and secured him; I found the watch-chain, three seals, and a key, in his hand; Freeman was with me, and secured Rowter. While I was searching Harmer, I saw a watch on the place where Rowter had been sitting, immediately as he got up; Freeman searched him, and found two 1l. notes on him.</p>

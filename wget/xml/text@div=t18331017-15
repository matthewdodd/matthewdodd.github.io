             (policeman). I took the prisoner into custody at one o'clock next morning in a privy; I was on duty in Webb-square; I found 3s. 6 1/2d. on him, nothing else; I had no conversation, but at the station-house, he said he went into the Golden Heart public-house, in Felix-street, at half-past eight o'clock - it is near Webb-square, about the length of the Old Bailey from it - he said nothing more - I found nothing else on him - I showed him to Cook next morning at the station-house - he was the only prisoner there - she fixed on him without hesitation.</p>

            . I live at the Golden Heart - I know nothing about this, only the time the prisoner came into the house, which was about ten o'clock; it might be a few minutes before, but very trifling if it was before ten o'clock; he stopped there till nearly twelve o'clock, until we closed - our doors were shut, and we were clearing out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you a clock? A. Yes, we have a clock in the bar - I noticed the clock when he came in, because several others came in with him; some of them staid all the time he remained, and some left - I was going out at the time; there were five or six of them came in, one after the other; they appeared connected together, and sat together - I did not know any of them before.</p>

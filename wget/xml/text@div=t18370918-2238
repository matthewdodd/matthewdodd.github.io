                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. On the same Sunday morning, about half-past three o'clock I went to the garden belonging to Mr. Whiffin, and between then and half-past five o'clock I found a variety of articles, which I produce—a scarf, a pin-cushion, a tobacco stopper, and other articles—I also found a right-foot shoe in a potato garden in Mr. Whiffin's grounds—you would not go through it to get to the railway—it is the corner piece—the railway boundary wall separates the railway from Mr. Whiffin's premises—you would not go that way from the railway to the house—it is an angle, sown with potatoes—a person could get from Mr. Whiffin's premises to the railway by going through the potato ground—that shoe was afterwards shown to M'Conachy, and he said, "Oh, you have got my shot"—I was present when he said so—he then began to pull his stocking over his right toe to have the shoe put on, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Ayn't</hi> you going to give me the shoe?"—I said, "No, I must have the other one"—he took his other shoe off, and gave it me—when he said it was his shoe, I said, "Where did you leave it?"—he said, in the potato garden, or in the garden, among the potatoes—I cannot swear which—I did not fit the shoe on him, but I took the other one off, which was the fellow to it—they looked like a pair, and they certainly are a pair of shoes—they are nailed and ironed in the same manner—he asked me what he should do without his shoes—I said he should have a new pair—he asked when, and I said he would have to walk some distance first, and he said he was lucky like me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. On Monday, the 21st of August, I was in High-street, Shadwell, and saw Moore and Gilles in company with another person—I gave directions to have them looked after—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183709180180"></xptr>
               <p>Saw Moore, when the constable laid hold of him, drop himself down towards the kennel, and something white, having the appearance of silver, fell from him into the kennel—Gilles and other ran away—a man named Chata way, who is subpœnaed here, came up quickly, put his jacket over it, and walked off with it—I left the other two, and went after Chat away, and took him—I asked what he had there, and he had a pair of plated snuffers in his jacket, under his arm, with mud and filth out of the kennel on them—the jacket appeared just in the same way as when he gathered the things out of the kennel—I afterwards searched Moore, and in his hat found thus blue silk handkerchief, and a crape scarf; on his neck a remnant of silk tied as a handkerchief; and in his pocket, this small knife, attached to a piece of tape, which he was wearing at his button-hole—I apprehended Giles about twenty-five minutes afterwards—the constable took Moore, by my directions I found nothing on Giles belonging to the prosecutor—I asked him what he ran away for—he said, "I did not run away"—he said, "You are welcome to search me; I have nothing about me now"—Mr. Whiffin gave me the leg of the pair of snuffers, which are deficient a leg.</p>

               <p>calls are not paid at the time they are made—the call was honoured; it was not made so soon as we intended to have made it—the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. did not relieve them, for they were not in a difficulty—the notes were payable to him—I did not make it one 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as before, because the directors said, "We will reimburse it as the money comes in, being out"—if a man has them in his strong box they are liable to go out—the reason why a man not liable for a shilling endorsed these bills was this: I was about to retire from business, and told the prisoner I thought there was an excellent oppor<lb></lb>tunity for him to start in life, and do well; it would take up to the end of the year to work up my affairs, and we were making a calculation as to what was required to enable me to retire, and put him in my position; there was a feeling of confidence, and I had no hesitation in asking him to endorse the bills, as he would stand in my position as stationer to the company: it would give him a sort of influence for the future, and enable him to continue the business—he was not to be liable to the company for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., they were liable to him—considerably later than the endorsement was given I was sued for 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know when it was, for I never received the writ—I believed the prisoner had paid the money, as he had received such ample sums in the business—he saw a man issue a writ, but yet never said a word to me until there was a judgment against me; it was served on him, and a few days afterwards he told me that it was served—I said, "It cannot be a proper service, unless it is on me; what is it?"—he said, "An account"—I said, "You have had ample money to pay it"—he said that he would go and see them; and the next thing I heard was that they had signed judgment—I did not receive a writ from the prisoner in a letter when I was in the country—I never sent him to Mr. Gresley, of St. Pancras-lane; I sent him with a cheque to pay the money the moment I heard of the position of the case—there was not another clerk of mine called Oliver at that time, but previously—there was a book called the cash book—he debits himself in this book 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his business costs—I sent to Mr. Gresley, and said that I had never received the writ, and he consented to take a cheque for the money, and to give him a guinea for the little expenses he had been at, and I signed it.</p>

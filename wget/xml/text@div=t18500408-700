                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Shropshire Union Railway Company, and live in Great George-street, Westminster, on the second floor; I have two rooms, which communicate with each other. On 6th Feb. I had three brooches on a table close by the door of the first room, which is the bed-room—I saw them safe at eleven o'clock on a pincushion, and missed them at one—I have not seen them since.</p>

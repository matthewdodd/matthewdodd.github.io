There was no liquor at four o'clock, and Lee sent us to the gin-shop. They would not trust him. A man then asked him if he could sell him any meat - he took this man to the shop with him, but whether he sold him any I cannot say. As we were going home Baker said,</p>
               <p>"Here is a piece of meat Mead's man has given you, and he has given me a piece." I told my wife to take care of it, for he had robbed his master before, and I would take it back and shew him - but when I was in bed Lee came and asked for it. I said,</p>

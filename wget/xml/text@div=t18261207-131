            . I am an officer. I went to Colonel Armstrong's - she had told me her box was at No. 2, Burlington-street, where I found it; she said she did not know what she had done with the key; I saw her husband there - he pointed out her box, but could not find the key; I took him and the box to the office - they both told the Magistrate they did not know where the key was - he told me to break it open, and this property was found in it. I believe the key was found at Colonel Armstrong's next day.</p>

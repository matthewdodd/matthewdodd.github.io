Yes; about seven o'clock in the morning, I heard Mrs. Taylor call nurse, for assistance to make her head up, nurse went to her, and I saw her put her hand under the pillow, and take out the pockets; she put them on a shelf behind the curtain, and put a bit of flannel over them; in a short time afterwards, I saw her go and take the pockets again, fling her apron over them, and take them to the privy; she staid there a short time; when she came back, she brought the pockets with her, and put them under the pillow again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Mrs. Taylor was awake, and could have observed every thing that was done as well as you? - A. She was in bed at the time, I was facing her.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, you told Mrs. Taylor of it? - A. No, I kept my bed, and was at a distance from Mrs. Taylor.</p>

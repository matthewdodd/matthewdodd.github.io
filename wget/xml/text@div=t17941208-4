               <p>Q. Was you in the month of February last, a clerk in the house of Messrs. Godling, the bankers? - I was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080021"></xptr>Q. Did you, any time in that month, send a letter to Messrs Davis, in Lynn, in Norfolk? - On the 19th of February I enclosed them in a letter, directed to Messrs. Davis, at Kings Lynn, in Norfolk, five post bills, the number.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know these notes again? - I should know the numbers of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had enclosed these notes in this letter, what did you do with the letter? - I sealed it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the letter? - I put it in a post office in the middle Temple.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any of these notes here? - Two of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce them.</p>
               <p>(The notes produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are these two of the notes that you put in that letter, and directed as you mention? - Yes, they are.</p>
               <p>Q. That was on the 19th of February? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When did you see these notes for the last time? - They were first shewn to me at the justice's, in Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. You put these in the letters; where did you get these bank post bills from? - They were brought to us that morning from the bank.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You got these notes when you attended at the public office? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. That was some where about the 26th of September? - Yes, somewhere thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. And you put them, if these are the notes, inclosed in a letter the 19th of February? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is seven months before you received these at the public office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that from the 19th of February to the 20th of September, you never set eyes on them again? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. At the time of this robbery being committed, by whom at all did you hear of it? - About two days afterwards Messrs. Davis sent us a letter, and by that we were informed that these post bills were not arrived.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do in consequence of that? - We sent to the bank to stop the payment of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Of course when you went to the bank to stop the payment of them, you communicated to the bank the number of the notes? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And that within two days, you had enclosed them in this manner? - Within two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at the time you enclosed these five bank post bills, take any memorandum of the number of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that book? - At Messrs. Gostings.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must go and fetch it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Certainly the post office ought to be better prepared than this.</p>

               <p>Q. When you stopped him was you by the side of any water? - By the end of the bridge, close by the brook; Mr. Dickenson hallooed out; he came running without his hat, and when he came on the middle of the bridge I saw him make a motion with his hand, and I heard something fall in the water, but what it was I do not know; this was at about a quarter after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time, and when did you search the brook, to see what there was thrown in? - The next morning about seven o'clock I came down, and I had thoughts of looking into the brook, and the first thing I saw there was a dark lanthorn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else there? - Yes, a dark lanthorn and a bunch of picklock keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take these from? Was that part of the river within the throw of the prisoner at the time you took him? - Yes.</p>

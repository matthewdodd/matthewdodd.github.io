On the 25th of March I placed four dozen and a half of brushes in an old ragged apron, and over the holes of the apron I put a sheet of paper; I left them in my room at the top of the house, and missed them next morning - they are here now. I work for a person named Thompson, and I know they are the brushes I finished for him. The prisoner is a stranger.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The brushes were not there when I went on Easter Sunday morning - I did not get up till half-past nine o'clock, and I met two shop-mates - one Mary Scott went with me; there was a woman, who appeared in the family-way, there - she seemed ill. A man who was with her, said he would give anything if I would take her home, and give her a cup of tea. I took her home, and she recovered herself; the man said he had no money - he then took out one of his brushes, and made me a present of it for my hair; I put it in my bed, and there it was found; he then left eight brushes, and was to call again on the Monday, and pay the shilling which Scott lent him; he did not come, and I took them to pawn; the pawnbroker would not take them of me - I got Griffin to take them, and get a shilling, which was all I wanted. - The other thirty-nine brushes I know nothing about.</p>

Being asked how he knew the Person who robb'd him to be the prisoner at the Bar, he thus proceeded: I have known him 7 or 8 Years; the first Knowledge I had of him was from this Occasion. The House I lived in with my Master was pull'd down (we moving into an Alley backwards) the prisoner was employ'd to build it up again, in doing of which he was about 4 or 5 Weeks, during which Time I saw him 4 or 5 Times a Day, which gave me a perfect Knowledge of his person; being ask'd, Why he did not apprehend the prisoner sooner, the Fact being done on Easter Monday, and he not taking him up till the Friday following? to which he answered, When I came back without the Pigeon, and in a dirty Pickle with my being thrown in a Ditch, Mr.

My Friend advis'd me not to be too forward in taking him, but to defer it for a Day or two, in which Time I might have the Oportunity of seeing him again, and considering whether it was really he who robb'd me, that I might not begin to prosecute without good Ground of Assurance. I took his Advice, and being confirm'd in my Mind that he was the Person, on Friday I apprehended him, and carried him before Justice Harwood, to whom I told the whole Story at which Time he said the Fact appear'd very plain, but after examining his Witnesses and Friends, he withdrew, and after some Time calling me aside, told me, if I swore against Mr. Vevers, he would make me stand in the Pillory if it Cost him 500 l. after this, I took the Prisoner with a Warrant from the Bench of Justices.</p>

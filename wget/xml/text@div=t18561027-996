                  </hi>. I am the Vicar of Eating. On Mon<lb></lb>day; 13th Oct., I came down at about half past 6 o'clock in the morning, and found the drawing room window open, and a pane of glaw broken, just where the catch is—in my study, I found abuadant evidence of a stranger being there, and doing actions which were disagreeable to me, and I missed a timepiece, which had been safe the night before; also two great coats—a box had been forced open.</p>

From information I received, I searched the stock on the 16th Oct, and found that this clock (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) had been pledged on 14th Oct.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the duplicate—I famly believe the prisoner is the person who pledged it—it was Jtetweea 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning; I cannot say to half an hour, as the dock in the shop varies—it might have been as late as half past 10 o'clock, bat I think not so early as half past 8—I gave a description of the person, and on Sunday night was taken by a policeman to a public house, and saw the</p>

               <p>prisoner outside talking to a sergeant; I passed him, and thought by the light in the lane that I could not be positive of him—he went into the public house, I went in after him, saw him by the light, and came to the conclusion, in my own mind, that he was the man—nobody pointed him out to me—I said, "I believe I have seen you before; did you not pledge a clock at our place?"—he said, "God bless the man, you must be mistaken"—I said, "I am positive that I am not."</p>

On Tuesday, 14th Oct., I went to Mr. Helton's, and found that an entry had been effected by the drawing room window; some drawers, a desk, and a mahogany box were broken open—from information I received, I went to Mr. Trail's shop, and on Sunday night I examined the prisoner's house, knowing where he lived, and found a waistcoat and this screwdriver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which fits the marks on this box of Mr. Helton's; they correspond exactly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is the prisoner a cabinet maker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a screw-driver was produced at the public house, not exactly like this; it would not fit the box so well, but I think it would open it—it was, I believe, pro<lb></lb>duced by Mr. Shifney, the landlord, who is a friend of the prisoner's; he brought it to show that it would nearly fit—he heard the case, and said, "I or any man might have a screwdriver in his house," and produced one, but it did not fit quite so well as this."</p>

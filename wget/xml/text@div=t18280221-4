            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 14th of January, about a quarter to seven o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in Rose-street, Long-acre, and observed the two prisoners coming up Rose-street, towards Long-acre; Westbury had a bundle; Wicks had nothing that I perceived; they were walking together in company - I crossed over, and asked Westbury what he had got in the bundle - what it contained; he said it contained some dirty linen - I asked where he fetched it from; he said from his sister's in Rochester-row, Westminster; I asked what he was going to do with it; he said to take it to get washed; I then took them to a public-house, and asked him before I opened the bundle, if the linen was marked - he said No; I then examined it, and found it was marked - here it is: here are 2 pinafores, one marked A. C., 3, the other E. C.; 2 boy's shirts, marked J. C. 3 and 4, and 2 black frocks, not marked; I then searched Wicks, and in his waistcoat pocket found 10 silver spoons not marked, 6 are plain fiddle-heads and 4 double threaded - I have had the property ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Wicks give an account of the spoons? A. He said a man gave him half a crown to carry them, but did not say where to.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was with Ledger, and assisted in taking the prisoners; I found in Westbury's pocket, a small penknife, with the point broken; I have had it ever since - I found on him the duplicate of a handkerchief, pawned in his own name - I saw ten silver spoons found in Wick's fob.</p>

On Monday the 14th of January, I lost a clock, 10 teaspoons and some children's clothes; I found them all at Bow-street - except the clock, the property produced is mine. I left home early in the morning, returned at seven o'clock in the evening, and found a pane of glass broken in my front kitchen window, by which means they must have unfastened the sash, by introducing a hand; the window was shut when I saw it - it was perfectly secure, and not broken when I left it in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you go out in the morning? A. About a quarter to eleven o'clock; I left my wife in the house but nobody else - we keep no servant - the window was not open when I returned; it must have been opened to get the property, unless they were let in at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210006"></xptr>the door; I found the door quite secure - the lock has a spring bolt; we occasionally have a char-woman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. They could have shut the window after getting out? A. Yes, but I presume they went out at the door; I found some dirt within the window; as if somebody had got in there.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife; I went out on this day at half-past four o'clock - I was the last person in the house, and left it perfectly secure: the kitchen window was not broken then - nobody had any business in the house besides me and my husband; I did not return all night myself - I had seen all the property and the spoons in the house in the course of the morning; I shut the door after me, and am sure the spring caught - I know all this property to be ours - I marked the linen myself, and know the spoons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know the spoons? A. I swear to four, by the pattern; one of the others by a small dent, and the others being exactly like it, I presume they are mine - that is one of the fiddle headed ones.</p>
               <p>Q. When you shut the door, how were you to open it again? A. With a key; it is a common key - I left nobody in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the char-woman have called in your absence? A. She could not have got in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you expect her that day? A. No; she lives in Wilton-street.</p>
               <p>WESTBURY'S Defence. I and Wicks were going up St. Martin's-lane, a man came up and asked us to help him carry a bundle, as he had another, and he would give us something - I asked, how far it was to go; he said to Long-acre; he told us to go up Rose-street, and keep before him, when this gentleman detained us - we looked round for the man, and he was gone.</p>
               <p>WICK'S Defence. When I was taken, I looked round for the man who gave them to me to carry; the officer found the spoons on me - I was going to give them to him, but he said "don't put your hand in your pocket;" he said at the office, that we said, we had them from our sister - we never said so.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner Wicks a good character.</p>

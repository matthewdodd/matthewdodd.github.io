I let down the Glass, and the Prisoner came to the Door, and presented a Pistol within the Coach. Pray Friend, says I, take away your Pistol, which he did. Mr. Wightman, who sat on the other side, said, What's the Matter? Why, don't you see his Pistol? says I. Upon that Mr. Wightman starts up, and says, I have got two half Guineas, and some Silver, and I'll give them you presently. Mr. Wightman gave him something; but not satisfied with that, the Prisoner would search him, and then making me stand up, he searched me.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you certain that the Prisoner is the Man? Had you any Light to see him by?</p>
               <p>Mr. Lloyd. Yes, a Servant attended the Coach with a Moon, and I saw the Prisoner plainly by that; I look'd full at him all the Time. The Moon was a little way off, as far perhaps, as from your Lordship to me; but it was so placed, that it cast a Light into the Coach. After the Prisoner had robb'd us, my Coachman leaning from his Box, I heard a Pistol go off, at which the Horses started and run forward. Next Morning I went to Newgate, and desir'd the Keeper to let me see the Man who was committed. the last Night for such a Robbery; the Person who went to show me the Prisoner, told me, I should not see him singly, because it was a Case, in which a Man's Life was in Danger. This I thought was Humanity; and as it was what I little expected to find in Newgate, I was the more pleas'd with it, and gave the Man some Money. He brought me to a Place, where the first Man I happen'd to cast my Eye on, was the Prisoner: I knew him immediately, and said, That's the Man that robb'd me. The Prisoner answer'd, I am sorry that I ever saw you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Lloyd has been to Mr. Akerman, the former Turnkey, to know if I had not been in Jail before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wightman. When the Coach was stopt (as Mr. Lloyd has Sworn) I ask'd what was the Matter? Mr. Lloyd said, Don't you see? And I then perceiv'd the Prisoner presenting a Pistol in the Coach. Says I, pray be civil, I have a Guinea and some Silver. I gave him two half Guineas, and he took half a Crown and some Shillings out of my Pocket. I desir'd him to leave my Keys, and he said he had. He ask'd me, for my Watch, and I told him I had none. My Man rode before the Coach with a Moon, that had 3 Candles in it. But there was another Highwayman, who brought my Man back with the Moon, to the Head of the Wheel-Horses, so that by that Light, I had a full view of the Prisoner, for he had no Mask, and am as positive, as I can be of any thing, that he is the Man who robb'd us.</p>

            . I was in the Coach with Mr. Lloyd and Mr. Wightman, when they were robb'd; but they turn'd so directly to the Coach-Door, that I could not see that Highwayman's Face, and for the same Reason, I believe, he hardly observ'd me; but I saw the other Highwayman bring the Moon back near to the Coach, and stand over him, to prevent an Alarm. I had got my Money ready to deliver, when the Coachman getting off his Box, fell upon the Highwayman next us; I heard one cry, Shoot! Shoot! and presently a Pistol went off, which I suppose, was fir'd by the other Highwayman; the Horses started at the Noise, and ran to the Turnpike.</p>
               <p>Oxton Chapman. I carry'd the Moon, and coming thro' Mile-End, at the End of the Dog-Row, a Highwayman rode up to me, and said, if I offer'd to open my Lips he'd shoot me thro' the Head directly. While the other was robbing the Coach, the Coachman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173304040019"></xptr> jump'd off, and knok'd him down. Then I got off my Mare, and help'd the Coachman, till farther Assistance came, and the Prisoner was not out of my Possession, till he was taken into Custody.</p>

            , Coachman. When the Highwaymen stopt the Moon-Man, I thought it had been a Quarrel, and cry'd Hai! what would you be at? I shall make one among you presently! With that, the Prisoner comes up to me, and says, You saucy old Rogue, I know you well enough, and I have a good mind to shoot you thro' the Head - Stand! And my Master called to me and said, Stand, James! The Prisoner went and robb'd the Coach; and the Light being betwixt me and the other Highwayman, I thought he could not well see to shoot me, and I knew the Prisoner could not, because his Head was in the Coach, and upon that Consideration I struck at the Prisoner twice, and knock'd him down dead.</p>
               <p>Court. But he came to Life again ?</p>
               <p>Price. Yes, yes; for at the second Blow he call'd to his Comrade and bid him shoot, and shoot he did; Aha! says I, * thee hast mist me, but I have hit + thee.</p>

               <p>Bird. The Prosecutor would not have me call'd, because his man should have all the Reward, tho' I ventur'd my Life as well as he when the Pistol was fired. I pick'd up a Pistol where the Coach stood.</p>

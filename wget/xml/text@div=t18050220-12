            , jun. sworn. - I am an Officer of Lambeth-street: on the 22d of January this man was brought to our Office, about the middle of the day, charged with a felony; he had a large bag, containing various articles, and among them I found this piece of flannel; I asked him where he bought the different things; he said, he bought some at Mr. Weddell's, and told me where Mr. Weddell lived, and amongst the cloth I found this card; I carried it to Mr. Weddell, who owned the card and the cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutor.) Look at that cloth; what is it? - A. It is a Salisbury flannel; I know it is mine by the card, otherwise I should not; I had such flannel in my house, but I did not know I had lost it till the Officer came; then I searched and found it was missing; the card has our private mark on it, and it belongs to this piece of flannel.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it when it was in your shop? - A. In the window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Prosecutor.) Q. Do you think you can swear you had this stuff in your shop two days before I came to your shop - A. I would not wish to swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the card fixed to the cloth when it came back? - A. It was loose.</p>
               <p>Q. Then upon looking over that card, does it satisfy your mind that that piece of Salisbury flannel was the same flannel to which the card was affixed? - A. I could think it was, and the quantity taken corresponds with the quantity left exactly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. A Jew that travels about declared to me, that Mr. Weddell had sold that piece of stuff to him three weeks before I bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200015"></xptr>it; he is at Portsmouth, on board of a man of war, with slops.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 4, Cadogan Street, Kenning-ton—one Friday night I was standing at my door, and saw the prisoner</p>

               <p>come out of his door and walk away—I saw a quantity of smoke come out of his door—he shut it after him—I saw a great light under the door—I opened it and found the place in flames—the flames were opposite the door, between the front and back rooms—the front room was full of flame—I got some water to put the fire out, and a young man helped me—about three months ago I heard the prisoner say he would set fire to the house, and burn us in our beds, using very bad language—there are people living in the house with him, and I live next door—I remained till the fire was put out—it did not take five minutes—I afterwards saw the prisoner at the station—he was very drunk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you speak to him when you came out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I opened the door by a string—a coal cellar is under the stairs, it is in a room, the outer door opens into a room, there is no passage—I saw he was drunk when he went from the door—I am his sister-in-law—he has fallen into the habit of drinking too freely ever since Christmas—he has always been subject to fits, they are not in consequence of drink—when he said three months ago what I stated, he was drunk—he has lived in that bouse twelve or thirteen years—he 1s. a tin-plate worker—he did not use Taper patterns for his work, that I am aware of—there was no one in the Louse at the time—I never said when the collector came for the rent, that I wished the place was all burnt down, because they would not do repairs which I said were necessary—they would not do the repairs—the prisoner had very little furniture in the house—there was a bed and bedstead, a table, some chairs, and his tools—he was uninsured.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wood cutter, of 13, New Street, Princes Road—I saw the prisoner come out of his house, and saw smoke at the top of the door, and a light under the door; which I said was too much for a candle—I saw Miss Doe open the door, and then saw the inside of the house—there was a fire in the cupboard, and by the side of the cupboard door there was wood chopped up, and paper, and the cupboard was full of coke—a deal table was broken up into small pieces, which were all standing up where the fire was—they were slightly burnt, and the paper was in full blaze underneath—I helped to put it out—he had been breaking the furni<lb></lb>ture up for some time before.</p>

I heard cries of "Fire!" went into the back room, ground floor, where there is a cellar under the stairs—I found a quantity of loose wood, some placed perpendicularly against the cellar-door, and some scattered about—the floor was strewed with water, and a portion of the door was slightly blackened by the heat of the fire—the coal-cellar was full of coal and coke—the coal-cellar door had been opened, and the wood placed against it, and the paper lighted under it—I</p>

               <p>told the prisoner the charge at the station—he said "It could not be me, for I was at Kennington Cross at the time the fire occurred"—that is about five minutes' walk from the house—he had had some drink—he was rather absent about giving his name and address; but other questions he answered reasonably—the fire was not near the fire-place, it was quite on the opposite side of the room.</p>

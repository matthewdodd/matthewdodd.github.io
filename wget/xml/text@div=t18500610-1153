                  </hi>. I am a butcher of Enfield—on 20th May there were thirty-five sheep and lambs in a field belonging to my father—they were all safe at half-past seven—about a quarter-past eleven I received information, went to the field, and found the prisoner in custody of Bellamy and Goddard—he said, "Do forgive me; poverty caused me to do it; I am starving"—there was nobody else to have done it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith, of Baker-street, Enfield—on Monday night, 20th May, I heard something, and went to Mr. Leahair's field with Goddard—we got over the gate, and stood under the wall a little time—</p>

               <p>we saw the prisoner go by the gate—we went after him—he attempted to run away—we overtook him—I asked him how he came to do such a thing (I had seen a lamb in the ditch as I was running)—he said he did not know, but be hoped I would let him go—I afterwards found the lamb with its legs tied with a string, which Goddard cut.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was going home when you pursued me, and I ran by where the lamb lay; I saw some other person there; I never said I knew anything of the lamb. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, he did not—he was fifteen or twenty yards from the lamb when I first saw him—the direction he ran in does not lead to any stile or gate—it was not a near way—it would not lead to his home, without trespassing on person's gardens—I saw no one else there—I was listening two or three minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Lahair's employ—in consequence of what I heard I went into the field, and saw the prisoner run and try to make his escape over a garden gate—he appeared to have come out of a corner of the wall—he was from eighteen to twenty-five yards from where the lamb was found—we talked to each other as we ran into the field—I said to the prisoner, "What have you been doing, you rascal?"—he made no answer, out was getting over a gate—I pulled him down by the legs, and Bellamy took him—I cut the string, which untied the legs of the lamb—I can swear that it was my master's, it rejoined the others which were about thirty yards off.</p>

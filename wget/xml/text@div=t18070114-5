               <p>The case was stated by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, This indictment charges the prisoner's with a capital offence; the first count charges them with a burglary in Mr. Spencer's house; and the second count charges them with assaulting and robbing Mr. Spencer's son.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, On the evening mentioned in the indictment, the servant heard a knock at the door, and on her opening the door, I think four persons rushed into the house, and immediately a pistol was presented to her; they had masks upon their faces, or were disguised; and upon hearing the noise young Mr. Spencer came out, and during the time he was engaged with them he received a violent blow, in which his hat was knocked off: the maid servant ran into a room where her mistress was sitting, and escaped out of the back window. Two persons followed; who knocked down Mrs. Spencer; others entered into another room, in which Mr. Spencer was sitting by the fire side, one of them presented a pistol to him, and the keys were demanded of the bureau, in which the money was deposited.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, There would be some difficulty in identifying the persons of all the prisoner by the persons who where in the house; the maid servant saw them but a short time, and therefore was able to make but little observation: I believe she will not be able to speak to the persons of any of them. Mrs. Spencer, Mr. Spencer, and young Mr. Spencer, they had a longer opportunity of seeing them; you will find some of them, speaking to one, and some to two of them, and I believe some speaking to the best of their belief that the prisoners at the bar were the four persons that were engaged in this nefarious transaction.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The servant that escaped out of the window ran to a public house, and before the robbers had escaped, a number of persons assembled about the house, but seeing six men armed with pistols and one with a crow, were afraid of attacking them; they did come out of the house, brandished their pistols and went off. I told you that young Mr. Spencer had his hat knocked off, and that hat was lost, and instead of that hat another hat with something of oilskin was left in the house, which belonged to one of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Information was sent to the police office, Hatton Garden, and the police officers were sent out to discover who were the perpetrators of this dreadful plot. On Monday evening, four days afterwards, they apprehended the four prisoners at the bar, together with a man of the name of Roberts, who was apprehended first, at a public house called the Blue Boar, Whitechapel: and on their being searched, such things were found, which demonstrates what sort of persons they were pistols and masks were found upon some of them: the lodgings of Harvey was searched, a mask was found there; there was found on the prisoner Bridge, Mr. Spencer's hat. On the person of Fordham there was a pistol found, and on Roberts there was another pistol found that matched with the pistol found on Fordham.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, After they were all taken into custody, it was thought prudent for the purpose of attaining as much justice as possible, to admit one person as witness against the rest; and Roberts was willing to disclose what he knew. On searching the person of Bridge they found the duplicate of a coat, which coat will be proved to you to belong to the servant in the house; therefore you can have no doubt respecting his person.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, You will have the evidence of the accomplice, and you will receive it with all caution as from a bad man, thus spared from standing at that bar but; weighing his evidence with all that caution, you will see whether you can entertain any doubt of the truth of his testimony. He will state to you where he found the four prisoners, he will describe the manner the robbery was committed, the part he took in it, and the manner in which they made their escape. All this evidence will be confirmed in so many circumstances by the belief of the prosecutor and the other witnesses, as to the identity of the prisoners, so that you will not be able to entertain the smallest doubt as to their guilt.</p>

            Enfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the house in the high road. - A. No, it is in what they call South street, Ponder's End.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the road leading to the river Lea. - A. It leads to a river, I do not know the name of the river.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140006"></xptr> Q. On the evening of Thursday the 18th of December, did you hear a knock at the door. - A. I heard a knock at the door, a sharpish knock, about seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had it been dark. - A. About an hour and a half, or more. On this sharpish knock I opened the door, and there was a tall person rushed upon me with a disguised face.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. State what you mean by a disguised face. - A. It was a black face, but whether it was a mask of a black face I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his dress at all. - A. A dark dress.</p>
               <p>A. Had he any thing in his hand. - A. A pistol, he was a stout man, and to the best of my belief he had a dark great coat buttoned down him.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say whether it was a blue or a brown. - A. I cannot say, by candle light I could not tell the colour, he had a pistol in his hand, he presented the pistol to my face, as soon as I opened the door, my young master Mr. Spencer came up in my defence; with that the man left me, and presented the pistol to his face.</p>
               <p>Q. While he was doing this did any person come to the door. - A. There was a second, I saw no more, the second was close by the first.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was the second. - A. A lower man than the first, he appeared very dark and dismal.</p>
               <p>Q. By a lower man I suppose you mean a shorter man. - A. A shorter man, he had a dark and dismal look.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore whether his face was black you do not know. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. All his appearence except his face was dark. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether he had a great coat on. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing in his hand that you saw. - A. I did not see.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say. - A. Not any thing to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe what you saw next after the tall man left you, and presented the pistol to your young master. - A. I ran up stairs, threw up the sash, and jumped out of the window, and went over some pales to a neighbour's, a public house, and gave an alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave the alarm, did you return to the house. - A. I did not. I saw no more of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners at the bar, and tell me whether you have any recollection of the persons of any of them. - A. I cannot say more than his being a tall stout man.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any man there that appears to you to be the size of the first man that rushed in. - A. Fordham seems to be the size of the man that first came in.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned they were gone. - A. All was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that any of your property was stolen. - A. Yes, a watch, a great coat, and a purse with three sixpences, two shillings and a half crown piece; they are my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to Fordham you said that he was more of the size of the first man. - A. Yes, he seems to be more of the size than any one of them men.</p>

            . - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at your father's house on this night of the 18th of December. - A. I was; I heard a knock, the servant opened the door, I heard a noise of several men; I got up from the fire side and went towards them. I thought there were some drunken men that came into the house; as soon as I got to the kitchen door, one of them presented a pistol to my head.</p>
               <p>Q. A man. - A. Yes, he had either a mask on or his face was black; he was a very tall man with a dark brown coat, he said if I offered to stir or maked the least noise he would blow my brains out. At that time there was another came up to me with an iron crow, that we found in the house afterwards; he also said he would knock my brains out if I offered to stir.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the dress of that man with the iron crow. - A. He looked very dark, his face was disguised; I rather thought with black crape. I did not take particular notice of his dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a stout or a thin man. - A. He was a stoutish man, but not so tall as the man that presented the pistol to me; he was not particulary stout.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more than these two. - A. Not at that time I did not; then they asked for my money and my watch.</p>
               <p>Court. The men that you have spoken of. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you give them your watch and your money. - A. I told them that I never wore a watch, I told them I would give them all the money that I had in my pocket, that was a shilling and sixpence; that was all that I had got in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. To whom did you give the shilling and the sixpence to. - A. I rather think it was to the shortest of the two, but I am not certain; they were very dissatisfied with the sixpence and the shilling that I had given them. They said they would blow my brains out; after that they left me. I saw them go to my father, and a little time after that, I saw one of them bring my mother out of the parlour.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was that one of these men. - A. No, I think it was another man, I saw four of them then.</p>
               <p>Q. What room was your mother in. - A. In the parlour; my father was in the kitchen, and I was in the kitchen at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw four in the house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you describe the dress of the other men at all. - A. Yes, there was one in a blue jacket and blue trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the one that brought your mother out of the parlour. - A. I rather think it was, but I am not sure. After they had been with my father, my father begged that they would not hurt him, he would give them the keys of the bureau.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any of them been saying any thing to your father to induce him to say that. - A. I believe they had, but I did not hear it; he gave them the key of the bureau. Three of them went up stairs, and one kept at the kitchen door with a pistol to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140007"></xptr> keep us in, threatening to shoot us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your mother in the kitchen. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was the man that stood at the kitchen door threatening to shoot you. - A. It was the tall man.</p>
               <p>Q. That you first spoke of. - A. Yes, the tall man, he has very much the appearance of that man in the red waistcoat (pointing to Fordham); the three men came down stairs to ask my father for the keys that belonged to the two up stair drawers: I then got up and threw my hands right in the man's face that stood at the door, I struck at him to get my way out. As soon as I did that, I sprung the lock of the door, got out of door, and then there were at the door when I got out, two or three men; I cannot say which were about me, I cannot say whether these two or three men were outside or at the door, or whether they had come from the fire side after they had been talking with my father.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a scuffle with them. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that scuffle did you lose any thing. - A. Yes, they knocked off my hat, they gave me a black eye; luckily I had a great coat on, one of them had hold of the flap of my coat, it tore off, and I got away from him and run away. One of the men ran after me that tore my coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more. - A. No, I saw some of my neighbours, and one of them caught hold of the man that pursued me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop to see whether he kept hold of him. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. On your return they were all gone. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you return when you found your neighbours were there. - A. No, it was dark, I could not see then, they were my neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since seen any of the persons, look round and see whether you see any of the persons here, that in your judgement, you believe was concerned in this transaction. - A. Yes, that man in the red waistcoat, is very much the appearance of that man that stood at the door (Fordham), and likewise the man whith one hand, (that is Bridge); that man I looked at for about two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the transaction was he engaged in. - A. I cannot say, he never came to me, I looked at his face, he had no mask on.</p>
               <p>Court. The man with one hand had no mask, you looked at him for about two minutes; do you believe the prisoner Bridge to be that man. - A. I do, to the best of my knowledge he did nothing particular as I saw in the transaction, I only saw him in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he dressed in. - A. In a blue jacket and blue trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you saw the prisoner Bridge at the office, did you recognize him by knowing any thing about his face. - A. By his whiskers being carrotty.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he bear any thing of that mark now. - A. The only difference is, the whiskers are not so long.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean they have been shaved off. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You observed the man with one hand had carrotty whiskers when you saw him at the office. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By whiskers, you mean the beard by the side of his face, you do not mean his whiskers on his lip. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to speak to either of the other prisoners. - A. No, before I made my effort to make my escape, I thought I heard the pistol snap from the man at the door. They still kept threatening every minute that they would blow our brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he standing at the kitchen door, or was he within the kitchen. - A. Sometimes he was within the door, and sometimes at the door; he would come within and threaten us.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the pistol snapping. - A. I thought I heard the noise, and saw the fire of the flint.</p>

            ; examined by Mr. Gurney. What parish is your house in. - A. The parish of Enfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you sitting by your kitchen fire at the time that you heard the knock at the door. - A. I was, they rushed in before I could get up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come into the kitchen to you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many came in first. - A. Two apparently, a tall man with a black face, and one that was not quite so tall; I believe he had got a crape on his face, and both their coats were dark, they came up to me, and the tall man presented a pistol, and said, if I spoke a word they would blow my brains out. I begged him not to use me ill, I put my hand into my pocket, and gave him the key of the bureau.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave them the key of the bureau, did any of them leave you. - A. Yes, they took the key and went.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more than these two men. - A. Yes, I saw four.</p>
               <p>Q. How many went up to your bureau. - A. Two or three, I do not know which; one man stood to guard me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that man that guarded you armed or unarmed. - A. He had a pistol, he said if I looked up to him he would blow my brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was that that staid to guard you. - A. He was a tall man.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that the man with his face black that you spoke of before. - A. Yes, it was; I believe he snapped the pistol at me twice, at last I heard it. He told the others to go up and get what they could, and he said he would guard us that we should not come out of the room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did any of the men come down. - A. Yes, two afterwards came and demanded the keys of the two drawers, that they could not open. My wife was present, they threatened that they would blow my brains out, if I did not deliver them immediately. I begged of her to give them her keys, she gave them the keys.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do after that. - A. That was the time my son struck the tall man and made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it while your wife was delivering the keys your son struck the tall man and got away. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18070114-5-person107">Q. </persName>
            That was when there were three in the kitchen. - A. As soon as my son got out I went to the door, there were three men that were jamed at the house door to keep me in.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140008"></xptr> Q. What became of the man that your son struck. - A. He ran after my son; I followed him, two of them throwed me down on the outside against some milk pans, which bruised me; I throwed one of them down, and another I got down by the throat. I was afraid that some of them would come up; I got up and ran away towards the mills.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Spencer, look at the prisoners at the bar, and tell me whether you believe any of them to be the persons that robbed you. - A. I think the person with the red waistcoat was the person that guarded us (Fordham).</p>
               <p>Q. The man who first presented the pistol to you, he was the man who afterwards guarded you while the others went up stairs. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to speak with any certainty or belief with respect to any of the others. - A. There were those two; the carroty one that is nearest me, and the other with the pale face.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak of Bridge, the man that is this way. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to speak to the other. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe Bridge do. - A. I observed him by his whiskers.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that he was one, or do you only believe it. - A. I do not like to swear positively, he looks like one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Bridge one that you saw in the house, or was he one of the persons that you had the scuffle with at the door. - A. He was in the house, he was one that came in and asked for the keys; there were two that came in and asked for the keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to speak with any certainty or belief with respect to the persons that you scuffled with at the door. - A. No, I fought my way through to get out,</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you find in the kitchen. - A. My husband and my son, and the man keeping guard over him. I was put in the kitchen with my husband and my son, and the man stood with a pistol over us.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the other men gone at that time. A. Up stairs; three of them came down for a small key to undo some drawers; in the mean time while my son took an opportunity to get out, then my husband made his resistance and got out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when they were gone, were you left alone in the kitchen. - A. I was. I got up, and when I came to the door there were two of the men picking up their pistols, or something, at the back door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the back door that they came in at. - A. Yes; I went by them, and ran down the yard.</p>

               <p>Q. When you come near the house, did you see any person come out of the house. - A. I saw Mr. Spencer junior running out; I was not sure at the time who it was, it was either father or son, I will not say which. A man was running after him, reaching his left hand after him, to catch hold of him; he had a pistol in his right hand, he tried to catch him with his left.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular about that man's face. - A. His face was disguised, it was either blacked or a dark crape upon it, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. What sized man was he. - A. He was a tall stout man. I immediately held the man by the left side of his coat, and he immediately turned the pistol into my face; I waved my head backwards and forwards. I stood in that position some time, expecting the pistol to go off, and finding myself unsupported by the people behind me, I drew from him; I begged of him not to fire, saying that my life would be of no use to him. I let go, and the man run away down the lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoners at the bar, and tell me whether any of them resembles the man that you laid hold of. - A. Fordham is the man most likely to be him by the size, he did not speak so then as he does now; that I cannot recollect him by his voice, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140009"></xptr> appeared to be as near the size as can be. He had a dark great coat on, and hanging loose as mine is now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other person escape from the house. - A. No, my whole attention was paid to him, he had leather gaiters on; I think they were over his knees. That is all I can say of him.</p>

            , in Essex street, Whitechapel. - A. I apprehended some before that. On the morning of the 22nd of December, I received information; I went with my brother officers to the Blue Boar, Aldgate, commonly called Whitechapel, where the person who is to be admitted as an evidence was apprehended; my brother officer apprehended him, after that I went to an house in Hackney Road, near Shoreditch church; at a small cook's shop, where I understood Harvey lodged. I saw the prisoner Harvey sitting reading some book, or paper, with the landlord of the house, in the back room adjoining the shop. I left my brother officer out side of the house; I beckoned the landlord of the house out, and in consequence of that, I beckoned to my brother officer, he came in, and from the denial that was made, I insisted upon searching the house. I left my brother officer with Harvey; I went up stairs, and in a bag among other things, I found this dark coloured coat, and this mask. The coat is very muddy, it appears to be country dirt; it was wet at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it as if it had been rained upon. - A. It was as if it had been rained upon; I called out to my brother officer, and said take care of the man; that is the man; he had a handkerchief tied round his face, having a black eye.</p>
               <p>Q. Which eye was it. - A. I will not be positive whether it was the right or left, he said his name was not Harvey.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ask him. - A. I asked him whether his name was not Harvey, he said it was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you ask him whether that was his lodgings that you searched. - A. He said he slept there, but another man lodged there; the landlord said that man was a smith that lodged there. After that he said his name was Harvey; he said master I used to bring coals to your house, when you lived in the country, but I believe I shall never bring you any more. I then put him in the coach, and went to Fordham's lodgings in Bethnal Green, at the sign of the Peacock; I enquired for the person, I was denied; I would go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find Fordham at home. - A. I did, at the Peacock, laying on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this. - A. Sometime in the afternoon; he was laying on the bed without his coat, shoes or hat; he had all his clothes on but them. I entered the room, and when I saw him, I knew him, I had known him from a child; I told him what I wanted, and we were officers, and were come to take him; he seemed to be very restless; I said if you attempt to be in any way, in which I think you are in, I will blow your brains out; I then called my brother officers to search the coat, that was laying upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found - A. A pistol was found, I believe by my brother officer; I afterwards saw it. My particular attention was directed to him, seeing him so restless. I found a pair of bullet moulds in the same room; he was handcuffed, and after he was handcuffed, he threw himself down stairs, with intent to run away; but he fell down two flight of stairs. I likewise found this great coat in the room; this coat is likewise daubed with country mud.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it wet or dry. - A. It appeared more damp than the coat that I found at Harvey's. We then took him away to the office, and then proceded to the

            , in Essex street, Whitechapel; there I saw Bridge and Hartford, I called out Bridge first, seeing him with one hand, and having a description of him; I saw a hat taken from him, which was shewed to Mr. Spencer afterwards. I then returned and spoke to Hartford, I said what is your name, he said my name is Dick; I said well, I know it, I knew him before. I then brought him backwards, where he was handcuffed, by my brother officers. This crow (producing it) was given into my hand at Ponder's End. by Mr. Spencer.</p>
               <p>Q. By which of them. - A. They were both together, and an old hat with an oilskin, the oilskin was in it exactly as it is now; it is an oilskin to cover a hat.</p>

               <p>Q. At that time it was accompanied with this, that there was another person, a smith, who lodged there. - A. He did, and Harvey afterwards said that these things that I found, and different things that I have got at home, the mask and shirt, they did not belong to him, they belonged to Vardon; that is the other person that is indicted.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember his being in the public house. - A. Perfectly well, he came there to sell pies; he sold some of his pies to Harvey, and Harvey gave an order for a minced pie, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Were you at work all that day with your father. - A. Yes, I was digging in the saw pit.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went home you found the prisoner sitting with his aunt. - A. Yes, I had not seen him before on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. By what means do you know it was Thursday. - A. I know so, particularly in our digging the pit; Mr. Evans employed us to dig the pit, Mr. Harvey came down and lent us a hand to finish digging the pit; we prove it in every respect by our master's bill that was sent in of the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the amount of that bill. - A. Our bill was very trifling.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not in the bill specify each day's work, you specify the work done. - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you for dinner that day. - A. I really cannot pretend to say, I know what I had for supper; it is a question with me whether I had any dinner or no. I am not in Mr. Demponey's family, though I live in the house. I dined with my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go into the room where the prisoner was. - A. Yes, I went into the room where they were.</p>
               <p>Q. What was their dinner. - A. I believe it was beef. I supped with them, we had some cold beef for supper.</p>
               <p>Q. There was some hot broth, of course. - A. Yes, but I had none.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell what you had for dinner, and you question whether you really had any dinner or no. - A. I really think I had some dinner, but what I had I do not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140013"></xptr> Q. How long did you stay at home at your dinner. - A. I very seldom stay at home at dinner above ten minutes any day.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was Demponey that day at his dinner. - A. He might be half an hour for what I know, I cannot exactly say to a few minutes of the time that we left our work and went to it again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Demponey and you talked this matter over at all. - A. I do not consider that we have talked any thing about it, I have not heard any thing about it till this day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you did not know any thing about this till a day or two ago. - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that wanted you to prove it. - A. I heard Mr. Demponey say that Mr. Harvey was so and so.</p>

               <p>Q. What is so and so. - A. That he was in trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not know that Harvey was in trouble till a day or two ago. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was he that told you that you was wanted to prove something before Christmas day. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never understood that you should be wanted to prove any thing till a day or two ago. - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It is very odd that you never heard of it before; upon your oath did not you know that Demponey and your mother-in-law went to the office to see him about a fortnight ago. - A. I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You and Demponey have been working together every day since that. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you a fortnight ago that Harvey was taken up. - A. I have heard him mention it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long, a fortnight ago. - A. No such thing, I cannot exactly say to a day or two; to the best of my belief it might be a week or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what did you mean to say just now that you did not hear that Harvey was in trouble till within this day or two. - A. Till within these few days.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said that you did did not know that Harvey was in trouble till within this day or two, you mean within a few days. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have not you heard it above a fortnight ago. - A. I believe if it is that time, it as much as it is.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you think it might be a fortnight ago that you heard it. - A. I cannot pretend to say, I know nothing of the business; to the best of my knowledge it might be seven, or eight, or nine days. I heard it of Mr. Demponey, he was the first person, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade is Harvey. - A. I believe a bargeman.</p>
               <p>Q. You are speaking of your wife's cousin. - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it since he worked at his profession. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he lived in London. - A. I do not know that he lived any where else than in Waltham Abbey.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Then you supposed that he came up with his barge, and so came to see his uncle. - A. I knew no otherwise.</p>
               <p>Court. When was it that you went to Mr. Evans's. - A. I was there yesterday and I was there today.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any book that told you the day, or any thing like it at Mr. Evans's. - A. Not this week.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you went to look at Mr. Evans' list. - A. Saturday night, I gave my bill into my master's hands, and he paid me our bill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I understood you to say you had been to Mr. Evans's to look at his book to see when the pit was dug. - A. Yes, on Thursday the 18th of December, Mr. Evans told me the pit was finished.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to say that the pit was finished on Thursday the 18th of December except what Mr. Evans told you. - A. I know it perfectly well; we began that pit on the Wednesday, on Thursday afternoon we finished it; on the Friday we began to work.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is whether you have any reason to say that that Thursday the pit was finished was Thursday the 18th of December, have you any reason for saying so, except Mr. Evans having told you so. - A. I have so far as this, I made a recollection in different things by our own earnings, I know it must be.</p>
               <p>Q. You are desired to satisfy the jury that this Thursday was the 18th of December, the reason that you gave some time ago was, that you had seen Mr. Evans's book. - A. I never saw Mr. Evans's book.</p>
               <p>Court. I should be glad to know what enables you to say it was the Thursday before Christmas day, you may very well begin a pit on a Wednesday and finish it on a Thursday, there is no circumstance that enables you to say that it was on that Thursday, independent of what any one told you. - A. There is a circumstance that I recollect perfectly well; on that day the master-bricklayer had four loads in.</p>
               <p>Q. What master bricklayer are you talking on. - A. On the building that we are engaged in; that master sent for two pots of porter to treat us with, and the master-bricklayer partook of the porter.</p>
               <p>Court. So he might; that might be the week before as well as the Christmas week.</p>

               <p>Court. Why could you not take care of this tieket yourself. - A. I might have done it to be sure, but I was going out of town; she had things of mine in her possession, and it was not a very pleasant thing to carry about with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the harm of a bit of paper. - A. Probably as I was going down to my mother I might be under some necessity, or some circumstance or accident might occur that might produce it; therefore my giving it to her to keep for me it would put it out of my power of informing my mother of it; that was my only reason for my giving it to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Egerton did you give this paper to this woman without any acknowledgement, in order that this might be safe. - A. I had a very high opinion of her principles, or otherwise I would not have invested it in her hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mrs. Demponey had the ticket from that time to this. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been returned to town from your mother. - A. About a fortnight. I have seen Mrs. Demponey two or three times since I came to town; I did not request it till I had the power of taking out the things; she said Mrs. Egerton my nephew was at my house and was not you with me when I carried the parcel, I said certainly; now says she, this will be a principal thing; I says I am very happy that you have it. She applied to me to let her have it in her possession.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you applied to her for it. - A. No, she could not tell when I should have applied to her for it; when the occurrence happened, she anticipated the thought that I might have asked her for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that. - A. I am only judging.</p>

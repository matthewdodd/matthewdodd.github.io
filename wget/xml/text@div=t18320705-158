            . My husband lives in Peacock-yard. The officer found the box of candles at our house, which the prisoner brought on the Saturday morning, and he was in the habit of coming up the yard with a truck, but he did not call at our house before he brought the box; I was up stairs at the time; he said "The box ought to have gone before, but it could not go without a direction," and he brought a card, and nailed it on.</p>

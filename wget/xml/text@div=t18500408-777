                  </hi>. I live in Swinton-street, Gray's-inn-road; the prisoner was my errand-boy two years and five months—I had in my warehouse a quantity of silk mechlin net—I received a note from Mr. Fletcher—I went, and he gave me some information, and showed me some lace, but he buys it of the same person that I do—it is all made in one large manufactory—it is all alike, and the boxes it is in are all alike—there is nothing to identify it unless it could be proved that the prisoner took it from my premises—I went to the prisoner, and said to him, "Tom, you have been robbing me "—he said, "No"—I said, "You have, for some time"—the inspector then said, "I am an inspector of police; I will take you"—the prisoner then burst out crying, and said, "I have been robbing you eighteen months"—I told him about the piece that was gone to Mr. Fletcher's, and he said he took it.</p>

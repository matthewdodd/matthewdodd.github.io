                  </hi>. I am shipping clerk in the service of John Scovell and Sons, at their wharf, in Tooley-street; the prisoner had been a cooper in their employ for twelve years. On the 21st of July, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I desired him to go into the counting-house, and told him to take off his hat, which he did—I found these nails in it—there are 4lbs.—they had come from the cooperage, which the prisoner had possession of—he had no authority whatever to take them away—they were precisely the sort of nails that we use in coopering tallow-casks, which was his occupation—he was going off the premises.</p>

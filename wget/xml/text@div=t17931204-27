               <p>Q. In whose hands did you find it in the public house? - I did not see it first in any body's hands, it was in the bar at the public house, with a great coat belonging to the porter, I see the great coat with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you there? - On the preceeding day, Tuesday, I lost a piece of floor cloth, a particular piece; Wednesday I missed the porter, he went out to breakfast, and did not return that day; I presumed he had gone off; I went to his lodgings for this piece of cloth, he was not at home; I found out the publick house that he frequented; I did not find that piece that I knew was lost, but I found the piece stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of yourself that he used this public house? - No more than what my clerk told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you receive this piece of cloth of? - I have not received it yet; it is in the hands of the constable now; I saw it first in the bar of the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it delivered to the constable? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it again was you to see it? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing about it by which you know it to be your's? - Yes, I knew it by a particular mark; the fellow piece is in court; I know it by the particular make of it, and the number of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the No.? - 126. I knew it to be mine immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went home did you miss such property, or can you swear that such property was missing, after seeing this at the public house? - After seeing that at the public house I went home and I missed it; I am positive of its being mine, I never made but fifteen of this sort, and this is one of the fifteen, and this was missing.</p>
               <p>Q. What become of the other pieces, had you sold them? - A part of them; the rest were at home, two pieces are gone to Manchester.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that this piece that you saw at the public house, was not one of the pieces that you sent to Manchester? - It was not the same number.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This gentleman hired me as a porter, and he keeps two shops.</p>
               <p>LISTER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a shopman to Mr. Bulmer; Mr. Bulmer sent his clerk in the morning to Jones's lodgings the day this property was found, and he could not find him the day he went away; in the afternoon I went to the public house in St. Clement's to look for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040068"></xptr>him, there I found him asleep on a table; I enquired if he had brought any thing there that day; I found a piece of black oil cloth there in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any body know how they came there? - They told me that Jones brought it there; the boy is here that took it of him, it was left in the care of the landlord till I went and acquainted Mr. Bulmer of having found it, and he sent for a constable and had him taken up; the constable has the care of the property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They told me that if I would tell who the man was that took another piece that they saw go away with it, they would freely forgive me? - I told him if he acquainted us who had taken the other pieces it would be better for him.</p>
               <p>ROBERT -</p>

               <p>SWORN.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us all the truth, that you know. Whose boy are you? - Mr. Webber's; my father's brother keeps the public house. I live at that public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and see if you know him? - Yes, I know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever use to come to your house at any time? - He never brought any thing, but that piece of oil-cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it? - I cannot say; I have got such a bad memory, how long it is ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the colour of the oilcloth? - I think it was a black; he put it into my hands, and told me to put it under a great coat; and I took it from him, and put it there; I was in the bar, when I took it from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had it from that bar? - I was out when they came for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know at all, whether this gentleman had it after you took it from the prisoner? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen it, since you took it of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The same day, I saw a man in the place with an oil-cloth under his arm, drinking a pint of beer, and I dare say, he saw me. The boy said before, that he never saw me but three times in his life.</p>
               <p>Court to boy. Are you sure, that this is the man that left that cloth with you? - Yes, that is the same man.</p>

               <p>Q. What day was it, do you remember? - The sixth day in the evening, about six or seven o'clock at night, I have kept it ever since.</p>

I hired myself to Mr. Bullmer, he keeps two shops. I used to pull his truck, &amp;c. And I used to drink at this public house, and that child used to drink rather too much, when his uncle was out of the way; and my master saw some man go away with a floor-cloth, and he came to me, and asked me, whether I knew the man that had taken the cloth out of his house? and told me, if I would tell, he would forgive me; and wanted to persuade the boy, that I left that piece there. Mr. Bulmer's house is a lodging-house, and the lodgers have as much liberty of going through the warehouse as he himself; and there was a man seen go with an oil-cloth away that day, as I was told; the clerk knew that I was going away from the place; his place would not suit me.</p>

Reynolds, an attorney, paid the money for him, at his request; he paid it in three one-pound notes, and received one shilling and three-pence in change from Draper. Draper put the notes into his pocket-book, it was a small red pocketbook; when he opened the pocket-book. I saw a large roll of notes, two or three fingers thick. He doubled these three up with the rest, and put them into his pocket-book, which he put into his breeches pocket, this was about four o'clock in the afternoon.

            . I am a hair-dresser. I was in Barnet on the 8th of August, I was in the White Bear; I had been in that house about a quarter of an house before Draper came; Draper was totally a stranger to me; I never saw him before. We drank together; I joined his company. I saw him take out a pocket-book; but I could not tell whether he had any money or not; I did not see him pay any thing. From that we went along together, and stopped at another public-house at the end of the Town; we had a pint of beer there. The deceased did not produce any money there; I paid for the beer. We then went towards Endfield, and stopped at the Bald Face Stag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you walk or how - A. He had a cart and horse, and we rode. The prisoner kept that house. We arrived there about eight o'clock, as near as I can appoint the time; I saw Mr. Tuck there when we arrived; Draper and I went into the parlour, and had two or three glasses of gin and water together while we were there; there were several other persons in the house; I don't know the exact number; but I suppose eight or ten in the same room; I did not know any of them before. The prisoner Tuck came in and out on business, I mean serving his customers.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid for the liquor that he and you had - A. I paid for two glasses I know; but I did not see him pay for any.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he hold any conversation with any one in that room - A. No one in particular. I did not see any thing in his conduct until he had drank, and it was about ten o'clock; he was then rather insulting to Robinson, the black, and wanted to be ten pounds or twenty pounds; he did not pull out any notes; but he presented his pocket-book; it was a small red pocket-book, wrapt round with a piece of string; it appeared nearly full. The black told him he should not strike him; but if he struck him, he should take the law of him. I saw the deceased put the pocketbook back into his breeches pocket, and that was the last I saw of it. I left the room a little after ten; I saw nothing more while I was there. I proceeded on my road towards. Hoddesdon. The horse and cart belonging to Tuck overtook me; there was nobody in it; I returned to Tuck's with the horse and cart. Draper lived in Enfield Town, and the cart was going towards Draper's proper home. When I came back to Tuck's, I saw Draper there; he was in the parlour, where I left him. When I returned it was in about half an hour; Robinson, the black, and two or three others were there that I did not know. I had no conversation with Draper in particular. I tried to persuade him to go home. I saw Mr. Tuck, the prisoner, also that second time; he was at his busines. Droper sat down, and said, he would go after another glass or two. He and I went out to look for his horse and cart; he was then quite drunk; he was stupidly drunk. When we went out together, he coliared the hostler, and asked him where his horse and cart were; the hostler said be did not know; they had a scuffle together, and he threw the hostler down once. Draper appeared to me to be a very powerful man; he was about fifty years of age. The hostler wrestled with him, but was in perfect good humour. Then a hay maker came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180008"></xptr>up to the door, and the deceased insisted on wrestling with the haymaker; the haymaker said he did not want to have any thing to do with him. Then he collared the haymaker, and the haymaker threw him twice by tripping him up; no blows passed. Then he wanted to fight with the haymaker; but the haymaker pushed him off with his fist, merely, in his own defence. Mr. Tuck then came out,and took the deceased from the haymaker. Then I went on, on foot, and about a mile before I got to Enfield Town, I overtook the horse and cart; I got into it, and gave the horse his head, and he stopped at a house which I afterwards found out to be Draper's. I told the people of the house where I left him. The next day I saw him dead, about three o'clock; If examined his person; I looked at the body; Tuck was in the house when I saw the body.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. When he produced his pocket-book there were ten or twelve persons in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance is the well from the place where the deceased was wrestling - A. About twenty or thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was no distance for a drunken man to waddle - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Are there not six or seven feet of the circumference of the well without any fence - A. When I saw it the fence was broken down. The prosecutor was a stout man, and able to make a good deal of resistance. So much of the fence as remained was a filmsey thing, and good for nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. And Draper would take a good deal of beating before he could be forced into a well - A. He was very powerful indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. And I believe he had a good stout bull dog, which I believe if he had been attacked could have afforded a good deal of resistance - A. I understand that dog was found on the premises the next morning.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. ANDERWS. Draper had lost his dog. I was never at Tuck's house before.</p>

            . I am hostler at the Bald Face Stag. I remember John Draper coming there the night before he was found drowned in the well; he came there a good bit before dark; he was in company with some delicate mechanical sort of man, like the witness James Smith; it was a beautiful night as ever I saw. Draper took me by the collar; in that scuffle he fell down poor man; I gave him no blow. I then went into the tap-room, and had my pint of beer. Afterwards my master said, go and look for that old man; he has lost his horse and cart, go and look in the field; I went and looked over all the field, and found nobody there only. the bitch in the yard; it was in the same close where the well was. I then went and laid on some straw over the barn. I can't tell what o'clock it was, as there was no clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. Did he not seem anxious about the poor man, and did he not tell you to go in search of him - A. Yes. This well is a wonderful size it is about eight feet over; there was about three feet from pole to pole where there was no fence. The next morning the fence was in the same state that it was in before; it was not broken down until the people came pressing on it. I saw the dog afterwards; it was a little brindle crop, a little on the cross, not through bred; I should not think the dog could defend Mr. Draper; there were bushes over part of the well, and there were about four feet without any bushes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WEEB. I was at work for Mr. Paris, in August last, at making hay. I remember the night this misfortune befel. Draper; I was at the Bald Face Stag as near ten as I can say; I saw Draper there, and felt him; he was outside in the road in front of the house; I never saw him before. He caught me very fast by the collar, and said he would wrestle with me; I said, my friend, I am no wrestler. He then wrestled with me, and kicked me twice on the legs; I was hurt by him; I took it in good part; I did not strike him; I tried to keep myself on my feet. He could not have sustained any injury from what happened between me and him; he fell twice, and I with him; he fastened upon me, and would not release me, and so we fell together; the second time in our getting up he slipped his hold of my collar, and I got away from him. I saw him coming at me again; then I stept up to him, and pushed him down on his backside; I pushed him with my open hand.</p>
               <p>Q.Did any thing more pass between you and him - A. No. I saw him then get up, and go into the house. I did not see any more of him. I did not see the prisoner Tuck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I took him to be an elderly man.</p>
               <p>Q. But a good heavy man, so that if he fell he might get a bruise on his head - A. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You were hurt by the fall - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And he being more heavy than you, was more likely to be hurt.</p>

             was there; he was in the front parlour; there were other persons in that room. The deceased had a young dog there; I dare say it might be seven or eight months old, it was a little small bull dog, and he had it in a chain. I stand in that company, until I persuaded Draper to go home, that is until I persuaded him to go out for that purpose; he was a neighbour of mine, and lived close to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he well acquainted with Tuck's premises - A. He knew the house very well; it is about three miles and a half, or three miles and a quarter from his own house. I left off telling him to go home at about half past nine or ten; I had tried to persuade him to go; at last he went away, leaving me in the room. The prisoner Tuck was in and out constantly in the course of his business. But I am going to tell you that the deceased got talking about fighting with the black; I believs the black was a fighting man; he began to play his tricks with the black, and the black said, friend I shan't hit you but if you strike me, I shall take the law of you.</p>
               <p>Q. While the deceased was in the room, did you see him pull out any pocket-book - A. Yes, a <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180009"></xptr>middling sized red pocket-book; I did not see it opened; it was in his hand; he talked about laying a wager; I don't know whether it was full or empty; I did not see him pay for any liquor; I don't think he did. I don't know this well; I believe it was a sess-pool formerly. I had seen it, but not to take notice of it before this happened; it is upon a little descent. I don't recollect it before this happened. There seemed an old rotten rail round it; it was a little out of the foot-patch going to the brew-house, about forty yards one way, and six the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q.Was there any thing to prevent a man from stumbling into the well - A. I don't think there was a railing all the way round; I think there was a dippling place; it was not a very large hole; but I should think a man might fall into it. After Draper was gone out of the room, some of the company remained behind entertaining themselves, singing. I thought he had gone home. Robinson was there a good bit after Draper was gone.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. WALFORD. I think it was half an hour after the deceased was gone, that Robinson and they quitted the room.</p>

            . I live in Tottenham. I went to the Bald Face Stag on the 8th of August, I got there about eight o'clock in the evening; I saw Tuck there; he was in the bar. I remained there until nearly twelve at night; I knew Draper perfectly well; he was summonsing officer in the County Court; he was in the habit of collecting money, and of carrying a good deal about him at times. I have assisted him at times in executions. I saw him at Tuck's at a little after eight in the evening of the 8th of August; he was rather in liquor; a young man (who has been examined here to day,) was with him; he had a dog with him in a chain or string in the room; it was a small whitish dog; there were several persons in the room, and Draper was talking very loud to some of them. Tuck was in the room occasionally; but I did not hear any conversation from him to Draper, nor from Draper to him. I went into the bar to Mrs. Tuck to settle some business. Draper went out for some purpose or another. I can't tell in particular what passed on his returning. I did not see him produce any money or notes. He was very noisy and blunt, but I did not see him quarrel with any one. I was called out a second time by Mrs. Tuck, and the plaintiff and the defendant agreed to settle the warrant in the business I went there on.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe where Tuck was - A. I believe he went into the bar as I came out of it, and went into the room; he was about his business, serving his customers. I returned into the room where Draper was; he was drinking with his friend. I remained some time, and at last I told him I would ride home with him in his cart; it was agreed that I should go with him; he was very forward in liquor. I missed him out of the room a little before eleven, or about that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether he went alone - A. No; about the same time I missed Crouch, Saunders, and Robinson, the pugilists, who were lodging at Tuck's house; they were in what is called training.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any one else at that time - A. I missed Mr. Tuck; I did not miss him at that time. When I missed Draper, I went outside the door to try if I could see him and his cart; I think at that time it was about eleven o'clock. The horse and cart were gone. I then came into the room again, and said to a man named Flowers, I believed that Draper had given me the double, for I meant to have gone home with him. I sat down, and had a glass of gin and water, and quitted the house about twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. After missing these three persons and Mr. Tuck, did you see them any more - A. I did not see either Crouch, Saunders, or Robinson; but I saw Tuck; I saw him in the parlour; it was getting about twelve when I saw him in his parlour; he was gone out of the parlour before I left the room; I believe he went about his business; the door is open to the bar. I could not see from the room where I was into the parlour behind the bar where he was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then where Tuck or the other three persons were, you cannot say - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand he came into the room where you were, about half an hour before you went away - A. Yes, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing in his appearance at that time - A. No, not in the least; he did not appear to be alarmed. My house is at Tottenham, and I went there that night. I knew Tuck's premises; but I have not seen the well above twice; I saw it when the Coroner was viewing it; I stood by his side; that was about three days after the man was found dead in the well.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get from the house to the well - A. I went through the field gate myself; I believe there is a door from the back of the house also into the skittle-ground; there is a small well just by that; but the other lies more on the left; there is a fence which separates the four corner ground from the field, or close where the well is; there are some boards to stop the ball in playing, over which a person might get. The top of the well was nearly covered over when I saw it; there was a dipping place left open about three feet over; there was a gradual ascent to the top of the well; it might be eight or nine inches rise, or probably a foot; the posts were broke off close to the ground, and the rail and all was down. Before the railing was down, I don't think any one could fall into the well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. From post to post, was it not at least six feet - A. Yes, it might be that. The well was covered with furzes, and such like; if a man walked upon that covering it would yield.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say Tuck was absent, you don't mean to say he was out of the house - A. No.</p>

            . I am a blacksmith; I live at Cockforsters, near Endfield; that is a village about three miles from Endfield. On the evening of the 8th of August, I was at the prisoner. Tuck's house, and I saw the deceased

             there; he was in the front parlour; I was in his company about an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180010"></xptr>hour. The prisoner at the bar was going in and out about his business while I was there. The last I saw of the deceased was that he was going out of parlour to go home as I thought; he went out alone. The young man Smith who has been examined went out a few minutes before; there were other persons left the room about the same time; there were seven or eight, whose names I could mention. It was about ten I saw him go out; I did not see him pull any money out. I continued there about an hour after he was gone; I was not in the same room; but I was in the parlour behind the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. I had business by the house; Mrs. Tuck applied to me to borrow some money; she said, she wanted to make up a certain sum for her brewer; I supplied her with six pounds. I saw a packet of bank notes in her possession at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave her that money, did she signify that that would be sufficient to answer her purpose - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased after that - A. Yes, for this took place about nine o'clock in the evening. Draper was there when I went; I saw Tuck about eleven; he asked his wife for the key of his bedroom, and he went off, as I supposed to bed.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. WALFORD. I had received five of those six notes from Mr. Paris's housekeeper; there were five of them old notes; I can't tell where I got the other; I had had it some days.</p>

            . On the 8th of August last, I was in the house of the prisoner Mr. Tuck. I saw the deceased John Draper in the house; I saw him somewhere about half past ten; I am not positive for a few minutes; there was a person there named Church; he is not here; he has been arrested, and is in the King's Bench.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I was there a number of times; I was there on the morning of the 8th, I saw the deceased come up to the house that morning, he had a horse and cart, and said he was going to Barnet, The prisoner spoke to him kindly; he spoke of him before he came up to the house; we were at breakfast, and the window was open, and we saw the deceased coming up with the horse and cart; and the prisoner said, here is Mr. Draper coming, as good an old man as ever lived; he said he understood he had been a man of considerable property, but through some misconduct of his own or law affairs, his relations got it. They shook hands together through the window, when Draper came up; there seemed to be a condiality and friendship between them. I was there in the evening, Draper was there very drunk, and very much disposed to quarrel; he was forward in liqoor when he came. He wanted the dog to fight; he went out, and brought his dog in in his arms; there was a dog of Tuck's in the room; the deceased took the chain and collar off his dog, and threw it down, and wanted it to fight; Tuck would not permit them to fight, and secured his dog. Several persons strave to persuade the prisoner to go, as he was so drunk; Tuck repeatedly told him to go. When I went to bed I heard a man's foot on the stairs coming up. Tuck was the only man in the house that was going to sleep there, that was not in bed. Before we came up, he declared it his intention of going to lied. He went by our door. Draper had left the room in which we were all sitting, at about half past ten; I can't tell exactly to a moment as there was no clock.</p>

             had gone into the house before I came up; they were ahead of me, and went into the house. When I came up to the house I saw four men run out of it quite hasty out of the front door; I knew none of them but the landlord of the house, I mean the prisoner at the bar; he was the first, I knew him by his voice, and it being a moonlight night, I could see him. The landlord said, d-n his old eyes he is gone this way, I know he has gone round here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the others say any thing - A. Yes, another of them said we will give him a good hiding and we will kick his-. They went in a direction towards the well. I then went on about my business.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Bricket and Austin - A.They were in the house before these men came out. I knew one of them to be 
               <persName id="t18160918-4-person105">Tuck</persName>
             the prisoner; I knew neither of the others. I had come near half a mile, and I heard Mr. Corvyn's clock strike twelve. It was after I heard this that it struck; I counted it. I worked late that night. I had been to town with a load of hay, and stood in the market until it was sold, I brought back a lord of ashes; and got to Mr. Tuck's at ten o'clock at night and left the load before his door; I left it opposite his house in the road. I took the horses out and left the waggon in the road. From that time until I returned past Tuck's house, I was employed in doing my horses. I put them up at Beech-Hill, where my master lives about a quarter of a mile from Tuck's house. I had three horses to do, and nobody to help me. Returning from Beech Hill, to my own lodgings, I pass Tuck's house. The next morning I mentioned some part of what I had seen, but not all. I mentioned it to

            , and Jem Seymour, and nobody else. I had not heard anything at that time, I told them there was a row at Tuck's house, I did not tell them that I heard the men swear; I said there was a row and they ran into the Field. I heard that morning that Master Draper had met his death.</p>
               <p>Q.After, the conversation with Harvey - A. No, before. The hostler came to Beech Hill to fetch some water, and told us there was an old man drown<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180011"></xptr>ed in the well; and I told him that I heard a row there that night as I was coming by; that was all that passed between me and Harvey about it. I did not go to see the man after that. It had been a moonlight night, but not quite so clear as it sometimes is I was acquainted with the well, and saw it a good many times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I am a carter. I took up the load of ashes at six o'clock in the evening in London; It is about twelve miles from town, to Tuck's house. I mean positively to say it was ten o'clock. I know a Mr. Langdale, he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you have heard Mr. Langdale's name, I will ask you on your oath, was it ten o'clock when you placed your load of ashes opposite Tuck's house - A. Yes, I am sure it was as late. It would take me two hours nearly to take the horses from the cart to the stable, and to clean them.</p>
               <p>Q. Now upon the oath you have taken, was it nine or ten o'clock, when you first arived at Tuck's with your cart - A. Ten. I had something to drink in the Haymarket, before I quitted town. I had nothing more to drink until I came to Bowes Farm; I had nothing to drink from Mr. Laugdale.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you told all this story to the Justice - A. I told it to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Q. I asked you the Justice - A. Yes, on the Monday week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention the names of Bricket and Austin - A. No, all but that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell that anybody was with you at the time you heard this at the door - A. No; because there was nobody with me when I saw these man come out of the house. They were forward, and gone into the house. I did not know the bruisers; I knew the boxing men were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Justice, that the men were going out to have a fight - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the Justice asking you, why you did not stay to see the fight as it was light enough - A. Yes, and I told him, because I had been up two nights. I have always been very good friends with Tuck; I never took out a warrant against him, Groom did. One of the boxers gave me a blow once; that was on the Monday night, previous to the night in question; I went to the door, to ask for a pot of beer, the door was shut, but there were lights in the house; I believe it might be near twelve o'clock; I made a noise at the door, and Mrs. Tuck said, who is there, and I told my name, and said what I wanted, and she said, Johnson, you will get no beer here to night. I then said, bring me a pot of ale, and a prize fighter; and then one of them came out, and knocked me right off the three steps. When I got up, I made a start, and he came and kueched me down again. It was Groom that took the warrant out. When I passed Tuck's on the night in question, I went to Cock Forsters, I went by myself. These four men that came out of the house went to the left, and I went to the right; in point of fact, we went two different ways.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I have never had any ill-will in the least towards the prisoner; I was a little sancy, and it was Church that came out, and beat me.</p>
               <p>-LONGDALE. I am Squire Paris's buileft. I know Johnson, the last witness; he is my carter; I have also two carters named Bricket and Austin; Austin is a boy.</p>

               <p>Q.On the 8th of August, what time did Johnson come home from Town - A.About a quarter before nine, as near as I can tell. When he came home he had to do up his horses, and feed then; what would take him perhaps two hours; but he might have been an hour and a half that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any beer to Johnson that night - A. Yes, and there were several more of the men present; I think I gave about seven quarts strong and small that night, among them in Mr. Paris's stables. I am not positive that Johnson drank any of the beer; but he was in the stables at the time it was there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. This beer was given for all the persons in the stables; some of the hay-carters who had come up with the last load of hay were there. Johnson did not tell me the next morning that he had seen four persons rush out of Tuck's house. The last time I saw him that night was between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL BRICKET. I am a carter in the employ of Mr. Paris. On the 8th of August, I was employed at hay-cart very late. Johnson went to London with the team; he had not come in with his horses when I came to the stables; he does not put his horses in the same stable where I put mine. I saw the beer served out; Johnson was not there then that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon did you see Johnson that night - A. About an hour before I came down to the Stag; he was in the stable then walking up and down; he had not done his horses. About twelve, Johnson, Austin, and I went from the stables; Johnson asked the watchman the time, and he said, he was going to cry twelve; this was a watchman of Mr. Paris's, his name is Thomas Hillyard. Austin and I were going to the Stag, and Johnson was going on to his lodgings at Cock Fosters. We all went on together to the stag; I was first; we were in discourse together with one another all the way. When we got to the Stag, Austin and I went into it; Johnson went on, and we saw no more of him that night. As I was going to London the next morning, I intended to have some beer and bread and cheese, at the Bald Face Stag; I asked Mrs. Tuck, who was in the bar for it. I did not see any one else, but what were in the tap-room; there was the servant boy and girl there, the old ostler, and three Irishmen who worked for my master. We did not get the bread and cheese at first; Mrs. Tuck said it was past hours. Then she hallooed out to the boy to go and ask his master, if she might let me have some bread and cheese; the boy went out, and coming in immediately said, she might do as she pleased. The boy had gone out at the back door; he returned in a very short time. The boy then brought the bread and cheesc into the tap-room; after I got the refreshment, we continued there twenty minutes at the farthest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time while you were in the house that night see Tuck - A.No. After that I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180012"></xptr>went to my home at Mr. Paris's, The back door goes into the Four corner ground, and to the stables.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I can be positive the watchman said twelve, and not eleven; it was in answer to a question of Johnsons that he said so. To the best of my knowledge Johnson had no share of the beer that was for the carters in the stables. I did not see Mr. Langdale come into the stables while we were having the beer. After the beer was drank, we waited nearly half an hour for Johnson. We went along talking together all the way, When we came to the corner, we bid Johnson good night; I did not look after him. When we crossed the bridge, we went to the left, into the public-house, and Johnson went to the right. We crossed the bridge together, Johnson was in discourse with me when we crossed the bridge. We went about a pole, before the road leans to go to Cock Fosters. I did not see four men rush out of the Stag. I did not hear any one make any exclamation or cry out. When we were going into the public-house, Johnson was walking steadily on towards Cock Fosters. If any men had rushed out as he passed I must have seen them, and if they said any thing I must have heard them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is the road going to Cock Fosters, a straight road - A. Yes, and from it you can see the front of the Bald Faced Stag.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.But a man going towards Cock Fosters, would have his back towards the Bald Facedstag - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And how long after Johnson parted from you, was it before you went to the public-house - A.about two minutes. We went in at the front door, and neither saw nor heard any thing. I was at the stag on the Monday night previous, when Johnson got the licking, that was between eleven and twelve o'clock; the door was shut and fastened. On the night in question the boy was not gone long to ask his master; he was gone a very short time. I saw Johnson on Friday. He did not ask me any question about any one rushing out of the Bald Faced Stag. A young woman told me of the death of this poor man.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Johnson had not got such a way from the Bald Face Stag; when we went in; but he might have heard the voice of a person coming out.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Paris. I remember going along with the last witness to the Bald Face Stag, on the night of the 8th of August; Johnson set off with us from Mr. Paris's; the watchman at that time said, he was going to cry the hour of twelve. We all came down the hill together. We did not part at all until we came to the Inn. We went into the house, and Johnson went to Cock Forsters; we all kept close together until we came to the Inn. We had some beer and bread and cheese. When I came away, we left a girl, a boy, three Irishmen, and the hostler there. We had some difficulty at first in getting the refreshment we called for, but the mistress sent the boy out backward to his master, to ask him if she might serve it; when he returned which was in a very short time, he said that she might do as she pleased. The reason she refused it at first, was because it was after hours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. I think it was darkish that night; but it was not moon-light. I had part of the beer that was given to the men in the stable; I can't say rightly whether Johnson was there, and had any of it or not. I saw Johnson's back turned towards us as I went into the stag. I did not see anybody come out as I went in.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HARVEY. I am a carpenter, living at Cock Forsters. I was at the Bald Face Stag on the night of the 8th of August, between nine and ten o'clock; I saw a man there of the name of Draper, I saw him wresting with a haymaker; he did not receive any injury then that I know of. I saw Johnson there; I saw him leave a load of dung or ashes or something opposite the door of the Bald Face Stag. John on told me that he heard a noise the night before, when I saw him the next morning, he told me he heard there was a man drowned; these were the words he told me. I did not ask him who the men were that he said he saw come out, nor did he mention any particular expression they used. He said he heard a noise, and scuffle in the Bald Face Stag, and one of the men said he is gone round this way, we will follow him. Nothing passed more between us two.</p>
               <p>-HILLYARD. I was watchman to Squire Paris, in August last. I remember Bricks, Austin, and Johnson going away from Mr. Paris's the night before the man was drowned; it was between eleven and twelve o'clock; I had called eleven about half past eleven.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by MR. DOWLING. I told them it was near twelve; I will swear positively it was half past eleven. Johnson lodged at my house at Cock Forsters; he did not say a word to me the next day about any thing he had heard or seen as he passed the Bald Face Stag; I went home between five and six the next morning to go to bed.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. WALFORD. I can't say I saw him the next day.</p>

            . I have been servant to Mr. Tuck between three and four months; I knew Mr. Draper; I remember seeing him at the Bald Faced Stag on the 8th of August, he had a glass of gin and water; I did not see my master wait upon him. I think I went to bed about half past ten or eleven, I am not sure, as there was no watch. I lit a candle for Mr. Church to go to bed, I think my master was in the room where the company sits when I went to bed. Draper was there; I did not hear him wrangling with any one. Sometimes we shut up at ten, and sometimes eleven. I think my master called me about a quarter before five; he called me twice, the second time was soon after the first. It was his custom to knock at the wall, or my door always. About seven o'clock, I went to the well to draw water; the well was in the same state as usual, only there was a piece of wood that went across, was broken in two or three pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that appear to have been broken since you had been at the well before - A. That which was broken was a fence that ran round the top of the well the dipping place where I dipped for water, was large enough for a man to tumble in. When I dipped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180013"></xptr>for water was large enough for a man to tumble in. When I dipped the pail, I saw the deceased's hat and face. I went to get assistance directly; I said, good gracions master, there is a man in the well; my masters was letting the fowls out of the fowl-house at that time. He went and looked, and said, good gracious, I suppose it is the poor old hostler. He appeared very much frightened. The body was in an erect posture, just against the pipe of the well; the water was rather thick. My master came to Robinson, the black, who was cleaning his shoes, and he said, good gracious Robinson, there is the poor old hostler in the well. I saw the body after it was taken out of the well; it was in the brewhouse. I heard my master say that he, Robinson, Crouch, and Saunders had taken the deceased out of the well. Draper's brother came about breakfast time. My master could not eat any breakfast, it shocked him so. Mr. Draper's brother was sent for by my master. I am still in the service of the prisoner's family.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Then your poor master was feeding the fowls when you gave him the alarm, and he was so shocked that he could eat no breakfast - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A drunken man going out into the yard, might easy find his way up to the well, and without much difficulty might tumble in - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The railing was very rotten - A. Yes, I should think so. I think the railing would have broken if any one pushed against it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not a place of all others where the body of a murdered person would be sure to be found - A. Yes. My mistress chiefly manages the business; she pays and receives the money. I remember Bricket and Austin coming for the bread and cheese. I gave it them, and went to bed. I went to bed before my master.</p>

            . I was servant to the prisoner in August last. I remember the morning that the man was found in the well. On that morning my master gave me a parcel; he told me I was to go with it, before the body was found; but he gave me the parcel to take after it was found. He told me the over night that I should have to go to Enfield; he told me so at seven o'clock the night previous. It was a very little time after the man was found in the morning that he gave me the parcel. He did not any particular what the parcel was, but he told me to take it to the brewer's, Mr. Etteridge; I gave that parcel to a little boy at the brewer's, in the same state as I received it.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Brailsford, the brewer, at Enfield. Tuck was a customer at our house. I remember the last witness coming to our house about half past seven in the morning of the 9th of August; he gave me a parcel; that parcel contained twenty pounds; eighteen one-pound notes, and two pounds in silver; I kept them about ten minutes, and then gave them to Etteridge, the clerk. I put Tuck's name on each of the notes before I handed them over to Etteridge; I also wrote on them the day of the month and the year, and C. Smith. I don't know that I ever before received any notes from Tuck myself. I should know any of those notes again.</p>

               <p>PHILIP ETTERIDGE. I am clerk to Mr. Brailsford, the brewer, at Enfield. On the morning of the 9th of August, I received eighteen one-pound notes and two pounds in silver from the last witness Smith. One of that parcel of notes was afterwards shewn to Mr. Reynolds. I delivered all them to Draper. I had calied on the morning previous at Tuck's for money; I called again at about four o'clock the same afternoon, I saw Mrs. Tuck; I told her I had a bill to make up, and she said, I should have the money the next morning at half past seven. They were pretty regular in their payments generally; we had no fault to find with them on that account.</p>
               <p>-DEAPER. I am the brother of the deceased. I did not see my brother when he went out in the morning. The deceased's son came to me about eight in the morning of the 9th; and about nine I went to Tuck's, and saw the body; it was in the brewhouse, with its clothes on; I saw Tuck there; he was the first person I saw; I believe I spoke to him first; I asked him if he had taken care of my brother's property, and he said what property he had about him, he had then, and he did not know he had any property. He said, I should see him, and what property he had about him, I might search him. I then proceeded to search the deceased, with the assistance of his son, and he took from him these two books; they had nothing but Court matters in them; also a small purse, with nine shillings in silver and a halfpenny; they were very wet when I got them, the water had penetrated through them. Tuck saw the body; he turned very sick, and was very much agitated, and turned away, and went out to the end of the brewhouse. He reached very much. I left his house almost immediately. He had told me how they found him. I was very frequently with my brother, he was in the habit of having money. I supposed he had some money on that day; but I did not know what he had. Mr. Tuck knew how he got his living. I should suppose he must have done business for him. I received eighteen one-pound notes from Mr. Etteridge on the 13th; I have sixteen of them in my pocket, and Read has the other two.</p>

               <p>-Draper. Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you not take up these two pocketbooks, and say it was all right - A. No, I did not examine them, nor look into them there. I did not examine them until I got two or three hundred yards from the prisoner's house. I opened them to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180014"></xptr>beadle of the parish; I met him going to view the body before he went to the Coroner, and these papers were all entirely wet,</p>

             there, I made a payment to him on the account of a client of mine named Chapel, I paid him three pounds. I look at one of the two one-pound notes produced, and know it to be one of these I paid to Draper on the 8th of August; I know it by"19l" put upon it, I put it on myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you put that on it - A. Because on the 17th, I had taken a large sum of money in notes, and in counting them over, I put the ones altogether, and when they amounted to nineteen pounds, I put"19l" on the outside note. Draper was the only person I paid out of that money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I was examimined at Hatton Garden. I paid Draper from the outside of the roll of notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not at Hattop Garden, say that you could not say whether you took them from the outside or the inside - A. I did not call it to mind at the moment. I don't recollect that I did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. You were asked to write the figures "19" - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Are these the figures you made, in compliance to that request; (putting a piece of paper with the figures "19" on it, into the hands of the witness.) - A. I really don't know; that is not the way I usually make "19"; I can't say whether it 1s.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been wagering on this subject; have you not been wagering that that man will be convicted to day - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath, have you not bet ten pounds, that that man will be convicted to day - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know a person of the name of Dray - A. Yes. The fact was, I saw Mr. Dray at the office, and the wager was ten to one, that he would be committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only wager you have laid on this subject - A. Yes it 1s. I have offered no other. I don't know a Mr. Davison of Charing Cross. I don't know that I ever saw him to my knowledge. (Another paper put into the hands of witness, with the figures"19"on it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Now we come back to the "19" again; did you or did you not write that "19" A.- I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how can you swear to the "19" on the note - A. I can swear to it. I said when I wrote the nineteens at Hatton Garden, that I did not think they would be like that on the note, because I wrote them on the back of a book; and I wrote that on the note at my own office, and at my case on my desk.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I had no knowledge of Mr. Tuck, until I was called on upon this transaction. I look at this note again; I believe I might swear to it, by the name of the Bank clerk,"Barkwaite," as there was a person at Cheshunt of the same name. I had seen that note on the evening before.</p>

            , JUNIOR. I live at Cheshunt. I remember my father having a quantity of notes, to the amount of five hundred pounds on the evening of the 17th of 
               <persName id="t18160918-4-person117">August. He</persName>
             marked the roll of ones"19l," because there were nineteen notes. He marked them, that he might not have to count them over again. I look at this note; I know it; the "19l" is my father's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How came you to open that note, and look at the front of it before you answered - A. I think it is proper to look at a thing before I swear to it. I saw my father write the "19". I was at Hatton Garden office. I did not say then, that I saw my father write it. I told Mr. Harmer at the time, that I could swear to it; Mr. Harmer said, that he thought my father's evidence was not true, and then I said, I could prove it as well as he could.</p>
               <p>KESIAH STREITS. I knew Mr. Draper, the officer of the County Court. In July last, I had to pay him some money. I saw him on Wednesday, the 10th; I paid him one pound four and four pence; I paid him a one pound note, and four shillings in silver. I should know the note again if I saw it; it had two names on it and J M; they were on it when I gave it him. I had received it about a quarter of an hour before from a person of the name of Mrs. Naylor. I had no more notes in my possession when I paid that away. Draper wrote on it when I paid it to him; he wrote my name Strits, which was an improper way of spelling it; he put J B at the bottom for John Brown, at whose suit the debt was incurred. (Note put into the hand of the witness.) That is the note; I can positively swear to it; there is the mark J M on it, and Callaway, and Mr. Morevin, then Streits; he said, if this note should be lost, or if there should be a dispute about it, I should know it again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. It was about a week after Draper's death that I saw this note again.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the front of that note, and you will see J. Rose 267, that is the 26th of the 7th month; was that on it when you parted with it to Draper - A. Yes, that I am sure of.</p>
               <p>Q. You are as sure of that as every thing else - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q.Were these words Pocock 1st of the 8th - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q.There is Neat 3rd of the 8th month; was that on it when you gave it to Draper - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And that you are sure is as true as all the rest you have said - A. Yes. Mr. Draper pointed out the name of Rose to me. Mr. Draper's brother brought the note to me after the death of the deceased. I told him about the name of Callaway. I did not tell him about the name of Rose; I told him Neat was on it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKE. I am a surgeon, residing at Enfield. I was called to examine the body of the deceased on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180015"></xptr>Saturday, the 10th of 
               <persName id="t18160918-4-person118">August.</persName>
             I examined the head, and observed marks of bruises about the head, face, and side of the neck, both cheeks, and under the left ear; on the face were marks of violent bruises as if from a fist. At that time I did not make any particular examination. Tuck said he had been fighting with one of the persons. At that time, his being found in the well, I thought a sufficient cause for his death. By the desire of the Coroner on the 13th and 14th I made a more particular examination; Mr. Holt was then with me. The body was then brought to Enfield at the second examination. I think, from the result of that examination, that the blow on the neck, might have been sufficient to stun him, or render him insensible. I could not then discover any blow that could have occasioned his death. But if I had found the deceased on the ground dead, I should have attributed his death to that blow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. At first I thought that his being in the well was quite a sufficient cause for his death. When I saw it the second time, the blow by the neck had become much more visible; the weather had been hot, and the body had been kept nearly a week.</p>

            . I am an attorney. I know Mr. Reynolds of Cheshunt. I was at Hatton Garden at the examination of the prisoner Tuck. I saw Mr. Reynolds there, and had a conversation with him about the event of the examination; the conversation was concerning the innocence or guilt of the prisoner. I knew Mr. Reynolds by doing agency for him as a Country attorney. I stated to him that it was my opinion that at that period there was no case against the prisoner to convict him, not commit; he differed from me in opinion by stating that he was sure to be hanged. I said it could not be. I said, I would lay him ten pounds to one that the evidence that had been adduced against the prisoner up to that period could not convict the prisoner. I shook him by the hand as a token that the bet was made. In about a minute he turned round, and said it was a mistake, and that he ment a commitment, and not a conviction. I turned upon my heel, and went off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Curiosity took me to Hatton Garden. I don't know that I have ceased to be Mr. Reynold's agent. I have never seen Mr. Tuck twice in my life, until he was apprehended on this, once at his house, and once in Smithfield market. I was subpoened here today.</p>
               <p>MR. DOWLING now called a very considerable number of witnesses, who gave the prisoner an excellent character for humanity, honesty, and integrity.</p>

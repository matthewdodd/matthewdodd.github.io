On the 12th of March I miss'd the things mentioned in the indictment, between eight and nine at night; the watches used to hang on a hook in the parlour; the buckles were with the shoes, under the table;

I went to see the boy in Bridewell, on the other side of the water; I asked him where the rest of the things were; he said the other watch was sold, and he had had a guinea for it; but the other prisoner, the gypsey, said he sold the watch for 25 s. I asked him where the shoes and buckles were; he said Lovell had the shoes on his feet, and Lovell had sold the buckles for a crown. Lovell said that was true. Justice Dawson delivered the things to the constable: the boy told me the gypsey threatened to cut his throat if he did not bring out the bundle. (He had bundled them up in my husband's apron.) He owned he had lodged in a house where

            . Lovell, his wife, and two or three boys, the boy at the bar was one, came to my house in the morning of the 13th of March. I keep a publick-house, near St. George's Church over the water; he called me aside and pulled out a watch, and asked me if I would lend him a guinea and a half till the evening, or the next morning; I refused it: presently he pulled out a guinea and wanted change, I changed it; he went out and left the boys and his wife behind, to pay the reckoning: I desired the boys to go about their business. About two or three hours after Lovell came in again with a bad shilling, and said he had it of me, and insisted on having it changed; I knowing he never had that from me, would not change it; there was a gentleman by, who said to him, Where is that watch you had this morning? here it is, said the gypsey; the gentleman said he would give him a tankard of beer to tell him the number of it; he told us quite a different number. Then the gentleman desired I would stop the watch and man, till he got a constable; then we took him before Justice Dawson; the boy at the bar came after us, to prove the gypsey came honestly by it; but the boy soon confessed the gypsey encouraged him to steal it from his master, a butcher in Holbourn; he also confessed he had robbed his master of another watch and a pair of buckles: the gypsey pretended this watch was a gold one, but it is only silver gilt.</p>

               <p>I came from Portsmouth on the Sunday morning, and on the Tuesday night this boy came to the house where I lay, and said his master had turned him away, because he staid a little too late; there were two other boys; they sent half a crown out, and got a pint of gin: I was fast asleep when he brought these things. The next morning I was going over to the Borough, to fetch some things cut that I had pawned; this boy and two others came over the water after me; he brought into a house, where I was, a breast of mutton and a quartern loaf, and asked me if I could sell him a pair of buckles: I went and sold them for 7 s. then he gave me the watch to dispose of for him; I went and asked 3 l. for it; the gentleman gave me 25 s. for it: the boy said he took the things from his father, and was going to Portsmouth.</p>

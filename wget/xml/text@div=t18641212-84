                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor—the warehouse, 3, Moor-lane, is mine—on night of 20th November, in consequence of information I received, I went there; I found a policeman in charge, and found some boots and shoes had been moved from one warehouse to the other—there were four pairs of boots, one pair of shoes, an odd Napoleon, and an odd boot—they had been taken from the back warehouse to the front—I assisted to search the premises, and on an adjoining roof I found the prisoner lying down—when I brought him to the light, I knew him—he was in my service about four or five years ago, for about nine or ten months I think—I saw a key that was found on the roof by the policeman—I did not try the key.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You did not find the prisoner on the roof yourself, then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I was close to it; that roof joins the premises—it is a shed projecting from the bedroom window on to the adjoining premises—the ad-joining house is a beershop—there is a wall about eighteen feet high, from one court to the other, between the premises of the prosecutor and the beer-shop—the bedroom window is only a small distance from the wall—there was another man charged in the first instance.</p>

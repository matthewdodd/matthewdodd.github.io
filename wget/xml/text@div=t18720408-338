                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 10, Lucy's Buildings, Leather Lane—one Saturday night I was going home along Christopher Street, and came to a part where there is a dead wall—I saw four men standing there—they said "Have you got any lights?"—I said "No"—they said "Have you got any—<hi rend="italic">bacca</hi>?"—I said "No"—they said "I know better"—then they sepa<lb></lb>rated, and one went to my left side and struck me a severe blow on the head, and put his hand in my pocket and took my money—the police came up, and they left—I don't know what money I had, but it was all taken from me—I saw the prisoners in custody three yards off—I do not identify them.</p>

               <p>money in my pocket before 12 o'clock at my friends' in Finsbury Square—I did not take it out in the street to look at it, but most likely I did in a public-house—I then had from 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I will swear I had more than 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was all in silver—I can swear I had a florin and other coins—I had been drinking ever since 2 o'clock.</p>

I was on duty in Christopher Street about 10 o'clock, and saw the prosecutor—four men, of whom the prisoners are two, went up to him, and as I passed he said, "They have robbed me"—I saw them surrounding him, and saw Sullivan strike him, knock his hat over his eyes, and knock him against the wall—I ran after them, and got hold of Matthews at the corner of Back Hill, Leather Lane, and as I turned round I caught hold of Sullivan walking back—I asked Connor if those were the two—he said, "Yes;" and I am sure they are, because I saw them—Matthews said "I only asked for a light"—I searched Sul<lb></lb>livan, and found six half-crowns, a shilling, sixpence, and 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—the prosecutor only mentioned a florin at the station.</p>

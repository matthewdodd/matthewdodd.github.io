               <p>On the 29th of January last, between six and seven in the evening. I was informed somebody was taking some iron away; I went to the door, and the prisoner was coming past with the iron; I said, Bill, your master wants you; he said he would come presently; I said, I want to have a word with you now; and he put the iron behind him; I told him he was a thief, and I had detected him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. Where did you first discover the prisoner and the iron? - A. At the front door; he had taken it off the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a wall to the street, and the iron was upon it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was coming round to the shop-door? - A. He was come clear from it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you he had taken the iron from a man who had taken it from the wall? - A. No, he did not.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner take the iron off the wall adjoining to my father's shop, between six and seven in the evening, after he had left off work, and go round the side of the house with it, near the ruins of a fire; and I went and informed my mother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. It was pretty dark at that time? - A. Not so dark but I could see it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from the ruins? - A. About as far as I am from you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my counsel.(The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character).</p>

On the 16th of July, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came for a pair of stockings which hung at the door, and came to 93/4d. - while I was folding them up he put his hand into his pocket, and said he did not think he had sufficient without changing a half-crown - he put a half-crown on the counter, which I took up and told him it was bad; he said it was not, and said, "Whether good or bad I must have change for it;" I was alone in the shop - I went to the door, and beckoned to Pudley, a neighbour; I gave him the half-crown - he desired the prisoner to pay for the stockings, and told him it was a bad one; he objected to pay; a mob gathered, and the officer came and took him - he was not out of my sight; Pudley took the half-crown to his own shop (next door), cut it in two, and brought it back; the prisoner was searched, and 7d. found on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not offer to pay for the stockings, if you would return me the half-crown, to return the person I had it from? A. He said if I would give him the halfcrown he would go back and change it, and pay for the stockings - I said I should not part with it, for it was bad - he did not tell me where he took it.</p>

            . I am a porkman, and live next door to Miss Niner - I went into the shop, seeing a mob, and Miss Niner said, "Is this a good half-crown?" I said No; she said, "This man insists on my taking it;" he said he had no more money - I asked where he got it; he said he took it in change at the Elephant and Castle, at Newington, on his road from Chatham - I asked if he had sufficient to pay for them without changing the half-crown; he said he had not - he was searched, and two shillings, a sixpence, and 7d. in halfpence were found on him; he insisted at first that it was the coin of the Realm, and on having change for it - he never offered any money for the stockings.</p>

               <p>GEORGE LOCK. I am a watchman. I saw a crowd, and found the prisoner was charged with uttering this halfcrown; I heard him say he had taken it in change that morning for a half-sovereign, at the Elephant and Castle; I found two shillings and sixpence in good money on him, and 7d. in copper.</p>
               <p>MR. FIELD. This half-crown is counterfeit, and made of Britannia metal.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence stating that he had received the half-crown, and had no knowledge of its being counterfeit.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you loose any books on the 7st of January - A. On the 7th of January, Mr. Sampson, a bookseller, in Oxford-street, came to me, and asked me if I had Lord Littleton's and Grays poetical works. I told him I had. I went to the shelf where they should have been placed, I found they were missing. I then told Mr. Sampson, I thought they were missing. Mr. Sampson took them out of his pocket; he said, he had just bought them of a man who had offered them for sale, and he had given eight shillings for them; that the man was to come again in half an hour to sell him some French books; and towards the evening. Mr. Sampson's boy came and said they had detained the prisoner. I went to Mr. Sampson's shop, and challenged the prisoner as being the person who had been in my shop. The last time he was in my shop was on Thursday week. He came into the shop at the time I was engaged. He asked for two sets of Cowper's poems, the small edition. I told him, I had not got the small edition, but I could get them. He walked backwards and forwards in the shop, and said he would call again. He called no more. I did not see him after that, until I saw him in Oxford-street; I then accompanied him down to Marlborough-street office. He waited by me, and ran into the street. I followed him, and overtook him at a considerable distance, and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Who was in your shop when the prisoner came in - A. Three elderly women and some young ladies, and the maid servant.</p>
               <p>MR. SAMPSON. When the prisoner came in my shop I was shewing some pocket-books to a lady. The prisoner asked me whether I purchased books. I said, I did. He produced Gray's and Lord Littleton's poetical works. He asked twelve shillings for them. I bid him eight. He refused it; at last, he took it. He then asked me if I bought foreign books. I said, I did. He said, he had purchased some at the Auction Mart; he did not read foreign languages; if I bought them, and would be at home in an hour and an half, he would bring them to me. After he was gone I examined the books that I had purchased. On the first leaf of Littleton's works was, plates, fourteen shillings. I recognised the writing to be Mr. Clark's, of Piccadilly. I went down to Mr. Clark. The officer has the two books. The prisoner came again to my shop on the Saturday evening, and Mr. Clark was sent for.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in Mr. Sampson's shop when the prisoner came. Mr. Sampson's boy asked him if he was the person that sold Mr. Sampson some books in the early part of the week. The prisoner said, he had. The boy went to fetch Mr. Clark. Mr. Clark came, and the prisoner was taken to Marlborough-street office. The books were given into my custody. These are them.</p>

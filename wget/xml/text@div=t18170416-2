            . I am a constable of the night. Mr. Jones brought the prisoner into the watch-house about half-past eleven o'clock. Mr. Jones appeared as if he had been drinking, but was perfectly collected. The next morning I told the prisoner he might as well say what he had done with the watch, to enable Mr. Jones to recover; he said that would not do.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Cape of Good Hope public-house, Devonshire-mews, Marylebone. On the 24th of January, the prisoner came in a few minutes after three o'clock in the afternoon—he called for a small glass of gin, and a halfpenny biscuit, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he offered me a good crown-piece—I am sure it was good, for I rang it on a piece of mar<lb></lb>ble—I then put it into the drawer—he then said, "I believe I have a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. about me"—I said, "It is no difference, I son give you change for the crown-piece"—I gave it him back, and he put down half-a-sovereign—I said, "You are now offering a half-sovereign"—he took that, and then offered me a counterfeit crown—I said, "You d—d rascal, I have been waiting for you some time"—I collared him, and sent for a policeman—the prisoner said he could give respctable references if I could let him go—he was searched in my bar—he took, off his two coats, waistcoat, hat, and gloves—I felt about them, but could find no other crown—we were going to take off his trowsers, but he said from delicacy he hoped we would not take them, off—I said I knew he had a good crown about him—he repeatedly said he had not—we then took him to the station-house—we took off his boots, and this crown fell down—he stooped and picked it up, and resisted very violently—I caught hold of his hand, and said he would swallow it—we had to get it from him by force.</p>

            . On last Monday night, about twelve o'clock, I was crossing Lombard-street; at the corner of <placeName id="t18130915-51-crimeloc306">Abchurch-lane</placeName>

I tried to keep him off when two others came up; one of them held my arms; then the prisoner took out my money. I cried out once or twice at the time, and struggled, and when he tried for my watch I was so tired with struggling that I could not cry out; then they were about three minutes in getting my watch out of my pocket. When they had got my watch they let loose my arms; then the prisoner gave something to one of the other men; I thought it was my watch that he had given him. I collared him as soon as I had power; I took him by the coat, and the other two men ran towards Gracechurch-street; he ran the contrary way, with me holding him. I cried out, stop thief, as long as I well could, and when he had ran a few yards he stopped; he took hold of me round by the body; he lifted me off the stones two or three times, and twisted me about to fling me. I put out all my strength, and would not let him fling me. He got loose from me; I followed him, and kept nearly up to the side of him; as he ran I cried out stop thief, until he was stopped. I am sure he is the man; I never lost sight of him. He took my watch, a seal to my ribbon and key, and five three-shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch again - A. Yes, it was found in the road.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you run - A. A good distance; there was nobody came to my assistance until the young man stopped him.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 13th it was my night to be out; I heard the cry of stop thief, as I was in Lombard-street watchhouse; I immediately ran down the street; I laid hold of the prisoner by the Post office; I asked who it was that he had robbed. The prosecutor came and said that he had been robbed of his watch and money. I found the box of the watch close to us. The case was blown off; the watch was in the street; there is some dirt on it now. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch.</p>

            . About a quarter past twelve, I was proceeding up Lombard-street in my way home, on Monday night, I heard the cry of stop thief; I immediately looked round, and saw the prisoner running very fast, as though he was pursued; before he came to the spot where I seized him, he upset a man; a man attempted to seize him before me, and at the corner of St. Swithin's-lane I seized him; he instantly cried out he was not the man, but I still kept hold of him; when he found that I would not let him go he stooped down, and threw the watch into the street; I kept hold of him until the constable came up, and took him to the watchhouse. I looked round for the watch, and found it, and the case; I gave it into the custody of the constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence On this night I was coming down Cheapside; I had been drinking with a cousin, a west country-bargeman; this gentleman was fighting in the street; I picked up his hat off the the ground; I put it on his head; he had a woman with him; she said he had lost his watch; I said you had better see whether he has lost his watch or no. I then proceeded up Lombard-street, then I run, and when I came in the watchhouse he did not say any thing about his money.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

I am a railway labourer—on the 16th of March, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, I went to No. 33, Angel-gardens, with Maria Barton—I had my watch safe—I did not have it out at all while I was there—I laid down on the bed, I awoke in half an hour, and my watch was gone—Barton and Smith were there—I asked them whether I might have it again and they would not give it me.</p>

I went to this room with the prosecutor—about a quarter before seven o'clock, whilst he was in bed, Smith came to tell him that his mate wanted him—I knew her by living in the neighbourhood—I saw her take the prosecutor's watch, which was at the foot of the bed—the prosecutor was very much in liquor—I was undressed—as soon as I could get dressed I sent for the policeman, and told him where Smith lived.</p>

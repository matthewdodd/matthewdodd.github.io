I was on duty on 8th January, about midnight—Price spoke to me, and I found the prosecutor at the door of his house, bleeding from his mouth—Price gave me a description—I walked with him down George Street, and saw the two prisoners comeback, looking about on the ground, evidently for something which might have dropped in the scuffle—they ran away, and I chased them up Wells Street; I got near enough to Bryant to recognise his face, and called out to him "<hi rend="italic">Mat</hi> Bryant, that is you," and I thought I would secure Thurlow as he was more of a stranger to me, and I knew Bryant well—Bryant said that he would go</p>

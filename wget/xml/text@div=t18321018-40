On the night of the 9th of September I met the prisoner in Long-acre, and went into a gin-shop with her - we afterwards went to a house; I do not know where; I was very tipsy - I laid on a bed in the room, and went to sleep; her coming into the room a second time awoke me; I saw her take my watch from the mantel-piece - I called Stop thief! I missed my purse from my left-hand trousers pocket; I cannot tell where I had put my trousers, and did not see her take the purse.</p>

             (Police-constable B 15.) At a quarter before three o'clock in the morning I heard a cry of Police! I went and found the prosecutor, who said he had been robbed at the house, which he pointed out - I searched the room, but found nothing; I padlocked the door, and took the key - I went to the watch-house with the prosecutor; I went to the house again at five o'clock- I found the door had been broken open, and fastened inside; I knocked, and then went to the window; I found the prisoner in bed - she told me to give her time to dress, which I did; I then searched, and found this purse, half a crown, a shilling, and a key, which opened some drawers in the prosecutor's room - the prisoner said she found the purse.</p>

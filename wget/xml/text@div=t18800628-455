I manage the Alton Ale Stores, Angel Lane, Stratford—on 15th May the prisoner called at my house; he asked for a glass of mild ale—he paid for that—then he said, "I want to speak to you privately"—I took him into the back room—he said, "I am an officer of Excise, I want to visit your cellars"—I said, "All right, I will go down and show you the way"—when he got down he asked to taste the mild ale—he tasted it—he said it contained water—I said, "No"—he asked to taste the porter—he tasted it and made the same remark, and said "I have to make a report of it"—I said, "You are quite wrong"—he said, "There is nothing more I wish to taste, that will do, I will go upstairs"—he went up—he began to make some entries on paper or in a book, which appeared to me to be like shorthand writing—he said he should not mind himself, but his clerk would not be satisfied—he said he had been 18 years in the Excise, and that he did not want to do anything to jeopardize his position, because he was within two years of coming in for a pension—I said, "Will your clerk require a fee?"—he said, "Yes, it will be necessary"—I said, "Will a sovereign be sufficient to satisfy him?"—he said it would—I gave him a sovereign—he said he did not wish to show the trade up, because it went against the house if one wanted to let it after an exposure of that sort—he said most likely he would be back in the evening with his clerk—I parted with my sovereign because I believed his statement.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I did not go to these public-houses with any intention to defraud. Several complaints had been made, and as I have been in the public line I was asked to go. It is well known to those who sent me that my experience in tasting ale will tell me whether it is adulterated. I complained that there was water in the ale. At first they denied it; then they admitted they had put a small portion in. I said "You are aware you have no businesss to do so, it is very wrong; in fact the brewers get blamed for sending you bad articles; you ought to sell it the same as you get it from the brewers; instead of that you adulterate it." They acknowledged it and gave me something to say nothing about it. I did not ask for it, they gave it me voluntarily. The witness who went with me does not know that I went into the cellars, In fact I did not, and he has been round since and found I did not go. He went drinking with me all the afternoon. I paid for what I had. I simply asked him to lend me half-a-crown and wait till I came back.</p>

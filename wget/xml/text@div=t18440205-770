                  </hi>. In Nov. 1840, I was living in Back Church-lane, Whitechapel, and carried on the business of a boot and shoemaker. After the fire at Hoare's-wharf, I purchased some Hessian linen canvas, and other things, at the sales—there were five successive sales—I saw a man named Nathan at all the sales, and he saw me—on the 4th of Nov., Nathan came to me at Goulston-street, where I have a warehouse—he said to me, "Well, Mr. Berlyn, have you sold all your linen yet?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I think I can sell a great quantity for you; what will you allow me?"—I said, "I will allow you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; per cent. on all that you sell for me"—he said 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; per cent, would not pay him, and it was ultimately agreed that I should allow him a farthing a yard, which made it come to 6 1/4 <hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; per cent—he asked me to give him samples of the various sorts I had, and the quantity of each, which I did—he came again the same day and said he had seen the person he wanted the linen for, that he was captain of his own vessel, and a man of large property, that the captain wished to see me himself to bargain for this linen, and if I would go with him at half-past four that afternoon, after 'Change time, to No. 15, Baker-street, Lloyd's-square, Captain Cornish would try to deal with me—we arranged to go that afternoon at half-past four, after 'Change time—about twelve o'clock Nathan came again and said he had seen the captain since he saw me, and the captain wanted a quantity of flock—I said, "Flock is a thing I do not sell, and I am no judge of it"—he said, "I could not haw come to a better person than you; I know you have a few pounds at com<lb></lb>mand; I know a person who has a large quantity on hand, and has a bill to pay, and he would be glad to sell it at a little loss to turn it into cash"—I said I</p>

               <p>was no judge of it—he said he had been brought up in that business all his life, and he knew the value of it to a fraction—he advised me to take a sample of it to the captain—Nathan went and got the sample and brought me the price as 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a ton—he said the man had a ton and a half of it—Nathan and I then took the samples of the linen and the flock to No. 15, Baker-street, Lloyd's-square—the name of Cornish was on the door—we knocked, a lady opened the door, Nathan went in and I followed him—the lady said, "Your pleasure, sir?"—he said, "Will you be kind enough to tell Captain Cornish that Mr. Nathan is come?"—the parlour door then opened, and the prisoner was there—he said, "It is you, Mr. Nathan; step in"—we went into the parlour, and when we entered Nathan bowed to the prisoner, and introduced me as Mr. Berlyn, and then he said to me, "This is Captain Cornish"—the prisoner asked us to sit down, and when we had sat a minute or two, the prisoner laid, "Well, sir, I understand you have a quantity of this linen?"—he asked me the price—I said I had 4,000 yards of the Hessian linen, at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 4,000, at 3 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he offered me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard, and to take the whole 8000 yards—I told him I could not make any abate<lb></lb>ment from the price, and he said as that was the case he could only take 1000 yards at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when that bargain was made he said, "Have you brought a pattern of that flock that I wanted, Mr. Nathan?"—Nathan said, "Yes, Mr. Berlyn has got it"—I produced it, and agreed to let the captain have it at 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a ton—I told him there was about a ton and a half—he said he wanted it for shipping—he did not mention what vessel he was captain of, but said he was going to set sail in a day or two—when I asked him the price for the flock he said I was much cheaper with the flock than I was with the linen, and he agreed to take that at once—he said I ought to make some little allowance, as all his dealings were for cash—I said I did business on no other terms—he then said, "I want these goods to-morrow; they must be here between twelve and one"—I said very well, he should have them, and they were to be paid for on delivery—that was the agreement between us at the time—I was then about to take my departure, and the captain said, "Won't you take a glass of wine before you go?"—I said I was not in the habit of drinking wine—he said I was not half a sailor, and would I have some grog—I at last had a drop of clear gin—I then went away, and Nathan with me—I laid to him, "Where is this flock?"—he told me to come with him, and took me to a man named Isaacs, of whom I bought the flock for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—the next day I took the flock and linen in a van and a cart—I paid a sovereign for the use of them—I went, and Nathan with me, to the house in Baker-street—I knocked at the door, and the captain opened it himself—he said, "Good morning, Mr. Berlyn; you have brought these goods; you are very exact; if you will be kind enough to take them round to my warehouse, in Spring-street, my man will be there and receive them of you, and he will assist you in unloading; then come back, and I will pay you"—I was going to leave the house with the goods, and he said to me, "Have you got the invoice?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Let me peruse it, to see that it is all right"—I gave it him and went round to Spring-street, where I met his man, and he assisted me to unload the goods into a coach-house—I then gave the men a sovereign for the van, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get some bread and cheese—I went back to the house, and knocked—I saw a woman, but I could not find the captain," and could not get my money—the next day I went to the police-office, and, by the advice of the Magistrate, I was accompanied to the prisoner's house by the police-inspector—I went to the warehouse with a sledge-hammer, and gave two or three men 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-piece to assist me—I broke open the door—I found the flock, and got all that back again—I went across the yard, and got into the house—I saw a lad, who came with a crow-bar, and said, "What do you want here?" and made a blow at me—I did not see the prisoner there at first, but I saw him afterwards at the back parlour window—he said nothing—I said, "I want my property"—a woman who was there held up the invoice, in the prisoner's presence, and said, "What do you want? it is only a mere debt; you can do nothing but sue for it"—I had broken the window to get into the house, followed by two or three persons—I got severely handled by a number of persons in the house where the pri<lb></lb>soner was—one struck me with a poker in the ribs, and I did not recover it for three weeks, and I got nearly blinded, as I had an umbrella <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> into my eye—I found about half the linen in the house, and succeeded in gaining that—the persons who went with me were frightened, and decamped—the value of what I lost was about 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—I saw Nathan after that, and taxed him with being a party concerned—he said what a fool I must have been to be <hi rend="italic">gulled</hi> by him out of so much money, and he only wanted such fools as me to enable him to pay for his wife's confinement—he mentioned something about sharing some money, but I forget it almost; it was, that two or three of them had a share, or a <hi rend="italic">swag</hi>, or something, out of it—I once saw the captain afterwards, but I could not secure him; I had broken both my legs and arms, and could not chase him—I found him here in Newgate, and recognized him at once.</p>

               <p>I am a Smith. On Saturday the 10th of November, I was employed to do some business for Mr. Austin, in the coal cellar, which has a communication with the area; this was two doors from Mr. Kastevan's - the same side of the way - about half past 5 in the evening, I observed a piece of goods, which I now produce, in the area of Mr. Austin's house. As soon as I discovered it, I got up from the area and went to Mr. Austin's house, where he now lives, while the house was repairing, and told him what had happened. I ask'd him to step over with me: he went over with me; and I took up the piece of goods, and gave it into the hands of Mr. Austin, and he carried it to his own house; and the same piece was brought back by Mr. Austin and me. - It was never out of my sight, only whilst I was climbing up the area. - After I had given it to Mr. Austin, I went with Mr. Austin to his house, I came back again with him, and threw it down again on the same place, as near as I could, in which I found it. I took my station then just within side of the coal-cellar, which was as near as possible. There was a doorway out of the coal-cellar into the area, I believe my feet were in the area. I sat within side the coal-cellar, to hear what passed, and to wait in case any body should come. - I did this by Mr. Kastevan's desire. After I had set there some little time, about half or three-quarters of an hour, some persons, one of whom I suppose to be the prisoner, came to the top of the area, and looked down, and said, there it lays - it is safe. - Are those boards fast? - (speaking to each other) meaning the boards that were laid down to prevent people from falling down before the iron-work was compleated. Another answered and said; No: they are only laid over to prevent people from falling; and these stones are rolled upon them to prevent the boards from moving. Then they went away, and in about a quarter of an hour after, as nigh as I can tell, they returned; and, looking down the area, they saw the piece of goods; they said, there it lies - it is safe; now we will have it immediately. The prisoner came down the area - the boards were removed, - He climbed down - The goods lay at the depth of about 8 or 9 feet: they were obliged to scramble down. On his getting down, I seized him, and took hold of the piece of goods - he had got it about breast-high, as if to deliver it to some one on the outside. I saw him drop pretty near to the goods; so high, that his feet touched the goods. I saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150022"></xptr>stoop and take up the goods: there was a lamp near. - There was more than one person above. I roused myself from my sitting, and caught hold by his coat, and all his waistcoat collars, and dragged him about the area, and cried out for help. He struggled, and fought with me to get away, but I had fast hold and would not let him go: his companions, who were above, whom I knew nothing of, said let him go - let him come up; - we will secure him. My answer was, as soon as I see a face I do know, I will let him go, upon which, immediately, a large club was striking at me from above. As soon as I refused to let him go, they struck at me, and I got down, and pulled the prisoner down over me, in order to secure myself from the blows. Mr.

             came, and I cried out, I have got him safe. - Then Mr. Kastevan took him from me, from the area; and as soon as I could get the piece of goods up, I went up myself, to Mr. Kastevan's shop, and they consulted, that it would be best to take him to Bow-street, in a coach. I went with him in the coach. As soon as we got in, the right-hand door was opened; and there was some alarm given, and sticks striking about the coach. - And the prisoner started up, and was half out of the coach. Mr. Kastevan and I were inside the coach; and he found we had got him so secure, that he cried out, Do not hurt them. I will not go with you, I tell you. (The silk produced and deposed to).</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This was several doors from Mr. Kastevan's house, where this man was found? - The second door.</p>
               <p>Q. In the area of an uninhabited house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first go to work in this area? - That day after I had my dinner, about two or three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And you continued working there till you saw this? - No Sir, I had orders to make a coal plate and fastenings; and which was not made till the workmen were all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you left the work for same time? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And returning you found this piece of goods in your area.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it dark when you left the place? - It was quite dark; I had a candle to go into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say positively no other person was in the yard, from the time the piece was thrown down by you, till the prisoner came to take it up? - there was no body but the prisoner.</p>

It cost about 8 s. a yard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Have you not expressed a suspicion that some people that were intrusted by you, had put the goods down there, that some bad people might come and take them away? - I had no suspicion at the time of any body.</p>

               <p>The prime cost of this piece of silk is at 8 s. 6 d. per yard. At about a quarter past five I sent the servant over the way, to the house, to dinner, where the family reside, and told him when he came back to clear the window; I then observed the window was perfectly full: In about half an hour I think the prisoner was secured in the area; I went down and got him into my own house, and when I got him into the shop, he fell down on his knees and begged mercy; the prisoner had not the least connection with our shop; he was taken to Bow-street; I went in the coach with him; the moment the coach had turned about, a dozen yards, the door of the coach was opened, and some men appeared with bludgeons, and a cry, rescue, damn you, come out; the prisoner gave a leap; I took hold of his collar; he attempted to get away, and we secured him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I am told there is a person of the name of Cave, interested in your business? - That is two years and a half ago; There is no one interested now but my brother and myself.</p>

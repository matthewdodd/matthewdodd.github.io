I am the daughter of James Walker Moore, who keeps the Lord Derby public-house at Plumstead—on 29th April, between 1 and 2 in the day, I was in a room adjoining the bar—I heard a noise in the bar, and went in; I found Geary there standing opposite the till—he asked me for a pipe—I gave him one—I then looked into the till, and found that it had been emptied—previous to that there had been some silver in it—my mother had been last at the till—I told Geary he had taken the money, and I called my mother—he ran out of the bar into the street, and my mother and I after him, shouting, "Stop thief!"—when he had got a little distance, my mother got hold of him—he dragged her on the ground—my uncle brought Geary back, and another man ran after the other prisoner.</p>

I am a wheeler in the carriage department of the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich—a little before 2 on the afternoon in question, I was coming past the Lord Derby, and saw Geary come out, and Klotz standing between the window and the door, with his back to the wall—I saw Geary hand something to Klotz, and Klotz placed his hand in his trousers-pocket—I distinctly heard money chink; I did not see it—Geary walked down towards the village—the landlady came out, and got hold of him—I can't say whether he knocked her on the ground, but I saw her on the ground—Geary was stopped, and I made a communication to the land<lb></lb>lady about Klotz—he was then some distance off; he ran, and I ran after him—he got over a fence six or seven feet high—I got over after him—I called to a Mr. Roberts to come after me, and he did, and a Mr. Opperton, who was passing. on horseback, gallopped after him; and when he found he could not get away, he stopped, and was brought back.</p>

               <p>another man, I cannot positively say who—I thought it was Coward, but cannot swear to him—I served Allen with an <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi>, and the other man with six raffle papers—I had to go to the back of the shop to get both articles, about forty feet at least; I came back, and gave them to the men, took the money, and they left—I had seven bundles of the <hi rend="italic">London Journal</hi>, larger than this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had received thirty-five reams of it, each containing 540 sheets, and seven of them were left on the counter—there were three lots of two, and one across them—I heard a noise when I was at the back of the shop, and looked up, and saw either one or two of the bundles gone—my counter is very high, and I was not aware but what the bundles were on the floor—I then went round the counter, and found that they were gone—I had no person in the shop—I had to go to the first floor before I could shut the shop door, and therefore thought best to let them go, as I knew Allen well—I gave information to the police—it had just struck 7 o'clock—they were afterwards taken into custody, and I was shown some <hi rend="italic">London Journals</hi>, a similar portion to what I missed—only two persons in London publish them—they have a private mark on them—they were brought to me on Saturday night, to publish on Monday morning.</p>

               <p>Oct., I was on duty in Warwick Lane, and saw the prisoner shortly before 7 o'clock, at Amen Corner, with a third party, between thirty and forty yards from Mr. Clarke's—I went up to them, and stood and looked at them for about a minute—they walked up Warwick Lane—the prisoners went into Mr. Clark's, and the other man remained at the window—I then went round my beat, and shortly afterwards Mr. Clark came to me, and gave me some information—I went round Newgate Market, and met Allen in the market with Mr. Clark—I told him that I should take him into custody on suspicion of stealing a bundle of <hi rend="italic">London Journals</hi> from Mr. Clark's shop—he said that he had never seen the bundle, and knew nothing of it—I took him to the station and searched him—the inspector asked his address—he at first said that he should not give it, and then he said, "I live at No. 19, St. Martin's le Grand"—after that he said, "That is not right; I live at No. 2, Wyndham Villas, Tottenham"—he was then locked up—I found a bunch of keys and a door key, with which I went to No. 15, Bath Street, Newgate Street—it opened the office door; that is a front room with a sitting room in the rear of it—it is merely a newsvending office—under the end of a sofa in that sitting room I found this bundle of papers on the floor—I took it to the station.</p>

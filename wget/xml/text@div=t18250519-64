            . I live in Summer-street, Air-street-hill. On Saturday, the 26th of February, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I was going through Islington turnpike, and saw two men on two brown or bay horses - one with a darkish snuff or brown coloured coat, and the other with a dark blue or black coat; one horse appeared to me to be higher than the other - one had a snaffle bridle, and the other a chaise or coach bridle, with a white rosette in the centre. I thought they were gentlemen's servants, exercising their horses, and were in a hurry, as they trotted very sharp; they were coming towards town. I saw Brooks and Yaxley on the 17th of May, at Worship-street, and think they are the men, but will not swear positively to them; I did not know the horses.</p>

            . I live in Northampton-street, Dog-row, Bethnal-green. On the 26th of February I was at the Artichoke, public-house, at lunch, with a friend, between eleven and twelve o'clock, when two men rode up to the door, and called out, "Landlord;" I went out, and saw one on a grey pony, and the other on a coach horse; they were very much in liquor: the landlord took them out some brandy - they did not get off their horses. I afterwards went home, and hearing a noise at the top of my street, I turned my head round, and saw Yaxley (who I can swear is the one who was on the grey pony at the Artichoke) with another taller man and a boy - they were quarrelling about a horse-cloth which was on the grey pony, at the top of the street; nobody was then on it: Yaxley spoke across the pony to the boy, and he gave the horse-cloth up to the man immediately; they directly went towards Jones's stables - I only saw the pony then.</p>

            . I live at Bethnal-green. I was at the Artichoke, and saw three or four men there, about eleven o'clock in the morning - Yaxley, Harper, and Brooks are three of them; I was there about half an hour in conversation with them. I am positive of Harper and Yaxley, but rather doubt about Brooks; they were drinking rum and milk, and Brooks, if he is the man, was laying down. About six o'clock that evening I met four men, all on horse-back, at Bethnal-green turnpike, going towards Shoreditch; one was on a grey pony - one appeared to be a coach horse: the other two did not appear so tall as that - Harper and Yaxley are two of them - I particularly noticed them; one of them was on the grey pony, and I believe Brooks to be the man who was on the large horse.</p>

            . Yaxley's father took a stable in my yard, Dog-row, Bethnal-green, nine or ten months ago. - On Saturday, the 26th of February, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I was going to Old Ford, and as I went out I saw some person ride a bay horse down the yard - I did not take notice of him. I was absent all day, and came home about 6 o'clock in the evening. Yaxley's father owed me two guineas for rent - I took a broker to the stable, and found two horses there; I think the bay horse was one: the rent was brought that night by a woman, and the horses were taken away while I was in my kitchen. After they went away I found a bridle hanging up, and took it in doors - it was given up to the officer by my wife (looking at one;) this resembles it: I recollect there were the letters T. A. J. on it, in the same place as on this. I saw a bridle similar to it on the grey horse when it came into the yard.</p>

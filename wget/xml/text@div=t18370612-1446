                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Wellington-square, Gray's Inn-road. The prisoner worked for me, and lodged in my house for three or four weeks—on the 16th of May I went out about two o'clock, and returned about six o'clock—I missed six pairs of boots and shoes, and some of our tools—I found a duplicate for a pair of boots on the prisoner's seat, but could not find him—I took him next morning in my own house—he said he had taken one pair of boots, and one pair of shoes, but not the others—the duplicate of a pair of shoes was found on him.</p>

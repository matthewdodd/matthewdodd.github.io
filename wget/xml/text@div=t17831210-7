               <p>What may be the value of them? - One pound one shilling.</p>
               <p>Court. That is three shillings and sixpence a pair? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you serve the other woman with stockings? - No, she would not have them at that price, I asked eighteen-pence, and she wanted them for sixteen-pence, the other woman told this woman to go out and mind a jackass that they had out of doors; I suspected then that they had got something; and I told the maid as soon as they were gone that they had got something.</p>
               <p>Did you examine to see if you had lost any stockings? - Yes, one Mr. Meecham came who had taken the stockings upon her, he asked me if we had lost any stockings, I said, I would look, I told him, I thought I had by two women who just then went out.</p>
               <p>Did Meecham you what stockings he had taken? - He said, he had taken some stockings, I looked, and missed these six pair of ribbed white cotton, I had put them in the window about five minutes before; I then went with Mr. Meecham to a public house, next to Justice Walker's in High-street, and there I saw the stockings.</p>

               <p>Page. About Seven o'Clock in the Evening, the Prisoner at the Bar brought this Watch to my House , in order to borrow a Guinea and a half. I ask'd her where she liv'd. She said, near where I liv'd. I ask'd her whose Watch it was. She said, her Husband's, and that he was ill, and that she pawn'd it out of Necessary, for her Husband. Then, Sir, she said, I let you know, the Watch is not mine, but a Woman's whose Husband is ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the Prisoner at the Bar confess'd this?</p>
               <p>Page. Yes, When I had her before Justice Toll, she confess'd she had stole the Watch.</p>

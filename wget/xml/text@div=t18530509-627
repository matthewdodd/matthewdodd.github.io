                  </hi>, I am the assistant manager of the London and County Bank, in Lombard-street—the prisoner bas been in the employment of the bank for about four months—bit salary was paid monthly—no alteration has taken place in the payment of it—the last payment I made to him before this transaction was on 31st March—on 14th April last Messrs. White, tobacconists, of Shoreditch, paid a turn of money into the bank—I did not receive it; but I made the first entry of it—I have the book in which I made it (<hi rend="italic">referring to it</hi>)—it was 12191. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., of which 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in money, and the remainder in notes and checks—when notes and checks are received from a customer they are folded up and passed into a box, called the waste box, or cash box—there are clerks whose duty it is to keep waste books, to take the particulars of those notes and checks respectively, and enter them in the waste books—the prisoner kept one pf those waste books—I folded up the notes and checks received from Mr. White, and put them into the box—this is the waste book which the prisoner kept (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I find here an entry in hit handwriting of the notes and checks received—among the notes there it an entry of one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, No. 21,125, dated 10th Jan., 1853—that entry must have been made from the note itself—it is our practice to make up our balances every night—on the night of 14th April I am informed there was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short; I was not present—on 23rd April the prisoner was charged with stealing the note—he denied it—I asked him what time he left for dinner on 14th April—I think he said between I and 2—the ordinary time allowed for dinner is under an hour—he said the entry that I have referred to in the waste book, must have been made soon after 12, or about 12—after making the entry he would pass the notes and checks into another box which stands before him, and then they would either go into the till, or be paid into the Bank at night; generally speaking, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes go to the Bank of England—they are not often paid away, unless they are new notes—after the prisoner had been charged with stealing the note, he said that it came from Messrs. White—that is the note that had been missed—I see the name of "James Duke, 19, Ebury-street, Pimlico," on this note—I have seen the prisoner write—I believe that to be in his handwriting.</p>

               <p>sit at the desk, or who may hare occasion to pass it, could have access to it—there are other clerks who keep waste books besides the prisoner—the produce of their books all goes into the waste box, they all mingle together—the cashiers can draw notes out of the box if they wish, and they do occasionally; they do not often have occasion to do it—there are six or seven cashiers—the prisoner was a collecting clerk—he was introduced by Mr. Brady, the member of Parliament—we should not have taken him without a high character; I am not aware what sort of character Mr. Brady gave him—I understand he originally came from Ireland—I do not know what the amount of his collection may have been, I should not have hesitated to allow him to collect large sums—I cannot charge my memory that he has collected 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day, he may have collected 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or he may have had 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6. 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I have had no occasion to refer—his collection was on the Southwark side, which does not include many bankers, therefore it would not probably be very large—when I first charged him with this, I told him that the note had been changed at the Bank between 3 and 4 o'clock; I was told so, not by the person who changed it—the prisoner's ordinary time for going to dinner was from 1 to 2 o'clock—I do not state that of my own knowledge—I do not of my own knowledge know what was his ordinary time of going to dinner, I have been informed by others—my duty is a general superintendence of the whole establishment—there are fifty-one clerks—all those clerks would not have occasion to go to the part of the bank where the waste box is kept, but not being a closed box, they could go to it—they would have access to it undoubtedly—perhaps half a dozen persons would have access to it in the course of their duty during the day; it might be ten or twelve—I have seen the prisoner write many times before 14th April—I have seen the entries in this book since this charge was made—I have compared the note with the entries—I have not compared the note with the handwriting in the book since the charge was made; I did before it was made—I had no doubt about the handwriting; I never bad any doubt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that the reason you compared it with the entries? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was struck with the similarity between them—not the first time I saw it; the first time I saw it I merely recognized the handwriting as that of some one whom I knew—my suspicions did not light on any other person first—I swear that—I did not compare it with the handwriting of any one but the prisoner—I did not order any one else to do so—I did not look at any other clerk's handwriting—I first looked at the prisoner's handwriting, for the purpose of comparing the note with it, when we had a notice from the Bank—I did not see the note on the 14th—I think not until the Wednesday or Thursday before the Saturday on which the prisoner was charged—I then compared it with handwriting of his—I think I compared it altogether three times; I cannot tell you for how long I was comparing it each time—I was comparing it then as a confirmation of my own views—the first time I was not half a minute comparing it—I cannot tell how long I was the second time, it might be two or three minutes; and the third time two or three minutes—I did not compare it six or seven times, it was two or three times; I am not speaking by the card—one clerk was comparing it with me; his name is Gray; that was only upon one occasion—I think that was upon the second occasion—the first time I compared it was the word "Pimlico," with the Pimlico which we have in his address—that was immediately I had the note I cannot charge my memory whether it was on the Wednesday or Thursday—I cannot say on what day I last compared it—Mr. Mullens, the solicitor, was with me on one occasion; he had the note, and 1 had the book; he was struck with the-great</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185305090125"></xptr>
               <p>similarity—I think that was at the time the prisoner was charged with it—I believe I was the only person examined about the handwriting before the Magistrate—I do not remember whether there was another clerk there or not—since then I have been asked whether any other clerk knew his handwriting—I have not been told that it was necessary to bring further evidence as to the handwriting; I swear that—I was asked if I knew any other clerk that could speak to his handwriting, as it would be desirable to have the evidence strengthened—there are two other clerks here to-day to speak to it—one of those certainly was not examined before the Magistrate; I cannot charge my memory whether the other was or not—Mr. Gray is not here—he is not in the department where the prisoner was, quite apart from it; it was mere matter of curiosity with him—he does not profess to know his writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With reference to this 219<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., would you yourself, after it had been received from the Messrs. White, have to make the entry about it, or do anything with it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I happened on that morning to have entered it in the cashiers' receiving book—there was pressure of business at the counter, and I was down there, and happened to make the first entry of it—it had not at that time passed through the prisoner's hands—after I made the entry it would pass to the cash book keeper, who would then pass it on to the waste box, from which the prisoner would take it and enter it, the cash book keeper takes the amount only—after the prisoner enters it, it ii put into another box, an open tin box sometimes; they are only put in, sometimes, a weight is put upon them—the waste book is not made up in any way at the end of the day; it is called over by clerk with the cashier, but the posting is from the cash book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi>, When these bundles of notes or checks are put in the waste box, how does the clerk (the prisoner for instance, in this case) know to whose account they are to be credited? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because the original ticket, or particulars stated, remains upon them—there is particular ticket with each parcel, that states the name of the customer, and sometimes it states the separate amounts of the checks and notes—for the number and date of the note, the party must look to the note itself, it may be that the notes received from the customers and put into the waste box are taken out again for the general purposes of the bank, when required; that is after they are entered; they are never used till after they are entered in the waste book—when they are entered they are placed in tin box, at least they ought to be; that is separate box from the waste box—notes are not taken from the waste box for the general use of the bunk, but from the box in which they are placed after they have been entered—I at first heard that this note had been presented at the bank between 3 and 4 o'clock, I afterwards heard that that was mistake—when I told the prisoner that I had heard the note was presented at the bank between 3 and 4 o'clock, he said he had not been out the whole of the afternoon; he repeated that several times—I ascertained that he had been out between 3 and 4 o'clock; I told him so, and produced the book to show him—he said he thought I referred to the morning collection—I understood that his usual hour for dinner was from 1 to 2 o'clock; that was left for mutual arrangement among the clerks themselves—I think I first saw this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note on the Wednesday before the Saturday on which the prisoner was given into custody—I communicated with Mr. Mullens immediately we received the notice from the bank I think, or on Monday morning—the note was changed at the bank on Thursday, we stopped it on Friday morning, but we got no information from the hank of its having been</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk in the London and County Bank, and have been so three years—the prisoner has been employed there about three months—I remember on 14th April, the balance being wrong 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was at the bank all that day—I sat at the same desk with the prisoner—his general habit was to leave for his dinner at 1 o'clock, or little after, and to return some time after 2 o'clock; he varied much more in the hour of returning than in the time of leaving—I have known him sometimes as late as half past 2 o'clock—his time for going was very regular while he was in that department—he was employed in that department on 14th April—it is called the Waste Book department—entering credits—I cannot fix the particular time at which he went to his dinner that day, but if he had departed from his usual habit to any extent, I should have observed it—I did not go to dinner myself at all that day, until after bank hours—I believe the prisoner went little after 1 o'clock—he was expected to go at 1 o'clock—we were detained till nearly half past 11 o'clock that night, endeavouring to trace the deficiency—we at last discovered that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was missing, and next day we discovered the number and date of the missing note—I had conversation with the prisoner about it—I believed that the note had been mislaid—the Waste Book keeper was frequently in the habit of passing notes in halves, not joined, to another desk where they are joined by others, and where it is much more likely they would be mislaid, or get into book—I asked the prisoner whether it was likely he had passed the note behind to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185305090127"></xptr>
               <p>be joined? he answered, that he had perfect recollection that he had passed no notes behind to be joined, received from town customers at that time of day—White and Co. would be town customers—I have seen the prisoner write—I believe this, "Duke, Ebury-street, Pimlico," on this note, to be his writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I think you were not before the Magistrates? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I was on leave at the time—the clerks arranged pretty much among themselves as to the hour at which they should go to dinner, but they go at fixed hour—an hour is generally allowed them—if they go at 1 o'clock they ought to be back at 2 o'clock—if they are not, sometimes notice is not taken of it, it is left to their own discretion—it need not be from 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock; it may be from half-past 2 o'clock to half past 3 o'clock, or when their duty permits them—the prisoner had a certain duty to discharge at exactly few minutes before 1 o'clock—he would be expected to return about 2 o'clock—I remember that he did not return immediately within the hour—he was in the habit of stopping more than the hour—I was not at any time in the County department that day, except to pass through it—I was not occupied there—I always endeavour in my department to note the time the young men go and return, or should be expected to return—I was first asked about—the time at which the prisoner went to dinner that day, after my return on leave—I do not recollect the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you when you returned compare this note with the handwriting of the prisoner in the book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw his handwriting in the book afterwards; that might be for the purpose of strengthening my opinion with regard to the writing, but I had no doubt of the handwriting when I saw it—I did not wish to see it to strengthen my opinion, but it was shown to me by Mr. McKewan—he did not in words ask me to compare it—he produced the book for the purpose of doing so—he did not do so more than once—I compared it with him—I do not recollect that I did it with any one else—I check this waste book with the cash book keeper, at about quarter to 1 o'clock in the day, after which the prisoner was expected to go to dinner—that was at 1 o'clock—one young man would be allowed to exchange hit dinner hour with another, but I should be aware of it in that department.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Willoughby Bishop, sadler, of No. 15, Upper Ebury-street, Pimlico. The prisoner lodged with me between five and six months—on 14th April he paid me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it had been owing about two months, or rather better—the bill is for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had paid part—it was for lodging, and things that I bad supplied him with—I had applied to him for money before 14th April—he said the first month that he could not pay, on account of paying 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the bank for security—he afterwards said he expected money up in day or two from the country, and then he would pay me—I named it to him again next month, and said if he would let me have it by quarter-day, that would do—he said he would be sure to let me have it when his own month's money was due—when the two months' came due we named it to him again, and then he said they had put him off; instead of paying him every month, they would pay him every quarter—by "they," he meant the bank—on the last occasion before he paid, he said he expected some money up from the country, and he would pay us on Tuesday—he did not come home to his lodging on Tuesday or Wednesday—he came on Thursday, 14th, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening, and then be paid—he paid in sovereigns—I did not notice them particularly; they were rather new.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had there been any disputes between you about things being taken from his room for which he should hold you responsible? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I said I was not, and I was not responsible for his things in any way—the first complaint he made was about shirt, which the washerwoman had; she had removed down to Chelsea, I did not know where; as to the other things I knew nothing—I know of his receiving remittance from Ireland while he was with me, and I tried to change note for him, but could not—that was when he first came to us.</p>

The prosecutor and the prisoner came to my house on the night of the 24th of July - the prosecutor was very tipsy, and the prisoner a little so - they came arm in arm - the prisoner asked for a bed, and said he would pay me for it - he said the prosecutor was a shipmate of his - the prisoner paid me 4s. - I showed them into the bed-room, and locked the door - I did not see that the prisoner had any thing in his hand then - he rang me up again, and wanted me to get some more liquor - I then saw that he had a pocket-book in his hand - he put it into his trowsers' pocket, and I sent for the policeman.</p>

             (police-constable H 44). I was called, and searched the prisoner - in his left hand jacket pocket I found this pocket-book, containing 4 £5 notes, and the discharge from the ship - I took him to the watch-house, and found 3s. on him - he said he had no more money; but the next morning, I found two sovereigns in a rule-pocket - when I found the pocket-book on him, I asked if he was a shipmate of the prosecutor - he said he was; that he came in the same ship, and he was to receive 80l. the next day; and he had taken this book from the prosecutor to take care of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you happen to know that the prisoner has been on board a ship as a carpenter's mate? A. There was a character found on him from the Rainbow man-of-war.</p>

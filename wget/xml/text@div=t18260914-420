            . I am a boot-closer. On Saturday night, the 22d of July, I called on Mrs. Young - I do not know her husband's Christian name - I went up stairs, by her desire, and found the prisoner in the second floor room, where Evison slept; he was walking from the cupboard, with the hat in one hand, and the bundle in the other - I asked him what brought him there - he said Evison let him in to sleep with him, as it was a wet night - I was rather rash with him, and Mrs. Young desired me not to be so violent - I went with him to the public-house where Evison was - I found Evison was gone - the prisoner then went away with the property.</p>

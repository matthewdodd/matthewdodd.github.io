                  </hi>. I live with my husband, at No. 30 A, Grosvenor Mews. The prisoner and his wife live in rooms adjoining ours—it is a different house, but only the wall separated them—on 17th Aug. I was in company with Mrs. Moody after 11 o'clock at night—when I returned home she was in a neighbour's room—we went to the Coach and Horses, I and my hus<lb></lb>band, Mrs. Turner and her husband, and the deceased—this was about a quarter or 20 minutes past 11 o'clock—we were at the Coach and Horses about ten minutes—we had half a pint of gin there among the five—the deceased merely tasted it; she drank about a spoonful—I cannot say whether she had had anything to drink before that; I was not at home—she appeared to have had a glass, but was not at all tipsy—I think she had had a little—I left the Coach and Horses with her about 20 minutes to 12 o'clock—I saw her go into her own house—I went into mine—I am able to hear in my room what passes in hers—I am certain she went into her room; I could hear her there—I went to bed directly—between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning I heard the prisoner come home in the next house—I had been asleep, and the dog barking awoke me—the prisoner came into his room, and shut the door, and began d—g his wife, and calling her filthy names—he said, "You d—b—, where have you been? where have you been?"—that repeatedly, three or four times, and "Who have you been with? where did you get the drink? where did you get the money?" repeating the words a great many times—she said, with a cry, "I have not any; I have not been paid"—after that I heard him say, "Hold up your head, hold up your head, hold up your head;" and I heard three distinct blows struck—he said "Hold up your head" after I heard the blows—I heard no more after that—about 8 o'clock the prisoner called me, and I went into his room—he said, "Here is a pretty thing; I came home, and found her beastly drunk"—I said, "No, not beastly drunk; she might have had a glass, but she was not beastly drunk; but I heard you beat her through the night"—he said, "I only hit her with my open hand; I hit her a pat or two with my open hand"—he then said, "What shall I do? we are going out for a day's excursion; I am nearly mad; I have a d—good mind to take the hammer and finish her"—he was very much agitated at the time, but he appeared to be quite sober—he said, "Look on the floor; that is what has flowed from her mouth while she laid on the floor; I do not know how long she had been there"—the deceased was then lying on the bed; she was quite cold—she was not under the clothes, or covered up; she had got her petticoat and stockings on—she had not undressed the previous night; she had her gown off; she never wore stays—I saw something on the floor; it appeared as if she had vomited there—I felt her, and spoke to her several times, but she was insensible—I remained there a few minutes—the prisoner said, "I would give the best 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that ever was, if her face was not like that"—her face was bruised very much, from the back of the right ear down to the neck, and her eye was entirely closed; the lid was very much swollen—I was then called out of the room—I said I would come in again</p>

               <p>presently—when I went back the door was fastened, and I could not get in—I knocked several times, and I went through a person's room to the front door, and that was locked also—there are two entrances, one by my door, and one in Bruton Mews—both doors were fastened—I called to her several times during the day, every twenty minutes or so—there was a little piece of wood in the door that I knocked down, so that I could put my mouth quite inside the door and speak to her, but I never got any answer from her during the day—Mrs. Turner was with me all the day—she fetched a policeman—he broke open the door, and I went in with him, and my husband, and Mrs. Turner—the deceased was on the bed, as I had left her in the morning—she had never moved—the policeman spoke to her first—she was sensible—we roused her, and I asked her if she would have some tea—she said, "Yes," and I gave her two cups of tea—she spoke very little—I went out, and met the prisoner in Cork Street—he said, "Have you seen my beauty to-day?"—I said, "Yes; I have had a policeman, and opened the door, and given her some tea"—he said "I have prayed to God all the day that I might find her a corpse"—I went on—I afterwards went to her room again, and we washed her, and put her to bed comfortable—I and to the prisoner, "Are you going to fetch a doctor?"—he said, "Oh, yes," and he went for one—when I washed her I saw no bruises about her body—she was quite wet with vomit all over the shoulders—I was there when the doctor came—he sent some medicine, which I gave her—I attended to her all the next day, while the prisoner went out fishing—I did not do anything for her after that day, merely ran in to see her from time to time until 29th Aug., when she was taken to St. George's Hospital—I went with her, and the prisoner also—he told the doctors that she had fallen out of bed in a fit—I cannot say to whom he said that; there were five or six round—I had never had any quarrel with the prisoner before this—he was always a very good neighbour—I had a dispute with him afterwards, before this charge was made against him—he used to come out every now and then and abuse me very much—I had great forbearance with him, which he took me before the Magistrate, Mr. Bingham, on 22nd Sept., and made me pay for—I was fined two guineas, or one month's imprisonment—I do not know what it was for—he said that I hallooed up and down the street at him, "There goes the murderer; there goes the thief; that is the man that killed his wife"—I never said such a thing—I told the policeman, who opened the door, the state she was in, and that I did not think she would ever get well.</p>

               <p>this occurred, I positively deny it—I was not there with her on the Friday previous—I lived next door to them, the wall that divides our rooms is wood and brick or plaster—there used to be a door between, and that is only lath and plaster—they slept on the ground floor and so did I—I think there are three floors to the house, but they did not occupy them the head of my bed came to the side of their bed—I do not know who else lived in the house, because those who lived over us did not come into our yard—in our room there was my husband, myself, and two children—my husband was in bed with me at the time this occurred—in the next room to us there was Mr. and Mrs. Turner, and three children—the prisoner lived on one side of us, and the Turners on the other, and in front of us there was another family, but the yard parted us—I do not know the name of the policeman that came on the next evening, his number is 168 <hi rend="italic">C</hi>—I have not seen him here to-day—I never knew the deceased to have a fit of apoplexy whilst she lived next to me, and that has been turned seven years—I did not know her before—she never had a fit of any kind during that time—never heard the prisoner say so; I never heard of her having a fit till he said it to the doctors at the hospital—I remember inspector Webb going to the house with an officer named Crabb, for the purpose of ascertaining what could be heard from one house to the other—I was present—Webb made no remark to me about it—the relatives of the deceased did not come daily to see her—the prisoner's sister came to see the deceased one day before she was removed to the hospital, and I believe on one occasion her own sister came; and I believe her mother, was there once, but I was not in the house at the time—I saw the sister there, I let her in the day after it happened, her name is Jones—she and I talked about this—I did not tell her that he had beat her so severely, I merely said he had beaten her; she said he had hit her with his open hand, she knew he did not hit her with his fist—I said very little to her—the prisoner was not there at the time, he was out fishing—he must have seen Mrs. Jones before I did, because he had been to tell her to come—she said she could see it was only done with the open hand—I never had any dispute with the prisoner or his wife before her death.</p>

                  </hi>. On the night of 18th Aug., I was called in to see the deceased; I found her lying on the bed on the ground floor—she was in a state of partial insensibility, she could answer questions slowly—she said, "Yes," or "No;" I asked her but few questions while in that state—I found the right side of her face, the right temple, and the right side of the neck considerably swollen; on the surface of the right temple I found redness and contusion; the right eye lid was congested with blood, and swollen, and perfectly paralysed; the right arm was perfectly paralysed, and the right limb partially so; the right pupil was considerably dilated the left natural—the prisoner was present at the time I saw his wife—he came for me and accompanied me back—when I saw the state she was in, I remarked generally, "How did this happen?"—from some one, I cannot say whom, in the prisoner's presence, I learned that he had returned home between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning, that he had stated he had found his wife intoxicated, and that he had given her a blow with the open hand—I then asked the prisoner if that was correct, and how it had happened—he stated that he had returned home, found his wife beastly drunk, and gave her a slap or two, but only with the open hand—I remarked that it was my opinion he must have used more violence than that to have produced such a result—a great deal of mischief may be done with the open hand, but from the appearances at the time I thought it could not have been produced by</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260117"></xptr>
               <p>the open hand; the appearances were so considerable, they extended over the entire lace and neck—the hand would cover that space, and I believe now that it could have been produced by the open hand—it appeared to me to be more likely to be by the open hand than the fist—the fist would have made a different impression, and there would have been more discoloration—I think it must have required a very severe blow to produce the swelling and contusion I saw—the prisoner remarked, either then or previously, that she must have fallen out of bed, otherwise he could not account for it—the bed was very low; in my opinion, a fall from the bed could not have pro<lb></lb>duced the appearances I observed—I attended her up to 28th Aug., at their own residence, and on 29th she was removed to the hospital—she had reco<lb></lb>vered to a considerable extent—she recovered the use of her limb, she was able to stand and walk a little, but finally she relapsed, when she was taken to the hospital—I did not see her there alive—I saw the result of the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination; I saw the brain—there was considerable effusion of blood; it appeared to be of some days' standing—it would have caused the partial paralysis I had observed—I did not observe any other injury about the deceased, except those on the head and face—the effusion was the con<lb></lb>sequence of a rupture of some small vessel; any violence affecting the head might produce that—I attribute the cause of death to the violence on the head and face—I observed no other violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The proximate cause of death was the effusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that effusion might be caused either by violence, or by disease, apart from the circumstances of the case—similar appearances would be presented after death in a case of apoplexy, whether the apoplexy resulted from disease or from violence: the appearance of the brain in the two cases would be different—if I had been called upon to examine the interior of the skull, without having been told anything of the circumstances of the case, I cannot say that I should have said that the proximate cause of death was apoplexy—I should have expected to find an indication of the brain, or the vessels, being diseased—apoplexy from disease generally occurs in the centre of the brain, in the substance of the vessels, not where we found it here; this was over the right hemisphere, between the membranes, on the surface—the brain was exhibited to me after it had been taken out of the head—that did not give me so advantageous an opportunity of judging as if I had seen it actually taken out—from only seeing this brain, I should not have been able to decide as to the cause of death, decidedly not—Mr. Holmes showed me the brain—it has been the case that persons have died of apo<lb></lb>plexy, and, upon a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, no disease of the brain has been apparent, but not with the blood in the position this was found, to my knowledge—anomalous cases are found, and this case was one—you can sometimes trace where the exact rupture is—I did not do so here—in cases of effusion of blood, I believe a vessel must be ruptured, either by disease or by violence—you do not always find fracture of the skull where a vessel is ruptured by violence—it is so as a rule, but not without exception—it is more generally so—extravasation is frequently found between the scalp and the cranium when a blow has caused effusion of blood—the proximate cause of death was the effusion of blood—I certainly do pledge myself that the effusion was caused by violence, knowing the history of the case—I do not think, in this case, that the apoplexy might have been superinduced by intoxication, because I saw the amount of injury.</p>

                  </hi>. I am curator to the Museum of St. George's Hospital. I examined the body of the deceased there—there were no bruises about the body—there was an extravasation of blood over the surface of the right side of the brain, between two of the membranes, of very considerable thickness, and apparently of many days standing—it was partly solid and partly fluid, as if the blood had been extravasated or effused at different period, the solid parts having lost their colour a little—I should suppose there had been different extravasations, but it is entirely a matter of opinion—I could not say with what interval—I mean that one extravasa<lb></lb>tion had gone on and stopped, and then another had occurred at a different period, then a third, and possibly more—the first extravasation must have been of several days' standing, because the blood had partly lost its colour; if it had been of several weeks' standing, I think it would have been more firmly adherent—I think it very possible that a part of that extravasation might have taken place a fortnight before I made the examination, which was on 31st Aug.—I do not think it is possible to date these things with any accuracy—the texture of the brain was perfectly healthy, except that one of the ventricles was slightly distended with fluid—the deceased was stated to be thirty-five years of age—I could not come to any conclusion as to what part of the brain the ruptured vessel was in—I searched pretty carefully, but all the vessels I had the opportunity of examining appeared perfectly healthy—of course there must have been a rupture of some vessel, but I could not find it—there was sufficient effusion on the brain to account for death—that was the cause of death—I showed the brain to Dr. Trouncer—at the time I made the examination, I had heard that the patient had received a blow on the eye—I heard that casually—I forget who told me—there were no appearances of any such blow, or of any external injury at the time I made the examination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If you had examined the head without any previous knowledge of the facts, would not your conclusion have been that the patient died from apoplexy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in my judgment—that was my opinion, and that was stated in the certificate—Mr. Potter, and several other gentlemen, were present at the examination—apoplexy sometimes takes place where no visible cause is present—there were no external appearances of violence that I could make myself sure of—where effusion on the brain is induced by external violence, we generally find a fracture, more often than not—there was no fracture here—there are cases in which persons have lived for months, and even longer, with extravasation of this kind produced by violence, and</p>

               <p>they occasionally recover altogether—it is usually the case that persons die in a shorter period.</p>

I remember the deceased being brought there, on 29th Aug.—the prisoner and Mrs. Appleton accompanied her—she was then slightly sensible—I asked her if she had any pain in her head, and she tried to put her hand up—she had all the appearances of apoplexy—there was a drooping of the eyelid, and partial paralysis on the right side—there was the very slightest possible mark on the top droop of the eyelid—it was so slight that I took no notice of it—it was a slight discoloration like the end of a bruise—she died on Sunday—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination made by Mr. Holmes—at the time the prisoner came with the deceased, he told me that she had had a fit, and had tumbled out of bed, and he thought she had hurt her head—Mrs. Appleton was present so as to hear that—she made no observation to me at all on it—she did not contradict it at all.</p>

CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does death sometimes occur from external violence, without any fracture of the skull? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe there are such cases, but I am not quite prepared to say—they are very rare—if a person were in a state of intoxication at the time external violence was used, she would cer<lb></lb>tainly be more disposed to have the vessels ruptured, and death would be more likely to ensue, because she would have congestion of the brain.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Police inspector, C</hi>). I apprehended the prisoner on Monday morning, 12th Oct., about 1 o'clock—that was not the first I had heard of the charge against him—I had received my first information about three weeks previous to that, from the Commissioner of police—he was at his own door in North Bruton Mews—I had been there three weeks previously, he was not than at his house, but he was in the neighbourhood—when I apprehended him, he said that it was a cruel thing; that it had been got up</p>

               <p>by Mrs. Appleton; that he had had her before a Magistrate, and she had been fined 42<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for calling him a criminal man, or a man of crime, or some words to that effect; that it was well known that his pretty little dear had had a fit, and had fallen out of bed; that he found her so on the floor, with secre<lb></lb>tion round her mouth; that it was known she had died from apoplexy, and the doctors at St. George's Hospital had given a certificate to that effect; that she had left him for six weeks at a time, and was brought back from the "Dials" without a petticoat to her bottom—I had seen Mrs. Appleton before I appre<lb></lb>hended him—I went to the prisoner's house, in order to ascertain whether a person could hear from Mrs. Appleton's room what was passing in the prisoner's room—that was after I had taken him into custody, in the same week—I went into the prisoner's room, and placed a constable in Mrs. Appleton's room, desiring the constable to speak in an ordinary tone of voice, and I after<lb></lb>wards placed him in the prisoner's room, and went myself into Mrs. Apple<lb></lb>ton's room—I could hear a muttering, but I could not hear distinctly what the constable said—he is not here—the result was the same when we changed places, except when I told him to call, and then I heard what he said—it is a brick partition between the two houses; I suppose about a four inch brickwork—I cannot say whether it was brick throughout—at the time I was there, which was the middle of the day, there was a mangle going overhead, and the ordinary business was going on in the mews—I could hear the words the constable used when I told him to call, but not when he spoke—I had not told him what to say.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any warrant for the apprehension of the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had not—I apprehended him by instructions to take him before a Magistrate on the best evidence that might be got—I took him on 12th Oct.—I made an inquiry some three weeks previous to that—no evidence was taken then—I imagine that I am the prosecutor in this case—the law was set in motion, I believe, by Mr. Trouncer first applying to Mr. Wakley to hold an inquest—that is only what I have been informed; and then it came to the police—I made some inquiries—the prisoner made a complaint before the Magistrate against Mrs. Appleton for using abusive language—the inquiry was going on at that time—no persons were examined on oath—the depositions were taken down afterwards.</p>

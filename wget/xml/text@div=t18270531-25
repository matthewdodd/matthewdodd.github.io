On Sunday, the 18th of June, 1826, at eight o'clock in the morning, I missed a pair of silver candlesticks from the pantry, which is in the middle of the house, down-stairs; I cannot swear that I had seen them since Friday morning; the area-door is occasionally open - I saw them again at the Police-office, on the 7th of July, and knew them; I brought them from the office on the 14th; they are now in Court- I know them to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know where they were yesterday? A. They have been in common use, mixed with other candlesticks since; there are two pairs of the same pattern; but I can tell those which were stolen; my mistress is not married; she is the daughter of a Duke.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 17th of June, 1826, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Petticoat-lane with Hanley, and saw the prisoner on the same side of the way as we were; he crossed over, and I crossed also; he had a basket, and was in company with another man; they immediately ran away, and separated; he ran down a small alley into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310019"></xptr>Bell-lane: his hat fell off - he threw the basket down, and one of these candlesticks fell out - I picked up the basket, and the other candlestick in it - Hanley still pursued him, but lost him. I was on the top of a Hackney stage, on the Thursday following, and saw him - I got off, and caught hold of him by his coat and handkerchief; but he got away, leaving his coat and handkerchief in my hand - I found him in the police van the other day, and identified him - I advertized the candlesticks, and marked them before I delivered them to the butler.</p>

            . I am an officer, and was in Petticoat-lane. I saw the prisoner and another man cross over, nearly opposite the Coventry Cross public-house; the prisoner ran up Frying-pan-alley; his hat fell off, and he threw away a basket, which Waters picked up - I pursued him into Bell-lane, but he got away - I returned, and met Waters with the basket and two candlesticks, which I now produce, the butler having delivered them to me since he was taken.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Why, the initials on them do not answer to your mistress' names? A. They are meant for the three sisters: they all live in the house - I cannot swear that they are not their joint property.</p>

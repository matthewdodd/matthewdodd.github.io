On Friday, the 2d of January, at four o'clock in the afternoon, the four sheep were safe; they were marked B on the right hip; at eight o'clock the next morning I missed two out of the field, which is about half a mile from my master's house. On Sunday morning they were shown to me by Wager; they were alone, I knew them to be the same. The prisoner lives about three quarters of a mile from my master's farm-the prisoner knows the farm - He has been in the poor-house. I know a man named John, he has absconded. When I left the sheep I pinned the gate-it was a new fence, it was not broken - They could not get out; I found the gate unpinned.</p>

I saw them in Mr. Greenhill's field, which is about a quarter of a mile from Mr. White's field; there was a flock of sheep near them, which belonged to a man named Dove.</p>

            . I live at Edmonton, and know the prisoner. On Friday afternoon he asked me to take a walk with him, which I did; as we returned Farmer John met us; the prisoner and him asked me if I would go and help them to steal two sheep; at first I said I would-as we were in a bye-lane, I was afraid to refuse. When I got into the high-road the prisoner told me not to let my heart fail me; I said, no, but I believed it would; he said, "I shall not bid you good night, you must meet me here about six o'clock." I went home, and did not go out again. Next morning I went to his house - He said,"You was not so good as your word." His father came home, and said White had lost two sheep; the prisoner said he knew nothing about it; he told me that he caught both the sheep himself, tied their legs together, and he and John carried them; and as he was going over the bridge with one, he fell into the water-that he got him out, and carried them through a turnip-field to Bow's farm, and left them there, with their legs tied; that John went to call up Davey to kill them, but he did not get up.</p>
               <p>THOMAS AUSTIN. I am constable of Edmonton. On Saturday morning I was about half a mile from where the sheep were taken, and saw a butcher there with a cart - He was quarrelling-it was getting light - He went away without taking any thing. I was present when the prisoner was before the magistrate; he was cautioned before he signed any thing, that it would be given in evidence against him. I saw the magistrate and prisoner sign this paper.</p>
               <p>(Reads) "Banton, John, and myself went together, on Friday last, to Bow's Farm; John went to see a man. We left Banton - I came across the field, and met John again. John and I agreed to go after the sheep. John and I went to Mr. White's mead, at Edmonton, and took two sheep; I carried them a little way, and John carried them the rest, and put them in a field."</p>

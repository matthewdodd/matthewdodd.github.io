On Tuesday. the 4th of December, before four o'clock in the morning, the tiles were taken off my stable, and fifteen live fowls taken away, three legs of pork, and two pounds of butter were taken from the dairy; I had been into the stable at half-past twelve o'clock at night - every thing was safe then - the stable communicates with the dwelling-house without going into the air - a door opens out of the dwelling-house into the stable, and another door opens out of the stable into the dairy, without going into the air at all - I saw one of my fowls in the officer's hands in the evening - it was dead then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you take your horses through the dwelling-house into the stable? A. No - there is another door - the dairy-door opens into the stable also; I was in the stable at half-past twelve o'clock, holding the candle to my son, while he fastened the doors, as the team had just come in - the fowls were then in the loft, at roost.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure you saw your son fasten the doors? A. Yes - I found the dairy-door open, and the stable-door, which leads into the yard - they had been unbolted inside.</p>

            . I keep a chandler's-shop in Ship-lane, Hammersmith. The prisoner Ledgerwood came to my shop about ten o'clock, one Tuesday, with a leg of pork in a blue handkerchief; I knew him before - he asked me to weigh it - it was 12 lbs. all but an ounce - he said he bought it of a man who told him it weighed 9 lbs. - he wanted to sell it for 8 1/2d. per pound, but did not ask me to buy it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far do you live from Hitchcock? A. About a quarter of a mile - mine is an open shop - he did not say the pork was too large for his family.</p>

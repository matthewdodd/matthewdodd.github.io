            </rs>. Mr. Styles swore that William Hall and Thomas came to his Shop to buy Shoes, which they bargained for, and bid him bring them to the Salutation Tavern at Billingsgate, which he did; where he found William Hall and Thomas; but at last they removed to the Bull-head, where G - came into the Room, and then Thomas Hall went away with the Shoes he bespoke, they keeping the said Styles in discourse, telling him, that they understood that he had been abused by a Neighbour of his, and they would put him in a way to be revenged of him, which was to be done thus. Says G - I have lost money at a Race at Bamstead Downes, and I am vext, I'le tell you what you shall do; I'll procure you some Clippings, and you may find a hole in the house to put them in. But he the said Styles refusing to submit to their counsel, another man came into the Room, personating himself to be Mr. Macey of the Tower, who presently set his Breech against the door, and they all fell upon him, held him by the Arms, and searcht his Pockets, threatning, that if he would not set his hand to a Paper, and would not lay the Clippings in his Neighbour's house, they would do him a mischief; and they took away his money, putting him in great Fear. That G - C - swore, God damn him, if he would not submit, they would kill him; and much more menacing language. The Drawer of the Tavern proved that G - Hall and Styles were all there, and that he heard no disturbance in the house, but that they parted friendly at the door. Then Styles declared, that one went before him, the other behind him, threatning him, that if he cried out, they would be severe upon him. Styles swore farther, that G - took 7 l. from him at the same time; and that he offered to agree with him about the matter, which one Captain Platt could prove, who was called, but did not appear. The Tryal lasted very long, and all that G - alledged in his defence was That he was a <rs id="t16941010-24-deflabel112" type="occupation">Butcher</rs>

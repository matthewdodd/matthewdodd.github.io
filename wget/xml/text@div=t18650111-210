                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, of 4, Bridge's-foot, Vauxhall—on 27th December, about half-past three o'clock the prisoner came, and I served him with half an ounce of tobacco—he gave me a bad shilling—I have a patent detector, and pass all silver and gold through it; if it is the proper weight it passes through—I found it did not pass through—I put it to my mouth and bit a piece out of it—the prisoner pretended to be drunk, and rolled about the shop—I asked him How many more he had of this description—he said that he had plenty of b----y money, put his hand in his pocket and pulled out two or three shillings, and paid me with a good one—I gave him 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I said that I should require some little informa<lb></lb>tion from him, and if not, I should send for a policeman and give him in charge—he said that he would go and fetch a policeman himself, but I went round the counter, detained him, and gave him in charge with the shil-ling—he appeared to be sober at the station.</p>

Mr. Pinson gave the prisoner into my custody with this bad shilling—I gave it to the inspector at the station—I there found another shilling in the prisoner's right-hand trousers pocket, which I also gave to the inspector—I searched him again and found another shilling between the lining and the stuff of his right jacket pocket—I gave that also to the inspector—I found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good money on him—he was not so drunk as he pretended to be—he gave his correct name and address.</p>

               <p>Payne. He was at work by himself on the out-side of the house; on Thursday afternoon, cutting down leaden spouts, by the Commissioners order, that are paving the Strand: he went thro' my room to go on the out-side of the house; that made me suspect him. I went to Sir

Sir John granted me a search-warrant. Going back, he owned the fact, and delivered me three guineas and a half, which was at a woman's house he called sister. I never got my other guinea and half; he said he had bought a stock and bits, and a saw, with the rest of the money.</p>

               <p>Payne. He owned he took it out of my box: he delivered up his tools in order to pay me, when I carried him to Sir John again; but Sir John said that could not be. He committed him to Newgate.</p>

            . On the 26th of February, between twelve and two, Ungly and I went, about one or a little after, to the back of Collinson's, and saw the two prisoners in a craft, handing out the jars out of it to a boat, we took them, the jars were put under my care, they are the same jars we saw in the boat.</p>
               <p>SMART's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On Sunday night he lost his boat, when he found it the jars were in it (he did not know how they came there) and some beans, and that the other prisoner was with him, and helped to carry the beans home at twice.</p>
               <p>FRITH's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>He was with Smart when he found his boat, that he helped to carry the beans home, that they meant to make enquiry whose property the jars were and the beans, when the officer came and took them up.</p>
               <p>Job Caley, his late master, gave Smart a very good character, said he lived four years with him, and he behaved very honestly, he had trusted him a hundred times with money, and would now.</p>

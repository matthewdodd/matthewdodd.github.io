                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, and live in Friday-street. About twelve o'clock at night, on Saturday, the 28th of August, I was pass<lb></lb>ing the Post-office, and was accosted by the prisoner, who begged me to give her money to buy a glass of beer—she went alongside of me to the corner of St. Paul's Churchyard—I wanted to give her some coppers to get rid of her, but I had none—she followed on a little farther—I said, "It is no use to follow me farther, if I had coppers I would give them you"—she put up her hand, gave me a gentle tap on the breast, and said, "I think you would"—I went on a few paces, and missed my pin—I came back just as she was speaking to another girl—I detained her till the officer came—she said she had taken it, and given it to the other girl, who had thrown it on a lot of rubbish—she said, "If you go back to that place you will find it"—I went back, but could not find it—she looked, and could not find it—she then said if I would go home with her she would give me the pin—I said I should do no such thing, and gave her in charge—I never got it.</p>

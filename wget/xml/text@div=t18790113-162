I live at North East Passage, Cable Street, Wellclose Square, and have a number of night lodging-houses in different parts of London, which are managed by persons appointed by me, and I go every morning and collect the money from them, but the money I had on this day had nothing to do with that—I had 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold in a cat-skin bag in a hip pocket of my trousers on the right-hand side, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver in a canvas bag in my right trousers pocket—I had not collected above 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of it that morning—I put that with the rest—the prisoner is my nephew; my sister's son—he lived in the house, 48, Golden Lane, St. Luke's, where this was done, and knew my habits—that is a mile and a half from Wellclose Square—I met him on 13th August, about 9 am., at the Golden Lane lodging-house—one of his brothers was with him, and his other brother came in afterwards—he spoke to me, and we all four went to the William the Fourth next door and had a few pots of ale, I will say a couple, and some spirits as well—they all left with me, and continued in my com<lb></lb>pany the rest of the day—I told them the amount of money I had got on my person—we were backwards and forwards, and we finally left the William IV. when it was getting dark, about 8.30 p.m.—I felt stupefied, and made my way to go home in a cab, and my nephews followed me and fetched me back—when I got to 42, Golden Lane, the three brothers took. me through the kitchen into the back yard—they then took me upstairs, and told me to have a sleep, and they set me on the side of the bedstead, and gave me some bread and cheese and some beer—while I was eating it I found a very heavy blow come on the. front of my head—I did not hear any one else but those three persons—I am familiar with their voices—I made to get up, but the blows came on my head so heavily and so often that I could not stand straight—the prisoner said "If you are my uncle I will knock your brains out or else I will have your money"—I called out "Don't murder me, you can take the money," because they were beating me so—I felt them putting their hands in my pockets and taking the gold from my hip pocket, and they tore out the pocket where the silver was—one of them</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer of 2, Holborn Buildings, Gray's Inn Road—on 13th August I lodged at 48, Golden Lane, St. Luke's, and saw the prisoner come in by himself about 3.30 p.m.—the other two brothers and the prosecutor came in about 8 o'clock—they took their uncle upstairs, and two or three minutes afterwards I went up to my bedroom, and as I came down again I heard a little bit of a noise, and looked in at the door and saw one of them strike the blind man on the head—I did not see who struck the low.</p>

Lydia Grace Flanders. I live at 7, Glass Lane, Aldersgate Street—in August last I was living with the prisoner—on the evening of 13th August, about 7.30, I saw him in the lodging-house 48, Golden Lane, St. Luke's—I had a bedroom there, and he sent me up the City Road to a doctor—I think I was gone about an hour—I did not see the prosecutor there when I left at 7.30, but when I returned I saw the prisoner's brother Jerry running through Play House Yard with no boots on—that adjoins the lodging-house—I went to No. 48, and heard the prosecutor halloaing out "Murder"—I ran upstairs, and he was holding the window-ledge, and was pouring with blood—I took something which was hanging on the clothes-line, and wrapped it round his head—nobody else was in the room, but the prisoner was on the stairs—I saw Holland put into a cab and conveyed away—I saw a man named Mike the same night in Play House Yard, about 9.30 or 10 o'clock—I saw a canvas bag, and they divided the money, and threw the bag over the hoarding—that was the silver—the prisoner said that he pulled his uncle's pocket out when he pulled the bag out—the next day I remained with the prisoner till 3 a. m., when the prosecutor's wife came and turned him out—I left London soon afterwards with the prisoner, and we went to Holyhead and Dublin with his two brothers, and the wife of one of them—we remained in Dublin three weeks, and when the two brothers left us we went to Cardiff, then to Newport, and then to Birmingham, where I left the prisoner—on the night this happened the prisoner burnt a birch broom, about 2 o'clock in the night—it had a stick to it thicker than this iron bar, but not so thick as that lamp—at the time he burnt it he said "Oh, Christ gracious, if I don't burn that it will get me lagged"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the kind of</p>

My uncle was taken to the hospital At 3 o'clock in the morning the prosecutor's wife came up with two policemen, and turned me out of bed, and said, "You are as bad as your brother; you shan't stop in my house any longer," and I went out to Gardner's lodging-house. I had got no money. My brother said, "Cheer up, Conny, I have got a couple of pounds, you can come with us," and we went to Dublin.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Andrew Coglan. On 24th June I was haymaking at Hendon—between 3 and 4 o'clock that afternoon I went to buy some things, and as I came back with another young woman and my cousin we met the prisoner—he said to my cousin, "Mate, you have got two; will you give me one?"—the other chap said, "Which will you have?" and he mentioned the other woman—we came on our way, and when we had got across two fields into the road the prisoner overtook us—we went into the Green Man, and he treated us to some ale and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of biscuits and cheese—not to be under an obligation to him I called for a third pot, and paid for it—I do not recollect anything more—I found out afterwards that my head was cut.</p>

               <p>with a briar at the edge of it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Coglan asked him for a pipe of tobacco—he said he would not give it to her, and told her to go away, or he would make her—he told her so three or four times, and then he turned round and said again he would make her, and then he struck her with the scythe on the right side of the head—she fell down—I went and picked her up, and took her to the Green Man—she bled very much—I afterwards went with her to the surgeon's.</p>

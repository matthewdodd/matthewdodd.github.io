            . I live in Hampden-street, Somers-Town. On the 10th of August, about a quarter before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120004"></xptr>two o'clock in the afternoon, I was walking near <placeName id="t18210912-2-crimeloc9">Primrose-hill</placeName>

A person asked me what o'clock it was, I said I could not say, for I had no watch, which was false, for I had one; he passed me, and in about two minutes he returned, stood before me, and demanded my money. I undid my coat, put my hand in my pocket, and gave him 4 s.; he then demanded my watch; I pulled it out, and gave it him. I had a bundle in my hand, containing bread. He then said "Give me that ring," which was on my finger. I said No, I would lose my life first. He then walked on, and I saw no more of him till he was at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he armed - A. Yes he had a horse pistol, which he presented to my breast, within three inches of it. I went to Bow-street a few days after, and saw him in custody. This lasted about ten minutes, I should think. I cannot swear to the prisoner, my sight is very bad. He was not dressed the same at Bow-street. I saw nobody else near. I have since seen my watch, and a pistol.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Hawkins, a pawnbroker, of Drury-lane. The prisoner came to the shop on the 10th of August, between three and four o'clock, with a watch, to pawn for 25 s. I asked his name, he said it was Collins. I did not like his appearance, and asked if it was his? He said Yes, and what he gave for it? He said he gave four guineas for it, he could not tell the maker's name; I asked how he wound it up or opened it. He said "What is that to you?" I said "If you cannot tell how to wind it up, how can it be yours." He said "What is it to you if a person sent me with it." I said fetch the person. He said "Give me the watch"? I kept it, and told him to send the owner; he left. I saw no more of him. On Monday. I told the officer that I had the watch, and found the prisoner, was taken. I am quite sure he is the man. He was four or five minutes, with me. I took particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I ask 25 s. for it - A. As near as I can recollect; he did not say it belonged to Collins, he said his name was Collins, and that he bought it new for four guineas.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 10th of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, Peters came to the office, and said he had been robbed. I heard his description of the man, and after that saw the prisoner at the corner of the street, as I stood at the office door, and from the description. I was sure he was the man. I called Read. I saw him go up the street, he passed a Jew, and went up to another Jew. I followed him into Long-acre, he walked fast. He turned round looked about him, then stopped to buy some currants. I stopped him, and asked what he was, and where he worked. He said</p>
               <p>"What is that to you?" I said I was an officer, and should take him. I took him to the office, and while I was speaking to the Magistrate he whipped round and was going out, but Blaksley stopped him. He told the Magistrate he lodged at No. 2, Rose-street, Long-acre. I went to the house, and saw the landlady, she shewed me a bed-room, and in a box there, I found this pistol. He told the Magistrate he lodged at the top of the house, but I do not know whether he said the back or front room. I found the pistol, in the back room. I do not think there was above one room at the top. I produced it at the examination; he at first said he did know it, but then said he did not. It was not loaded, nor had it any flint in it. I found no powder or ball in the room. The prosecutor saw it that evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say, I had seen it - A. No, he said he knew it, and then he denied it.</p>

            . I assisted in taking him in Long-acre. He said he lived at No. 2, Rose-street. I did not hear him say what part of the house. We went there and found the pistol, in a box, in the top room. I think there is only one room on a floor. It was produced to the prisoner, and asked if it was his, he said "I might have seen it in my box, up stairs." I believe Lack had told him, where it was found. He afterwards denied knowing any think of it.</p>
               <p>MR. PETERS. I know the watch to be mine, I had had it two years and a half. I believe the pistol, to be the one that was presented to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was looking for work, and met a man, who took me to a public house, called for a pot of beer, and gave me the watch to pawn; I asked what name I was to pawn it in, he said Collins. I said, they would not take it in, if it was not my own; he said then bring it back. The gentleman asked if it was mine, I said "Yes, and I paid four guineas for it," I returned to the house, the man came out, I never saw him again. I went up Bow-street, and asked a Jew if he met a man in a white apron, going down Long-acre.</p>

I am the prisoner's mother—I remember him being taken—I think it was a month last Saturday—he was in that night about 11.30, and remained till 12.30, as near as I could say—I asked him if he would go to the top of the street and see if he could see anything of his brother William—he was down stairs, and I was up stairs between 11.30 and 12.30—I reckoned that it was 12.30 when he went out—I went up stairs about 11.15—I have a clock down stairs—I live in Blue Anchor Yard, Peckham—my son lives with me—he has been a very good son, and has supported us since the illness of his father—you can get to Hill Street in about a couple of minutes from Blue Anchor Yard.</p>

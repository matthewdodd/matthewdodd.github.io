             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a watchman, at Bromley: On Sunday morning, the 22d of June last, I saw the prisoner about half past twelve o'clock at night, rowing about in a boat; I had a suspicion of him, and watched him; I called a man to my assistance, and after some time, the prisoner rowed on shore, on the side where we were; we let him go on a little way a head, and then I followed him and stopped him, he had a sack upon his back, containing peas, and in another sack, inside of that sack, some beans.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there a bushel of peas, do you think? - A. I cannot say, the prisoner said it was his own property, that he bought it of a bargeman, and pleaded to let him go; I delivered him, to the officer Shynn, and we went with him to the watch-house; he got out of the watch-house, and was re-taken on the Thursday night following; I left the property in Mr. Shynn's hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Was it on the river Thames you first saw him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When you went to call assistance, you lost sight of the man in the boat? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q.Then the person that you saw afterwards, you cannot swear was the same that you saw in the boat? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Are you certain that he is the same man that came on shore? - A. Yes.</p>

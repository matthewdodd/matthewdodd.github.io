                  </hi> I live at No. 4, Berkeley-place, Connaught-square—the prisoner was in my service for one month, and was my only servant—she was to leave on Saturday night, the 2nd of Aug.—having some suspicion of her, I insisted on searching her box that morning, which was out-side the kitchen door—there were three or four witnesses present at the time it was searched—the prisoner gave me the key out of her pocket, and I unlocked the box—it was a little key with a chain to it—I found in the box a pair of French stays, a pair of new stockings, two pocket-handkerchiefs, two books, and a scent-bottle, which I said were mine—I did not find a needle-case there, that was found at her sister's lodgings, which the officer searched—her sister never visited her at my house—I had a lady visiting me at the time.</p>

                  </hi> I am married, and am sister-in-law to the prisoner. I know this house where my sister was servant—I have been there frequently—I went with her when she took the place—a fortnight after that, she com<lb></lb>plained, and said that her mistress wished her to go to bed on the sofa, where there were several gentlemen in the room—she told me that the next day, and I wished her to leave her situation—she said she would give her warning—I did not take her away at once, because I was not aware what sort of a place it was—I did not know whether she could leave—her mistress said her wages would be stopped if she left—the prosecutrix has sworn to a brooch of mine, as I have witnesses to prove—the prisoner has borne a very good cha<lb></lb>racter.</p>

               <p>part of the day, about three o'clock, all about the house, and in the drawing-room—it was a dressing-gown, similar to a night-gown—I do not know whether there was any clothing underneath—I have not seen any men there, but I have seen several different men coming while the brother and sister were lying for trial—I saw many different faces, three or four—they came with them to High-street, and to the station-house.</p>

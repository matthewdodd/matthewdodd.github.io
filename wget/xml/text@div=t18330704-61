             (police-constable G 141). The prosecutor spoke to me on the 24th of May, and I took the prisoner about eleven o'clock on the following evening; he denied knowing Case at first, but he afterwards told me he had never robbed him, but had lived with his wife, and that if I would let him go and take no notice that I had seen him, he would go down on his knees, and beg pardon - I said I could not think of such a thing - he then said, "I will bid you good night," and ran away; I pursued, and took him in Cross-street - I found no property on him.</p>

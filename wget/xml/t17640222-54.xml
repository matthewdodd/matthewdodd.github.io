On the 24th of last January, between four and five in the afternoon, came the two prisoners, and a constable and attorney with them. (Dove was a company-keeper with Mrs. Glass, as far as I understand; sometimes he lived in the house, and sometimes not): Taylor said, all that were in the house, was his property, for he had a bill of sale made to him by Dove. I said, then he had better pay me for my goods: when I first came to the house, I lent Mrs. Glass 20 l. and she gave me some papers, which she had of Capt. Leicester's, at Hull; they were in my chest, in my room, amongst my cloaths; I had also in the chest, a note for 4 l. 8 s. another for 4 l. 4 s. and another for 2 l. 2 s. I had also in the chest two dollars, a pistereen, and seven buttons, all Spanish money; two pair of silver sleeve buttons, and a razor; I saved nothing but what was on my back: I found since, four cheque shirts (which were in the chest when they took possession of all) at a pawnbrokers; they took away also my bed and bedstead, curtains, looking glass, fire-shovel, tongs, stove, and other things: I got a warrant, and took up Taylor, and had a search warrant granted to seach his house; there I found my coat, bed, and chest, but nothing in it; there were three disorderly girls in his house, who were sent to Bridewell; he keeps a very bad house: I found nothing upon Dove. I had been arrested at the suit of Dove, on the 22d of January, for 4 l. 4 s. and I never owed him a half-penny in my life; I never had any thing of him. I regularly paid my half guinea every Saturday, to Mrs. Glass; the other lodgers in the house always paid her. Dove is a labouring-man, at the White-lead-works, Whitechapel: Taylor lives in Buckle-street; he is an officer.</p>
               <p>Dove. Logan said, all the goods, and my wife and all, were his; he has taken my wife from me.</p>

I saw him and her in bed together, and began to be jealous of her: she said I should never lie with her any more, for I had got nothing. I got a warrant for them both; the justice ordered us to go and make it up; after that, I was advised to go and sell all the goods, but I never had a penny of Taylor for them; he and the attorney took upon them to clear me.</p>

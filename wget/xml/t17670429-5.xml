            . About half an hour after seven o'clock on that Wednesday night, Leach and I went to the prosecutors window; he broke the window, and took out a piece of white cloth, it measured 16 yards and a half; he gave it to me, and I went away with it, and in the mean time he took out two more pieces, and brought them to me; then he went and fetched another piece. I went to his house, then we went and took all the cloth down to Mrs. Nursey's shop; we offered to sell it her at 9 d. a yard, she would not buy it; we sold her a little bit that was cut off from a piece for 13 d. 1/2, then we went home to Leach's house, and staid there all night; the next morning Merrit took the cloth, and sold it to a Jew for 18 d. a yard; we had 1 l. 17 s. for it, and drank two or three pots of beer together.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Merrit?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. He is one of our gang; he has been tried two or three times; but he was not with us when we took the cloth.</p>
               <p>Merrit. I am a watchmaker by trade, I never was tried here.</p>
               <p>Blackmore. It was at Hicks's-hall; he once was an evidence here.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Nursey. The evidence, and a person like the prisoner Leach, came to my shop, they offered me this small piece of cloth; (produced in court.) It was then wet and dirty; I then took it to be flannel; I bought it of them; after that they produced more, I refused buying any of it; I then suspected it was not honestly come by, and was sorry I had bought this piece.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Look at this cloth.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe it to be part of the cloth that was stole from us; I have compared it, and it agrees with the pattern.</p>

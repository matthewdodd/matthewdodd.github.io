On 20th Dec., about half-past four o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon, a train was expected at Shoreditch—I saw the prisoner on the platform there before the train came in—when it arrived the luggage was taken off, and he went up to a carpet bag, and was in the act of stooping, when a person came and took the bag away—he then went to some other luggage, and took this portmanteau up—he went away down some steps—I followed him, and about half-way towards High-street I stopped him, and said, "Does that portmanteau belong to you?—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Are you sure?"—he then said he was going to take it to the address—I said, "What is the address?"—he was going to look—I said, "No; tell me the name on it?"—he said, "Call me a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> "—"No; come back, you are in custody"—I took him back—Mr. Sedgwicke came and claimed it—the prisoner was taken to the station—there was no portmanteau belonging to the prisoner at the railway.</p>

On the 26th of October, about two o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise at my bed-room door; I sleep in the front-room, first-floor - the noise awoke me; I got up, looked towards the door, and saw a light through the key-hole - I called out Halloo! I heard a loud voice, and immediately heard persons running down stairs; I ran to my window, looked into the street, and saw three men come out, one after the other from the house-door of No. 10, as it appeared from the direction - they ran towards the turnpike; I sprang a rattle immediately, and lost sight of them - some watch-men came up when I was at the window, and my boy had just then run down stairs from No. 10, and got to the door: I went down stairs to the back-door, and found it open - the watchmen came in; I went with them into the kitchen of No. 11, examined the window, and found about half a pane of glass cut out: a man must have put his arm through there, and taken out an iron fastening - that would enable him to throw the window up; they appeared to have got in that way - the iron was fastened at night; it was afterwards found out in the yard: I have no doubt they had entered there. From the drawers in that kitchen I missed a silver tea-spoon and table-spoon; I missed all the property stated in the indictment, and among other things, a pair of shoes - I went to the watch-house, and found the prisoners there; I knew Morley before - he had lived a considerable time in my service, and left about two years ago- the tea-spoons were produced to me there; they were those I had missed from my kitchen; I saw the key of the street-door of No. 10, at the watch-house, and the kitchen poker. The house is in Shoreditch parish.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It appeared to you they came from No. 10, you cannot tell what door they came from? A. No; I was looking out of window and could not see the door - I could not distinguish the men; at the time - it was too dark to distinguish Morley; the was down and the window was very dirty.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You found the back-door of No. 11 open, and the key gone? A. Yes; I found the backdoor of No. 10 open when I came back.</p>

On the morning of the 27th of October, about a quarter, or twenty minutes past two, I heard a rattle spring; I ran into the road, and saw three persons running about fifty yards off, coming in a direction across the road, from Mr. Austin's house, and about twenty yards from the house, or not quite so much - I made the best of my way after them, and saw Mr. Austin's head out of window: in consequence of what he said I went after them round the new market, and turning the corner, I saw Kemp with Ousby in custody; I assisted in taking him to the watch-house - I cannot say whether he was one of the three I had seen running; as we were taking him to the watch-house, I felt something fall against my feet - it jingled on the ground; it was dark - there was nobody but we three, and Nixon, another watchman; I stooped down and picked up a spoon, which I gave to Berry, the officer - I afterwards went back and examined the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner OUSBY. Q. At the time I was going to the watch-house you had hold of one of my arms, and Kemp the other? A. Yes; I will not swear you dropped the spoon - I kicked it myself; I had seen three persons running before you were caught.</p>

What have I done?"

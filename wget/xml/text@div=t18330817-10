I only rent one room in the house - on Whit-Sunday, the 26th of May, I had occasion to leave my room, and went into the country - I fastened my room door by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183308170013"></xptr>locking it, and took the key with me; I am quite sure I locked it - I have lost a silk cloak, and dress, and other articles, all of which were in my drawers when I locked my door - I put them all away safe on Saturday night, and never left the room till I left for good - the key was left in my drawer; I left the room about eight o'clock on Sunday morning - the landlord lives in the parlour, and we all use one door and one staircase - I returned on the Friday evening following, and found the door locked, I opened it with the key, and discovered the band of one of my gowns lying on the floor, near the door - I then searched my drawers, and missed a silk cloak, a silk dress, three silk shawls, one Cashmere shawl, a crape handkerchief, four silk neck handkerchiefs, six silk pocket handkerchiefs, a silk skirt, a silk body, a silk dress, a body, a necklace, a gold pin, an amber seal, two snuff boxes, a lace frill, six silver tea spoons, one pair of boxes, silver sugar tongs, three gold rings, two gold brooches, two black brooches, two pair of black ear-rings, and a pocket-book, two sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, and twelve shillings in silver - the prisoners lodged in the same house, on the same floor as me; the female prisoner knew I was going out of town - she was in my room on the Friday evening before I left town - the man lived in the same room with her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. RYLAND. Q. How long had you lived there? A. About three months - they came there on the Saturday following the Monday that I did, which was the 25th of March - they lived in the back room, and I in the front; I do not know whether they are married - I am single, and live by tailoring; nobody could go into the room without my permission - I saw all the things safe on Saturday night, for I examined my drawers, as I wanted some things to take with me - I took the key of the room with me.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How long have you worked for tailors? A. About five years - I obtained these things when I was in servitude, but I became a cripple and left service - they were worth 20l. 8s.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH JESSUP. I rent the house - the prosecutrix has lived with me about three months; the prisoners have had a furnished room in my house about seven weeks, on the same floor as the prosecutrix, but in a different room - I remember the prosecutrix leaving on Whit-Sunday, about eight o'clock in the morning - the prisoners were both at home at that time; the female prisoner told me that Mrs. Allen was gone into the country; and would not be home until Thursday afternoon - she said Mrs. Allen had told her so; I had no conversation with the male prisoner about it - they hired their room at 3s. 6d. a week - the week expired on the Sunday, when I had this conversation; they left my lodgings on the Wednesday following - Willis had come home very much intoxicated on the Sunday, and I told him he must leave; he came home intoxicated about three o'clock in the afternoon, and I said he must leave my house, as they quarrelled, and he ran away on the Wednesday afternoon without giving me any notice - I had told him he must leave the house if he went on with that sort of conduct, but I had given him no notice, and did not know of his going - he owed me no rent, except for the few days - the woman left the lodging with him - I live in the house and let the rooms out separately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a family man? A. I have a wife and one child; we all live and sleep there; the man hired the apartment of my wife - I was not present; she would not allow them to come in till I came home, and then I told them, they might come in - I always considered them to be man and wife.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth street office. On Wednesday, the 5th of June, I received a communication respecting this robbery, and went to Newcastle-court, Strand, to a common brothel, and found the male prisoner up, and the woman in bed in the same room; I asked the man what his name was, he said, Hutton; after some further conversation he acknowledged his name to be Willis - I told him I was going to take him into custody, for robbing Mrs. Allen's apartment in Charles-street, and that I was going to search the room; he said nothing; I told the female prisoner that she must go with me - she heard what I said to the man; I proceeded to search the room, and brought away some things which I produce; here is a yard and a half of silk, some pearl beads, and part of a gold pin - I found them in a drawer, in a chest of drawers in the room - I showed them to Mrs. Allen next morning, and she claimed them; the male prisoner said they were his ownproperty, and he could prove it - the prosecutrix picked them out from a great many other things which I had, and identified them.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH ALLEN. This silk is mine; I bought it of Harriet Jessup, the landlady, for a bonnet - I lost a piece of this colour and quality, and the same quantity; it laid along with my best gown in the drawer - I can swear to the colour, and a stain on it which I had noticed before I lost it: and here is a piece of the same silk which was left behind - I have not a doubt of it; and here is a part of a pearl necklace - I lost such things, and I had such a pin; it was in the drawer, and so was the necklace; they were altogether - the pin had a head to it, which has since been taken off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you mean to say, you lost such beads? you don't mean to swear to these particular beads? A. Yes; they are my beads - I identify them - I don't know every one of them, but I have had them often enough in my possession - they were strung when in my possession, but are not now; they are like mine - the pin I lost had a head to it - I made this stain on the silk accidentally with my finger - it is grease.</p>

               <p>Q. Well, but this W. A. is the mark that you showed to me first? A. No, it is not the mark - I did not make that - I did not know it was there before you showed it to me - here is the mark I know it by; it is a stain - I saw that before I left town; I did it with my own fingers - it was there when I put it into my drawer, on the Friday before I went out - my hands were dirty at the time.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Was this piece cut off that? A. Yes, by Mrs. Jessup.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You don't mean to swear to the beads?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183308170014"></xptr>A. I could venture to swear they were my necklace; I mean my necklace was composed of such kind of beads.</p>
               <p>HARRIET JESSUP re-examined. I received this silk from Mrs. Willis, with more, to make a dress of; I sold this piece to Mrs. Allen, and cut this small piece off it to make it a yard and a half - it is the same silk, and came off the same piece - this small piece remained in my custody till after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you get the silk? A. I got it from Mrs. Willis for making her a dress, instead of money - she gave it me about a week or fortnight before I sold it to Mrs. Allen - I kept the small piece, and have had it ever since; these two pieces make all that Mrs. Willis sold me - I did not sell both to Mrs. Allen.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had Mrs. Willis any more of this silk in her possession, when she gave you this? A. Yes; about 20 yards - she told me she had pawned that - Mrs. Allen gave me 2s. 6d. for this silk; the two pieces now produced once formed one piece.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PRENDERGAST re-examined. After the last conviction took place, this silk was in my possession - the letters W. A. had been put on it since that to identify it.</p>

            's Defence. I had 28 yards of silk, and Mrs. Jessup had it to make a gown for the other prisoner, she cut this piece of it from what was left, to make it level, that I might take it to pawn, and now she says she cut it off that piece.</p>
               <p>JURY to ELIZABETH ALLEN. Q. How do you identify the part of the pin? A. It is such a pin as I had, but the head is now off, and I know it by the twist - I had had it in my possession between five and six years.</p>
               <p>HARRIET JESSUP re-examined. I had 40 yards of that silk from Mrs. Willis - I used about twenty yards, for she had a bonnet and other articles - after cutting it from the dress it remained in this shape; I did not cut this piece off what I returned to her - she brought me the yard and a half with this piece joined to it, afterwards, to pay me with it, for making a dress for her; and I cut off this piece to make it even, to sell to the prosecutrix - I cut it off the yard and a half, but not off the 20 yards.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You cut off sufficient for the dress, and there was about 20 yards left? A. Yes; this cut piece was on the end of the 20 yards, and I delivered it to the prisoner - she afterwards brought me down this yard and a half of silk, and this small piece joined to it, and I cut off the small piece before I sold it to the prosecutrix, and have had it ever since - on comparing this end with what I have, I can swear that is what I cut off - she had a dress, a bonnet, a bag, and other articles made; and she brought this down to make a bonnet for myself, instead of money; and she told me in the course of a week, that Mr. Willis had taken the rest to be pawned.</p>
               <p>John Willis. That would correspond with any silk of the colour - I know nothing at all of the robbery - the reason I left the house was because Mrs. Jessup told my fellow prisoner, she owed a man named Walker in the Commercial-road a grudge, and if she could get £3 in his debt, and run away, and give her part of the property, that she would say she was gone away, and and she did not know where too - she got in debt with the man, and we left - this piece of silk was never given at all to Mrs. Willis, nor to Mrs. Jessup; nor are the beads pearl, nor the pin gold; the beads are glass, and the pin metal - she swore at the other trial they were pearl - as to the house I had only lodged there a few days, and did not know what sort of a house it was.</p>
               <p>Sarah James's Defence. Mrs. Jessup cut this piece off the piece which she returned to me, after making the dress, to make it even, as I told her it was no use - I gave her no silk afterwards; she had 4s. 6d. from me, at different times, for making the dress.</p>

             came in with his gig about three o'clock in the afternoon, he brought the coat to the stable, and left it with the gig in the coachhouse. I believe the coat was stolen about three o'clock in the afternoon. It was not missed till Friday morning about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner Rafferty - A. I never saw him to my knowledge, I did not see the coat till Saturday, and then I saw it in the box belonging to Rafferty in his own lodgings, Rafferty was present, he had the key in his pocket, I had information first from Stevens, I suspected Stevens, I could not find him, he left me on the day I hired him. Stevens hearing that he was suspected came to me to clear up the point threatening to punish me for accusing him. I got him into the stable, and locked him in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him to tell - A. Yes, I detained him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see ever Rafferty on the premises that day - A. No, the coat found in Rafferty's box was the same coat that belonged to Colonel Rutherford, I watched Rafferty into a stable in Cheney Mews on Saturday morning, I followed him in, locked the door, and put the key in my pocket, I said good morning to him, he said good morning, I had the advantage of him, I told him no, he had the advantage of me, I wanted the coat that he pawned in St. Martin's lane, and fetched it out again that he received of

             on the Wednesday afternoon, then he changed countenance, said he had a knowledge of the coat, he received it from Stevens, he told him that he brought it from on board a ship, I asked him if it looked like a sea-faring coat, and how he came to have half of the thirty shillings, the money it was pawned for, I took this coat out of Rafferty's box in his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Stevens's Defence. He said upon the honor of a man, if I would say what I had done with the coat, he would forgive me.</p>

               <p>Rafferty's Defence. When he told me the coat was lost, he said I will do you no harm, only deliver me up the coat, I did not know that the coat was stolen, I took it out the evening before, to return it to the man, I told him what a distressed state I was in, my wife died, and left me with three young children.</p>

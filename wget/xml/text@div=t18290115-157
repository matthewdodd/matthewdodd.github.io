            . I live at Hillingdon, and keep the house. On Monday, the 1st of December, about six o'clock in the morning, I left my house, and returned on Tuesday evening, between four and five o'clock; I left a maidservant in the house, and two men servants sleep in the yard; my wife and children were at another house. On returning on Tuesday afternoon I missed some property; the damage done to the things left behind was more than the value of what was taken: I should think my whole loss, from damage and all, is 200l. or more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know the prisoner Shaw's husband? A. Yes, he lived at Drayton, I believe, with her; he has absconded, I understand: I was looking after him.</p>

            . I live at Useley, near Hillingdon, and am a brickmaker. I heard of the robbery at Mr. Milton's house; on the day before I heard of it I saw the prisoner Burnham - I was at work at the brick-kiln, and was stamping to keep my feet warm; Burnham came along with another man, taller than himself - I did not know either of them before: I said, "Good morning, Puttey - I wish I had had a little of what you have had too much of;" they both appeared intoxicated - the tall man said to the prisoner, with a wicked oath, "If we had known it we would have had all the furniture;" Burnham said, "Would you? Would you?" that was all I heard him say; the tall man lay down about twenty yards from the kilu - Burnham went about one hundred yards below him, and stood at the bridge; Burnham had two large bundles, and the tall man one - two of the bundles were coloured, and one white; this was a little before eight o'clock in the morning - it was quite light; they went away: Mr. Milton's house is about a mile from where I saw them. I know the prisoner Shaw- I met her that day, close to my own home, which is about three hundred yards from the kiln; she had nothing with her: it might be a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after I saw the men - she had a shawl and a bonnet on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BURNHAM. Q. Did you ever see me before? A. No; I took particular notice of you, because you leaned against me, and the other man I could not see so well, as his shirt-collar came so high over his face, and his hat came over his face.</p>

            . I keep the King's Head public-house, North Hyde. On the Tuesday or Wednesday morning, the 2d or 3d of December, about nine o'clock or half-past, I saw both the prisoners - they had another man with them, rather taller than Burnham; they were in my public-house, which is about two miles and a half, or three miles, from the kiln Higgs works at - they were all in company together, and had one pot of beer; they had three bundles - I did not notice, but believe one was in something white; I had known the woman before for eight or ten years - I did not know Burnham before: the tall man was not Shaw's husband; the two men carried the bundles - they staid in my house about half an hour, and then went towards Brentford, all three together.</p>

            . I am constable of Hillingdon. I went to Mr. Milton's house on Wednesday, the 3d of December, and found the glass broken in: the back-parlour window shutters were cut with a centre-bit; I went down to the cellar door, and found that broken open - a great many of the locks of the drawers and cupboards up stairs were forced; the laths of the wine-bin in the cellar were broken down, a great deal of wine spilt about, and bottles broken- I did not know Shaw before: I went to her house about nine o'clock that evening, and searched her pockets; I found a little purse, with four duplicates in it - she was in bed when I knocked at the door; her husband was not there - she said he was gone down into the country; I found this pair of shoes under her bed: I found one port wine-bottle, a dark-lantern, this hammer, with a crow-bar at the end of it, this little saw, and a little whistle - I found nothing more; I took one of the duplicates to Butcher's, at Brentford, and found two coats: I observed some pattenmarks on the gravel-walk under the window which was broken; the window is about three feet from the ground: there is a back door to the house, near the window - there is no out-house or privy between the back door and where the patten-marks were on the gravel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether there are any female residents in the house? A. There is one female servant; I have not compared any pattens belonging to Shaw with the marks - I found nothing else to indicate that a woman had been there; I found no pattens in Shaw's house: search has been made for her husband, but we have not been able to find him - she did not say the lantern and things belonged to her husband; I did not ask her.</p>

About eight o'clock on the Tuesday morning, in consequence of something the man-servant told me, I went back to the house at Hillingdon, and observed that the house had been broken open; I had seen it shut up before I left, and saw the back-parlour window secure - I observed some patten-marks on the gravel-walk, which I had never seen before in my life; there is no out-house or building that a female might put pattens on to go to - I myself have no pattens: I missed every thing out of the drawers; they were very much broken indeed, and all the things turned out in my bed-room; the cellar was locked up on the Monday, and the key put into my bed-room drawer - I found the beer-cellar door standing wide open; I missed a large cheese and a great deal of wine, some table and bed linen out of the drawers, and from different places in the house, shirts, coats, and a variety of other things.</p>

            . I live with my father, who keeps the Six Bells public-house, at Brentford. On a Tuesday, five or six weeks ago, I remember two men coming to my father's house between eleven and twelve o'clock; the male prisoner was one, the other was a tall man - they had a pint of beer to drink; they were both fighing, but not together; Burnham fought with a boatman - I remember Shaw being there; I did not see her in the house, I saw her out of doors - she came just as they had done fighting; I had seen her before - I did not notice any bundle with her; I do not know whether either of the men was Shaw's husband.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether she is married? A. No.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I have two coats which I got from Mr. Butcher at Brentford.</p>
               <p>MR. MILTON. These coats are mine, I am certain - these shoes are mine, I know them well; I have worn them - I know nothing of the saw, hammer, or lanterns.</p>
               <p>MRS. MILTON. This is my apron.</p>

               <p>SHAW'S Defence. My husband brought these two coats home to me, tied in the apron as they were: he took the two shoes out of the apron, and gave me the coats tied in the apron and made me go and pawn them- I never wore pattens. I have my marriage certificate here.</p>

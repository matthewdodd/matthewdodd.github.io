               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask her, whether I took it out of her hand by main force? - No, Sir, not by main force, it was by juggling the change backwards and forwards.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask him, whether I strove to rescue, or any thing of that kind? - No, you was in the coach, we had you safe enough, you would have lamed us if you could.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a salesman, in the employ of Otto Alexander Barens and Co., in Cannon-street; they are jewellers and watch dealers, and general importers. I was in their employ in Nov., 1854—there was a robbery com<lb></lb>mitted on their premises, between 4th and the 6th of Nov.—I left the pre<lb></lb>mises all safe on the Saturday night, and they were broken into and robbed between then and the Monday morning—amongst the articles stolen there were a great number of gold and silver watches, and something like thirteen dozen of gold and diamond rings—this watch produced, is one that was stolen on that occasion—the wholesale price of this, is 37<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I should imagine the retail price would be about 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., it is a Geneva watch.</p>

On 9th Nov. last, I was in the Black Dog public house, in Church-street, Shoreditch—I saw the prisoner there, he asked me to buy a watch—I believe this is the watch—I said, I would buy it if he would allow me to go to a pawnbroker's to show it to them—I took the watch for the purpose of going to a pawnbroker, and on the way I was stopped by Sergeant Jackson—I gave him the watch, and told him from</p>

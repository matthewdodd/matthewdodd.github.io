                  </hi>. I am a railway porter at Haverstock Hill Station—on 13th July, at 4.59, I was at the Southampton Bridge and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner there—I saw him fling a stone at the 4.40 train, and before I could get to him he took a second stone out of his pocket and flung it at the train, which was full—I took hold of him—he cried, and said, "It was not me, it was my brother, the other boy"—I took his name and address—I am quite sure it was his hand that threw the stones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I did not throw the stones; it was another boy. My little brother and another big boy, with curly hair, as big as me, were with me, and as soon as the man came and catched hold of me he ran away, and they took me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 464.) I arrested the prisoner on 29th January at 42, Cheapside, where he was that day employed as jobbing porter—I charged him with obtaining goods from messrs. Cook, Son, and Co. by false pretences—he said, "I did go for some goods for a man who asked me to go for them and to sign his name as John Howell; I don't know who that is"—I took him to station, and he made no answer to the charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was called off the porters' stand at Milk Street by a gentleman who said his name was John howell. He asked me if I was a porter. I told him "Yes." He said, "if you will come with me I will give you a job." We went across Cheapside and Bread Street, and he said, "I want you to go into Cook, Son, and Co.'s and get for me seven pieces of George Walton's linsey cloth." I said, "I shall want an order." He said, "Not if you use my name and sign sign in my name," They gave me the goods, and I took them to the corner of Cannon Street, where he was waiting, and he gave me a shilling. That is all I know of the goods. I have been thirty years in the City of London as porter and packer, and have never been in trouble before.</p>

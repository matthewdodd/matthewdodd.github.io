                  </hi>. I live at the Tiger public house, Tower-hill. On 29th June, I was at the first floor window looking at some tumblers—a good many people were looking on—the prisoners walked round the ring several times, close together—I saw Morris feel several ladies' pockets as he went round; Leonard was right at his back, and Connett was a little distance from him, about a couple of yards behind—they both could see what Morris was doing—after feeling several ladies' pockets, Connett and Leonard went and stood by a post, while Morris stood against the mob—Morris then went to them, and stood with them a few minutes—two ladies then came by the crowd, and went to look over the people's shoulders to see the conjuring; Morris walked towards them, followed close behind by Leonard—Connett then left the post, and went after them—Leonard kept his hands at his coat behind Morris, and Connett was standing behind Leonard—the lady raised herself up to look over the people's shoulders, and Morris tried to put his hand in her pocket, but she made two or three moves—I then saw him put his hand in her pocket, and she moved; he then moved close up to her, and gave her a bit of a <hi rend="italic">shove</hi>, and pulled her purse out; I saw the beads at the end of it, as he was putting it into his left hand pocket—he then walked towards Thames-street, and the other two followed him—I went out and saw Connett and Leonard at the corner of Thames-street; I followed behind them a few yards, and heard Connett say to Leonard, "Make haste," or</p>

               <p>"Look sharp"—I saw a City policeman, called him, and ran after Morris, who I took, and told him he had been picking a lady's pocket—he said, "Me! I have not done such a thing;" I said, "You have, and you have got it in this pocket"—I pulled his hand out of his pocket, and the purse fell out at the bottom of his trowsers' leg; the policeman picked it up directly—I stopped Morris—the other two came up, and I pointed them out to the policeman; I left them with him, and went to find the lady, but could not see her.</p>

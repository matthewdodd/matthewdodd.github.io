               <p>19th May, about 10 at night, the prisoner came up to me in Frederick Street, and said, "Please little boy will you go and get me change for a half-crown"—I said, "Yes"—he went down to Tomkin's beer-shop and gave me a half-crown—I went in and got the change, and gave it to the prisoner—he gave me a penny and told me to go and get it changed, and while I was gone he ran down Salmon's Lane—the prisoner afterwards spoke to me—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man—I knew him by his slippers, his trousers, and his coat.</p>

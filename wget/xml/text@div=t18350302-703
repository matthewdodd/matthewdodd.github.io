I was on Ludgate-hill at half-past seven o'clock that evening—I saw the prisoner and another following the prosecutor—the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and took out his handkerchief, and put it into his own side pocket—he turned up a court—I ran and asked the prosecutor if he had lost any thing—he said, "Yes"—we all went back, and took the prisoner in the court.</p>

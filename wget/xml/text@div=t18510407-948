                  </hi>. I manage a soap-manufactory in Comp<lb></lb>ton-street, Clerkenwell, for my father, Charles Williams. About July, 1849, I engaged the prisoner in his service—it was his duty to take orders and receive the amounts—he was at first allowed a commission—that went on till the end of 1849—in 1850 he came to me, and said it would be more agreeable to him if I would let him draw 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week on his commis<lb></lb>sion,</p>

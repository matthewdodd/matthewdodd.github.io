                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the service of James Easton and another, engineers, wheelwrights, and lead merchants, in the Grove, Great Guildford-street, Borough. This piece of lead, now produced, weighing 52lbs., resembles the lead on my master's premises—it has no particular mark, but it is cast in a particular way—the prisoner Delay was employed as a labouring bricklayer on the premises—he had access to the lead—he was desired to remove it out of the way where they were building a boiler—I found it at a marine store-shop in Redcross-street—I was after<lb></lb>wards with the officer when he took Mayhew in Castle-street—he said he had taken a piece of lead from Delay, and had sold it in Castle-street, that Delay gave it him in the Grove, Great Guildford-street, and that it was handed out at the door of the factory to him.</p>

On the 21st of June, 1818, about seven o'clock in the morning, a neighbour rang the bell; I got up, found the party-wall broken through, and found a hole large enough for a man to get into my house; it was secure when I went to bed - the next house was empty. I missed the articles stated in the indictment from my shop-window, which were worth 130 l.. I saw none of them till last April, when eight rings and the snuffer-stand were produced by Goff.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. You came down after daylight - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>GEOBGE GOFF, I am a constable of Lambeth. On the 29th of February last, in consequence of information, I went to No. 4, King-street, Snow's-fields, found the prisoner's wife there, and inquired for her husband? She said he was at Maidstone, in custody. I took her into custody, and locked the room up. Next morning I went there and found eight gold rings and the snuffer-stand, which the prosecutor claimed in April.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know how long the prisoner had been in custody at Maidstone - A. From August, 1818.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he not there for passing bad money - A. I was told it was for horse stealing. I was told he had never lived in the house where I found the property.</p>

            . I lost my Watch from my Bed's-Head in my own House, between 8 and 9 o'Clock at Night; the Watch was seen at the Bed's-Head about a Quarter of an Hour before I missed it; there was no other Person in the Room afterwards besides the Prisoner. She lodges in the House, and came frequently into my Room as other Lodgers did. I was in Bed when she came in. Just before I missed the Watch she went out, and staid for the Space of half an Hour, and when she came back, said she had been in Chiswell-street. Before I got a Warrant for her, I enquired whether she had been there, and I found she had not been there at all. - She did not confess any thing.</p>

             sworn. - I am an assistant elder in the India Company's warehouses; Mr. Lucas, one of my colleagues, discovered a deficiency in the bales of muslin; as soon as Harris was secured, I went after Topley to the armoury, and brought him down stairs; at the end of the square he told me, in the first instance he must go to the necessary, and ran away from me into the necessary; I followed him, and there I saw his left hand in the act of pulling something from the waistband of his breeches; I seized him by the left hand, and called to Mr. Evans, a commodore, for assistance; he came, and I saw a piece of muslin hanging out of the prisoner's breeches; I took hold of the muslin, and seized him by the collar.(

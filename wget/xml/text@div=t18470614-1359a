                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Dorset-place. I was called on the 7th of May, and found the deceased on a truss of straw in the stable, in a state of collapse, suffering from symptoms of concussion of the brain—there were some slight superficial cuts on her right wrist, and an appearance of having recently received a black eye—it was very pale, afterwards became purple, and at last a confirmed black eye—there was an abrasion of the skin—she had a wound at the back of her head, behind her right ear—there was dilation of the right pupil, and a contraction of the left pupil—I and Mr. Oakley, a medical friend, adopted the usual remedies, and she subsequently rallied—we afterwards took her up stairs to bed, and in the evening, when some reaction had taken place, we applied leeches, and other remedies—Mr. Fergusson, of King's College Hospital, saw her next day with me, and at once pronounced it a hopeless case; but we continued to attend her till Mon<lb></lb>day night, when she died—there was a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination next day—the back of the shoulders were much bruised, and blackened, as from a fall, also the back of her right arm—on removing the scalp, there was extensive extravasation between the scalp and skull—no depression of born but a ra<lb></lb>diating fracture in the centre, corresponding with a cut outside the head—on removing the skull, we discovered a fracture extending to the inner table of the skull, and very extensive extravasation of blood on the brain, which arose from a rupture of one of the sinuses of the dura mater—there was some little softening on the right hemisphere of the brain, which if she had lived longer would have terminated in suppuration—we examined the spine, and the other viscera, they were all perfectly healthy—the cause of death was the rupture of the central sinus of the brain, and the extravasation of blood on the brain—the rupture was occasioned by a fall, most likely from the injury at the back of the head—it appeared as if she had struck on some hard point—a man's foot would certainly not have done it—a stick or poker might—we examined the door, but could see no mark of her falling</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184706140034"></xptr>
               <p>on the fastening of the door—the door opens towards the bottom of the stairs, and there is a very awkward fastening protruding from the door-post—it is possible she might have fallen on that—the floor she fell on was brick—she might have fallen on the rough edge of a brick—a fall on any unequal hard substance might have done it—the floor was unequal—if she fell down stairs, and struck against something that might have caused all the injuries—the black eye must have been very recently received—it could not have been from any very hard substance, if so it must have been a par<lb></lb>ticularly flat surface which struck it—there was no abrasion of the skin at all—the black eye might have been occasioned by a fall—she might have turned round in some sort of way, but I hardly think it could—it is entirely a mat<lb></lb>ter of opinion—it was as if from a blow from a fist—I should think I got there about five minutes after the fall—the prisoner was there when I arrived—I think he was rather under the influence of liquor—I required brandy—he went for it immediately, and held her up while I tried to get it down her throat—the only conversation I had with him was when I turned her head round to ascertain the nature of the injury—he requested me not to hurt her—he did not say how it happened—the injuries were at the back of the head—it is possible she might have turned while falling, but it is a very narrow staircase—if she had fallen forwards I do not think the injuries would be received at the back of the head—she must have fallen backwards, or else the injury must have been inflicted by somebody behind—when he said, "Don't hurt her," I said, "You are very tender now, you should have thought of that before"—he replied that he was as tender as I was—he said, "It served her right"—I said nothing to that—he continued with me, and paid her a great deal of attention, and exhibited a good deal of anxiety.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>there—I did not hear anything pass before the doctor occurred—after he came he asked how it occurred—the prisoner said she was coming down stairs, and he struck a blow and knocked her down, but it was her own fault—Mr. Guy said, "You will say so," and I said, "Of course he will"—he did not appear at all intoxicated.</p>

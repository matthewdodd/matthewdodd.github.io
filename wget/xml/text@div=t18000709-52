               <p>Q. What are these things worth? - A. They are worth above ten pounds, without the table-cloth and white handkerchiefs; I left her in the room between nine and ten in the morning; when I came home, I found the door locked, the prisoner was gone out, and had taken the key with her; I did not see her again, till I saw her at her lodgings in Peter-street, Westminster, on the 8th of June; she was taken with the gown upon her, and I swore to my gown upon her back, at Queen-square office, and she had my bonnet upon her head; she would not tell me what she had done with any of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180007090032"></xptr>things, she left her own bed-gown, and her own bonnet in my room; the gown that I lost was down stairs, under the counter.</p>
               <p>Q.Were the shirts new? - A. There were two belonging to a gentleman at Kensington, and one of the petticoats was new; those shirts were worth a guinea and a half a shirt, the shirts were new, the woman's dress was bran new, it cost two guineas; the cloak cost me two guineas just before, and was not the worse for wear; the stockings, I cannot say what they were worth, there were two pair cost seven shillings a pair; one of the petticoats was worth fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep the house? - A. No, I am a lodger, the house is let in tenements; the landlord does not live in the house, nor any of his family.</p>
               <p>JOHN BEVAN sworn. - I have an apartment on the same floor with Mrs. Williams; on the 18th of October, I observed the prisoner go down stairs twice, with clothes drawn carelessly through her arm; the second time she went down, she left the room door wide open; in a few minutes, she came in again, and I followed her into the room, and gave her a caution about leaving the door open, and she thanked me; just after, I heard her go down stairs again, but did not see her, and she locked the door after her.</p>
               <p>Q. How was she dressed, when you saw her that second time? - A. In an old bed-gown, and an old black hat; I then went out, I was gone about a quarter of an hour; when I returned, Mrs. Williams was come home, and the door broke open, there did not appear to be so many clothes in the room as there were before.</p>
               <p>- JAQUES sworn. - I am a constable; on the 8th of June I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody; I found this bonnet upon her, and the gown that Mrs. Williams claimed, the gown was not taken from her; she told me, the bonnet she took, but the gown was given her.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence.</p>

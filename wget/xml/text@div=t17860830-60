               <p>I had been out at work all the week; and was locked out of my lodging, and the prisoner asked me to go home with her; we went to bed, and I waked at nine in the morning; the prisoner was gone, and my things; on the Tuesday week following, I found the prisoner with my bonnet and cloak, and gown, and handkerchief upon her; I am sure they are nine; she said I had robbed her of two guineas, and she would not give me my things till I gave her the two guineas.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have known this young woman a month; she has been under the piazzas frequently, and went in company with me night after night; one evening we met two gentlemen in New-street, Covent Garden, and one of them gave a couple of guineas to that young woman; we went out together, and was out till four in the morning; the prosecutrix went home with me; she lent me the gown to go out in, and the cloak and bonnet; I went out of town with a gentleman; and I came back, and I went under the piazza's to look for her; she overtook me in Hart-street, and charged me with a theft.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Is that true, did you lend her these things? - I never lent them her; she took them while I was asleep.</p>

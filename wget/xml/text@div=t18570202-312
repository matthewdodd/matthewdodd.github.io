On Sunday morning, 11th Jan., between 1 and 2 o'clock, I heard a cry of "Police!" in a female's voice, at Bridgewater Gardens, leading out of Barbican—I proceeded to the spot, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor together—the prosecutor said that she had robbed him of a sovereign and a half crown—she said that he had given her a half crown and wanted it back again—I asked him how long since he had the money in his possession—he said that he was sure he had it not a minute before—I took her to the station—she produced half a crown voluntarily—she was searched by the female searcher, but only 2 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on her.</p>

               <p>the 10th, and Sunday, 11th Jan., I saw the prisoner in Smithfield, about 1 o'clock—she begged very hard for a cup of tea, which I at first refused, but afterwards gave her in a coffee shop in Smithfield, and I had a cup with her—we came out together, and she followed me on my way home, as far as Bridgewater-gardens—she laid hold of my left arm—I took my hand from my trowsers pocket to my breast pocket, and when I put it back into my trowsers pocket my money was gone—I had had my hand upon it all the while—it was a sovereign and a half crown—I said, "You have robbed me of a sovereign and a half crown"—she tried to escape, but I would not let her—she called for the police, a policeman came up, and I said, "This is just the man I want"—she said that I had given her the half crown to go with her, and then wanted it back—I had given her no money at all—I was with her about half an hour—I changed 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay. for the tea, and had a few coppers out, which I put into my other pocket—I saw the sovereign in the coffee shop and the half crown—I took them out, but the prisoner was sitting on the other side of me, and could not see—I did not feel her hand in my pocket at all—I have examined my pocket, there is no hole in it, it is exactly the same now—I was perfectly sober—I had drank some ale, but not to affect me—she was sober, to all appearance—she wanted me to go home with her, but I refused.</p>

On the 14th of September, about a quarter-past ten o'clock at night, I came home, and the servant was in her bed-room, watching for some persons she suspected would come; she said there were two men on the tiles of the warehouse - I fetched my brother; we went to the warehouse stairs - I opened the door, and saw a light; I took a poker; we rushed in, and I saw Smith (who is not here) with his hand on the bannisters of the stairs, with a piece of rope in his hand, carrying it up the warehouse stairs which go to the first floor - the prisoner was helping him; they were going to get out at the tiles: I said, "Smith, what, is that you?" he made no answer, but dropped the rope and ran up; I threw the poker at him and knocked him down - the prisoner instantly put out the light, which left me in total darkness; I went up stairs in search of Smith, while my brother went for a light: I could not find Smith, and called my brother to bring a light; as he was coming I heard some person up stairs; I went up again in the dark and kicked against a stick - I took it up, and went to the place where I heard a noise; I struck, and, unfortunately, broke the prisoner's arm - I struck again, and hit him on the head, but lightly, or he would have been no more; I called for a light, and found him apparently in a lifeless state: I raised him up - he recovered a little, and said, "Don't kill me - do what you like to me:" I asked where Smith was - he said he did not know; I got the watchman; we searched the house and warehouse, but nobody was found - I have seen the prisoner before. This rope was removed two or three yards - a large bale of rope had been divided into three parts; they entered the warehouse through a bulk-hole in the top of the warehouse: my mother and the servant were watching, in consequence of our having been robbed shortly before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What did you strike him with? A. A stick - no one else struck him in my presence; my brother had some weapon in his hand, I think it was a stick - I dropped the poker; my brother did not strike him to my knowledge - I have not brought the stick here - it was about the size of my two fingers: I struck him once when he was down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not this occur in the dark? A. Yes; I was in danger of my life - I did not know who was there; I did not strike at him before the light was out.</p>

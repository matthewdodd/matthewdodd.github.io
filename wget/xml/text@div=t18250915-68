            . I am a broker, in the rag way, and live in Red Lion-street. The prisoner came to my shop on the 19th of August, and brought this bag, which he put down in the shop; I asked him how he came by it - he said a man in Whitechapel gave it to him to sell, and gave him 6 d. to bring it. I asked if he knew the name of the man, or where he lived; he said No. I saw the officer passing, and gave charge of him.</p>

            . I have worked with the prisoner. - On the 19th of August I was walking up Plough-yard, and saw him come out of Mr. Gardener's warehouse, with a bag on his back, similar to this. There was another man with him, who is in Mr. Gardener's employ. The prisoner went up King's Head-court; the other man locked the door, and went the contrary way; the prisoner went towards Red Lion-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say you thought the bag contained shoes? A. Yes, I did, because they are allowed to be taken away by Mr. Gardener.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If he had seen me would he not have stopped me, and made it known to Mr. Gardener? He said at Worship-street that he was near me, and spoke to me.</p>

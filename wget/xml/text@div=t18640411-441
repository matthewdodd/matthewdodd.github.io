                  </hi>. I am manager of the London and County Bank at Knightsbridge—the prisoner kept an account there—in November, 1862, he applied to me for au advance of money—I advanced him 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by dis<lb></lb>counting</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186404110064"></xptr>
               <p>two bills for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. respectively—they were debited to his account; put with his vouchers and given up to him. (<hi rend="italic">William Base, clerk to Messrs. Mullens, proved the service of a notice upon the prisoner and his solicitor, to produce the various bills alluded to in the evidence.</hi>) The bills were dated the 12th of November, 1862, drawn by the prisoner and accepted "William Neats"—the application was for a loan of 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the bills were drawn in that way for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., simply because we hap<lb></lb>pened not to have a stamp for 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were four months' bills; they would become due about the 15th of March—on the 20th of March, a few days after they became due, I received 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the prisoner—I carried on the loan by discounting a bill for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn by him and purporting to be accepted by Mr. Neats, dated the 14th of March, 1863, at four months—that was done by agreement with the prisoner—on the 17th of July that 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was paid by 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, and a renewal for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was by agreement with the prisoner—that 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was drawn by the prisoner and purported to be accepted by William Neats—it was dated the 7th of July—on the 10th of November, the day on which that bill became due, we gave the usual notice to the prisoner, and we held the bill till the 14th of November, on which day he called and paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., giving me this bill for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated November 12th, 1863, drawn by the prisoner upon, and accepted by William Neats and Son, at three months—that is the bill which is the subject of the present indictment—upon two previous occasions I had objected to Mr. Neats making his bills payable at our bank, as he had no account there—the prisoner said that Mr. Neats had no private account at Glyn's, and he did not wish to accept them for Neats and Son, as his son knew nothing about the transaction—the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill accepted by Neats and Son is made payable at Glyn's—I received it in that form—this conversation took place on the 18th of July, on the occasion of discounting the previous bill, and on an occasion subsequent to that—I did not require that it should be accepted by Neats and Son; I required that it should be payable at Glyn's—the prisoner called on me on the morning of the 16th February, 1864, and stated that two acceptances of Neats and Sons for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. respectively, became due on that morning, and he proposed to pay 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. off the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and to renew the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I suggested that it would be better to have one bill for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he then left, as I imagined, to get a new bill, to get Mr. Neats' acceptance or promissory note—this was about twenty minutes past 11 o'clock—he returned about 4, or a little after, and complained that I had not prevented these bills from being presented—I told him, in the first place, I had received no instructions from him to retire the bills, and secondly, that, even had I done so, it was too late, for the bills had been presented when he was with me in the morning—he wished to know if he should get them himself by going to the City—he said that Mr. Neats was very much annoyed—I noticed that the prisoner seemed a great deal agitated, but I attributed that to the bills having been presented contrary to his wish—he asked when we should have them back—I told him at half-past 10 the following morning—he then left, and agreed to come in the morning—he did so, and while he was with me the bills were brought back from the head office—Mr. Cutler, the accountant, in my presence, showed him this memorandum written on the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, "orders not to pay this accept<lb></lb>ance, being a forgery"—upon that the prisoner said that Mr. Neats had repu<lb></lb>diated the bill because he imagined he had no bill becoming due for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that date, that Mr. Neats thought the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was at six mouths, instead of three, and that he therefore denied its being genuine—I told</p>

               <p>him if that were the case, he had better bring Mr. Neats to me, and he then left, as he said, for that purpose—Mr. Neats did call upon me some days afterwards; the prisoner was not present at that time; he called alone—I had seen the prisoner in the meanwhile.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was duly paid by the prisoner, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was—that is to say, we debited his current account so soon as we had funds to meet it—there were other money matters between us—it was debited to his account as an unpaid bill—I could not have given him that bill, it having been marked a forgery—I am not sure whether he applied for it—I don't know whether he did or not; but for its being so marked he could have had it—I don't recollect whether he applied for it; at all events he did not appear anxious about it—in the first instance there were two bills for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were re<lb></lb>duced by the payment of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and acceptances given for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>,—the arrangement then made was, that there was to be a subsequent reduction of not less than 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill became due, Mr. Neats came with the prisoner; he was not a party to that arrangement—the prisoner and he came together—the prisoner came into my room—Mr. Neats remained at the counter, but seeing him at the counter, and Mr. Wykes handing me the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and joining Mr. Neats, I imagined that Mr. Neats was cognizant of the transaction—Mr. Neats says that the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. hill was a forgery—there was no other bill at that time except the 1,0002. bill—Mr. Neats did not transact any business with me that day—he did not speak to me at all—he and the prisoner came together and left together—a new bill was given for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot tell whether it was accepted then and there, without seeing the bill—I cannot speak from personal knowledge, whether I got the bill back again—in the usual routine it would be debited to his account, but we do not keep them, when the pass-book is made up the cheques are put into the pocket—I think that is done by all joint stock banks—I don't think Mr. Neats was present when the business respecting the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was transacted—I should not like to say positively whether I got that 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill at that interview, but my impression is that I did; in the absence of the bill I cannot recollect—it was alleged that the first two bills for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were forgeries—Mr. Neats' expression to me was that with the exception of the one for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which came due on the 15th of February, that is the last 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, he had not given the prisoner an acceptance for eighteen months—the two first bills were not renewed by the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, until four or five days after they were due—we had them for a few days until the prisoner called—they were presented, because they were due at our office, so that our having possession of them would be presenting them—they were not presented to Mr. Neats, nor was any notice given to him that they were due at our bank—the prisoner arranged to renew them, so that they were not dishonoured—Mr. Neats was not communicated with—the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which the prisoner paid was upon the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. genuine bill.</p>

I was not there; and I want to put that right, because it might bring my name into question—I was there on one occasion, but not at that time; it was a year and a half or two years previous—I am positive I was not there at that time, because I bad no occasion to be there—I was not at the bank in 1863; that I can declare on my oath—I was very sorry for the prisoner's position when I ascertained this was a forgery—it did not alter my friendship for him at all—I I was not dining with him when he was taken into custody; I was dining at the same table—he was not dining—he sent to say he wished to see me at the Bridge House Hotel, and I went there, and had dinner at the same table with him—I was exceedingly good friends with him—I am not the prosecutor—I am not opposed to the prisoner; quite the contrary—I have not said that he might have imagined he had authority to sign my name—I have never said that—I said at the Mansion House that he might think be could take a liberty with my name, but that he had not my authority to do it—if he had asked me to accept the bills, no doubt I would have done it, out of the respect I have for him—I did say at the Mansion House, that I thought he might have supposed he could take a liberty with my name, and I think so now, from the terms of intimacy upon which we were—he has paid this bill—I have not lost a sixpence, nor has any one else, that I know of.</p>

On the 21st of September, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was at breakfast - I left my front parlour to go into the kitchen. I returned, and saw a man's hand in the window, taking a spoon off the table - I also missed the sugar-tongs. I saw a man running from the house, a gentleman pursued, and brought the prisoner back, who I believe to be the man by his dress and figure.</p>
               <p>FORTUNE GUILLOIS. I was in Mary-street, and saw the prisoner and another young man, in a brown coat, at the prosecutrix's door, a gentleman came out, and both ran away, the prisoner turned to the left, and the other man turned to the right. The gentleman called out Stop thief! I pursued - He jumped over a pailing, and then over a ditch. I cried out Stop thief! but could not follow him. About three days after I was attacked by the young man in a brown coat - He struck me several times, and said if I appeared against the prisoner, he would be the death of me - I am certain the prisoner is the man, he was taken about five minutes after the robbery, in the field, by the constable. I had him in sight all the way till he got over the pailings, I then lost sight of him for a minute.</p>
               <p>JAMES BIRK. I am a constable. I heard the last witness cry stop thief! and followed the prisoner down the road; he turned up Edward-street, jumped over the pales, and then over a ditch; I went over after him, ran round the ditch, and two men stopped him in the Regency-park. I brought him back, and am positive he is the man. I found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw the people about a pond; I was stopped as I went to see what was the matter. I was not near the door.</p>

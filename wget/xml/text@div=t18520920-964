                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Parr, a grocer, of Trafalgar-road, Greenwich. On Saturday evening, 11th Sept., the prisoner came, about 8 or 9 o'clock—I saw her sitting in the chair by the counter, in our shop—she asked for three ounces of tea, and two half pounds of sugar—I served her—she tendered a sovereign in payment—I looked at it—it was bad—I gave it to my husband, who was in the shop at the same time—he weighed it and bit it—he threw it back to the prisoner, and said, "It is a very bad one, Mrs. Chapman"—the prisoner put it into her purse, and then left the shop—she did not take the articles which she asked for—I offered to trust her with them, but she left them.</p>

I went to Mr. Parr's, and, in consequence of what he said, I went in search of the prisoner—I found her in the first floor of 13, East-street, Greenwich—I said to her, "Where is that bad sovereign that you uttered to Mr. Parr a few minutes ago?"—she said, "I don't know where it is; I cannot find my purse"—I said, "I shall have you searched if you don't find it"—she then produced the purse—I have it here—I found in it two bad sovereigns—I asked her how she became possessed of them—she said they were the remaining two of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that she had changed at Mr. Toplin's, the grocer—I asked if she had any more bad money—she said she had not—I took her into custody—I then returned to her lodging, and found, in a drawer of a chest of drawers, this reticule—in the top part of it I found two good sove<lb></lb>reigns, and some silver; and in this other compartment of it, nine bad sove<lb></lb>reigns—I afterwards saw the prisoner, and showed her this bag—she said it was hers.</p>

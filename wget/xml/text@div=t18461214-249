                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Mr. Adkins. On the 26th of Sept. I was sent by Mrs. Adkins to No. 10, Triangle, Camberwell—Mr. Adkin' son accompanied me—I had sixteen pairs of plated candlesticks, three plated liquor-frames, six plated cruet-stands, two plated tea-pots, six Britannia metal tea-pots, three cream-jugs, two plated mugs, six toast-racks, four pain of bottle-stands, a basket, egg-cup-frame, a soy frame, six snuffer-trays, six pain of snuffers, six pairs of nut-crackers, four dozen of spoons, and a Bri<lb></lb>tannia-metal coffee-pot—I received directions from my mistress not to leave the goods without the money—I got to the Triangle about a quarter to eight o'clock—the time appointed was eight o'clock—the shop was shut all but the door-shutters—I knocked at the door two or three times, and waited about ten minutes, and then Phillips came—he acted as the servant of Millard—he said, "Do you want Mr. Millard?"—I said "Yes,"—he said, "I will fetch him"—he ran across the road, and presently Millard came by himself—he recog<lb></lb>nized me by just nodding his head—he was the person who had ordered the goods—I had seen him then—he went into No. 10, opened the door, and let me in—when I got into the shop there was nothing but the counter and the gas-fittings—I took the goods out of a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, when he came in and deposited them in the shop—as I was taking them out of the bag, Millard said, "You seed not take them out of the bag"—I said, "Oh, yes, we had better take them out to see that they are right"—when I had taken out about half the things, my young master gave me a receipt stamp—I said, "I have brought a receipt, I can fill it up here"—Millard said, "Very well"—while I was taking out the goods, Phillips said, "Make haste and get them out, for he is going to pay the men, and you will be too late"—Millard said, "Come across, and I will pay you"—he took me over to a public-house—as I was going out I saw Phillips was going to stop behind, and said to my master's son, "You had better stay here till I come back"—when they found that, they said, "We will all go together"—we all came out together—Phillips locked the shop door—when we got to some distance, I looked round, and found Phillips was gone—I said to my master's son, "You had better go back"—he went back—I went on with Millard—I said, "I hope you are not going to take me far, as my time is precious"—he said, "Oh, no, it is only just here"—he did not say whom he was going to take me to—I did not hear him mention any name—we went into the parlour of the public-house—it was full of working men, carpenters and bricklayers, and then I thought it was all right, as if they were waiting to be paid—he offered me drink—I refused at first, but afterwards just tasted it—Millard was in and out two or three times, and said, "My relation will be here directly"—he went out—I waited about ten minutes—he did not come back—I asked at the bar where he was gone—I could not find him—I hastened back to the shop as quickly as possible, and saw my master's son, who could not get in—I could not get in—I went to the back of the house, got through the next door neighbour's, got into the shop, and all the goods were gone—I went over the house, and could not find anything in it, or any person—I did not see Millard or Phillips again till they were in custody—I remember Millard being at my master's shop the night before this Saturday, and heard Mrs. Adkins tell him he could not have any goods but what he paid for—he took up the invoice, and said, "What extra discount for cash?"—she told him five per cent.—(there was also twenty-five per cent. allowed to the trade)—the thirty per cent, was taken off the invoice—on that being done, I said, "Then you will pay me there and then, when I bring the goods?"—he said, "Yes"—it was agreed I should bring them next evening—I went to look for Mr. Walker, to whom he referred, but never could see him.</p>

The invoice price of the goods is 71<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we take off twenty-five per cent, to the trade, and five per cent, when the cash is paid, in all thirty per cent.—the value of the articles Pyke paid 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for would be about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Robinson, a shoemaker, of 5, James-street—on 31st October last, between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, I was engaged washing in the kitchen of No. 2, Bacon-street—I could see into the back yard of that house—I heard a great many words, but too bad to ex<lb></lb>press, between a young man and the prisoner—I saw the prisoner; she had a child in her arms—after about twenty minutes, and after having a great many words with the young man, I saw her take the child and put it into the water-butt; the child rather struggled, and clutched its little hands on the edge of the water-butt, and she took its hands off and put it down into the water—she went a little way from the butt, and left it in the water—the same young man came up momentarily, and took the child out of the butt by the heels, and gave it to Mrs. Merrett—I saw her undress it; it was rather exhausted—it appeared to be about twelve or thirteen months old—there was a cry of "Police," and a constable came and took the prisoner in charge.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did this woman live with her husband and children in that house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; she was an entire stranger—I had never seen her before—she did not live there, nor did the young man she was talking to—there was a little building going on at the back of the house, and the young man was employed there—I understood that he was her son-in-law, but I do not know anything of the family—he was making use of very gross and disgusting language to the prisoner—she appeared to be very much excited—the butt I speak of is a kind of pickling-tub—I suppose it stands about that high from the ground (<hi rend="italic">about a yard and a half</hi>)—she dashed the child in the water in her rage—I don't think it was half a moment in the water before it was pulled out by the young man.</p>

               <p>—I can't say how she came to wreak her vengeance on the child; that is best known to herself—I do not know, of my own knowledge, whose child it was; no more than what I heard when it was taken into the house, from the young man—I heard nothing said by the prisoner about it or in her presence.</p>

I am the wife of an engine-driver, and live in Bacon-street—I do not know the prisoner, any more than seeing her on the day in question—I do not know where she lives—I saw this transaction—I was looking out of window into the back yard—I saw the prisoner standing quarrelling with the young man—I saw her standing against the butt, and she put the child into the water, and as she was putting it in it struggled rather, and caught its hands on the side of the butt, and she loosed them from the butt and pushed them into the water, and afterwards pushed its head in; I saw her do that—the first time I saw her she was about two yards from the butt—she then had the child in her arms—after she had put the head in, she stepped a little way back from the butt—the young man was then at the other end of the yard—he was at the other end of the yard at the time I saw her put the child in—she stepped away from it, as near as I could tell, about half a yard—the young man was stooping down, picking up some bricks, he looked up directly, dropped his trowel, and ran and took the child out of the water—I saw it taken out, and it was carried into the house—I saw it afterwards; it was very much exhausted—I don't know exactly how long it was before it recovered.</p>

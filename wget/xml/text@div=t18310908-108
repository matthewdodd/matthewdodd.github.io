On the 2nd of September, about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and asked to look at some heavy Brussels silk handkerchiefs; he came and looked at some printed bandannas, and knocked one piece off the counter - while I stooped to take that up, I suppose he must have put the piece in question into his apron; there were bundles of handkerchiefs on the counter - he then asked to see some black bandannas, which I showed him; he bought none, and was going out - I charged him with having taken something; and he said I was injuring his character: nobody else was present - he desired me to call the person from the next warehouse; I went to a window which looks into the next warehouse - Mr. Lock came and the prisoner wanted him to allow me to go to Mr. Leaf's, to inquire his character; he was then going down stairs - I followed and told him, I thought he had got another piece - he came up stairs with me, and a piece, containing twelve handkerchiefs, was found in his outside pocket; it was the first piece I had shown him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did he not speak like a foreigner? A. No - he asked the price of the goods; I said I did not know the price of any thing - he was not two steps from me when I went to call somebody, and could not have got out without my seeing him.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to Mr. Haslock, whose warehouse is on the same floor with Mr. Jones', and is parted by a glass partition - Judd called me in, and said he suspected the prisoner, who seemed very indignant at the charge, and wished me to let the boy go to Mr. Leaf's, in Old' Change, and inquire his character; I refused, and wished to know if he had the goods he was charged with taking: he denied having them, and was going away -Judd still said he had a piece in his pocket; he followed him, laid hold of his coat pocket, and said, "You have a piece here" - the prisoner said, "What do you mean?" I said, "We will see if it is so or not;" he said, "No one shall search me but an officer;" I said we could soon send for one - he said, "I will go back with you into the warehouse," and while I was directing Judd where to find and officer, I saw him pulling the handkerchiefs out of his pocket, and endeavouring to put them on the counter - they came unfolded, part on the counter and the other end in his pocket - while Judd was gone for the officer he took out his purse, and said, "For God's sake, let me go, and take this;" the officer found the purse contained eleven sovereigns, besides silver.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he tell you he intended to pay for it? A. Not a word of the kind.</p>

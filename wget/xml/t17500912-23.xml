            . I was coming from Hampstead on Sunday the 22d of July, about 9 in the evening, in a landau; there were five of us in it, three gentlewomen, Mr. Sherard the attorney, and my self. We insisted that our coachman should keep with the other; yet, for what reason I know not, they divided; the one went to Gray's-Inn Lane, and the other to Hanover Square. I was in the latter; we were stopp'd <placeName id="t17500912-23-crimeloc113">near Fig Lane</placeName>

They d - d their eyes, and said they would blow our brains out, if we di d not deliver our watches and money directly. One cry'd out to me, your watch, your watch, and put his hand into the coach. I gave it him; it was a metal one gilt, with an enamell'd dial plate, made by Delander. The prisoner at the bar was on that side I was on; it was light enough for me to discern him, being a clear night. Then he demanded my money. I told him I had spent that at Hampstead; so they took none from me. The other evidence I believe saw him there, but I will not swear that. When I went first to see the prisoner at the bar, he confess'd to me the whole. One of them was lying down on the side of a heap of gravel.</p>

            . The prisoner and I have committed several robberies together; at this time we lay in weight at the end of Fig Lane about half an hour; we heard the rattling of coaches; said the prisoner do you lie down on the stones. As the coach and landau came on, the landau turned round on the right hand near my legs. The prisoner said, Jack, which shall we follow? I said it is best to follow this, there being the fewest people. There was a great noise in the other coach. I went up and stopp'd the landau. Then Henry Saunders went on the other side; he took this gentleman's watch and brought it to me. I took a diamond ring and another plain one from off a gentlewoman's finger; and Campbel took the money out of a gentleman's pocket, about fourteen of fifteen shillings. I had a brace of pistols, the prisoner a brace, and Campbel one.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say for himself.</p>

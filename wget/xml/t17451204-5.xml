            . I had a Search-Warrant to search her House, and in the old Woman's Pocket I found it (the Watch) serv'd up in this little Bag.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Elizabeth. My Lord I met this Evidence, and she said to me will you go and drink a Pint of Beer? and there was a Soldier with her, and we went to drink, and the Soldier pull'd out the Watch, and he said, Go and pawn this Watch; and they offer'd 15 s. for it: and I said, I know where to sell it for more Money. This Evidence has charg'd me with a Pair of Ear-rings: She wants to swear a Street-Robbery upon me.</p>

I bought this Watch of the Evidence and this Woman: She said to me, Mother, will you buy my Husband's Watch? and I bought it, and borrow'd Part of the Money; and I pinn'd it up, and said, It shall not be seen 'till I see my Child's Face.</p>
               <p>Jury. We desire to understand clearly the Time when advertis'd, to the Time when it was found in her Pocket.</p>
               <p>A. Lost the 28th (August) bought the same Night, paid for the 29th and advertis'd the 30th, and found in her Pocket the 4th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that she sent for the Advertiser?</p>
               <p>A. I heard it read the Day that it came out; it was the second Day after the Robbery; and in reading it she fell a-crying, and said that she had a good Mind to carry it (the Watch) to Mr. Counsel; and her Daughter said she might do what she would.</p>

            . Mrs. Newberry came to me, and desir'd to borrow a little Money, for her Son had been extravagant, and his Watch lay in Pawn, and she was willing to have it, to remember him. Well I lent her what she desir'd: If it had been the whole 40 Shillings, she should have had it. I keep a Butcher's Shop, went to carry out Meat, and call'd in at her House. I saw the Watch, and she kiss'd it, and said it should be the last Thing that she would part with. I have trusted her with five or six Pounds at a Time.</p>

               <p>Lewis. It was about Ten o'Clock in the Morning; and she said it was her Son's Watch, and she was willing to have something to remember him, if she never saw him any more.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Woolmer Lodge, Hampshire. At the time in question I was staying with my father at Blackheath—I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper referring to some horses—I will not be quite certain as to the date—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the Times newspaper</hi>)—it was an adver<lb></lb>tisement to this effect—I had occasion to buy smile horses at that time, and on seeing the advertisement, I went to Gloucester-mews, Montague-square—I was there shown two horses and a mare by the younger prisoner, George Ward—on going into the stable, I inquired of the younger prisoner, before the elder came in, whether the two horses and mare then in the stable were the horses advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper, which I produced—he said they were, that he had the care of the horses, and that they belonged to a third party, who had sent them for sale on commission to the elder prisoner, stating his name to be Mr. Ward—from about twenty minutes to half an hour after, the elder prisoner came into the stable—I inquired about the horses, and the elder prisoner told me they were sent to him by a family of the name of Lloyd, that he had long known that family, that they lived near Stratford-upon-Avon, and that on the decease of the elder member of that family, these horses had been sent for sale, as they wished to have ponies instead—it had been stated by one and both of them that the two smaller horses had been driven together, and that the larger horse had been driven in a clarence, or brougham—at the time I was having this conversation with the elder prisoner, the younger one was in the stable, and within hearing—I agreed to purchase the three horses for 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—gave a check on Messrs. Glynn and Co. for that amount—this is the check—at the time I gave that check I had cash to that amount in the hands of Messrs. Glynn—it has been returned to me as paid—I received this receipt at the time—this was either a little before or after twelve o'clock in the morning, but I was there a considerable time talking about the horses, and seeing them out—I left about two—the elder prisoner handed me the receipt, not in the presence of the other—there was a small counting-house attached to the stables, in which he delivered it to me—I should say the terms of the receipt</p>

               <p>were not arranged in the presence of both the prisoners—I should say I was addressing the elder prisoner only—the terms were arranged entirely with the elder prisoner—I do not know that the younger prisoner heard what the horses were to be sold for, but he told me that 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been offered for the larger horse, and he thought something about that price would be taken—that was at some period before the sale took place, and I rather think it was before the elder prisoner came into the stable—(<hi rend="italic">Receipt read</hi>, "Received, July 9, 1844, of William Angerstein, Esq., 110 guineas, for two bay geldings, and a bay mare; all warranted sound, quiet to ride, and quiet in double or single harness, and if not approved of at the expiration of seven days, the whole or either to be returned, and the money refunded,—<hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE HENRY WARD</hi>.")—there being three horses, and having my servant with me, who was riding behind me, I was obliged to get somebody to help my servant in taking them up to the Veterinary College, and I employed the younger prisoner to do that—my servant took the horses to the Veterinary College, in company with the younger prisoner—before that he told me his name was George Glass—he also stated that as the horses were sold he should lose his situation, and I agreed to take him to assist my servant in taking the horses down to Blackheath, and I also said he should remain in my stable till I could get a permanent helper—he acquiesced in the arrange<lb></lb>ment of going down to Blackheath, but he said he could not stay, because, a relation of his had died at Doncaster, and had left him money which he must look after—I got a report from the Veterinary College, I should say between four and five o'clock, and in consequence of that report I told my servant to take the horses from the college, to take them back to the stables from whence they came, and leave them there, and I gave him a letter at the same time—next morning, about eleven o'clock, I went with my solicitor to the stables—neither of the prisoners were there—I cannot tell whether the horses were there—the stables were locked—this was on the 10th of July—on the 26th of Aug. I was taken by the police to a mews near Fitzroy-square, to identify the horses—they were all there—the prisoners were then in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Mr. Prior's coachman. I knew from my father that Mr. Prior wanted a horse—I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper, and on the 24th of Aug. I went to Fitzroy-mews—I saw a person there who appeared to be a helper at the stables—he brought the younger prisoner there—I asked him if those were the horses that were for sale—lie said "Yes"—I saw the bay gelding—he wished me to see the horses out—I saw them out, and said I thought one was most likely to suit Mr. Prior—he said they belonged to a widow lady at Stratford-on-Avon, and that his master was just dead—he did not tell me the name of the widow lady—I asked him the price of the bay gelding, and he told me fifty guineas—he said his mistress had written for them to be sold, and he thought they might be bought for much less—I went from thence and told my father.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the professors at the Veterinary College, Camden-town. I have been connected with the college for the last fourteen years—I remember these two horses and the mare being brought to the col<lb></lb>lege to be examined on the 9th of July—I examined them—they were all unsound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did the unsoundness consist of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The larger gelding was defective in his respiration, what is termed a roarer—he also had spavin in the hocks, and was vicious when mounted to ride—the other gelding was unsound from chronic lameness in the off fore-leg, and the mare was unsound from lameness in both fore-feet, and she had all the nerves of both fore-legs divided—that was done to prevent the sense of pain—the mare and larger gelding were six years old, and the smaller gelding was about eight years old.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Advertisement read</hi>.)—"For sale, three superior horses; first, a pair of bay phaeton horses, 15 hands 1 inch high, remarkably handsome, and nearly thorough bred; match well together, have both carried ladies, and very clever in saddle; also go well in double or single harness. Second, a bay gelding, well adapted for a brougham or <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; all warranted sound: a liberal trial granted to ride or drive.

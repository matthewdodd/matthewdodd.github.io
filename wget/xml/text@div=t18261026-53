On the 11th of October, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was at my own door, and heard a woman had been knocked down - I have lived in that neighbourhood six or seven years - I knew the prisoner by sight; I have merely spoken to him; he is a cobbler - I saw him in the street with a knife in his hand - I went up to him, and told him he had better put it away; I then laid hold of his arm, and he stabbed me in the left thigh; and after that I had hold of his right shoulder, trying to take the knife from him - he shook himself out of my hands - I got my arm round his neck, and tried to throw him down - he then stabbed me in the right thigh. I was stunned, and fainted away immediately; I tried to take the knife from him, because I heard he had knocked a woman down and stahbed her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell you I had been robbed, and wounded in my breast? A. He did not say so to me - I saw no wound in his breast - I cannot say what happened before I saw him; he appeared sober.</p>

            . I am a pensioner of Chelsea-college. I was in Turk's-row, and met the prisoner about a hundred yards from White-lion-street, coming out of a little alley, with a shoemaker's knife in his hand - I saw no blood on him - I said, "Are you an Irishman?" he said, "No, d-n you, what do you do with me?" - he seized me, and attempted to stab me - he cut my coat and breeches, but I got from him; I saw nobody doing any thing to provoke him; he said nothing about being robbed - I went directly to the constable - he declined coming, but told me to get a warrant. I went back, and saw him going towards the market-place, with the knife in his hand, swearing velemently if anybody should interrupt him, he would run their g-ts out; I had not been absent a quarter of an hour. Knight stood at the corner, with two or three other men: I said that man would injure somebody, it was a pity he was not taken up - Knight went forward, laid his hand on his left shoulder, and told him to throw the knife out of his hand - he said he would not - Knight took hold of his right shoulder; he then stabbed him with great force - Knight still held him, and tried to get him down; he endeavoured to catch him inside the thigh - Knight then got from him: he was swearing in the most unbecoming manner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you knock me down? A. Yes, after you had stabbed Knight twice - you had no wound in your breast, and said nothing about being robbed - he appeared perfectly sober, but in a passion.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I saw the prisoner with a drawn knife in his hand in Turk's-row; I saw nobody ill-use him; a good many people were round him, but not ill-using him - I saw him strike an old woman who met him; she had done nothing whatever to him - I did not hear him complain of being ill-used - I was not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260044"></xptr>near enough to hear what he might say - I saw him wound Knight, who had done nothing but try to get the knife from him.</p>

            . I am a constable. John Gorman came and showed me his thumb, which was bleeding - he said the prisoner was brandishing a knife about - it was a trifling cut; I could not leave my shop then; soon after the prisoner himself came to my door with the knife in his hand; he appeared in great agitation, and told me to come with him, or he would get a magistrate - he did not complain of being ill-used, or say what he wanted; he seemed in a rage of passion - I told him to go about his business; he was afterwards given into my custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell you I had been robbed? A. No; he said something before the magistrate about being left in charge of a house - I saw no wound in his breast before to-day.</p>
               <p>JOHN GORMAN re-examined. He complained to the magistrate of being wounded in the breast; he was not wounded when I met him - he must have done it in struggling - I saw it bleeding when before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. After complaining to an officer, who is not here, I was going home - they knocked me down, and knocked the knife out of my hand - I could not see where I was going, I am so blind - I was all over dirt - I cannot now see any body before me - I had been left in care of a house; four men came in, and threw me on the floor.</p>

I felt somebody at my pocket, but did not mind it: my wife was behind me: she said, Barrwick, you have lost your handkerchief, and there is the thief: I went to lay hold of him, he ran away: I cried, stop thief: he was stopped: it was the prisoner at the bar. The next evidence can give a farther account.</p>

            . I was going through the Poultry at that time: I heard the cry of, Stop thief, on the other side of the way, and saw a croud of people: I went over, and saw the prisoner in the middle of them: I observed him pull off his coat, and at the same time, a man stooped and took up a handkerchief, which the prosecutor said was his property.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. We had been to Westminster: coming along the Poultry, the prisoner was several times behind me, he trod my shoe down behind: my husband pulled out his handkerchief with his left hand, and wiped his face; when he had put it in his pocket, the prisoner came on his left-hand side; he putted my husband's handkerchief; I saw him do it. I said, Barrwick, you have lost your handkerchief, and that is the person that has got it: my husband catched at the prisoner: he ran cross the Poultry, and was soon stopped.</p>

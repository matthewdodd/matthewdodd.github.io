               Burglary and stealing several Goods

               not guilty
            </rs>; but another woman arraigned with her, convicted, and burnt in the hand for it. However the said woman standing obstinately mute to her first Indictment, notwithstanding all the perswasions of Master Sheriff, and the Ordinary representing to her that she drew her blood upon her own head, the Court was forced to that terrible Judgment, that she should be pressed to death; and accordingly she was carried forthwith to Newgate in order to such Execution.</p>

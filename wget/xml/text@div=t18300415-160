            . I am a Police-officer. On the 11th of March, at a quarter-past eight o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Fox-lane, Shadwell; two women fetched me to No. 43, Spring-street, at the back of Fox-lane, to a back-room on the ground floor; the prisoner was in bed - I told her I was informed she had robbed a gentleman of his watch and some sovereigns; she said she knew nothing of it - I asked for her pocket, which she gave me, and I found in it this pouch, which contained 14s. 9 1/2d., and five duplicates; I told her she must go with me - she hesitated; the landlord came up, removed the bed clothes, and I saw the watch in the bed; she said if I would stand on one side, she would get up, and take me to a house where I could put my hand on nine sovereigns and a gold pin; I went with her to No. 22, Martha-street - she took me to a room, and said, nine sovereigns and the pin were near the looking-glass, but there were none there; I had not then mentioned about the pin - I had not known it was lost.</p>

On the 11th of March she came home with the prosecutor; I went to bed - she afterwards came and asked me to get her something to drink; I said it was too late - she came down again, and asked a young man to get her something; he said he could at the night-house - she gave him 1s.; he said that was not enough, as he meant to have a glass himself; she went up again, brought down something, and put into his hand - I do not know what it was; he then went out, and I went to sleep - she came down again, shook me, and said, "Is Mark come back?" I said, "I don't know;" she said, "He is a long while gone, I will go and look for him, and leave the door open, as he has taken the key;" I said, "Don't some one may come in."</p>

I met the prosecutor, who went home with me - he gave me his watch to take care of till morning; he then put his hand into his pocket, and gave me a sovereign, and 2s to send for some liquor - I gave the 2s. to a man to get some liquor, he did not return, and I went to him - I sat drinking most part of the night; I changed the sovereign, and spent part of it - when he saw I was drunk, he went away and left me; I could not find my way home - I went to a sailor's wife, and went to bed there; I took the watch out of my pocket, and laid it by my side, where the officer found it - the pin and neck handkerchief were on the table when I left the room.</p>

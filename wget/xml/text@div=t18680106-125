                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 187, Cannon Street Road—on Wednesday night, 18th December, I closed my house at nine o'clock, and saw it all safe at eleven o'clock—I had then thirteen rolls of cloth, six coats, and four or five pairs of trousers safe—about eight a.m. on the 19th my attention was called to a hole in the roof of my workshop, which com<lb></lb>municates with the shop, but not with the house—a rope was suspended from a beam, and a pair of my workmen's trousers were lying at the bottom of the rope to make it easy to ascend and descend—several shelves were empty, and I missed thirteen rolls of cloth, value about 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., six coats, and six pairs of trousers—I saw them on the following Saturday—my house is in the parish of St. George's-in-the-East.</p>

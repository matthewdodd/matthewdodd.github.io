On the 4th of December the prisoner, in company with his brother, called at my house to look at a chaise - he left his card for me to call on him; I went to a public-house, which he then kept, and saw him, and his brother - I wanted 28l. for the chaise; his brother said 25l. was as fair price he offered - a 20l. bill, at two months, and 5l. in spirits or wines - I agreed to take it, and it was to be ready on the second day following - he called at my house then with a saddle horse, but the chaise was not ready-he brought me a 22l. bill, which was accepted, and said he thought it better to give me three sovereigns instead of my taking spirits or wines - I said I must inquire about the bill, unless his brother would endorse it - he was very angry at that, and said he would give me a bill of his own - it was at last agreed that I was to have the three sovereigns - I was to inquire about the bill, and if it was good I was to leave the chaise with him at four o'clock; I went to Westminster to inquire about the bill; he watched me out, and before I had been gone half an hour he took the chaise out - I went to Westminster and inquired of a person who knew the parties; he said the bill was good for nothing - the prisoner said I was to take the chaise home at four o'clock, as he was going to Barnet to look at some corn for his father.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Where is the bill? A. Here it is - it is on a person named Lane; I went to two respectable tradesmen who knew the parties well - I passed the bill to the hands of a Mr. Clark, with whom I do business - Mr. Clark is dead, but his wife gave me the bill up; when I wanted money, I was in the habit of borrowing of Mr. Clark; I owned him 100l. once; I passed the bill into his hands for the purpose of presenting it - I went before the Magistrate at Queen-square; the case was not dismissed as a charge of felony; the prisoner brought the acceptor of the bill, and the Magistrate said it must stand over till the bill became due- I went again when the bill became due - the prisoner was then in the King's Bench, and the Magistrate said I must consider it as a bad debt - the officer told him it was a case that had been heard before - the acceptor of the bill was brought there on the first hearing, to say it was a good bill, and would be paid when due - I told he Magistrate I considered it no debt at all - it was fraud and felony - the Magistrate afterwards advised me to bring him up by Habeas, which being expensive, I would not do - I put it into the hands of Clark; after I was told I must consider it as a bad debt I received a notice under the Insolvent Debtor's Act - I opposed him for fraud and felony - he was not remanded at my suit - he gave a fale notice to come on the 24th of May, and his notice was dated the 28th of May - I appeared on teh second examination, and told the Commissioners I had taken proceedings - I was not sworn as a witness - I entered in the book my intention of opposing his discharge - I heard the judgment of the Court against the prisoner - I did not hear that he was remanded for eight calendar months at the suit of John Evans, for a debt of 22l. - I have been to him in prison - I found him in custody for debt - I did not ask him then for payment - I did not say, "Will you pay me now?" nor did he reply, "I cannot pay you now, as it would be giving you an undue preference" - I did not speak to him - I did not tell his brother that if the bill was paid I would not take any step at all - his brother came and offered a bill of 15l. - I know Mr. Lane lives where the bill was payable - no action has been commenced against him - I could have arrested him, but I did not consider it a debt - I owed Mr. Clark money, and I told him the nature of the case - if he had got the money he would have paid himself - he was to take his account out - he did not sue Lane - it was not considered a debt - there was a cushion taken from another chaise.</p>

            . I went to Mr. Evan's shop one Monday morning; the prisoner said, "I am glad you are come, there are some jobs to do to the chaise" - he then said, "Never mind, it can be done at home," and while I was up stairs he pushed it out, or it was taken out, and the cushion of another chaise was taken at the same time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear you did not say that the cushion belonging to the gig was repairing, and it should be sent home? A. I cannot recollect - I might have said so; I do not know whether we have the proper cushion now.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. The cushion belonging to this chaise wanted fresh covering, and the prisoner said he could take the cushion of a phaeton - I said he must not have that, very likely it would be wanted - while I was on the stairs he took it, put it into the chaise, and said I might have it in the morning.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY to MR. EVANS. Q. Did not you see the prisoner after this? A. Yes, at his own house; he told me to leave his house, and I went to Queen-square.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What became of the chaise? A. I saw it standing at Westminster for sale; the prisoner sold it the day before he went to prison - I was told he went on the 18th of January.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That was six weeks after? A. Yes - the bill was never presented for payment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor came to my house on the 5th of December, and said he had a second-hand gig for sale - he waited two hours, and urged me; I agreed to give him a 22l. bill on Mr. Lane, and 3l. in money - I was to go on the 7th of December, and it was to be delivered to me at ten o'clock in the morning; he took the bill - I endorsed it, and gave him 3l.; I lost an action in the King's Bench, and not having means to pay, I was forced to go through the Insolvent Court - the prosecutor came to me and said, "The bill is due, do you intend to pay it;" I said, "Mr. Lane owes the money" - he said, "I will oppose you, and you shall have twelve months;" he met me going in, and said, "If you will pay the bill, I will not go in, I will put off the indictment I have against you, and if you don't, I will oppose you now, and at the Old Bailey;" I said, "it is not in my power to pay you, if my friends like to do any thing with you, it is their concern" - he went in, and I was remanded for eight months; the man who says he was up stairs, was there at the time, and I asked if he would have something to drink, and gave him 1s. for half a pint of gin - he said, "You can have that cushion till the evening, and I will bring yours down."</p>

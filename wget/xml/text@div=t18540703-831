                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Cromer-street. On 10th June the prisoner came for a slice of bacon—I think it came to about 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a shilling—I noticed it—it was a bad one—I put it into my pocket, where I had no other money—the prisoner went away, and she came again in the evening and wanted more bacon—she said she found it so good she hoped it was not all sold—she had some, and she gave me another bad shilling—I told her so—she said she did not know it, and she would go home and come back directly—she went home and came back, and brought a penny to pay for the sugar, but she could not pay for the bacon—she said she would come for that when her husband came home—I sent for a con<lb></lb>stable and gave him her address—he went and took her.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, E</hi> 157). I was in Cromer-street—I went to Mr. Borley's, and he directed me to go to a house—I went, and the pri<lb></lb>soner refused to let me in—I put my foot against the door and broke it open—I found the prisoner in the room, and no one else—I told her what she was charged with—she refused knowing anything about the two bad shillings, and she refused at the station knowing anything at all about them—the next day, at Clerkenwell, she told me her nephew had given it to her, and she was in very great distress or she would not have done it.</p>

I lost six geese on the 22nd of August; I had seen them on the day before - I have seen two geese since, but I cannot swear to them - they were white ones, and ours were all white - they correspond in size - I went to the watch-house, and found the prisoner there, with two geese that morning; he had been employed by my uncle - I have seen him in the stables, the premises are surrounded by a wall six feet high, with spikes at the top.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. On the 21st of August, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the geese were all safe; there is no fastening to either of the doors of the kitchen where they were; I went out about five or half-past five o'clock in the morning; I found the pond had been dragged for fish, and I saw blood on four separate places at the end of the pond; I have seen the two white geese - one of them has a particular claw, which I had marked, as being one of the two small ones which I had kept back - I had twenty-five of them, and sent them up as they were wanted - they were dead when I saw them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the mark? A. A hole in the claw - the Magistrate asked how I knew them; I said one had a topping on it; I said so at the watch-house, that I could swear to one of them; I do not know that I was asked about the feet - I went to prove the property; I do not suppose the Magistrate asked me how I knew them - one of the gentlemen asked me some questions - I do not know that I was asked to swear to the geese - I will not swear to the colour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you mean by saying you would not swear to the colour? A. They were mostly all white.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner near Paddington, at five o'clock on Sunday morning, with a basket; I asked what he had - he said a hock of bacon and a bit of bread; I collared him - he said he would go with me, and I let him go; he ran into the canal up to his waist, ran down two hundred yards, and then trampled the basket under his feet in the canal; my brother officer took him, and I got a boat - a person

             the basket out with a stick; I took it to the watch-house, and found in it one small goose and one large one - one with the head off and one on; they were quite warm, and appeared lately killed- I afterwards saw the witness; I do not recollect that he gave me any description of the geese before he saw them - I produce the legs of the geese.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he describe them after he saw them? A. I did not hear him say any thing about them - I asked the prisoner where he brought the basket from; he said from Stone-bridge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was at large for six hours. Witness., My brother officer took him to the watch-house, and the inspector sent him back with the officer to find the property - he went into the water to find it, but could not; I went into the boat and got it, and the prisoner walked away - some of the men were to give him a glass of gin; he was taken the same morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did your brother officer make the slightest attempt to prevent his going? A. No.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you certain it was the same basket? A. Yes - I never left the spot till I found it.</p>

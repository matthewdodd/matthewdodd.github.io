I live at 93, Graham Street, City Road, and am the widow of Charles Holmes—on 21st June about 1.30 in the afternoon he left home in his usual health—the next I heard of him he was in Bartholo<lb></lb>mew's Hospital—I went there to him about 8.30—he came out and tried to walk a little way, and then fell faint—I took him home in a cab, and he went to bed, and stayed in bed till the 23rd—he then became insensible</p>

I live at 14, Stent Street, City Road—on Monday evening, 21st June, about 8.10, I saw a crowd outside my door, and the prisoner with a pocket knife open in his hand—I took it from him, and in doing so accidentally cut my thumb—I gave the knife to his cousin, who was standing by.</p>

I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—on the night of 21st June Holmes was brought there—he had a cut over the left eyebrow, about three inches long, and about an inch deep—it was superficial, because it was an oblique cut—the wound had been dressed and strapped—I undid it and examined it—it was a clean cut wound; such as might be inflicted with a clasp knife—I dressed the wound and sent him home, telling him to come next day—he seemed to be the worse for drink—I did not see him again till the 26th, when he was brought in in a delirious condition—after a day's treatment he became better—next day he relapsed, and gradually became worse, and died on 1st July—I assisted in a postmortem examination—I found considerable inflammation over almost the whole of the base of the brain, traceable to a clot in a vein near the wound; that was the cause of death—I think that was due to the wound—there was nothing else to account for it.</p>

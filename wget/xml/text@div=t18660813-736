                  </hi> (Policeman T 68). At half-past eight o'clock on the 14th July I was on duty at Twickenham—from information I received, I went to the "Rising Sun," and there found the prisoner in the custody of some men, who said that he had stabbed a man—I went into the yard, and there saw the prosecutor, who was bleeding very much from the thigh—the prisoner was with me, and the prosecutor said, "That is the man that stabbed me"—the prisoner said nothing, but when at the station he said, "I will give you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if you will allow me to go out the back way"—the next morning he said, "I had been knocked about most terribly, and I took out the knife to intimidate the mob, who was knocking me about. I had no intention of doing any one an injury"—from the prisoner's appear<lb></lb>ance, I should say he had been knocked about very much—he had two black eyes, his mouth was cut, and he had lost both his coat tails.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at No. 5, Albert Street, St. Leonard's Road, Poplar, and am a hammerman—on the 14th July I went with a party of friends to Hampton Court, and when we were returning, about eight o'clock, we stopped at the "Rising Sun," Twickenham—we went into the bar, and ordered some refreshment, after which I went into the yard—two minutes afterwards some one said, "Beware of that man, he has got a knife"—I turned round and saw the prisoner with a knife in his hand, and before I had time to move he stabbed me in the left thigh—I fell into a man's arms, and said, "Oh! he has stabbed me"—I was taken to a private house, and on Sunday night was removed home—I am still under medical treatment, and am very weak from the loss of blood.</p>

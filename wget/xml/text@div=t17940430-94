I told him I had, he said he was recommended to me from Mr. Price, over the way, to sell a parcel of juniper berries, which he had bought of a captain of a ship; I looked at them, and see they were not fit for the scale, they might do for distillers; I asked him what quantity he had? he said he had twenty hundred weight, at eleven and six-pence per hundred; he called a few days afterwards, and said, that he had got some more from the same captain, and on the same recommendation we took them also, and continued that from different periods, till I took thirty-seven hundred weight, from the 3d of December, to the middle of January; we weighed them, and they weighed on an average, an hundred weight in a bag, one with another.</p>

               <p>Q. To Taplin. Where did you get that sack? - From under the stairs in a closet, between the hours of five and six, the time that the prisoners were in the house; I went in company with Griffiths the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any thing said by the prisoners when you took that? - No.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot say that that sack is mine.</p>
               <p>Kirk. I have got some sacks four of which Mr. Cunden gave to me about the beginning of March, I had no other sacks in my house but these four.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did Mr. Cunden tell you how long he had had these sacks? They were very old sacks, were they not? - They were old rubbishing sacks laying about the floor.</p>
               <p>Cunden. The four bags that I gave to Kirk were what I received of the prisoner, I cannot speak to the mark of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Whether these had been in your warehouse before or after Christmas you cannot tell? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Here is a bag I have no doubt belonging to me because I marked it myself, I marked it with an F in black ink, here are six bags in all.</p>
               <p>Kirk. I brought two bags besides the four that Mr. Cunden gave me in all they make six, this one marked F was given me by Mr. Cunden.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Have you ever sold any with that mark? - I don't think that I have, I had a great quantity of things to bring from on board of a ship, and I got up all the bags I could, and I remember this one going on board a ship to be filled, and if it did not come back Carter must have stole it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Cunden. You never took any particular notice of the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. That bag if it ever was in your warehouse probably came there before Christmas? - It might, I cannot say whether it came before or after.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. You say you believed that that bag has been out of your possession? - It certainly has been out of my possession or else Mr. Cunden would not have had it.</p>
               <p>Q.Certainly it also has been out of your possession in the course of your trade? - Never till it went out at that time on board of ship.</p>
               <p>Q. That letter F may of course be found on many bags? - It may, but I marked this myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300152"></xptr>Q. You yourself parted with a number of bags marked with F. - We sent a number of bags on board, and amongst which was this one marked F. I sent, I suppose, about a hundred on ship board; as to the juniper berries, it would be difficult for any man to swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact you have never found any berries at Mr. Cunden's? - I have never been at Mr. Cunden's, but Mr. Cunden brought a sample before my Lord Mayor, that I should think were of the same quality of mine, being damaged berries, some oil having got among them.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not taken stock from Christmas 1793? - No, not from Christmas 1792, and I had not taken stock in March, if it had not been for this information.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. How long had Cooke been in your service? - About six or seven months. Carter has never been my servant, I don't know that he ever had access to them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was informed Mr. Fonblanque, that you would with to make up your damage, and therefore you employed a parcel of soldiers, in order to weigh your stock; while these soldiers were weighing your stock, you was up stairs in the counting house; they called the weights, and as they called the weights, you put them down on a bit of paper; you took the weights from their assertion, and never saw the weights they alledged to you, and soldiers are men that know a little about half hundred weights, as many that are here know about pounds.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw the greatest part weighed myself if not the whole, and I have made on allowance of almost twenty hundred weigh.</p>

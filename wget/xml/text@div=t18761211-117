                  </hi>. I am a general agent, of 1, Bull and Mouth Street—I know both the prisoners; Ralph from about the middle of May this year—I became acquainted with Leconte from his apparent business connectional at Westmoreland Buildings; he was there when I saw Ralph—I had two transactions—Lecomte was not there during the actual purchase of the goods—I sold some goods to Ralph on 15th May—I only saw Lecomte when they could not pay—I wanted Lecomte to give me some goods instead of money—he said that certain goods which were coming to England should be given in payment of our account—he did not actually say that he was one of the firm—when I did not see Ralph I saw Lecomte and he assumed authority—on one occasion he produced a letter and said that he could not hand over the goods until they had actually arrived—as far as I am con<lb></lb>cerned, they never did arrive; if they did we never got them—Ralph bought from me in the name of Victor &amp; Co.</p>

                  </hi>. I first became acquainted with the prisoners about two years ago; they had an office in Burleigh Street, Covent Garden, and another in Crutched Friars—they were carrying on a commission business under the name of Lecomte &amp; Co.—I sold to them in both places—I was intro<lb></lb>duced to Ralph as Leconte by a friend in the first instance—he represented himself as a member of the firm—I have always known Ralph as Lecomte and Lecomte as his brother—I have met them frequently in business—they were entered in the Business Directory at both addresses—this was in the month of August, 1874—the last date I knew anything of them was February, 1875, but not in Burleigh Street; they had given up that—I lost sight of them in Crutched Friars.</p>

I received a warrant on 3rd November, for the apprehension of both prisoners, and on 10th November they were brought to the Snow Hill station—I said to Ralph "Mr. Ralph?"—he said "That is my name"—I then said to Lecomte "Mr. Victor"—he said "No, my name is Lecomte"—the warrant was read to them and they made no reply to the charge—they were afterwards seen by Hawkins, who identified them—I then said to Lecomte "This is the young man from Peter Robinson's, he is the person who gave you the goods, and you gave him a check"—he said that the check was given by the direction of Mr. Victor—I found nothing on them relating to the charge.</p>

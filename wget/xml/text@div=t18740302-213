I am a clothier, of 66, Cable Street, St. George's—on 20th February I saw the house securely fastened, and went to bed at 11 o'clock—the shop window was in good repair and the shutter was up—there were two watches, a pair of boots, and six shirts in the window—I was roused by a neighbour at 1 o'clock and found a policeman there—the shop window had been broken, one of the shutters had been pulled down, and I missed the articles from the window—they could be reached by a man putting his hand through the broken glass—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the boots I missed.</p>

I am an assistant letter sorter; I was going home from mid-night duty, heard a smash, and saw three men run from the side of Mr. Rosenberg's shop—the prisoners are two of them—Driscoll ran down a passage, I chased Anderson and the other man right along Cable Street, shouting at the top of my voice; a policeman joined me, we were running fast, Anderson fell back into a doorway and we passed him, but we went back and took him—I am sure he is one of the men who ran from the shop, I never lost sight of him—Driscoll was dressed about the same as he is now.</p>

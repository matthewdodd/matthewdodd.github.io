In July last, the prisoner came and said she had recommended my house to old Mr. and Mrs. Varley, her husband's father and mother - that they wanted a great many things; and first, they would have some silk handkerchiefs and stockings to choose from- I had my bonnet on, and was going out - I told my young woman to show the handkerchiefs - she said they were to be shown to Mr. and Mrs. Varley, and to be returned if not approved - she came several times, and at last I began to have some suspicion.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Has not she been in the habit of dealing at your house for some years? A. Yes; since October, 1831 - either she or her husband paid for the goods she had - she asked for the running credit of twelve months, which she had, and paid soon after Christmas, but it was of small amount - we entered the goods she had in the waste book, which is here - I entered these goods to Mrs. Varley, but supposing it was for old Mrs. Varley - this entry was similar to the previous entries - I made out a bill of parcels to Mrs. Varley - I did not write"Old Mrs. Varley's."</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Would you have let her have these things for herself? A. No, not in any way; her entries before this were not more than 8l. in a year - I knew old Mr. and Mrs. Varley by report, and one of the parcels was directed to Pangbourn, near Reading.</p>

            . I was in the prosecutrix's shop when the prisoner came for these things - I heard her say she had recommended Mrs. Porter to Mr. Varley, of Pangbourn, and she wished to have some handkerchiefs and other things - Mrs. Porter was going out, and I made up the order - I offered to send it, but she took it away herself - the goods were to be taken back or exchanged, if not approved by old Mr. and Mrs. Varley - the next day, she came again - she said two of the silk handkerchiefs were not approved of, and she looked out seven others - she wanted some more of the stockings, but we had none - she came again, and went on dealing, till the bill came to 25l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You entered the goods to Mrs. Varley? A. Yes, as we had before; and I gave her a memorandum of them, as she said they would want to know the price - I knew they were not for her.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My husband's disgraceful conduct was the cause of my pawning these things - I was privately married to him, but his conduct in going with other females was such that I could not live with him - the man Varley, now in Court, persuaded his son to abscond and leave me destitute; and, on my demanding a maintenance, he promised, on my retiring into Wales, to allow me the vast sum of 20l. a year - I went there; but on my applying to a bank, through which it was to be remitted, he, to my great surprise, refused this 20l. a year, pretending it was not due - my friends then persuaded me to return, and reside near his country seat, till he felt inclined to perform his promise, and send me this handsome settlement of 20l. a year - I went and resided at a little cottage, near his country seat - but finding he would do nothing for me, I went to Mrs. Porter, who let me have the things; but as she had given me twelve months' credit before, I thought I should have time to pay her - I thought, as I had the good had a right to do what I pleased with them - my chief prosecutor would not send me what he promised, though his son got in debt with other women, and it was all laid on my shoulders; and so destitute has my husband left me, that when I go out, I should not know where to turn for a home, nor where to go for a sixpence.</p>

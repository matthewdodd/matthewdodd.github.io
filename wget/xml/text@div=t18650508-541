                  </hi>. I live at 65, Warwick-street, Pimlico, and keep a school—my husband is a clerk at Mudie's Library—I remember the fire—I spoke to the prisoner about it on 19th April—I first spoke to her about taking some money from the pocket of my sister's dress, which she admitted—I then said, "Well, it is well for you that you have confessed that; it is forgiven concerning the money, but if you have caused the house to burn make so reply; if not, tell me so, and I will believe you"—she said, "I have not done so"—I wished her "Good night," and we each retired to rest.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Here are your depositions; have not you said this, "On the following Saturday she made a statement I had told her previously that it would be better for her to tell the truth, and I had said, 'Do not add sin to sin; it will only make the matter worse!'" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never said that it would make the matter worse—I have said that if she had done anything wrong, it would be better to tell the truth—I told the Magistrate that I said she had better tell the truth on every subject—I have said so perhaps thirty times, and after she had confessed it I said, "Mary you had better tell"—I had not said on the Saturday that it would be better for her to tell the truth about the fire; I had about the money, but it was all within a few minutes—I did not tell the Magistrate that those words applied to the fire.</p>

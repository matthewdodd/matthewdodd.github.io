               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any shopman? A. I have not now, because I was obliged to discharge him - I ought to have been aware if the shopman had sold any thing to the prisoner, as it ought to have been entered in his book; I sent him away because he was connected with the prisoner - I had reason to doubt his honesty; he may have sold articles to the prisoner - I have been at the bazaar, but never saw such saucepans as these there; they sold cast iron saucepans - I complained to the merchants in the City that these were too heavy, and they made wrought iron ones - they have sold enamelled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090065"></xptr>saucepans there; they were forwarded to me, and I was told they came from the bazaar, but they were cast iron - Batty, the shopman I discharged, is in court now; I think I dismissed him about a month ago - it was the same day as I gave the prisoner into custody; I came home and dismissed him in five minutes - I did not subject him to any search; I called him up to a room privately, and said I did not wish to expose him, but I had discovered some property at Whyte's; I told him to leave my house, or in one hour I would not answer for his not being in Newgate - he had been with me about nine years, and the prisoner about two years and a half; I have a customer named Calkam - I do not remember sending the prisoner to him; Mr. Calkam did complain of what in his estimation was an overcharge, I think it was ten pounds, more or less, a trifle, and upon investigation I believe about seven pounds were found to be an error - the recollection I have of the transaction is, that the prisoner stated Mr. Calkam had made an objection to the charge, and upon investigation great portion of it was found to be an error; and I believe the observation I made to the prisoner was, "It is a sad pity this error has arisen, but I think the best way will be for you to go and state that it is your error in making out the bill;" it was on ascertaining the error that I advised that - I remember there was some conversation, and the purport of it was, "I think you had better say it was your mistake, that the business may be settled;" if the error had not been detected the money would have gone into my pocket of course, but if it had been detected by me it would have been returned - it certainly was my business to investigate how the error took place; the prisoner told me be had married a woman with three children, and he had had one since - the only article which I recollect that he offered to account for was a tea-tray in his kitchen, which he offered to show me the bill of, and I did not take that; he had some papers, and I think one was a bill of the Carron company.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these bills and say if you did not claim as your property some articles for which these are the bills of parcels? A. I have looked at them, and I select some bills, which as far as my memory serves, I did see in searching his drawer or desk - the other bills I have no knowledge of; but, Sir, there is not one individual article which is stated in any one of those invoices, which I took up and said was my property - I do not recollect any one article which I claimed as mine for which he produced an invoice; we are continually selling tea-pots of the same metal as these, and all these other articles, but then the book will prove the transaction - I have the cash-book here, which was kept by the shopman whom I dismissed; my own mark is not erased from articles when we sell them - the prisoner's wife and children were at his house; I should think the youngest child to be twelve or fifteen months old.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you been a trader in the City of London? A. Twenty-four years - I have occasionally had one, two, or three shops; I have carried on an extensive business, and I believe have been well known - I had no quarrel with the prisoner to induce me to go to his house and lay a false accusation against him; I had two or three times had some conversation with him about debts received - I had reason enough in my own mind to turn Batty away; I am not in the habit of making out accounts, and therefore I presume the clerk made out Mr. Calkam's account - I make up the books, and they make abstracts from them - the error must have been my own; I have done business with Mr. Calkam since - the officer brought away from the prisoner's some screws, and some little trifles which I could not swear to, but they are not in the indictment; two of these tea-pots have my mark on them - this cock has no mark on it, but it is a particular article; the prisoner did not offer to produce invoices of any of the articles I brought away - he did not account for the receipt stamps; here is a flush ring for a water-closet which I had made for me - these things were all in my shop while the prisoner was there, and he had daily access to them.</p>

            . I am an officer of Union-hall. I went with Mr. Marriott to search the prisoner's lodgings; I found the articles mentioned in the indictment, and I have them with me - Mr. Marriott looked carefully and cautiously over the things, and I told him to be very particular; there were some things from which the marks had been erased - some of them were brought away and some left; what were brought away are put down in the indictment - there were four tea-pots; the place was not at all like a shop - there were four rooms and a kitchen; these articles were in the kitchen and different parts of the house.</p>
               <p>MR. MARRIOTT. These are the articles found at the prisoner's house - this tea-pot and this canister have my marks on them; these two tea-pots are so scratched that there is no discovering the mark - this is the German saucepan; I never saw such a one till I had them made of wrought iron - those from the bazaar were all cast iron; this is the cock of a pattern I had made for myself - I do not know that I ever saw such a one in any other person's possession; it is manufactured at Birmingham or Woolverhampton, to my own pattern - these are the receipt stamps; they are engraved from a plate of my own, and were in a drawer in my counting-house, which is open to my clerk and myself - these have never been issued by me; they are the writing of different persons - this one is "Received of Mr. Whyte (the prisoner) the sum of 3l., on account of bill delivered. E. and C. Steele." - I never had any dealings with a person of that name; here is another, "Received of Mr. Whyte the sum of 5l., for one quarter's rent of a house in Kennington-street, due at Christmas last. B. Stevens." here is another of a Mr. Burton, and some others - these could never have been given on my account; I never had any such dealings with any such persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has not Mr. Weiss such articles as these flush rings? A. I never saw any of these things have a spring to them; my foreman suggested the propriety of having them made as this is, and I had them made so - I never saw any like these; I have not the facsimile stamp here of these receipts. [Here the witness pointed out the private-marks on several of the goods.]</p>

            . I am in the employ of a pawnbroker in the Westminster-road. Here is a pair of snuffers, a tea-tray, and a tea-pot, which Mr. Marriott swears to, and some other things, which he does not swear to; they were all pawned by the prisoner, on the 10th of November, in the name of John Wilson, for 8s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known him before? A. No; I never saw him before - they were pawned at night; I cannot speak positively as to whether any one else was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090066"></xptr>the shop - I think it was seven o'clock or half-past seven; I partly remember his dress - I cannot say whether he had a coat and breeches on; I think my employer was in the shop, engaged in some part of the business; there were other persons in the shop - there are customers in the shop nearly all day; there might have been four or five in the shop - he was in the shop five or six minutes; it was a wet night, and he was wrapped up in a camblet cloak - I saw him at Guildhall and at Union-hall; the Magistrate desired me to look at him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. This took place on the 10th? A. Yes - these are the duplicates, one I gave to the prisoner and one I kept.</p>

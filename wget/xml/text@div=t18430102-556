                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at Stratford, in the parish of West Ham. I rent the house—on Saturday night the 31st of Dec., about eleven o'clock, I was in my shop, and heard a noise of the window breaking—I went to the door, and saw the prisoner running away—I believe there was more than him, but I noticed him particularly, and followed him—Mr. Storey also followed—I kept him in sight all the way till he was stopped—I then went up to him, and found it was the prisoner—a policeman came up—the prisoner was brought back to my shop—when I got back I looked at my window, and found the greater part of the bottom pane knocked out—I had boots and shoes in the window—I found them all in confusion when I got back, and saw there was some gone—Mr. Brown produced a pair of women's boots, which are mine—I had seen them not five minutes before the window was broken, close to the broken pane—I had not sold them to anybody—I re<lb></lb>mained in the shop from the time I saw them safe till I heard the window break—the window was perfectly whole the early part of the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hat-manufacturer, and live at Stratford, in the parish of West Ham, opposite to the prosecutor. On Saturday, the 31st of Dec., about eleven o'clock at night, I heard the breaking of a window—I went out, and saw three or four persons running away from Scammell's shop—I followed them, and saw one of them stopped—it was the prisoner—I am sure he is the person—I had not seen him do anything but run away, but when he was stopped I saw him throw something over his shoulder into a garden belonging to Mr. Brown, which is separated from the street by a gate with open rails—I went back to the garden, leaving the prisoner in custody—I saw Mr. Brown take up a pair of boots, about three yards from the gate in his garden, about five yards from where the prisoner stood, when he</p>

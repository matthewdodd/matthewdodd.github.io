I said I was going myself, and did not particularly want him that day. Mr. Davies came up; the prisoner got into the chaise - I told Mr. Davies he had better get into the chaise too, as I was younger than him, and could walk. I told the prisoner to ask 14l. for it, if he was there first, but not to sell it, for I was coming directly after him. I got to Smithfield about three o'clock - I had told the prisoner I would allow him 1s. in the pound on what it sold for. When I got to Smithfield I saw Davies first - we went to the prisoner, and placed him in Smithfield to show it; we went round the market, came back, and found him in the same place; he said nobody had bid him any money. I told him not to sell it - and Davies said "Don't sell it yourself; Mr. Daniels will soon be back and would like to sell it himself." Davies went home - I stood by the prisoner some time; then the prisoner's uncle came, whom I had known for sixteen years - he and I went round the market, leaving him in the same place, and when we came back the prisoner was gone; the last time I left him was about a quarter to six o'clock. I have known him fifteen or sixteen years; the horse and chaise were also gone. I did not see him again till the 19th of June - his uncle is employed in the same factory with me, and as the prisoner was out of work, he asked me to employ him to sell the horse; the uncle did not apply to me first. I told him myself that I wished tosell it. On the night of the 10th, he said the prisoner was out of work, and might he go to Smithfield with it. I said I should like to go myself; the uncle said, the business was so urgent I had better let him go - I asked if he thought it was safe to trust him, and I told the prisoner he might go; he had only said, that he could go. I told him not to sell it, but to bring me a customer; he took it to Smithfield on the 11th, about three o'clock. I went at six, and found him there - I went back with him, as it was not sold; and on the 18th we went again, as I have stated - his uncle is a man of property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I ask you, did you never give the prisoner authority to sell this horse? A. No; I never told any body that I gave him authority to sell it. I never told his uncle Bull so; I know Mr. Spencer, a cooper - I saw him the evening it was stolen, and told him the prisoner was gone away with it, but did not say I had given him leave to sell it - nor did I ever tell Dawes so, nor Mr. Gigg - I swear I never told any person that I had given him authority to sell it. I told them all that he had been to Smithfield to get me a customer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner come to you one evening and say, he had been offered 12l. for it, at Smithfield? A. That was on the 11th; I said if he knew where the person lived he might have strained another pound. I did not blame him for not taking the 12l. I never said to his uncle, when he did not come home, that I dare to say he had sold it.</p>

            . On the 18th of May I saw Daniels at his stable; he asked me to go to Smithfield with him - the prisoner came in; Daniels and he put the horse too; the prisoner got in and drove about one hundred yards - Daniels said, I had better ride, and I got in and rode with the prisoner. I got out at the pig-market, and said, "Mr. Daniels and I will be with you in a few minutes, you draw the horse and gig into Smithfield," which he did, and in five minutes Daniels came up - we went to the prisoner; Daniels said, "We are going to take a walk - if anybody comes, ask 14l., but don't sell it, for I shall be back in a few minutes;" I said, "No," do not sell it, for Daniels wishes to sell it himself - we came back, and he said nobody had been to look at it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is Daniels a stranger to you? A. Not particularly; my brother married his sister. I never told the Magistrate that I was merely acquainted with him.</p>

            . I am a coach-maker. On the 19th of May, about half-past three o'clock, the prisoner came to my factory, at Islington, with a plater, who works for me - he asked me if I would buy a yellow pony chaise. I appointed to meet him at seven o'clock at my house - he came; and I went with him to the Leaping-bar stables, in St. John-street. I saw the chaise, and told him it would not suit me - I went on the 23d, with a gentleman who wanted one, and left a note for him to come to me on the following morning, which he did, at twelve o'clock. I asked the lowest price of the chaise; he said he had been bid 50s. for it, and said he had a duplicate of some harness. I said I had three, which I had bought of a lodger, for 24s.; he said he would take them in exchange; I went to the pawnbrokers and redeemed the harness, which was pawned for 30s., and I bought the chaise for 50s. On the 28th the officer came, and I delivered him the chaise.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Daniels ever tell you he had given him authority to sell the property? A. On the 30th of May I was at the Hugh Middleton public-house, he said he had given him permission to sell it, that if he did not, he should not think of giving him anything; but if he did, he was to have 1s. in the pound.</p>

            . Daniels told me he had given the prisoner authority to sell the property, and that if he could not sell it altogether, he was to sell the horse and chaise; this was on the 9th of May - and when it was missing, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120023"></xptr>said, "Most likely he has sold it, and is looking for us, as it is getting late."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he ever say so after the prisoner went away with it? A. No; one night when the prisoner said he had refused 12l. for it, Daniels said he was foolish in not taking the man's address, for he might have got a pound or two more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ribbon-manufacturer. My warehouse is in Wood-st., and I have a factory at Coventry—I had, shortly before this, remov<lb></lb>ed from another warehouse—Jacobs had been recommended by Feltham, who was my servant, to assist in moving—in consequence of something that passed on that occasion, I gave directions to Feltham never to have the slightest communication with that fellow—he said he certainly should not; and about six weeks prior to this time I said, "I hope you have no communication with that fellow"—he said, "I have not"—Feltham had been in my employ from ten to eleven years—Shaw called on me on the morning of the 12th, and gave me information, in consequence of which, on Feltham's coming in I gave him into custody of Shaw—these three pieces of satin ribbon in the paper are dressed, but not blocked—they are sent up from the factory undressed, and they are not in a condition to be sold—Feltham knew that—it may happen</p>

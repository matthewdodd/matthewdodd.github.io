                  </hi>. I am cook to Johnson and Co.—the prisoner was a salesman in their warehouse—in April I bought three collars of him—he brought them to me in the kitchen, which is in the back part of the house—I believe his department of the warehouse is in the front of the house—I gave him 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the collars—he gave me this invoice (<hi rend="italic">producing it,</hi>) when he brought the collars—here is no date to it.</p>

I am a commercial traveller, in the prosecutor's service. On the 16th of April last I bought two black Brussels capes of the prisoner—I bought them on the same day, and gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for them at the time—I bought them in his department in the warehouse—he did not give me any invoice.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was anybody present? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, Mr. Emery—I know the habits of the house—I have had mistakes in my account with the house to the amount of twice as many pounds as I paid the prisoner shil<lb></lb>lings—I cannot tell on what day of the week I paid him—I can say it was the 16th of April, because I had two friends with me from the country in the warehouse, buying a parcel—I received a sum of 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at Lynn, of a person named Kirk ham—I was applied to for it in about a fortnight—I denied that I had received it—I believe it was a mistake, and my employer believed so—it was not entered in my book—it was my duty to enter all receipts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. William Bulmer and Robert Johnson—we are warehousemen—the prisoner was in our employ for about three years, in the working department—our business is principally whole<lb></lb>sale—when the prisoner received any money on account of any retail trans<lb></lb>action, it was his duty to take it into the counting-house, and give it to the clerk, but to enter it first into the journal, in the entering-room—we enter the ready-money transaction with "RM" to them—we have two youths to enter them in the cash-book, and when the goods are entered the invoice is taken to the counting-house with the money by the young man who sells, but if he does not take it, the customer takes it, and the clerk in the counting-house receives the money—the prisoner never paid me either of these sums.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He came to you from Morrison's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, with a good character—he was regular in his habits—the whole sums that we charge the prisoner with embezzling, in three indictments, are under 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is not the rule that young men in the same employ as the prisoner should take</p>

               <p>money—but they all know it has been deviated from very much lately, and with our sanction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are your orders to your servants that they shall at the counter, if called to sell goods, sell them, make out a bill of parcels, band that hill to the person, and send the customer to pay the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The order is for the customer to pay the money; but sometimes the person who sells takes it——the returns in the prisoner's department, which was mostly wholesale, were from 12, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 15, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—when he first came, it was perhaps 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less—he was originally taken into custody for embezzling 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he confessed that—that is not in this indictment—we were not afterwards threatened with an action, or proceeding, for having him taken into custody, to my knowledge—I have not beard it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any observation made by any friends of the prisoner that you had taken a very cruel course towards him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that was the report in the neighbourhood, set afloat by himself after we let him go—we did not, upon that, hunt these charges up—they came to us—I spoke to Catherine Johnstone, when I was told of it by some one in the warehouse—I will not swear it was not Emery told me, but my impression is that it was not him—I hate never said that it was Emery—Emery was immediately under the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked whether an action was threat<lb></lb>ened—is this the letter the prisoner sent you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he had the whole of the department in which he was—we have five departments—our ready money, taking in the whole house, is from 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—it has been the prac<lb></lb>tice for the servants to receive money, and band it over themselves, instead of the customer, for the last ten years perhaps.—(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>)—"To Mr. J. Johnson. Mr. Johnson,—Will you be kind enough to allow me to have a few things? I am wanting a change of linen, &amp;c. If so, perhaps you will be so kind as to let one of your porters bring them to S—, say a shirt, two collars, rasors, and hair brushes. I have to apologize for thus intruding on your kindness; but I think I know your good nature too well to allow yon to refuse. Again allow me to thank yon gratefully for your and your partner's forbearance, in not pushing too hardly this unhappy business. I have felt, and do feel acutely, my degraded situation; but, with your kindness, I trust so much has not been said but I may establish my reputation. Let me beg you to place yourself in my position, and I trust, for my family's sake, yon will be dis<lb></lb>posed to view it in the most lenient light. <hi rend="smallCaps">GEO. FOX</hi>.

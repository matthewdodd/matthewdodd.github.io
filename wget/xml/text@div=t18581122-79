                  </hi>.

                  </hi>. The last witness is my sister. On Tuesday, 9th November, she pointed out the prisoner to me, and I followed him from the Red Lion to the Cross Keys—he went in there, and immediately he came out I went in and made a communication—I then followed him to the Red Cow in Princess-street, Lambeth, kept by Mrs. Woolf. I did not see him go in, but I saw him in front of the bar, and I saw him come out about six minutes afterwards—I then went in and spoke to Mrs. Woolf, and then went after the prisoner—I found him twelve or thirteen yards from the house, and told him I should charge him with passing a bad shilling at the Red Cow—I took him back there—Mrs. Woolf said that she would not give him in custody, but I said that I would—he seemed to have something between his teeth and his cheeks—I asked him what he had got, and he made two <hi rend="italic">bolts</hi> to get it down before he succeeded—he then said "You may put your hand in my mouth and feel whether I have got anything," but Mrs. Woolf declined—I did not get a countable, I took the prisoner to the station myself.</p>

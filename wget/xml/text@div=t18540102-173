                  </hi>. I am a mercantile clerk, living at 49, Burr-street, Spitalfields. On Sunday-night, 11th Dec., I met the prisoner between 11 and 12 o'clock—she asked me to accompany her home; I refused, and walked on—she followed me, and requested me to give her something to drink, as the night was cold; I took her into a public house in the Minories—we drank together there, and staid three quarters of an hour, after which she asked me to see her part of the way home; she took me to Northumberland-alley—I was stupid after what I had drank, and recollect being knocked down in the street, I think by a man, but I could not identify him—the prisoner ran away; and after lying a short time on the flags, I got up and went home—I had not been into any other house with the prisoner in going home—I received a blow across the left eye and fell to the ground—I got up, and found I had lost everything I had except my handkerchief—there was a purse containing, to the best of my knowledge, 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a duplicate, a pair of gloves, a letter, and a newspaper—I remained in bed the greater part of the next day—on the Tuesday evening, I went to the Minories with a friend, and found the prisoner—I sent my friend for a policeman, and gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

               <p>she hesitated very much, but after a little while she told me, and I went with her to her lodging, and found these three silk handkerchiefs; three pocket books, containing memorandums; two silver watches; a purse, con<lb></lb>taining two sovereigns and four half crowns, in one drawer, and 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver in another; also, a <hi rend="italic">porte monnaie</hi>, containing a letter and a duplicate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went with the man to a public-house in George-street; we remained there till they were about to close, and then he paid, for a pint of brandy at the bar, and took it away in a bottle; we went to a public-house in Northumberland-alley, and drank wine, rum, and brandy; he then paid for half a pint of rum in a bottle, and we came out with it, and went to a house of accommodation in Northumberland-alley, for which he promised me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but only gave me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he said that was all the money he had; I was very tipsy, and he was extremely so; I took him to my house, and asked him to make me a present; he took out his purse and the dupli<lb></lb>cate, and said he would bring me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to-morrow, and befriend me; he threw a newspaper on the table, and pulled his pockets out, to show me that he had no more money; I think the pint of brandy must have been drunk, for I was in a dreadful state on the Tuesday, and could scarcely get out of bed; about 2 o'clock, as he did not come according to promise, I went to the Minories, and saw him, but I do not think he saw me; I ran up to him, and said, "You did not perform your promise in bringing me the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" he said, "I did not know what I was doing on Sunday night; I was in a dreadful state of drink;" he pointed to the side of his head, and showed me a scratch; he proposed going to have something to drink; we went to a public-house, and had two quarterns of rum and a pint of ale, and talked matters over there; this pocketbook was left in my-bed by a friend; this watch belonged to my deceased parent, and the other watch I redeemed at the corner of Turner-street, Commercial-road; the handkerchiefs are mine; I have two children to support, and work at dressmaking and millinery; I never was in prison before; I thought the prosecutor was my friend, and did not think he would turn upon me in this cruel manner; he was pulling me about and kissing me in the street, and because I would not let him do so, he said, "You shall go with nobody else to-night; I will have my revenge;" I said, "If I see a policeman I shall get some protection," and walked up a dark turning; he said, "Give me what I have expended;" a policeman came up, and I was given into custody, to my great surprise.</p>

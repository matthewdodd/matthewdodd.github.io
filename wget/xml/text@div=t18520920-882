                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Aldgate High-street. The prisoner was in my employ on 31st Aug. and had been so for five or six weeks previous—in consequence of something I heard, I marked a half crown and two shillings in a particular way, and put them in the till—there was then no other silver there—I called the attention of my shopman to it—I then marked another half crown and two shillings in a different way, and gave them to my porter to give to a person to purchase articles in the shop—in a few minutes Mrs. Williams came in the shop, and I went out—Mrs. Williams had some dealings with the prisoner—I saw her quit the shop, and I went in immediately—no person could have been at the till from the moment Mrs. Williams left till I went in—I saw the prisoner leave—I went to the till im<lb></lb>mediately—the prisoner could see I went to it, and he walked to the back of the shop—there is a water closet and a soap closet on the next floor below—the prisoner went the way towards them—on examining the till, I found the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that I had marked and put in, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that was not marked, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that I had marked and given to my porter.</p>

I engaged the prisoner, on the 8th of August, to attend my wife in her confinement - she died, and the prisoner left me in about a month; it was the week after my wife died; I missed two sovereigns, two half-crowns, and one sixpence, out of a bag - I had seen it safe the week before I missed them, and while she was there - I did not then miss any thing else, but afterwards I missed the shifts, gown, and other things -I then applied to the prisoner again on the subject of these things, and gave her into custody; she lodged in Upper Garden-street, Vauxhall-road - I found many things, the marks of which had been picked out; I found the top of the smelling-bottle, and the duplicates of some property, which I found at the pawnbroker's, and a black apron, which was my wife's - I saw more of my property, but as the initials were gone, I would not swear to it.</p>

               <p>MR. SWENDELL. No, I did not; I gave her a black stuff gown and a green shawl, which my wife departed in; it was stained with leeches, but she said she could wash it, and wear it.</p>

             (Police-constable B 139). I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's lodgings - I found this black apron, this top of the smelling-bottle on her person, and a duplicate of these things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell him when he found the apron that he gave it to me? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. SWENDELL. These are new ones; they are marked with my wife's maiden name, Ann Rodgers - what she wore were old ones; the prisoner washed them, and gave them to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. His wife asked me to lay her out four days before she died - I said I would, and she said,"What linen I have on, you can take it for laying me out;" I thought they were my own, and pawned them in my own name; these are the things that his own mother and I pulled off when she died.</p>

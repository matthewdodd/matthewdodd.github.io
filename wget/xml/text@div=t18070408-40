On the 30th of August the prisoner had lived with me three weeks; he left me on that day; he said he would mend a chair while I was gone to market. He came out with me at eight o'clock, to buy a screw to mend the chair, I saw him return into the house, he unlocked the door and went up stairs; I returned in about half an hour, when I came back the property was gone. I did not see him for six months afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of your property. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know this person before you took him in the house to lodge. - A. No, he said he had just come out of the country; I found he knew London as well as I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he take out of your house. - A. A suit of clothes, four shirts, and a one pound note, and a seven-shilling piece. He saw me put the money in the caddie when he and I came home from work.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (read in court) My lord, having an impediment in my speech, which makes it out of my power to address the court, I hope your lordship will excuse these few lines; my case is as follows: - On or about August last, I went to Mr. Loader to work, my shopmate asked me to lodge with him; I did so, at eighteen pence a week. On Saturday night following my master paid me my wages, and discharged me. My prosecutor and I went home together, from whence the prosecutor, his wife and I, went out to take a walk together, as far as Smithfield; I met a shopmate of mine, who told me where I might get work: I told him I should not stay with him, and that I would leave my shirt and stockings, which would be a security to him for what I owed him. I went with my shopmate to Hertfordshire, and got work there. In January last I got work in Little Moorfields, where I was apprehended. The prosecutor came to Newgate and told me the bill was thrown out; he treated me; I sent all my friends away yesterday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Benjamin Harvey and Mr. Nicholls. On 10th Dec., about twelve o'clock, I noticed a woman coming to the shop—she was served by the prisoner—I saw her put three shillings and a penny on the counter—the prisoner asked if she wished to have the bill he had just made out—she said, "No," and went away without it—the prisoner took the money up as well as the bill—it was his duty to go and pay the money in at the desk, to enter it in his book, have the bill stamped and return it to the customer—he did not do so—he passed the desk and returned, and while returning, I saw him put his hand towards his pocket—I told Mr. Harvey.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Ann-street, Sloane-street, Chelsea. On 10th Dec., about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I went to Mr. Harvey's and bought articles which came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I paid the prisoner one shilling, and the rest in halfpence—I did not receive any bill.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Benjamin Harvey—we are drapers at Lowndes-terrace, Knightsbridge. The prisoner was in our ser<lb></lb>vice about ten months—his salary was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and his board and lodging—on 10th Dec., when I returned from the City, I received information from Mr. Harvey—I gave Mr. Tuck two half-crowns—I afterwards gave him a</p>

               <p>shilling which was marked, and two penny pices—supposing a sale to be effected above the value of a shilling, it is the shopman's duty to make out a bill and have it examined by the young man next to him, and if he finds it right, to take it to the desk, and pay the money in with the bill to the cashier—the cashier would stamp the bill, and return it to the young man, who would enter it in his own book and return the bill to the customer—we have a number of young men—the number varies from twenty-eight to forty—after I had parted with the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Mr. Tuck, I saw Angelica Armes come to the shop, whom I had instructed Mr. Tuck to send—she came to the counter to the prisoner's department—he served her with four yards of muslin at 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. yard, and two pieces of cotton cord, at a penny each—that made 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw her pass the money to the prisoner at the second counter—I saw him take it—I then went to the back shop, in sight of the cashier's desk—I saw the prisoner go up to the desk, write on the slate "2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," and then put his hand to his pocket, and go away from the desk—I do not know whether he spoke to the cashier—if the sale were under a shilling it would he his duty to put the amount on that slate, and lay the halfpence on the desk—that was what he did—as soon as he went from the desk to the front shop, as I thought, going to his customer, he turned round the corner, and went down stairs—I followed him and said, "Curtis, you served a customer with four yards of muslin, for which you took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the shilling you have not paid in to the desk"—he said, "I paid it in to the desk"—I told him to walk up stairs with me, and as soon as I saw a young man, I sent for an officer—there were nine or ten shillings I think, found in the prisoner's waistcoat pocket, and amongst them, the shilling I had marked, and I think 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes and sovereigns in a pocket-book, in his coat-pocket—I had seen him put his hand towards his waistcoat-pocket, or the side-pocket of his coat—this is the shilling I marked; I have no doubt of it—I have the prisoner's book—he should enter the amounts in it before he leaves the desk—here is no entry in it of this 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., nor the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., nor the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

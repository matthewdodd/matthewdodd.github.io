I live at 8, Osborne Place, Whitechapel—about 11 o'clock, on 8th April, I saw the male prisoner on the stairs struggling with Catherine Sweeney and Laura Sweeney—he bad two bundles with him containing property belonging to me, which I had seen safe between 5 and 6 o'clock—there were also two other bundles lying in the passage—the goods were worth about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a policeman came and took the man to the station—when we went out with him the female prisoner pushed across to him, trying to speak to him, after he was in custody—she was close to the door when we came out.</p>

I work for the last witness—on the night of 8th April I was coming up the kitchen stain, and saw the male prisoner coming down with two bundles, from the second floor—I asked him what he wanted—he said "All right, don't make a noise"—I caught hold of him—he kicked me—I screamed for assistance; my sister came, and Mr. Smith, and he was taken into custody—I had seen the female prisoner before this,—I standing outside—as we were going along to the police-station she pushed me asked her what she pushed me for, and she told me to go back and mind my own business—she was talking to the man when he was in custody till they got as far as the station-house—she was not in custody then she gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not hear him ask for it.</p>

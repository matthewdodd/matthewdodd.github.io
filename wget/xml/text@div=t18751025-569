                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Cafe Regence, Tichborne Street—on 11th October, about 11 o'clock, the prisoner came in for a glass of stout and handed me a florin, I tested it and found it was found; I bent it and showed it to the manager, who told me to keep it—I said nothing to the prisoner; he went away—I had seen him there on the 10th at 10 o'clock, with another person, one of them asked for some stout and a florin was tendered to me; they had got to the door when I found that it was bad.</p>

I do not know whether that was good, because I gave change for a sovereign afterwards, and may have paid it away, but I am positive about Monday night, when I bent it in the waiter's presence; I charged you with it, and you said that you would give me a half-crown for it, but I would not take it because you had been in twice before—the stout was not paid for; you were given in custody.</p>

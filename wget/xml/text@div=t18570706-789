               <p>Woburn Place, by the gentleman opening the door—I climbed on the first wall—there was a fire escape man in No. 22—there were a few policemen about—there had been an alarm of thieves before—a good many people were about—I found Stevens in the furthest part of the garden from the house—he was crouching under the wall—I was looking over the wall—the gardens communicate one with the other—I had passed by the centre wall which ex<lb></lb>tends along the whole of the gardens between Endsleigh Street and Woburn Place—Stevens had a cut on the forehead—he was the only person in that garden.</p>

About half past 11 o'clock that night, after scrambling over several gardens, I found myself in the garden of No. 10, Endsleigh Street—I there found Henrick—he was very much hurt—I took him to University Hospital—I found on him this picklock and some matches.</p>

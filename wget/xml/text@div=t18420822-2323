                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live in Copthall-buildings, Throgmorton-street. I was concerned last year for a gentleman named Pinner, who had proceedings against one Charbean—Pinner re<lb></lb>quested me to pay some money for him, and he was indebted to me for some costs in the action, and he deposited with me a bill of exchange, which I produce—it was afterwards dishonoured—proceedings were taken on it, and the plaintiff was nonsuited—Mr. Pinner brought the prisoner to me, to prove the handwriting of the acceptor—I asked him if that was the writing of John Monday, the acceptor—he said it was, and that he saw him write it—he said he took the bill to him, and saw him accept it, in White<lb></lb>cross-street prison.</p>

               <p>Pinner for uttering—he was not examined before the Magistrate, as he was in custody in Whitecross-street at the time the warrant was lodged at the prison—the prisoner has not been examined before a Magistrate-several months passed before an indictment was found—the bill became due in June, 1841—I could not then find the prisoner out—I swear Pin<lb></lb>ner never told me he was all along in Munday's employ—I inquired of' Pinner where he was—I wrote to him several times to know where Hill was, but he never came near me—no action was commenced till October or September, at the desire of Pinner, because he was a customer, and he would be sure to pay it—the action was tried at the sittings after Michaelmas term, and we failed in proving the handwriting.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">looking at the bill</hi>.) This acceptance is not my hand-writing—I did not give the prisoner, or anybody, authority to write my name across it—I know the prisoner—he was formerly in partnership with me—we dissolved in February, 1841—I got into trouble in 1841, and was in Whitecross-street prison—the prisoner came to me there in April, but not with this bill—he came with a blank piece of paper, and asked me to accept a bill—I think it was 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>: odd—I refused to do so—he did not ask me to give him permission to put my name—I came out of prison early in May, and saw the prisoner afterwards in my own premises in May—he was in my employ, and he said he had accepted the bill—I forget How the conversation arose, except that he stated he had accepted a bill in my name—I do not think he mentioned the sum, I am not positive—I was extremely angry about it—he said it was in the hands of Pinner, the drawer—he proposed to go with me to Pinner, which we did, and de<lb></lb>manded the bill—Pinner said it should be destroyed, and relying on that, I thought it a dead letter—I was afterward sued on the bill, and defended the action.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Miles Stringer, of Russell-square. On the 8th of May I missed a coalscuttle, at eight o'clock in the morning, from the area, where knives are cleaned - the Police-man brought it me; the prisoner said at the office that he had stolen it, and that distress drove him to it.</p>

            . I am a Police-man. I took this coal-scuttle from the prisoner in Bedford-square, between five and six o'clock on the 8th of May; I asked him how he came by it - he said from his father; he did not say where he lived - he owned at the office that he took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Police-man stated at the office, that he saw me come out of the area, and then he said a boy told him.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH CALLAGHAN. No such thing - a boy did give me information.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming across Russell-square, saw it in a cloth, and took it up; the officer said I had taken it from a house at the corner of the square; I said, "I will go back;" he went and knocked at the door, and they did not answer - he then took me to the watch-house.</p>

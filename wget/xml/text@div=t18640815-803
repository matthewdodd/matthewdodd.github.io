I live at 26, Bolsover-street—on 6th August, at 12 o'clock at night, I was outside a beershop at the corner of Clipstone-street, and saw a row outside a beershop a little lower down—my wife went to see what it was, and in a minute or two I went also—I heard that the prisoner's brother had knocked my wife down—I asked him what he had done it for—he made no answer, but turned round again—I said, "You must be a mean man to knock a woman down"—he said, "Yes, and I will knock you down"—he struck at me, and we began fighting—while we were fighting I felt myself stabbed in the face—I turned round, and was stabbed again near my eye—I saw the prisoner with a knife in his hand close behind me—I called out that I was stabbed—I became insensible with loss of blood, and found myself in the hospital—I also found a cut on my arm through my coat, and there was a small cut on my head—I was only in the hospital while the wounds were dressed—I had never seen the prisoner before—I am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband's name is Robert—in January, 1871, we were living at Sidmouth Street—my father's name is John White—he is not here—I remember him being taken ill—that was in January, 1871, as near as I can remember—he was living in Devonshire Street—I nursed him—as near as I can remember I was there three or four weeks—Dr. Hugman attended him—I lived at my father's while he was ill—I had some work to do for Mr. Coate before my father was taken ill; some jewel brushes—the value of the work was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I left it behind at my own residence—I should think it was about three or four weeks after my father was taken ill that I finished my work—I took it to the warehouse then and the prisoner paid me for it—I finished the work at my father's while I was attending him in his illness—I did not do any more work for Mr. Coate, and only received that 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think I was first spoken to about this matter about two or three months ago by Mr. Coate—he came and asked me the amount of work I did—I told him as near as I could—he said what was down in the book, and then he asked me if I had received those—I told him I did not think I had.</p>

            , we have the whole house. On Sunday the 27th of October, at eight o'clock we went out, and returned home at twelve o'clock, and when we came home we could not open the door, the lock was stiff, we were obliged to get the watchman to open it, it is an old lock, it does not open very easy. We got the watchman to light us, the first thing I saw when I went in was the parlour door open, I looked up at the mantle piece for the time piece, it was gone, I had left the time piece on the mantle piece in the front parlour when I went out. I went into the back room, I found the money and the notes box gone from out of a drawer in the bedstead, three five-pound notes and four one pound Bank notes, and two pair of gold ear rings, and a plain gold ring, and a breast pin, were taken away, I went into the front parlour, there were three silver tea spoons taken out of the cupboard, I have seen all the things since.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the persons get in. - A. By the cellar door, it is a bad bolt. I saw all these things before I went out, and when I returned they were all gone.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday, the 28th, I received information of the house, No. 21, Oxford Market, being broken open, I went and searched the premises, and found where they got in, the prisoner Burne was active in shewing us the place, he is a relation of the prosecutrix, we concluded that it could not be any one but what well knew the premises and knew where the property was, Burne seemed very much flurried. Limerick told me to go and ask the prosecutrix who he was, I went and asked the prosecutrix, we then accused Burne of it, saying that we had great suspicion that he either knew who it was, or had had concern in it himself, he denied it, we told him that we were sure he was concerned in the robbery, and that we should take him in custody, he then said it was not him, but he knew who it was that did it, it was two soldiers that belonged to the West London militia, and a young man of the name of Tibbett, he said he partly knew where they were, he would go and shew us where they were in the city. We then came into Bunhill Row, Burne went into several houses they were not there, he went into one house, they said they had not been gone above half an hour; he then said he supposed they were gone to the Bricklayer's Arms, in South-Molton Street, where Tibbett was to meet him in the afternoon to divide the property; we then went into Oxford Market to the prosecutor's house, there he wished to see the prosecutor, they went up stairs, Limerick followed the prosecutor and Burne, - when they came down again the prosecutor, Burne and Limerick, and I, went into Grovesnor market, we went into a house, Burne and Limerick went down into the kitchen, and Burne brought up some notes in his hand, we counted them over, there were two fives and two ones, he then said if you come along with me to the Bricklayer's Arms in South Molton Street, we shall have the remainder part of the property; we went there, and was there near half an hour, when Tibbett came in, Burne asked him to drink, they drank together, and went out, and Limerick followed them, they got some distance, Burne turned back and said, come along, you shall have the other part of the property; we then went into New Court, Fleet Lane, Fleet market, we went into a garret where there were presses, they were book binders, and under some paper shavings Tibbett produced this time piece, three silver spoons, a breast pin, two pair of ear rings, a gold ring, a silver tooth pick, and a horn box, and a small article or two that are not mentioned in the indictment. We brought them to the office, and took them before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. How had they got in. - A. The way they got in was at the cobler's stall, the kitchen was being repaired, they took the wainscot away and got into the cellar, they got into the back window, up one pair of stairs, the prosecutor found the back window open,</p>
               <p>Q.(to Prosecutrix.) This window is up one pair of stairs, was that up or down when you went away. - A. It was down, not fastened, we found it up a little way, it was quite shut down when I left it, when they got into the yard, there is a shed that goes up to this window, we saw the foot marks where they got in at the window.</p>

            . I went in company with Read to 21, Oxford Market, to look at the house that had been broken open, we went in, Burne was there present, he shewed us all about the place, we went into the cellar, it was dark, I said to Burne go up and get us a light, he did, he seemed a great deal alarmed at the time, I told Read to go and ask who he was, he brought back word that he was a relation, and had been out of work six months, I then had a strong suspicion of him, we went up stairs, I told him I should take him in custody concerning the robbery, he said he had not done it himself, it was three others; he said there were three men that had done the robbery he could give us information where the things were; he said it was two soldiers and one Tibbett, we went in company with him to Bunhill Row, we could not find the three men, he said most likely they would meet him at the Bricklayer's Arms, he pressed very hard to see the prosecutor, we took him to the prosecutor, he wanted to see him privately in a room, I told him I had him in custody, I could not grant any such thing, without being present at the time. He went up stairs, he asked the prosecutrix if he was to bring back all the things would she hurt him, she said she could not say any thing to it, it was gone too far; we went up to Grovenor market, where his mother and he lodged, he went down into the kitchen and produced these two five pound notes, he said these were a part of the notes that he had taken, he owned to changing one of the ones, he said he had three, and that is all that he had received, two fives and three ones, there were three fives lost. We went with him to the Bricklayer's Arms, in South Moulton Street, we waited there about half an hour, and Tibbett came in, they drank together, and he beckoned him out, Tibbett made answer to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300046"></xptr>him, you are in a hurry. They went out, they had got about half way down the street, they called to us, we were very near to them, and Tibbett said to us, if you have all the things it shall be all right, I said that rested with the magistrate; we went straight on to New Court, Tibbett went up and brought the remainder of the property, when we came to the office before the magistrate, they confessed the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them sign this. - A. I did, and I saw the magistrate sign it. That is my hand writing. I saw both the prisoners sign it, it was read over to both of them.</p>

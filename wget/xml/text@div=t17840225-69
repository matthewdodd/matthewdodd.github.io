               <p>The prisoner lodged with me about eleven weeks, she left my lodging six weeks next Wednesday, I gave her warning, and after she was gone, I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, I never saw them while she had the room, but I saw them when she took the room, I never found any of my things again, I took the prisoner to the constable, and she directed me to the pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you make her any promise in case she would enable you to recover your things? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell her that you would be favorable to her? - I cannot say whether any such thing passed, I was in a flurry, nothing in particular passed to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Evans, I had those things of the prisoner, she pawned them at different times, in November, December, and January; I am sure she brought them; they have been in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>When I carried them it was through great necessity, and I intended to have got them again, and my son has paid part towards them, has not he Mrs. Norris?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. He gave four shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. You should not have received money, how came you to take these four shillings? - Her son passed his word for three weeks rent, and I thought as I was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250153"></xptr> distress, I had better take a little than lose all, and I fetched out two things.</p>
               <p>Tyler. My Lord, they would have settled it before they could have been taken before a magistrate, if they had had time, I belive it was the intention of the prisoner to get them again.</p>

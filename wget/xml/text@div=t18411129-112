                  </hi>. I am foreman rope<lb></lb>maker, in the employ of Mr. John Thompson, Jun., Love-lane, Shadwell. On the 17th of November, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner Donovan came to me in the rope<lb></lb>ground, and asked for a coil of two<lb></lb>yarn spun-yarn for the ship Clare, by order of Mr. Coker, who I knew as a rigger and ship chandler, doing business for that ship—I refused to let Donovan have the rope without an order—about half-past two he came again, and Briant with him—Mr. Wriggles worth, our clerk, gave me the order—I then ordered Toole, our lad, to get out two coils of spun-yarn—the prisoners were standing close by when I gave Toole the order, and were near enough to hear what I said—I told Toole to get the spun-yarn out, and go with them to the ship, and I would go into the office and get the delivery note for him—I left the prisoners standing by the coils of rope, and went into the office, where the clerk wrote out the delivery notes—I afterwards went out, and the prisoner! and the coils were gone—I sent Toole in search of them, and went myself, to Mr. Coker—I afterwards gave information at the station, and the prisoners were taken that evening—I saw the rope next morning at a shop in Brook-street, where the prisoners were taken from.</p>

             I was Assistant to Rhodes, we had a Warrant against Robinson, and while we had him in Custody, the Prisoner and a Heap of Irishmen rescued him from us, and we were obliged to get away as well as we could. When we were got out of the House, the Prisoner and Hunt push'd Rhodes down, and stood over him with Broomsticks in their Hands, but what was taken from him I can't tell. After this, we found Hunt and the Prisoner at Mr. South's in Holford s-Alley, and Hunt said, let us drink Boys, and be merry, with the Constable's Money: There was a pane of Glass broke, through which we saw them, but we were afraid to go in.</p>

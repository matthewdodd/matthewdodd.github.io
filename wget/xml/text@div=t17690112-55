The prisoner Davis, was the first evidence that appeared to support what Flanady had swore in the Court of Common Pleas. Part of his evidence was as follows: That he had a pair of hand-cuffs put on his hands, which cut him like a knife, and made strong marks on his hands, and a rope about his neck, which was squeezed hard ready to hang him; and that this was done in order to make him confess to a forgery: that he was exposed to a great number of people with his hands dirty and bloody, and in extreme torture, occasioned by the handcuffs: and all this he deposed was by order of Commissioner Hanway.</p>
               <p>For want of room here, the reader is referred to his evidence at large, No. 642 in last Oct. Sessions. The prisoner seeing there were a number of Gentlemen in court to prove not a word of his account was true, as they had done on the trial of Flanady before, thought proper to withdraw his plea, and <rs id="t17690112-55-verdict333" type="verdictDescription">

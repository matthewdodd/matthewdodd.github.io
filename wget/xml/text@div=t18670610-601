                  </hi>. I am manager of the London business of Mr. James Anderson, who trades under the style of David Anderson and Son—he manages the manufactory at Belfast—I knew the prisoner when he was traveller for Smith and Co.—they Were customers of ours—I advertised in June, 1866, for a traveller, and, amongst others, the prisoner applied by letter for the situation—he came to Billiter Street and saw Mr. James Anderson, who was in London—he had a private conversation with him—I was then called in, and the terms of the engagement were stated to me; he was to have 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year and reasonable expenses, and to be their sole servant as town traveller for London and suburbs—he assented to that, and entered into the employment a week or a fortnight afterwards—I asked him how he wished to receive his salary, and he said weekly—this is the book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in which his salary was regularly entered—die last date I have is 30th March, and I discharged him on 2nd April—he collected the accounts, and it was his duty to account to me for such sums as he had received the next time he saw me—these are the tickets (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) that he hands over to me when he receives the money—all these moneys he has paid over—I copied those tickets into this memorandum cash book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he did not hand over to me the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Received from Mr. Wickens, nor the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mrs. Gresham, nor the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from Mr. Nichols—up to the time of his discharge he gave me no information as to the receipt of those moneys—this is his expenses book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in his writing—I have never disallowed any of his charges—during the time he was with us his expenses averaged 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. A week, but that includes three or four weeks' expenses in the country, which would be higher, but, excepting that, his expenses would average 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I may have demurred to some of the expenses, but I never deducted any—that was more than we had allowed other travellers—the accounts go out from Billiter Street.</p>

               <p>bonus—when Mr. Anderson is in London he never transacts business without my assistance—he hired the prisoner at my recommendation—I was not in the room when he was engaged, simply because I thought it better that they should speak to each other—I was told afterwards what had passed—they were together for half an hour—the details of the ar<lb></lb>rangement were left to me—I do not know whether Anderson was in London when Dean commenced his duties—the prisoner had told me before he saw Mr. Anderson that his terms were 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I am not at all connected in business with a man named Robinson—I have never done business with him—I have said something to the prisoner about doing business with Robinson, but not while he was in the employ of David Anderson and Son, it was while he was in Smith's employ—I introduced him to Robinson, telling him that I knew nothing about Robinson, but that he seemed a likely person to suit him in his business—I had no interest whatever in Robinson's business—I and Robinson were fellow-ser<lb></lb>vants—I have not the least idea whether Robinson owed Dean any money—the prisoner used to go to the suburbs, and to Hertford and Ware—he went to a few places in the home counties—I am not aware that I have ever perused these diaries (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) before—here is an entry on 18th September, "Railway to Belvidere and Gravesend, and expenses thereat, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—his expenses would not be more than that; you can go there and back by railway for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the entry on the 19th is, "Expenses to Camberwell, Walworth, Battersea, and Chelsea, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—this is his ex<lb></lb>pense book, and is in his own writing—I may have demurred to some of his charges, but his expenses were always allowed—I never had anything to do with the prisoner's diaries, they were never produced to me—the prisoner had a certain discretion in treating and giving little <hi rend="italic">douceurs</hi> to servants—the firm took a promissory note from the prisoner for 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he had no business to pay any expenses, out of the moneys he received on account of the firm; he was always at liberty to ask me for expenses whenever he thought proper, and he frequently did so—he may have deducted his expenses from accounts received, once or twice, but I objected to it—I am not prepared to say when that was—it was not more than once or twice—I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to the prisoner, dismissing him—after I had dismissed him I found these sums out—I consider him a man of great energy—I did not know he had been ill since 1st April.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Matthews, and live in Pitt-street, Old Kent-road. I was at the Bull public-house, in the Dover-road, on the 27th of December—both the prisoners were there with other people—I left the house about a quarter past seven o'clock—I was rather the worse for liquor—I had sufficient recollection to know what happened—the private door of my house is in William-street—the front door goes into Pitt-street—when I got to my door in William-street, I observed the prisoners, but not till they struck me on the head—Jennings came up and struck me first on the head with his crutch—(he is lame, and walks with a crutch)—it broke the comb in my head—he then put his hand into my pocket, and took out 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my purse; and he took a piece of silk out about three quarters of a yard, which I used for a handkerchief—the woman took the shawl off my shoulders at the same time—they went away after<lb></lb>wards, but I was so frightened I scarcely knew where they went—I ran in doors, and screamed out, as I was so frightened—I had known the wo<lb></lb>man sometime before by sight, but never saw the man before—I dare say they were half an hour in the public-house before this happened—I saw my piece of red silk and shawl again at Union Hall.</p>

I was on duty in Dover-road, on Wednesday evening, the 27th of December, about seven o'clock, and saw the prosecutrix come out of the Bull, rather the worse for liquor, followed by the two prisoners—I asked Colwell if she knew where the prosecutrix lived—she said she lived at No. 5, Pitt-street, Old Kent-road—that was correct—she did not say why she was following her—there were two other persons with the prisoners—they left them at the Sunday toll—the prisoners continued to follow her to the end of my beat, in the New Kent-road—that was not above one hundred yards from where she was robbed.</p>

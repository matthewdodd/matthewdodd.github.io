On Saturday, the 6th of November, I went out about a quarter before eight o'clock; as I went out I let the prisoner in, he lodged with me once - I left him with my son, who is sixteen years old. I saw my wedding ring safe in a glass on the mantle-piece of the room where they were. I came home about half-past ten o'clock, and in a few minutes I missed it - I found a brass one in the glass in its stead. My ring was stamped with S. G. in the inside. On the 24th of November the prisoner's father came with a man named May - they said they came to talk about the ring. May asked where the glass stood, I shewed him. He went to the mantle-shelf, and was not there a minute before he found the ring in a crevice behind the mantle-shelf. I had looked there numbers of times for it, and am certain it was not there. I had got some small moulds out of that crevice, and am certain it was not there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. The prisoner was an acquaintance of yours - A. Yes. The crevice is not the depth of the ring. The man's father had lived in the house - he said he came to look for the ring. I had looked several times before he did, and am certain it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010020"></xptr>not there. I had put a piece of paper in the crevice four days before. The brass ring was on the mantle-piece, but at some distance from the glass.</p>

            . I am son of the last witness. The prisoner came to see me about eight o'clock, and stopped till a quarter past nine - we were in the room were the ring was - I left him alone about ten minutes. Nobody but us were there until my mother returned, except the girl, who came in for a broom, she did not stop. I searched the crevice, and am sure the ring was not there.</p>

            . I am a navigator. The prisoner lives a few doors from me. On Saturday, the 6th of November, between nine and ten o'clock, he shewed me a ring, and said he found it at Homerton. I saw an S inside it. I went to him at the lock-up house in Worship-street, and called to him through the key-hole. I knew his voice. I said,</p>
               <p>"Are you there, Harry?" he said,</p>
               <p>"I am - don't you know any thing about it." I should know the ring again; that produced is it - I know it by the S.</p>

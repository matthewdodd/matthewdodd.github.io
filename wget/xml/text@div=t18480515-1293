On Saturday morning, 15th April, about five minutes to five o'clock, I tried the door of the Grapes', in Old-street, at the corner of New-street, in the parish of St. Luke's, kept by Mr. Thomas Jarmaine—it was not fastened—I opened it, went in, and saw bottles lying about in different directions, some cakes spilt over the counter and some brandy on the floor—I called a brother constable, and left him is in charge—I traced some drops of brandy from a puddle in the front of the bar, out at the door on to the pavement, and into Peartree-street, near the door of No. 11—there I saw the prisoner Price with a two gallon bottle and a pail on the pavement—Mrs. Murrell was there, and was pouring brandy from the two gallon bottle into the pail—Price was standing by her—a Mrs. Cooper was also there—I took Price into custody, and found a quart bottle in his pocket containing rum—there was some brandy on the pavement near where Price was standing—Ambridge took him to the station, and took possession of the bottles—he said, "I have done nothing."</p>

                  </hi> I am barman to Mr. Thomas Jarmaine, of the Grapes', Old-street. On this morning, a few minutes before five o'clock, I was roused by a ring at the bell, went down stairs, and found a policeman in charge of the door—the bar was in a very disturbed state—the glasses had been used, and brandy was spilled about the counter and on the floor, and some cakes were gone from some glass globes—I guaged the brandy-vats, and from No. 12 missed about nine gallons—it could be got from the foun<lb></lb>tain on the bar, which communicates with the vats by pipes—this two-gallon stone jar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my master's—I missed some bottles from the ware-house adjoining the bar—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them—the brandy found is of the same kind as we have in the vat—I went to the station, between half-past seven and eight, and found both prisoners there in custody—I was there shown some cakes—they were the same sort as were missing from the bar—I was also shown a dozen metal wine bottle labels, which are Mr. Jar<lb></lb>maine's property—I shut up the house the night before at eleven o'clock—I was the last up, and saw all safe—the door which the policeman was in charge of was barred and bolted—when I was rung up I found a window open in the warehouse, leading to a gallery—the window opens into the back-yard—there were a pair of large 4 steps kept in the back-yard—a person could, by raising those steps on to a shed, get through the window—we found the steps against the window—they had been kept against a hay-loft—that window was open the night before—it is generally open to air the place—I saw a rope suspended from the rail of the gallery, by which a person could swing himself down into the warehouse—Higham had been in Mr. Jarmaine's employment occasionally for eight or nine days—that would enable him to know the nature of the premises—I have seen Price there also.</p>

On 16th May I saw the prisoner come to the bar; the last witness served him—he laid down a shilling—I took it and bit it in half—I asked him where he got it; he said from No. 13 or 14, Union-street, from his cousin, in change for a half crown—he was going, but I said. "Stop a minute; I took one last night"—I reached that one from the back of the counter, laid it on the bar, and was in</p>

On 16th May I was sent for to the Rose and Crown, and the prisoner was given into my custody—as we were going to the station, he asked if lead would poison—I said, no doubt there were some injurious properties belonging to it, as it was not intended for food—I searched him at the station, and all the money he had was 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—after he was committed, he said, on the way to Newgate, "You had no occa<lb></lb>sion to say anything about the lead"—he refused to give his address—he said if he could get out of this, he would go for a soldier.</p>

I confess I did swallow the shilling, and my motive was to keep myself out of trouble, as I thought he would swear that I gave him that also.</p>

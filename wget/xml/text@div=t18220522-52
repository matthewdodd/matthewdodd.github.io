            . The prisoner is my wife's sister, she was at our room; I gave her the watch to hang up on the mantle-piece. I was reading my book - a man was sitting by who went away between eight and nine o'clock. My wife asked me to go to bed; I asked the time. The prisoner got up and took the patchwork by the mantle-piece. I did not see her take the watch, but I saw a tea-spoon in her hand which she brought back next day. I missed the watch next morning, it was safe after the man left. My wife was sober. I did not know till next morning that it was gone. My wife did not tell me that the prisoner took it till next day about ten o'clock. I would sooner lose it than interfere with them about it.</p>

On Thursday, the 26th of April, when she was gone, I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; I did not find any thing till the pawnbroker brought to my house two spoons, her name is Mr. Parr; my initials and my husband's are upon them.</p>
               <p>- PARR sworn - I am a pawnbroker; I live at No. 3, High-street, St. Giles's: I received these spoons, I produce, on Thursday, the 26th of April, from the prisoner, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; she required half a guinea on them, when she brought them to pledge; I asked her who they belonged to, and she said they were the property of her mother; I asked her where her mother lived, and she said, at No. 4, Long-acre; she told me that No. 4 was a chandler's shop; I told her I thought it was not; she then hesitated, and said she might make a mistake; I told her I did not like to take them in of her; I desired her to fetch her mother, she agreed to fetch her mother, but wished to take the spoons with her; I told her I should detain the spoons till her mother came; there was with her, when she came, a girl of about twelve years of age; I then laid an information before Mr. Bond; I produce the two spoons. (The spoons identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>- HARVEY sworn. - I produce two gowns pledged by Mrs. Peters.</p>

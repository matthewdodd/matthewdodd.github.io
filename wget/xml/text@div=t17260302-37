             thus depos'd, I have known the Prisoner ever since he came out of Newgate. One Day when I came to shave him, he told me he was a dead Man if he was taken, for his Name was in the News, and therefore he always carry'd Pistols about him, and intended to leave the Country, and then he shew'd me a News Paper, in which William Gates, alias Vulcan, was requir'd to surrender, and he said that he was the Man. The Jury found him to be the same Person. <rs id="t17260302-37-punish160" type="punishmentDescription">

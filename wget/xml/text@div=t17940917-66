               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - I have seen him before in my shop. I remember he came to my house on Friday the 15th of August, in the afternoon, between the hours of four and six.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come alone? - He was in company with a woman. When the prisoner at the bar came into the shop, he asked to look at some pistols; that was an article for sale in our shop; the pistols were shewn him. He asked for pocket books likewise; they were shewn him; he fixed on a pair of pistols and a pocket book, the price of both were two guineas and a half. He said to the woman that was along with him, give us what you have got; have you got some gold about you? The immediate reply she made I don't know, because I was in a hurry.</p>

            Did she give any gold to the prisoner? - Not to my knowledge; I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170147"></xptr>see any given. The prisoner presented the note which I have in my pocket; he laid it on the counter before me, saying, I suppose you have no objection to that; I examined the note, finding it to be a country note. I observed, that I had an objection to them in general; since the failure of country banks I had not taken them with that alacrity I had before done; I don't know he made any sort of reply. I took the note, and gave it to my apprentice. He is here.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did you give it to your apprentice? - To take it in for the inspection of my next door neighbour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your apprentice take the note away with him to your next door neighbour? - He did.</p>
               <p>

            After he had taken it into your next door neighbour, did any conversation pass between you and the prisoner Ross? - After the apprentice was gone, Ross and myself sell into some conversation. The first conversation was respecting the woman that was with him; she had two sad black eyes. I was commisserating the misfortune of the woman; Ross informed me, that she was subject to sits, and had fell down and hurt herself in that manner. Previous to my taking the note, he had observed, that he was in a very great hurry, going to set off in the coach, he was fearful he should be too late for the Sussex coach; he said he was going to Steyning. I should not have taken any further notice of it, but during the time my apprentice was gone, about five or six minutes, Ross seemed greatly agitated.</p>

            Did he say any thing more about Steyning? - He represented himself either as a Custom house officer or a smugler, or words to that effect, either one or the other, residing at Steyning. After this he observed to me, if he was to drop me half an anchor of rum or Holland's, or some spirituous liquor, whether I would take it or no. I observed to him, that I should not take any thing of the kind; that I was certain it was worth no person's while to run any sort of a risk. My apprentice returned, bringing the note back; I observed that to be the same note that I gave him, saying, my next door neighbour said he should take it; Ross was by at this time; that Robert Herries was a very good house. I then took the note, desiring Ross to indorse it; he indorsed the note, Ross only, no addition to it. I then asked him for his address. I took down Ross, in Sussex; near Steyning, on a separate piece of paper, left any thing should transpire. After this I gave him a five pound Bank note, two guineas in gold, and five shillings and six-pence in silver; that, together with the sum of the pistols and the pocket book, made up ten pounds. Ross asked me to indorse the Bank note which I gave him. I told him, it was not necessary; it was not like country bills; it was payable any where; then he went away, and I sent the note to Sir Robert Herries' banking house within a few minutes by the same apprentice. His name is John Simpson.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you see the prisoner write his name on the back of that note? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Has that note been in your possession ever since? - It has the greatest part of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say, that that is the same note? - I am, because I saw the prisoner write his name on it. I am sure it is the same note.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards did you see the prisoner at the bar? - On the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the result of your sending the nore to Herries for acceptance? - I hat it was a bad one, a sorged one; they refused the note. The note was brought back to me, refused pay<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170148"></xptr>ment. On the Monday following I saw the prisoner at the bar again in the Poultry compter.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him in the Poultry compter did any thing pass between you? - I told him I was sorry to see that he had been guilty of such a thing, and to see him in that situation he was in; he said, he was very unfortunate; it was the first thing he had ever attempted in his life; he had never been before a magistrate in his life, and that he had no intent whatever to defraud; that the notes were given to him by his brother-in-law, in an account standing between them of seventy five or eighty-five pounds, I will not take on me to say which. I then enquired of him if he had any other notes? he answered that he had. I told him I was sorry that they had not all remained in his possession, it would have saved me the trouble of coming there; I then asked him, as he had had so much money of me, where the pistols were that he had of me? he said the pistols were at a friend's, or words to that effect. I then enquired at what friend's, or where, if I could not get them? he then answered that he did not know, but he would send the pistols to me; I enquired where, he, the prisoner, lived, if I could apply at his house, knowing, by his being in prison that he did not live at Steyning; he then told me that he lived at the King's arms yard, High Holborn, No. 13, on the second gallery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Bull and gate yard - It may be so; he told me the right place then, because I found it out. I went to his lodgings to enquire for his wife; I saw nobody there but three little children, who told me their mother was not come home. I went the following morning, which was the Tuesday morning; I was admitted into his apartment, where I had been before in the same yard, the same number where he had described to me before, where I saw the very woman who was with him at my shop; from the extreme misery that I saw of the man's family, I declined further pursuit till I was called upon by the banker. There was not a single thing in the room but the bed rolled up in the corner, and three naked children.</p>
               <p>Q. At the Poultry-compter, or at any other time, was you present when the prisoner was searched? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this was it that you was desired to attend at Bow-street? - I never attended at Bow-street at all; I attended at the Mansion-house; I believe it was the Saturday following; there I gave the same account that I have now related.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. You seem to be so inaccurate in this conversation, that you cannot tell whether he described himself as a Custom-house officer or a smuggler? - I was very busy at that time.</p>
               <p>

            While the apprentice was gone with the bill he gave you the reason why he was agitated; for fear he should lose his stage? - He told me so; and what makes me so correct in this business, I copied every thing that transpired, when I found it was a bad note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said Horsham, not Steyning. - I am certain to the place he mentioned; it was Steyning; because I looked at the Directory, to see what time the coach went off that time in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>I am constable; I was present when Ross was taken into custody on the same charge, and I attempted to search him at Mr. Crouch's; he said he wanted to go to the necessary. I went with him into the yard, and I attempted to search him in the yard; when I did that, he refused to go to the necessary then; he said, now he did not want to go, and we returned into the parlour of Mr. Crouch.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not examine him then? - Not immediately; no further than the attempt. We took a coach, and going along in the coach, I told him that I should strip him naked when I got him to St. James's-street, for I suspected he had notes about him. On my saying that, he put his hand to the back part of the waistband of his breeches, took out this pocket-book, and gave it me. I examined it, and found two notes in it; there was also an order in it to press men, which I gave him up; he begged for mercy both of me and Mr. Crouch; I told him I did not wish him any ill, I must take him to the house where I was going. It was at Mr. Crouch's, a pawnbroker, in Fore-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170150"></xptr>street, a near neighbour, where he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, The prisoner voluntarily gave up these notes, I believe, telling you that if one was sorged they were all sorged? - He told me he had taken them of his brother only.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say they were all alike, or something to that effect? - I don't know that he did.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of the prisoner at the bar living at Steyning? - No, not during the last fourteen years, I can positively say that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. These notes I received of my brother for money sent, seventy-five pounds eighteen shillings, at the Castle, in Devizes; there were gentlemen in the room in the mean time that the money was paid to me; and whether he might know that they were sorged or no I cannot say. I left one of the notes with Mr. Crouch from Saturday till Monday before I called for the balance of the note. On Monday I called for the note, and he told me, Mr. Ross come in; have you had any thing to drink this morning? I told him no; and he asked me to breakfast with him, and I went to breakfast with him; and at breakfast he says, Frank, I am afraid that the bill is sorged that you have left. I told him, I received it of my brother. My brother was going as captain's cook of the Argonant? he was a man cook, just paid off from the Syren. I was going to take an eating house with the money; and I told Mr. Essex I was going to take an eating house or public house at Horsham, and was going by the Steyning coach.</p>

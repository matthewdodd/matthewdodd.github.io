                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon of St. George's Hospital. The deceased, William Iles, was brought there on the 2nd of May, about six o'clock in the afternoon—I believe he was led there—he could stand—he had a contused wound, about an inch long, above the right eyebrow—he also appeared to have bad concussion of the brain, from which he was recovering—I sent him to bed—the wound went down nearly to the bone, but not quite exposing it—I am quite sure it was inflicted by a blunt instrument—he appeared to have lost some blood, but not much—I did not bleed him—I applied something to the wound, and gave him calomel—he was a very old man, and it would not have been right to bleed him—on the following morning he was much better, the wound looked healthy, and he was perfectly sensible—he said he wished to leave the hospital—I advised him strongly to stop, and told him he was not out of danger—I expected inflammation of the brain or erysipelas might follow, either of which might end fatally—he left that morning—he came again on the 7th, and then had erysipelas of the head and face, which I should think had been on him two or three days—it was of a very low character, snow<lb></lb>ing that the powers of life were much depressed—the wound was still un<lb></lb>healed, still open—it was looking dry, but not otherwise unhealthy—I ordered him to bed, and all was done that could be done to arrest the progress of the erysipelas, but he died on the morning of the 10th of May—the cause of death was the erysipelas and its effects—I could not say positively that it was produced by the wound—erysipelas of the head and face sometimes occurs without any injury, and, as it came on when he was out of the hospital, I could not say positively that it was produced by the wound—it is probable, but I cannot say.</p>

Snoakes was sitting at the side of the bar: he said, Why don't you pay my mistress the farthing? Upon that the prisoner gave Snoakes a shove, by which he was near falling into the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the situation of your house.</p>
               <p>Lewis. You come down steps into the house, and then your go a little way up to the bar. and the cellar stairs are near the bar. Upon the prisoner's shoving Snoakes in that manner, Snoakes struck him on the head on face; the prisoner returned the blow, and then passed about three blows between them. Reynolds, the man that waters the horses, came in much about this time; he endeavoured to keep order, and he bid the prisoner go about his business, or he would charge the watch with him; upon that, the prisoner and the two woman went away. I could not see the prisoner go out at the door, as I stood at the bar but I suppose he did not go out, Snoakes staid talking to me; he complained that the prisoner had broke his whip. In about two minutes after the prisoner was gone, Snoakes left the bar, and went out, as I thought to go home in about two minutes, Snoakes came into the house again, and said he was stabbed, and that he had received his death's wound from the foreigner; he took off his coat, and I noticed that the back of his shirt was bloody and I saw the wound between his shoulders. A surgeon was sent for, who came in a few minutes; before the surgeon came, Reynolds and Styles brought the prisoner back into the house.</p>

            . I stopt at the coach and horses between twelve and one that night to water my horses. I saw the prisoner, the deceased, and two women standing by the side of the bar; the prisoner and Snoakes were disputing about the farthing; Snoakes said nothing more than this; why don't you pay my mistress the farthing, he might, perhaps, call him dirty fellow; the prisoner said I have no money and will pay no more; he then offered to go towards the door, and Snoakes stood at the door, and he lifted up his elbow, as if he meant to prevent the prisoner's going out, without paying the farthing: the prisoner, upon this, struggled with Snoakes to get out of the house, and in the struggle Snoakes's whip was broke; Snoakes said I am sorry you have broke my whip, for I have had it two or three years; immediately upon that, Snoakes struck the prisoner a blow on the side of his head, over his eye, so that some blood ran down his cheek; the prisoner returned it, by giving him a punch on the belly, which would have knocked him down the cellar, but he caught hold of the cellar door, which is about three yards from the street door. At this time Reynolds came in, and asked what the disturbance was about, and he told them that if they did not go out of the house he would charge the watch with them; upon that, the two girls said that the prisoner was a substantial man, and lived next door to the Crown, on the other side of the bridge. He laid hold of his arm and led him: out of doors; Snoakes staid at the bar with me a minute or two: I asked him if he would go home, he said he would; we both went out together, both our coaches were at the door. I was getting up upon the box, and as Snoakes was about getting upon his box, I heard a voice, which appeared to be the prisoner's, calling out, come here, and I will pay you for your whip. I looked and saw the prisoner and the two girls about twelve or fourteen yards from the door of the Coach and Horses, crossing Palace Yard, in the direction to the passage that goes in to Bridge street; so that he was standing in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230023"></xptr> middle of Palace Yard. I cannot pretend to say whether the prisoner and the two women were standing still or walking, when I heard the voice: we had not been out of the house above two or three minutes, before I heard the voice call out: Snoakes went directly up to the prisoner, upon hearing the voice, and said to the prisoner, what do you want with me: I saw the deceased go up to the prisoner, and as soon as he came up to him, immediately one of them fell; I could not at that time tell which it was, and immediately I saw the other run away: I saw no blows pass. I observed the women left the prisoner before the deceased got up to him. Presently the man that fell got up again, and it appeared afterwards to be Snoakes. I walked towards him, and he said for God's sake stop him, for he has stabbed me: he was holding both his hands upon his breast. Styles and I run after the prisoner; I saw him run out at the corner, towards Westminster-bridge. I called out stop thief; Reynolds ran through the passage that goes into Bridge street; Reynolds and Styles had stopped him in Bridge street, near the end of that passage, before I came up; I collared him, and we brought him back to the Coach and Horses: he was loath to go into the house; as he was going into the house the deceased met him with his hands upon his breast, and said he was a dead man; a surgeon was sent for, and he came directly. I went away and left them all in the house; I came back again in about ten minutes; then I saw the surgeon had just dressed him, and put a blister on him; I did not see the wound at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did the deceased fall after the prisoner got up to him?</p>
               <p>Twine. He fell the moment the prisoner got up to him.</p>

            . I am the watering man. I was not in the house when the prisoner and Snoakes went into the Coach and Horses. I heard the prisoner and Snoakes have words together, so I went into the house, to put an end to the disturbance. I bid them all go about their business, or I would charge the watch with them. I took the prisoner by the arm, and led him out of the house. I did not see any blows pass in the house; Snoakes staid about two minutes after the prisoner was gone out, and then he gave me a penny, and bid me good night. He was just putting his foot upon the wheel, in order to get upon the box, when I heard a voice call out, come here, and I will pay you for your whip. Snoakes got down and went forward to where the voice came from, at that time I observed a man and two women standing in Palace Yard, about twelve or fourteen yards from Snoakes's coach; they were standing still, and as Snoakes got up to him the women went away; the horses interposed, so that I could not not see him when he got close to the prisoner; but within two minutes, from the time of his leaving the coach, in order to go up to the man, I saw Snoakes returning, holding his hand upon his breast, and calling out to stop the man, for he had received his death's wound; at the same time I saw the man running away. Twine and Styles ran to the corner of the yard after him; I ran through the passage into Bridge street; as soon as I got into Bridge street I saw the prisoner walking along, and Styles was close behind him; he laid hold of him, presently after I joined him, and we took him to the Coach and Horses; there we found Snoakes. I searched the prisoner, and found only some brass work about him . The deceased said I am bleeding to death, and he said you are a villain, pointing to the prisoner; and he said that if he had broke his leg or his arm, he could have forgiven him, but now it would deprive his family of his assistance, if his life was to go; and he said that the prisoner was the man that wounded him; the prisoner was by when he said this, and made no answer to it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the prisoner a wound in his face before he went out of the house?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. There was a cut over his eye as if it had been done with a knuckle; three days afterwards I saw the prisoner, and he had a black eye; the prisoner was searched at the watch-house; and there was a knife found upon him.</p>

I went into the yard a little before one o'clock; I bid the waterman water my horses; I stood by to see it done; I heard a disturbance in the house; I did not go in directly; presently I saw the prisoner come out and the two women; I walked, I believe, ten or twenty yards from the Coach and Horses. door, towards the passage that goes into Bridge-street;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230024"></xptr> presently I saw the coachman come out, grumbling about his whip; he was going towards the passage that leads to Bridge street, the two women left him, and then I saw him turn round and stop, with his face towards the Coach and Horses: the prisoner had turned about before Snoakes came out of the house.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Styles. There was no other man in the yard as I could see; the deceased walked to him; one of them dropt immediately as he came up to him; I could not see which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased all the way till he came up to him?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe whether Snoakes turned about, or had his back towards you or the man?</p>
               <p>Styles. I will not pretend to say that; I obobserved one fall the moment Snoakes came up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you tell whether it was the man that stood still, or he that walked up to him, that fell?</p>
               <p>Styles. They both stood still, and then one immediately fell. I heard Snoakes then cry out (for I knew it was his voice) Stop him, for God's sake, for he has stabbed me with a knife. I immediately ran after the prisoner, to the farther end of Palace-yard. He crawled up that high part, and ran towards the Bridge. I struck a blow at him, but I missed him; then I seized him by the collar: he was stronger than me, and made from me; then I got hold of him again, and then Twine and Reynolds came up and laid hold of him: we took him to the Coach and Horses: he was not willing to go into the house; Twine pulled him in, and Snoakes met him at the door, with his hands to his breast; and he said to the prisoner, O you bloody minded man! you have murdered me! blood for blood! We had a hard matter to keep him from the prisoner, as he wanted to attack him. The prisoner made no answer to that, but looked very sulky: he never spoke a word to me. The watchmen took him to the watch-house. I went there soon afterwards. I saw Mr.

Here is blood upon it: the blood appeared fresh at that time; it stuck together so that Mr. Wylde could hardly open it; a good deal of the blood is wore off; some is on now: I tried to open it; but it stuck so fast that I could not open it; Mr. Wilson asked him a question or two; but could get nothing out of him; it was as much as we could do to get out of him where he lived.</p>

            . I was constable of the night; on the 7th of September, about one o'clock in the morning, Twine, Reynolds, and a watchman or two, brought the prisoner into the watch-house: as soon as he came in, he sat down, very sulky: Mr. Twine had a shirt in his hand, all over bloody, and he said the prisoner had murdered Snoakes. I searched him as he sat, and took this knife out of his right breeches pocket; it was shut, and all over blood for about two inches and an half high.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it fresh blood, or had it been there some time?</p>
               <p>Wilson. It was rather dry; it had a shining colour, and looked quite fresh. I could hardly get him to tell his name. When I took the knife from him, I asked him if he had any more of those sort of weapons; he said, No. I went to the Coach and Horses, and there were two bundles in different papers, and some pieces of cast brass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any raw meat in the handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No; I did not examine the bundles.</p>

            . I am the deceased's widow. The first night he came home he was not sensible; he desired me a few days afterwards not to wash his shirt; he said that no blows had ensued at the time the accident happened: he was sensible when he said this and was so for about a week.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he sensible when he said that no blow passed at the time he received the wound?</p>
               <p>Snoakes. Yes; he said that about four days before he died.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jessamin. I was called to the deceased on the 7th of September, about one in the morning;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230025"></xptr> when the person came for me, I was not gone to bed. I cedded to see the wound; upon drawing up his shirt, I found a wound a full inch in length passing from the right side of the spine, evidently made with a cutting instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean a pointed as well as cutting instrument?</p>
               <p>Jessamin. It is hardly possible to say, because of the breadth of the wound. The wound passed across from the right side to the left, where it went in to a considerable depth I found it necessary to dilate it, which I did immediately, in order, if possible, to discover the nature of the injury; with my finger I felt the rib bare at the bottom of the wound; there was a prodigious quantity of blood flowing from the wound; from which circumstances, and the depth of the wound. I judged that it might have penetrated the cavity of the chest. I could not be certain of this point at that time. I desired to see the instrument with which the wound was inflicted, as I might form some prognostic from that; but it could not be produced at that time. I saw the deceased again the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any cut in his shirt?</p>
               <p>Jessamin. There was a cut in his coat and waistcoat corresponding to the wound. I attended him regularly, and finding his pulse raged, I continued to bleed him and keep him low. I imagined there was mischief within. In the course of this treatment, I separated some splinters of bone that I found loose in the wound. On the Friday after he received the wound, bad symptoms increased very fast upon him. Imagining there was a wound in the lungs, I desired a physician might be called in, and Dr. Morris attended him: he grew worse, and died on Tuesday the 17th of September. I opened the body after his decease, in the presence of Dr. Morris, and several pupils belonging to my hospital. On opening the cavity of the chest on that side where the wound was received, the plura, or membrane that lines the chest, was full of dusky inflammation; bordering upon what we call gangrene. I raised up the lungs, and perceived at the back part of the thorax a wound entering in and passing the membrane of the plura; and upon the superior lobe of the lungs, on the left side, there was a small wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your opinion that this wound was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Jessamin. In my opinion it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think such a knife as that might have occasioned the wound?</p>
               <p>Jessamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form an idea what situation the body was in when it received the wound?</p>
               <p>Jessamin. I can't say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Could such a wound be made if the parties were standing face to face?</p>
               <p>Jessamin. I should imagine it very difficult, if the person's back was not turned. I think it most likely that the deceased's back was turned when the wound was given; it must be a very tall man else to inflict the wound in that manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased taller or shorter than the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Jessamin. I believe about the same size.</p>
               <p>[Note, the prisoner was rather short.]</p>
               <p>Q In what condition was he as to his understanding?</p>
               <p>Jessamin. His understanding was sufficiently free, till within three days of his death.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I went from home to Chiswell-street, Moorfields, to Alexander's foundery, and fetched some brass, which I was to use for Mr. Cox's work in Shoe-lane. I bought a piece of beef in Clare-market, of a out 5 or 6 lb. I had a pair of leather breeches I had fetched from cleaning; when I came to the corner of Parliament-street, with my bundle in my hand, two girls came to me and asked me to give them something to drink. I agreed to it, and they took me to the Coach and Horses; they had a glass of something; I had a farthing too little for the reckoning; I told the landlady, when I came that way again I would make her a recompence; she seemed very agreeable; when I turned about there was the coachman leant against the wainscot opposite the bar; he called me names, and said, How dare you come here to treat girls, and have no money? and things to that purpose. I said, What is that to you? He gave me a blow directly, and the blood burst over my clothes; the blood is now upon my coat and waistcoat, and the fear is in my face; the girls cried out, The gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230026"></xptr> is used ill; Go out, and take the number of his coach; he prevented my going out; I got out at last; they said I broke his whip in getting out; I don't know whether I did or not. When I came to the coach, I could not see the number, it was so dark, and I bled so. I went from the coach, he halloo'd after me, and said I was a thief, that I was robbing his coach. I went from the coach as fast as I could; I thought I was among strange people, and had no friend with me; therefore I thought I was in danger of being ten times more beaten, so I ran away from the coach, about the distance of fifteen or twenty yards; the girls left me, the deceased came up to me, and I was afraid of him; he gave me a blow upon my breast and broke my rib, any body may feel now that my rib is broke; he broke my rib with his right hand, and he struck me at the same time on my eye with his left hand. I told him he should not use me ill; that I would stand upon my defence. After I had received that unmerciful blow upon my rib - I don't know how it happened; it was dark, and my eyes were blinded up. I had the knife, and I don't know how it happened; after that, he caught me and brought me into the public house, and there he took from me ha I had, except the bit of beef; he threw that, as if for the dog, upon the table; then they carried me to the watch-house, and locked me up. I was used in a barbarous manner. Here is a person come here by accident, and he saw how I looked. My head was beat about just like a sheep's head that comes out of a butcher's shop.</p>

            . I am an organ-builder, and live in Compton-street, Soho; I saw the prisoner the Sunday after the affair happened; his eyes appeared very black; I tried with my hand, and felt one of his ribs deeper than the rest; I did not see his body, I only felt. I have known him eleven or twelve years, I never heard of any complaint in his ribs before this. He has the character of a very honest man.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. If your Lordship pleases Mr. Jessamin shall examine the prisoner's ribs. (Mr. Jessamin examines the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Jessamin. There is an inequality that there should not be.</p>
               <p>Q. Is his rib broke?</p>
               <p>Jessamin. Probably it may have been; it is almost impossible to say that: I believe it has.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say how recently it may have been broke?</p>
               <p>Jessamin. When once the ribs are united it is impossible to say that; it is impossible to say whether it has been broke a month or a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that if it had been broke by a blow at that time, it might have been in the state it now is?</p>
               <p>Jessamins. It might.</p>

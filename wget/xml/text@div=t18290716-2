            . I am servant to Mr. Thompson, a salesman, of the Borough skin-market. Last Saturday week, between one and two o'clock, twenty skins were brought for sale by Lancashire Jack (Flitcroft) - I understand he goes by that name; they were sold, and he received the money for them - they were marked on the head or down the neck, and across the loin, with red ochre; I cannot say whether they were all marked the same way -I only turned one over, and saw it; they were sold to Corderoy, a fellmonger, of Bermondsey - I should know them again: I went to Corderoy's afterwards, to look for them - they were among five hundred more; the fellmonger picked them out, but I recognized them; they are here(looking at two) - these are the same skins I received from Flitcroft.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.They were pulled out by Corderoy, and shown to you? A. Yes - he did not say they were what he bought of me - he pulled out a good many more, and these were picked out from them; a red ochre mark is very common - there were no letters to my knowledge: Lancashire Jack received 7s. 8d. for them, which was more than he ought to have had; they were sold for 5 1/2d. each, and are not worth more; the general price was 6d. - we sold them in the public market; I never saw Flitcroft before, but have no doubt he is the man.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Farringdon within. I was in Pocklington's shop on the Saturday, about twelve o'clock - I was speaking to Mr. Pocklington about stopping the account, when Henderson came in, and asked for the account in my presence: I asked him who he had brought the sheep from - he told me from a person named Brown; he did not know where he lived, but he could find the man if I went with him, and I went with him - he said he was to meet him at the end of the Minories, to receive the account of the sheep; I went there with him, but met no person - we went into a public-house, three doors beyond the Minories, and looked round there, thinking he might be waiting there, as it rained very hard, but could not find him; he said he should be sure to find him at the Ten Bells, Spitalfields - we went there, and saw the landlord, the servant, and the pot-boy, but no such person as Brown was known: he said he was a master butcher, and had employed him as a porter; I brought him back to Mr. Pocklington, in Newgate-market, and saw Mr. Pocklington's nephew, who had refused him the account in the morning, and had directed me to his uncle, in Smithfield; I went there, and he told Mr. Pocklington that he was merely employed as a porter, and that he could bring Brown forward on Monday morning, and I suffered him to go, but took him into custody again about an hour after; White's-row, Spitalfields, is in the county of Middlesex.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you in the habit of selling sheep? A. Yes; the mark is not initials - I marked them in this way; I have sold others with the same mark, and so may a good many graziers in Essex - there is another mark on them, which would not be noticed; they had been shorn very badly, which disfigured them very much, and I ran the shears over them, and in doing so I found a small spot of paint, by which I know them: I saw eighteen of the skins, and on both these two there was a small piece of paint when they were found - I pulled it off - it is not visible now, for after skins have been in the pit the wood comes off very easily; I have no hesitation in swearing to these two skins, from the state they were in when I took them out of the pit, and here is the ochre mark, which I swear is the mark I put on them; there was a spot of a mixture called paint, which sheep are dotted with - it was on these two skins, but came off on my touching them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. It was on them when you first found them? A. Yes, at Corderoy's - I identified them as they came out of the pit; three or four hundred were pulled out - I saw that private mark on five or six of them, but being in water the least thing will make it come off; I had seen that mark on most of them when I sold them to Mr. Vigne - it was not my own mark, I found it there when I marked them; I bought them of a Mr. Tye, a sheep-salesman, in Smithfield - he is not here.</p>

            . I was in custody on this charge, and have been admitted a witness for the Crown. On Thursday afternoon, the 2d of July, I was coming up Whitechapel-market, and met the two prisoners in company; Henderson asked me if I was willing to go and earn 1l., for he had bought some sheep in the country - I said Yes, I was very poor, and much in need of it; we went through Clapton, and beyond Lee-bridge, all three together - we went to a field - Henderson opened the gate, and said those were his sheep: I do not know how he opened the gate, for he was before us - I do not see what he did to the gate; Wilson and I went in, and brought out twenty sheep - we brought them through Stratford, up the Mile-end-road; I took them to No. 9, White's-row - Henderson left us before we got there, and came to meet us again a little before we got to White's-row; we stopped to have a drop of beer, near the Globe, but Henderson had left us as soon as we came out of the field. The sheep were slaughtered at No. 9, White's-row that day, and taken to market; Henderson, I, and Wilson slaughtered them; I got to White's-row, about three o'clock: after they were slaughtered, six sheep were taken to Leadenhall-market, five to Mr. Challis, and one to Mr. Cross - four were sent to Mr. Mason's, of Newgate-market, and four to Mr. Boyce: Henderson told me he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160006"></xptr>delivered them at Boyce's - five went to Mr. Pocklington's; I delivered them there, and told Henderson I had done so- I did not go for the account: the other one was cut into pieces - one of the sheep at Pocklington's was without a leg: the skins were taken by me to Mr. Thompson's, Borough-market, for sale - I took twenty there; I laid them down at Thompson's to be sold by commission - I received 7s. 8d. for them; 8d. being the commission at 5 1/2d. each, that would be 8s. 4d.: I left the carcases for sale in the name of Brown, of Spitalfields - I do not know such a person; Henderson told me to leave them in that name.

Because I came from Lancashire - there is no other reason that I know of; I had not the slightest idea the sheep were stolen: Henderson was a very few minutes before us, and when we got there the gate was open - Henderson stood there, and said those were his sheep; I saw the gate, but observed no chain to it: I have heard the witnesses state where the sheep were disposed of - I heard there was a warrant out against me; I came into the neighbourhood directly, to be taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not strike you it would be best to give yourself up? A.Why, I should look better with clean linen, and went to my lodging to change myself; I was taken at my own lodging before I had shifted my linen - I was in custody about ten minutes before I told this story; I was not afraid for myself - it was for the sake of justice; it was more to my credit to state it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you suspect they were stolen? A. On Saturday evening; I was taken on Sunday morning -I did not give myself up on Saturday, as I did not wish to be in prison a night more than I need; I have heard of many sheep stealing cases in Lancashire, but was never charged with being concerned, that I swear - if I ever said so I told a lie, for I never was concerned: I have heard of many a forgery in Lancashire - I was accused of being concerned in a forgery in Lancashire, but not of sheep stealing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you abscond? A.Necessity compelled me to go, for want of work; it was not to avoid being taken up- my friends compromised the case; I paid the man the money for the bill myself: there never was a warrant out against me for forgery; I have been accused of something else - I am not obliged to tell for what; I was accused at Guildhall respecting some fat, the property of Lemington and Co. - it was beef fat; I was not accused of stealing - cwt. from the man the fat was sold to - I do not know Back; I was never accused of stealing - cwt. from any body.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, were you not accused of stealing - cwt.? A. I am not obliged to answer that; I do not know where Back's is - I never was accused of stealing a - cwt. to my knowledge; I do not recollect it - I never was charged with it in my life; I have mentioned every thing I have been accused of to the best of my knowledge - I have been in town about seven years, and am married; I do not know where my wife is - I saw her last, four or five months ago in Somerset-street; I have now come from Giltspur-street - I have not been in Newgate; I do not know that my wife is in prison: I remember a - cwt. being put into the fat sack to make it weigh heavier - I was not accused of stealing it; I did not put it into the fat.</p>
               <p>Q.You did not know it was there? A.That has been already tried; I went and sold the skins by Henderson s order - he hired me; I had known him about three months - we started from Whitechapel to fetch the sheep between five and six o'clock in the evening; it was morning when we got the sheep out - I never did such a thing before, but Henderson said they were his; we went a long way beyond Lee-bridge for them - it might be eight, nine, or ten miles.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course Henderson paid you the pound? A. I received money for it; he authorised me to take the mo-money from Cross - I got 1l. 5s. 6d., which I kept - I received the money for the skins, and made 25s. of the sheep that was cut up: I had to account to him for the balance: Cross did not ask if I knew Brown - I acted as Henderson's servant; I have been out of service some time - I have jobbed about the market, and been haymaking when the weather admitted; I was last in the service of Mr. Brown, a carcase-butcher, of Whitechapel - he turned me away for neglecting his work, and getting drunk; he never charged me with theft to my knowledge- I give evidence for the sake of public justice, and to save myself certainly; I expect if they are convicted, I shall get off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wilson. Q.Were you not aware that I was engaged to go for the sheep, and did you not see me paid? A.He told me he was engaged, and I saw him receive 10s. from Henderson's hands.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was that paid in your presence? A. It was; Wilson asked him for some money - he said if he would go to the Queen's Head, White's-row, he would give him some; we went there together - he gave him 10s., and said was that sufficient, and was he satisfied for his labour - Wilson said Yes; I have seen Wilson before, but was not much acquainted with him - he was present when Henderson asked if I would earn 1l., and heard what was said; I did not know where the sheep were to go to - he said he should go before us, and prepare a place, and meet us in Osborne-street, near Whitechapel; he went on alone to the field before us to open the gate: I do not think Wilson was present when he told me to deliver the carcases in the name of Brown - I did not see Wilson after he received the 10s., till he was in custody; I never knew Henderson deal in sheep before - he was a butcher, and I have been a butcher: I had known Henderson for three or four months.</p>
               <p>Henderson's Defence. Three parts of what Flitcroft has said is false: I never employed him, nor went to get the sheep.</p>
               <p>Wilson's Defence. I met Henderson on Thursday morning, about eleven or twelve o'clock; he asked if I had any thing to do - I said No; he said he had some sheep he was going into the country with, for a man, and was ordered to engage a man - if I would go I should have a few shillings for my trouble; I went and helped to lay them down to slaughter - they were done up, and I went to the public-house, received 10s., and saw no more of him.</p>

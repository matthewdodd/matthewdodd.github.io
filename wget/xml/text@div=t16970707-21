The Evidence deposed, That a Gentleman called to know if she was within, and she told him that she was above Stairs; then he went his ways:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16970707003"></xptr>and when she came down into the Parlour, she told her a Gentleman had been there to speak with her, and that she had seen him before. And she replied, It was no great matter, and went down to her Husband. Then he did ask what Fellow that was at the Pails; and he going to pursue him, she catcht hold of him, and he took the Knife and gave her the said Wound; and on a sudden she heard a skreeching out; then she took the Child in her Arms and went down, where the Deceased lay wallowing in her Gore; then the Prisoner said that she was dead, and was Whore enough. Another Evidence said, That he did meet him coming up Stairs, and he askt him what was the matter: and he replied, You will see what is the matter, for she has been a Whore long enough. And after he had done this bloody Act, he came to the Lady Nevill, and fell upon his Knees, and said, That he had killed her, and begged her pardon. He alledged, That she had been a very ill Woman a long time; and that she kept company with one Clun, which he had forbad her to do; that she went out for one day, and tarried out two Nights, which he knew not till afterwards; he said, that Clunne had Lodgings hard by, and she went to him every Morning before he was up, and continued with him some hours. He said that she had abused him, and had taken his Trunk of Cloaths and carried them to Clunne's Lodgings. He made it appear, That he was in a great Rage at that time, thinking there by to extenuate his Crime; but the Jury having considered the matter, found him <rs id="t16970707-21-verdict122" type="verdictDescription">

Oswell and Co. No. 17, Crutched-Friars; I met him before, and he told me, he was in partnership with Mr. Oswell; on which, the next day, my waterman informed me, that the Betsey, a Rotterdamer, Captain Dixon, had arrived in the river; accordingly, I went to Mr. Disney's compting-house; on which, I told him, the Betsey had arrived, Captain Dixon, from Rotterdam; on which, he, the prisoner, opened a drawer, and took out a letter; in which, was this bill of lading; (holding it in his hand) he then took and indorsed it, and doubled it up; I do not know what he wrote on it; he said to me, there is a case on board, marked P. K. No. 1. containing seven hundred and fifty pieces of open tape; which he desired I would enter; on which, I said, I had no money; pshaw! he replied, you will have enough in your hands; you can but sell them and pay yourself, and pay me the overplus; on which, I shewed them to a person, and he said, they were too dear for him; I had got them from on board the Betsey, Captain John Dixon; he called a few days afterwards, and asked me if I had sold them, I said, no; on which, he asked me to let him have five guineas, which I let him have; in about an hour afterwards he recommended me to shew them to Mr. Smith, of Bread-street-hill; I did, and he said, they were too dear for him; there were seven sorts, and I recommended him to take a piece of each, and endeavour to sell them; he had no more than one of each sort, and I kept the rest; at that time I thought them to be his property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. The bill is addressed to Messrs. Mayne and Hodgson, or their assigns? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You could not deliver them to any body else? - Certainly not, unless the bill had been indorsed; some time afterwards, Disney came with a person of the name of Defrieze, and brought an order for the delivery of those goods, signed Mayne and Hodgson; Defrieze produced the order in the presence of the prisoner, in the names, of Mayne and Hodgson; upon that, when I opened the order, I told him, I would have nothing to do with him, but told him to go about his business; he said, he would have them; and I turned him (Defrieze) out of doors; Disney remained a little while; and I went, and looked at the bill of lading; I asked him what he meant by that, as I thought they were his; he said, he would have them away in a few days; and he went away; I did not know, when he first delivered me the bill of lading, that it was signed Mayne and Hodgson; when we do business for constant customers, we have no occasion for a bill of lading, we only want the marks and the contents, &amp;c. and we make our marks, and they deliver them to us; I saw him (Disney) afterwards at the compting-house; he told me not to be uneasy, for it should be soon taken out of our hands; I did not see him for six weeks afterwards; Oswell and Co. was rubbed off, about a fortnight after I saw him there. I and others have made enquiries, and cannot find any such partnership subsisting, as Mayne and Hodgson, in the city, nor bear of such a firm any where; I am sure the prisoner's name is Disney; he never carried on any business in that name; he said, he was partner with Mr. Oswell, and that they did a great deal of business; I found him afterwards in the street, and took him into custody.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Coussmaker. Is there such a firm at Harleigh? - No, sir, only Peter Clarinbank, to whom it went; I received both the letters back from him; I never remember Copps being in the firm.</p>
               <p>When did you receive them? - I believe, about a month ago.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Coussmaker. How long is corespondence, by letter, going and returning from Harleigh? - If by the mail, about eight days.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester to Hodgson. How long was you clerk to Disney? - About three months.</p>
               <p>Who was he in partnership with? - I do not know, but I understood with Mr. Oswell.</p>
               <p>How did you get the letters directed to Mayne and Hodgson? - I believe they came to Sam's coffee-house.</p>

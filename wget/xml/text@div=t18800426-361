                  </hi>. I am a physician—on 21st April I was staying at the Langham Hotel, and on that evening I went into the drawing-room with my wife—I placed my coat, and my wife placed her sealskin jacket on a side table—I left an umbrella in the hall—we left the room, and on returning three quarters of an hour afterwards I missed the articles, and made a communication to the manager—next evening at 6 o'clock a detective brought the articles to me—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I never saw the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private detective at the Langham Hotel—on 22nd April I was watching about the house—the prisoner had had a room there since the Saturday—I saw him go to his bedroom about 5.30, and followed him—I knocked at the door, and said to him "Have you found an overcoat which you stated you had lost last night?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Very strange things do happen; have you heard that a lady lost a sealskin jacket last night?"—he said "No"—I said "Strange things do happen; will you allow me to look round your room?"—he said "Yes, willingly," and I did so, and saw nothing but a portmanteau—I said "Will you allow me to look at that portmanteau 1"—he said "No, certainly not, I will go with you to see the manager if you like"—I said "I should like to see what that portmanteau contains," and stooped down and opened it, and saw the sealskin jacket and cap—I said "There is a silk handker<lb></lb>chief which cannot be found"—he said "Here it is," and took it out of his breast pocket—I gave him in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate.</hi> "After I had taken the coat, umbrella, and lady's jacket to my bedroom, I sat down on the bed and began to realise my position. At first a thought struck me that I would take them back; but on consideration I thought I would run down first to see if it was missed. When I got down I saw Dr. Bramwell talking to the manager. I then went to bed determined to speak to Dr. Bramwell in the morning. I went down and had breakfast, and walked about the hotel till midday. As I could see nothing of Dr. Bramwell, I went upstairs to get my pipe to have a smoke. When I opened my bedroom door I saw my portmanteau had been opened. I opened the drawer and saw some one had been there too. I took my pipe and went down to smoke. I waited till 5.45 without having seen Dr. Bramwell, and went up to wash before dinner. The detective then came and spoke to me."</p>

I saw the prisoner, about two o'clock in the morning, going from under the caravan; he went under the next van; I went and asked him what he wanted he said to ease himself; I saw him stoop down and pick up the box - he said some chaps had given it to him; I then inquired of my neighbours if they had lost any thing, and Mr. Jones owned the box.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see him next - A. I heard a great alarm; I went as far as Church-street, then I went to Bembridge-street. I heard a great row at the Ship.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the assembly that you first mentioned - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after you had seen White at the Hare and Hounds - A. Not above ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got near the Ship did you see White - A. Yes; I saw him knocked down, but to tell you who knocked him down I cannot. I saw

               <p>Q. Did you see Gallagher do any thing to White - A. No, I did not; Ragan did strike him; I could almost swear I saw him strike him a blow across the nose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see White picked up - A. I waited a good bit, and then I went away for fear I should be served the same.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was White from the Ship when he was knocked down - A. Not two yards. He was on the pavement. I went and leaned over White; I asked him to come home; he was not able to make me any answer. The crowd returned. Ragan said he was not dead. The deceased said in Irish, do not strike, and then they struck him with scaffolding poles. A man took him away.</p>

There were a good many people beating him as he was down.

The prisoner Gallagher was about five yards distance; he was standing upon the step of the Ship public-house door without a hat. I applied to him to assist me in preventing a party beating the deceased. Gallagher immediately assisted me to prevent the party from beating the deceased. When I applied to Gallagher, some of the mob were crying out in Irish to beat him; Gallagher cried out in Irish not to beat him, and immediately Gallagher and I shoved ourselves between the party that were beating the deceased, and after our interference the deceased did not receive any blow except from some person who kicked him on his legs. I know nothing more of White. I spoke to the party of the impropriety of their assembling in this way.</p>

They went off to Mr. Griffiths's, the Hand and Crown. I asked White to come home with me, and not to go with these rebellious characters. Some of these men had sticks in their hands.

One of them broke the bar window; then the word was, the first man that comes out of the Ship let him he knocked down. Gallagher came to the door; he told them to be peaceable and quiet, and to go home without fighting. They struck at him; he put up both his hands to save himself, and got through them as well as he could.</p>

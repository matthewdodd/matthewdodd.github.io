I am inspector of letter-carriers at the Charing cross Branch-office—the prisoner has been a letter-carrier at that office for three or four years in the Pimlico district—a letter addressed to Emanuel Hospital Schools would be in his delivery—a letter posted at Beverley, in Yorkshire, on 3rd Aug., would be delivered in town on the morning of the 4th, about nine, or from nine to ten—after his delivery, he came to the office about twenty minutes past twelve—he was then taken into custody upon a process of the County Court—the officers were waiting at the office for his return—they brought him to me, and asked if I would see that all his letters were taken from him before he was taken, as they could not take him while he had any letters in his possession—I desired the prisoner to give up all his letters to his partner, George Feltham—he said he had done so—he was then taken by the officers—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) bears the Beverley post-mark of 3rd Aug., and the London post-mark of 4th—it is open—it has been wafered—I know the prisoner's handwriting—I believe this other letter to be his—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>.)</p>

I am a warden in the Westminster House of Correction—the prisoner was brought there on the 4th Aug. under a process of the County Court—I was asked by another officer to come and search him, and I did so—the first thing I searched was his hat—I turned up the leather lining and found a piece of newspaper put in, as if the hat was too large for him—I said, "Have you anything else in the hat?" He said, "No." I then tanned down the lining, and there found the letter produced, broken open—I said, "Halloo! here is a letter!" He said, "Oh yes, it is quite right; I have deliverd the letter, and am further going to deliver it to a Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Somebody</hi>, "</p>

Eastwood, Emanuel Hospital School, James-street, Westminster, London." He said, "Yes; if I can see the next postman that comes to the prison gate, I will explain the whole particulars to him, and give it to him to take it to where I was to take it to." I was about to take it out of the enve<lb></lb>lope, when he very quietly took it from my hand, and said, "It is quite right"—I had not read the contents of it—I said, "I don't think you will be allowed to see the next postman; if you will tell me the particulars about it, I will give it to the postman?"—He said, "I think you will not understand it." I said, "Why; is it not written in English?"—he said, "Yes; but you won't understand it." I continued to search him, and the only money I found on him was a penny, and he acknowledged that to be all he had; but he wanted to send for some money—that was while I was searching him—I searched every pocket except his fob, and I told him to turn that out—he said, "he had nothing in it"—he bad given the letter back to me, and I gave it to Maries, who was also present during the search—I handed it to Marles with the other papers—he reported the case to the Governor, and the Governor allowed the prisoner to see the next postman—I was not present—I did not read the letter and envelope at the time I was with the prisoner—it was about five minutes to two when I searched him, and it was about half-past four the same afternoon that I saw it again—Marles was not present when I looked at it—the prisoner did not ask me for pen and ink to write a letter, nor did I see him write a letter—next day I went to the General Post-office, and accompanied Peak back to the prison—I was present when Peak saw the prisoner—Peak said to him, "You are charged with stealing a money-letter containing one shilling, directed to Master Geo. Eastwood, Emanuel Hospital Schools, James-street, Westminster, London." He said, "I did not steal it, I found the shil<lb></lb>ling in my pocket and meant to have returned it to the inspector on duty."—I said, "How could you do that, when you had only one penny in your pocket?"—he said, he had made use of the money previous to coming in, and he meant to have returned it.</p>

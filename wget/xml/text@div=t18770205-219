                  </hi>. I live at 46, Great Peter Street, "Westminster, and am a painter—on Saturday night, the 6th January, I was at this lodging-house,. just after 12 o'clock—I saw the prisoner brought in by two men—I had never seen him before to my knowledge—he was very drunk—he was taken upstairs by the two men who were lodgers-by the time he reached the top he had a fall—about 12.50 I saw him walking about the room and talking in an incoherent manner—I said "Get to bed there's a good fellow"—he never answered that; I was in bed then—the man sleeping next to me said "We will talk no more, and perhaps he will go to sleep quietly"—I was just dropping off to sleep when I felt some stabs through the bed<lb></lb>clothes—I threw my hands up and received several cuts in the wrist—I defended myself with the bed-clothes—I was in the darkness; I got away and rushed up another flight of stairs—I was taken to the hospital; I do not think the prisoner was responsible for his actions—I wished to with<lb></lb>draw the charge before the Magistrate, but he would not allow me to do so.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in this lodging-house—on the night of the 6th January, about 12.50, I saw the prisoner brought in—I went up before the prosecutor—the prisoner sat on the bed; he was drunk and talking like a drunken man—I and the prosecutor got into bed—the prisoner was sitting on the bed then—the candle went out—a few minutes after I heard the prosecutor hallooing out "Murder," and all the rest of it—I got out of bed and went out on the stairs and called the landlord up, and said "Do not come without a light," and he brought up a candle—I saw the prisoner standing beside the bed—he had the knife in his hand shut up.</p>

I was called by the landlord of this house on the morning of the 7th—the prisoner was charged with stabbing the prosecutor—he made some incoherent remark I could not catch—on the way to the station he said "They had no business to pitch into me"—I said "That does not justify you in using the knife"—he said "Serve them right, they should not pitch into me"—he seemed to be recovering from drink; he had this knife when he was charged—there appears to be some dry blood on the blade.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the Westminster Hospital—the prosecutor came on the morning of the 7th—there were two incised wounds on the inner side of the right wrist, about half an inch long—the back one was shorter than the front one—they were very near the artery and bled a good deal, not that day, but afterwards; I saw a small wound on the side of the face, and another small wound on the back of the other wrist.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> When they say I was drunk it is a falsehood. I went to bed by myself. Two men stood on the stairs and said "Come along old chap." I said "I know my road and I know my bed." I had not lain long when I felt my pillow move. One man caught hold of my trowsers, he got hold of my leg, he crouched down. Then he let go into me and another man gave me a kick in the side. I said "Will you leave go?" but he kept pulling my trowsers, and I hit him on the hand or wrist, for it was dark. He then let go, but he never holloaed "Murder! "nor said a whimper. I put my trowsers on and went downstairs, and there was reading and he said "What's up?" I said "enough's up, I've had three of them on to me and one tried to get my trowsers and I gave him a prick in the hand." He says "You'll have to go to the station," and I gave the knife into his hand. Then we met the constable and he told him about it. The constable asked for the man that was cut, and he said "He'll follow, but he is gone to the hospital," and he came. If Reading had taken the knife out of my hand I could not have brought it downstairs and given it to the constable. One constable says I was sober.</p>

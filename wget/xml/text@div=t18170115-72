            . I am servant to Mr. Brown, who is a butcher, and lives at Aldgate. I was in Whitechapel, about a quarter of a mile from the Minories, on the 2d of December, near Red Lion-passage, I saw the prisoner there; it was just after the soldiers had been in the Minories; he was going towards Red Lion-street, as if from the Minories; he had a sword in his hand, and was in company with two others, each of whom had a pistol and a gun. I walked behind them, and asked several to assist me in taking the three. They kept together till they came to Red Lion-street, the prisoner then turned down the street; I got assistance, and secured him. My friend asked him if he was an officer, he said, no; I said, how did you come by that sword? he said he found it in the Minories. It was a dirty day, but there was not the least appearance of dirt on it; if it had been picked up, it would not have the appearance that it had. I gave the sword to Dalton. It was not drawn.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER DALTON. I am an officer. I produce the sword</p>

            . I am a sadler, and live in Red Lion-street, Whitechapel. On the 2d of December, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner passed me, he was alone; Ireland was following him, and he asked me to go with him. We followed the prisoner as far as Rosemary-lane, and then went up to him, and asked him if he was an officer, he said, no. I told him to give me the sword - He gave it me immediately. I took him to the police-office. He said that he was a labourer, and had picked it up in the Minories.</p>

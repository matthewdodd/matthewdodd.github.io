                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and live in Ebury-place, Pimlico. The prisoner came to my place on 15th Oct. for a glass of porter—he gave me a shilling—I put it into the detector, and found it was bad—I told him so—he said, "Is it? let me have it again; my mother gave it me this morning in change"—I gave it him back, but I had cracked it quite across—he gave me another shilling, which was good—I put it into my detector, and it just bent, but I am satisfied it was a good one—I laid it down, and, before I could get the change from the till, he took that shilling up, and gave me another good one—for the last good shilling I gave him change.</p>

             sworn. - I am a stonemason: On the 13th of March I was going to work; I was near Mr. Mennoll's yard in <placeName id="t18040411-49-crimeloc288">Carburton-street</placeName>

             sworn. I am a constable; when I first saw the prisoner, I saw him turn from Buckingham-place with this stone under his arm; I thought, by his carrying the stone, he had not come honestly by it; I followed him, and before I came up, he turned out of the street into the yard; I there lost sight of him for one minute in Mr. Mennolls's yard; as he turned out of the yard into the street, I took him in custody; I now produce the stone; I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Rowtry.) Is that the stone you saw him with? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did you produce the stone before the Magistrate? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say before the Magistrate you should not know the stone again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mennoll). Is that your stone? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes, he is a stone-mason; he worked for me about twelve months ago, for the best part of a week.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are there any other persons having stones in your yard? - A. There are one or two more; Cole has stones on the north-side of the yard, and Hobbs has stones on the south-side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This Hobbs and I had a dealing to the amount of 11 shillings, and we shook hands as we parted; he said there is another piece of stone, come and take it; I had told him I wanted another small bit to finish my job; Accordingly I went over, and looked out a piece of stone; I was there half an hour before I looked it out, and I enquired of a man whether Hobbs owned all the stones.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. I do not know, this Rowtry met me, and asked me whether I worked for Mr. Hobbs; I told him I had bought it, and if I was going to steal a stone, I would not go at noonday.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the morning of the 11th of December, I was down stairs at breakfast, I heard my door-latch open, I ran up and a neighbour pointed to a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150055"></xptr>boy, and said he had run off with a pair of shoes, I run out, the people said he had run up Red Lion-street; I saw the prisoner running, I got over a wall into a yard, I found him there and took him, the shoes were in the next yard to where I found him; as I was bringing him back I met Collins, who said in the prisone's presence, that he saw him open the door, and go into the shop.</p>
               <p>JOHM COLLINS. I live opposite to Clapp. I was at my window, I saw the prisoner go into the shop, and come out again with something under his arm; I told Clapp and he went after him. I am sure the prisoner is the boy, that I saw go into the shop, he waited at the door before he went in talking to some boys, one of the boys went and pointed his finger at the shop window when the prisoner was in.</p>

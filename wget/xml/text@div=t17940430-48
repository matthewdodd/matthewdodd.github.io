               <p>Q. Do you remember driving a job for starling, on the 12th of April? - I am not take up any body, Mr. Starling you them into the coach, I was in the house, and the waterman called me out; so the best of my knowledge it was somewhere about two o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the watering house? - In Bishopsgate-street; I don't know who was in the coach, I was desired to go to the May Pole, East Smithfield; and when I came there, they made me go a little further, and I went to the right hand, about four doors beyond Nightingale-lane, and before I could get off my box, they were out of the coach, and the first that went off had a little bag under his arm, the last that got out paid me, I had no suspicion at all of the affair, and I did not observe the men.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoners at the bar, or either of them, and when? - One of them, the furthest, May, came in one morning, and the other two, Wyburn and Mason followed, how soon after the robbery I cannot particularly say; they came in and called for a pint of beer, and I gave them the beer, and they asked change for a guinea, and it lay on the table, and I laid the change on the table again.</p>

               <p>Q. You was a workman belonging to Mr. Gibson? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you so on the 12th of April, the day that the robbery was committed? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell the court and jury distinctly, and go slowly, what you know about this business? - I will, to the best of my endeavour. About three or four months ago I became acquainted with Wybrow, by using the Black Bull, Dunning's alley, in Bishopsgate street; I had not used the house, more than the space of a week, before Wybrow asked me to go up to the other end of the town, he knew some girls.</p>
               <p>Q. Confine yourself to this business of the 12th of April? - On the 12th of April, about seven o'clock or half after, I met May at the Black Bull, and we had some supper together, and we had two six-pennyworths of gin and water together; after that he asked me if I would go with him to the Queen's Head, in Paternoster-row, to a raffle there? I told him I would; he said he expected to meet Wybrow there; we went there, and had one pint of porter, and Wybrow did not come, I went out to seek for him, I went out to the Black Bull, and there I found him, I brought him to the Queen's Head.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you bring him? - About half after nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was May there when you came back? - He was. As we were coming along, we bought some bees and ham, and had it for supper; when we came there we joined the raffle, we staid there till half after twelve o'clock, and had a glass of rum, and went away, we went to Mr. Gibson's house, all three of us, with an intent to do the robbery; there were some pailisadoes before the house, and Wybrow shoved a good many times against the gate, but we could not open it, we then examined the bag we had with us, and we thought the bag was rather too small. May brought the bag, and a chissell; there being a great many people passing and repassing, and the bag was too small, we judged it expedient to go to the person that was to buy the property, to get a larger bag, we went to East Smithfield, to one Joel; Wybrow<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300081"></xptr>threw up to the window, and Joel came down, and let us in, and we all three went up stairs, when he gave us a larger bag and a dark lanthorn. We then came away to Mr. Gibson's house again; (this was about half after one in the morning) then May got over the pallisadoes, and with the chissel he wrenched the boards down, that guarded the cellar window; he then came out, and Wybrow and I went in, I put the nine pieces of mode into the bag, and Wybrow held it; we then came out and pulled the outside shutter to, and handed the bag over to May, who was outside; after that Wybrow and I came out and we all three went together, and May carried the pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a bag was it? - A white canvas bag, it was properly of a canvas colour. We went as far as the corner of Catharine Wheel-alley, and then Wybrow went and fetched a coach, the coach came near to the end of the alley, and we all three went into the coach, May had the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect particularly where you got into the coach? - I cannot say, it was near the alley. As soon as we got in the waterman shut the door, and I gave the waterman a shilling myself, we told him to go to East Smithfield, but he set us down near the end of Nightingale-lane; the coachman then came down to open the door; I took the goods myself and went down an alley, a few doors from where the coach stopped, and went into a necessary, while Wybrow threw up to the window, and broke several panes of glass.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that for? - Joel told him before not to mind breaking two or three panes of glass, but to throw up hard, when he came. Joel came down and opened the door, then we all three went into the house, and went up one pair of stairs, and then we shut the door to, and he told us to be as quiet as we could, and they assisted me in cutting off the ends, and the marks off this silk; after that we agreed about the price for the goods, when we asked forty guineas for the goods; Joel he then bid twenty guineas; Wybrow he said he could not take less than twenty-four; (that was eight guineas a piece for the three) he said he would split the difference, and give us twenty one guineas, (that was seven guineas a piece, and he gives us one guinea on the table, and told us to call at two o'clock. We went down to Hornsey; I left them at eight o'clock and the next morning May gave me seven pounds; I went to the public house and sent for him.</p>
               <p>Q. You forgot to tell us what you gave the hackney coachman? - May said he gave him five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. This is the truth of the business, is it? - It is. On Monday Mr. Harper and Armstrong were at our house, and they said they had a suspicion of me, because I put the goods down the cellar on Saturday night, and they apprehended me on Monday night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I will not waste much time with such a witness as you, but I will ask you one or two questions. In the first place you say you supped at this place, at the Black Bull, and you went from there to the Queen's Head? - I did.</p>


               <p>Q. The landlord is full as honest as you are, I dare say; the landlord swears that May came in alone? - He might be in first.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you think may be the better character? - I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a deep laid plan. You knew very well that the goods were not to be removed of a Saturday night into the cellar? - I knew the goods were laid there every night.</p>
               <p>Q. Now hear, man, don't you know that you was not to have removed the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300082"></xptr>goods there on Saturday night! - They have been put in the cellar before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that there were orders that they should not be put there on Saturday? - No, I have not heard that.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you put them there for the sake of robbing your your master? - To be sure it was done for that purpose. It is customary to lay them in the cellar every night.</p>
               <p>Q. Except Saturday night? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lay them? - They were spread on both racks as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. You was called to an account about this before your master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath was you not promised that your life should be saved if you could convict any other person that was with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore to save your life you must convict somebody, you accuse these men to save yourself? - I say the truth to save myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you come here and accuse these men, and believe that you shall save your life, by the accusation, and perhaps have some little reward besides? - I should expect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I am done.</p>

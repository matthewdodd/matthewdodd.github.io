I saw the prisoner James come out about half-past nine o'clock—I stopped him in Hyde-street, and found on him a bundle, containing a quantity of bread, butter, and meat, and this towel—I asked what he had got—he said broken food—I asked if he would allow me to see it, and he did so readily—I asked where he got it—he said from a woman in the Wellington-road—I said it would be necessary to show me where she lived—he said he did not know; that she came out into the road, and said, "Here, my lad, here is something for you"—I took him to the station, and went next morning to Mr. Sutton's—I saw the female pri<lb></lb>soner, and asked her if she had seen her brother the preceding evening—she said she had—I asked if she had given him anything—she said "A parcel"—I asked if anything was in it—she said, "Bread, butter, and meat"—I asked "What was it wrapped in?"—she said, "A towel"—I asked whose towel—he said her master's—I asked if anybody had given her authority to give the towel away—she said, "No."</p>

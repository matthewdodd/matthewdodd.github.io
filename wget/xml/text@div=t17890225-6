               <p>Court. It would have made a report with only powder? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was loaded with ball or shot? - From the great report, and smoke coming out.</p>
               <p>Are you a pretty good judge from the report of a pistol, whether it is loaded with ball or shot, or not? - I cannot say, my Lord; I should think it was loaded with ball, from his having these little balls about him.</p>
               <p>Did you think at the time it was a ball? - I did: after he fired, I stood a little while, and he ran off; I found I was not shot; I went after him, and cried, a foot-pad going to rob me, fired at me; he was stopped just through the turnpike, about one hundred and twenty yards from where he had stopped me, by some gardening men, coming from their work; he was taken to Mr. Wheeler's, and from there to the cage; I saw the pistol, and the balls in a bag, taken from him.</p>
               <p>Did you try whether the balls would fit the pistol? - I did not.</p>

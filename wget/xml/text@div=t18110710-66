The tall one stopped me, and collared me, I made what resistance I could, until the other assisted him, the tall one drew his knife out of his pocket, and stabbed me in the shoulder; all the resistance I then could make I found was of no effect. They pushed me into the ditch, where the tall one cut me in the cheek, and the neck here very much. I got out of the ditch by some means or other, and the tall one took hold of me again. The little man then put his hand into my right hand breeches pocket, and took from me the silver I had there, and also tore from the breeches the watch out of my fob, fob and all. The tall one put his hand into my side pocket, and took from thence a small memorandum book; he then took hold of the left skirt of my coat, where there was a silk handkerchief and penknife, and cut that pocket off; I then made my escape from them, and after running, being a good deal agitated, and from the loss of blood, I fell down; I got up again as fast as I could, and found they were still pursuing me; I exerted myself and ran on till I got to the houses at Mile End road, nearly, I found a watchman in the watch-box, he took me down to the watchhouse, from whence the constable of the night conducted me home; a surgeon was sent for, and my wounds were dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two persons, do you know either of their persons - A. I have no doubt of the tall man, being the person that cut me from his stature, and appearance of his visage, and what I could recollect at that time. The other I do not know nothing about, nor have I seen the little one since.</p>
               <p>Antonio said nothing in his defence.</p>

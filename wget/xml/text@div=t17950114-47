               <p>Q.Had you hackney horses? - Yes. In consequence of what Mrs. Cross said I looked through the window behind, and I see the prisoners who are now at the bar, almost close to the carriage.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was this? - About twenty minutes past four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they on horse back or on foot? - On horseback.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the colour of their horses? - I cannot positively say; I have some recollection of the colour of one being a bay or sorrel, but I cannot recollect the other. Very soon after, I heard somebody cry out, stop! very loud, two or three times; and the prisoner on the right hand, the one in the red collar, Austin, demanded my money; he was on the right side of the carriage; Mrs. Cross was very much alarmed at the fight of the pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he presented a pistol? - He presented a pistol; I requested him to take his pistol from the carriage, I had nothing worth contending for, and he should have it; he begged us not to be alarmed, he would do no injury, and he requested we would give our money; he conducted himself as civil, I suppose, as any man could do. Mrs. Cross had just given over her money, and she found a noise on her left hand, which alarmed her very much, and she put down the window, the man on the left hand ran his pistol into her neck, I gave my money, and the prisoner who last attacked us, insisted on our watches and diamond rings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he present a pistol also? - He presented a pistol also, which he did not take away for some time, though repeatedly d-mned and cursed by the other man for not doing it. I think I gave him eight or nine guineas, it was more than seven, but I am not certain whether it was eight or nine; the other man still persisted that the lady had a diamond ring and the man on the left hand,

I said, upon my honour she has none; he said, then I wish you a good or a pleasant evening, and hoped I might meet with no other company, and they went off.</p>

I opened the watch and found it was advertised from Bow-street, as stolen; he said he believed the chain was gold, I then gave the aqua fortis and the Turkey stone to my young man to try it, during which time I went out to get assistance in taking of him; a few doors from my own house I met one of our patrols, I told him what I wanted, and in returning with him into the house, just at the door I met the two prisoners at the bar coming out. Austin Flowers, he stood in the passage during the time that

             ran up St. John's-street, and Austin Flowers ran towards Smithfield, I desired the patrol to pursue John and I would endeavour to take the other; I ran after him till turning down towards Cow-lane, there he stopped quite out of breath, I laid hold of him and there was a coach on the stand and I brought him back, when I got home I found the other prisoner was in my shop in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. You carried them both to the magistrate, I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What are you? - A pawnbroker, No. 92, St. John-street, West-Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you went out of your house, and left the two prisoners in the house? - I only saw one in the house.</p>
               <p>Q.How long did you leave him in the house? - About two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him there when you returned? - I found him coming from the house in the passage, coming out both of them together.</p>
               <p>Q. To Cross. You have stated very fairly to the court, and it is natural to suppose you would, that this was on the 17th of November, about twenty minutes after four o'clock in the afternoon? - In stating it so precisely, I conjecture it so. It was between four and five, and rather nearer four than otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what sort of a day it was? - It was a sharp frost, I rather think it was, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not much daylight? - It was so much daylight that I could have read in my carriage, because a very short time before I had a book in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was able to see the person through the glass behind the carriage, the glass you say was dim? - No, I did not, I said, it was high, I could not see the colour of the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. First of all, if I understand you right, you observed the prisoners you say,(if they were the prisoners) from the back glass, the glass of the back part of your chaise; the glass is not very large? - It is a square glass and rather large, it is as much as eight inches square.</p>
               <p>Q. By that means you was enabled first of all to discover the persons? - No, Mrs. Cross supposing somebody was getting up behind the carriage, I looked and see the two men distinctly behind the carriage, not thinking they were robbers at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the man on your side behaved very civil? - Uncommonly civil, I never was robbed before and so I cannot tell how others behave.</p>

               <p>Q. But the other man was not so civil? - He was not, he swore to the other man for not taking the things.</p>
               <p>Q. The man on the right hand, he said, all I want is your money, and I beg the lady will not be alarmed? - He did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140085"></xptr>Q. You say you lost your watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that is your watch now produced? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were the prisoners apprehended after you was robbed? - I see them only yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they taken into custody after the robbery was first committed? - I see them yesterday at the police office, Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. They had been committed to Tothill-fields, and brought to Hatton-garden? - I don't know that. There were none in irons but these, and therefore I must mark them as the prisoners, I must say very fairly.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore they were pointed out? - No, not pointed.</p>
               <p>Q.When you got to the office you recognized two men in irons? - Of whom I could have no doubt, if I was to see them among ten thousand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Austin. Were not your eyes bad then? - No, that has arisen since in consequence of an inflammation from the gout.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you perfectly recollect, you say it was eight weeks since the robbery was committed? - The question is perfectly fair, and if I had the smallest doubt on my mind, I would not in this place, swear so positively; I am sorry I am obliged to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was on your journey to Barnet, robbed at some little distance from that place. Now I ask you which side of the carriage you sat on? - On the left side. I recollect you perfectly at the turnpike; you remember looking into the carriage; you remember stopping some time to do it. I had a perfect recollection of your face before you stopped me, I had a perfect fight of it from the hind glass, I could not be mistaken afterwards; you was extremely civil, and if I had any doubt I would express it, but seeing you now and seeing you yesterday, I cannot do otherwise than say I am certain; I wish I was not obliged to say so.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been repeatedly wrote to by the magistrate on this business? - And very unwillingly came up on this business.</p>
               <p>Q. And returned for answer that you could not swear to the persons? - I think that when Mr. Bond wrote to me in Yorkshire, I was ill with an inflammation in my eyes; under this circumstance, Mrs. Cross wrote an answer, that coming up so far at the uncertainly of been able to swear to the persons, would be putting me to a great inconvenience at that time; I felt a repugnance at coming up, but that was from the uncertainly of figuring to myself the persons of the men that had robbed me, but seeing these men again I have no idea of doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any such letter wrote by you? - I think I wrote one letter to excuse myself from coming up,</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Briggs. The prisoner Austin, wishes me to ask you whether before the justice you did not say, that John Flowers informed you that he had received the watch from a friend? - When I asked him whose watch it was? he said it was not his own, but he had brought it for a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he add any thing, did he say he had brought it from a gentleman for whom he had made a coat? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. In short he disclaimed any property in it, he said it was not his? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you knew him very well? - I have known both of them for some years; one of them Austin Flowers, lived at our beadle's.</p>

On Thursday, the 20th of November, between seven and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140086"></xptr>eight o'clock, I was walking on my duty as a patrol, I see a young lad coming out of a butcher's shop, which is Mr. Spencers, and I heard him utter the word here is one of them; that gave me reason to suppose that there was something amiss, that he was in persuit of one of the patrols, I happened to be there; I turned myself round and see Mr. Briggs speaking to Mr. Spencer; I asked what was the matter? Mr. Briggs he said, there was a person that he wanted immediately to be taken to prison, he told me that he was in the box, a place which I did not know what it meant at that time, at last the boy told me I will come and shew you; the boy shewed me; this place is in the passage, the passage leads to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with Mr. Briggs? - I went on and the butcher's boy shewed me, said there, it is there; I just stopped and I saw the two prisoners there present coming out of the door; Mr. John Flowers who is there prisoner, he was obliged to squeeze himself to come by me; at that instant of time I did not know they were the party that I was to apprehend, and by that they got by me, there was an immediate cry, there they go; Mr. Briggs called out that to the best of my knowledge; accordingly I see John Flowers run up St. John's street, I followed him, I called out stop thief, accordingly he was stopped by one

               <p>Q.Now tell us what you know of this matter? - I saw John Flowers bring the watch into our house, on Thursday, the 20th of November, he asked two guineas for the watch.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he speak to you or in your presence? - In my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard him? - Yes. He said it was a gold chain, I tried the chain and it was good gold; in the mean while I was trying the chain my master went to get assistance; in the mean while he was gone, Flowers asked me where he was? I told him I believed he was at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do on that? - He then took away the watch off the counter and went out; it was laying on the counter, I saw no more of him till he was brought in by the patrols; while they were both standing in the shop a woman told me they were emptying their pockets; I immediately went round the counter, and I found this pair of spurs in a paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them come out of the pockets of these people? - No, I did not see them; a short time afterwards there were three shot found just on the same spot.</p>
               <p>Q.But you did not see them come out of their pockets? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Austin. The evening on which my brother went to Mr. Briggs with the property in question, I met with my brother, he asked me to go home to sup with him, which I did not refuse to do; he told me he wanted to call at Mr. Briggs, the pawnbroker's, he had something to pledge; he then went into Mr. Briggs and I waited at the door, I stopped there some little time when I see a patrol come up with a hanger drawn, I thought there might be something going on that might hurt my brother, I ran away and Mr. Briggs followed me till I came to the pens in Smithfield; I turned about then and asked Mr. Briggs what he wanted? he told me he wanted me to go back with him; I turned round on him and went back, had I wished to have done it I could have made my escape from Mr. Briggs I make no doubt; I went into the shop and he told me that my brother had brought a watch to pledge that was not his own; my brother said it was not his own property but the property of a friend; he had for some time been acquainted with Mr. Briggs, if this watch had been improperly got he would not have taken it to Mr. Briggs. With respect to myself, I am totally ignorant of the watch, neither for some time prior had I seen my brother; had I the idea of this watch being improperly got I would not have waited so near the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner John. On the evening I took the watch to the pawnbroker's, I took it of a person who had ordered a coat of me; I measured him at the George, in Aldermanbury, on the 13th of November, a person who called himself a Mr. Smith, who had used that house for some time; I was to make him a coat and waistcoat, he told me when I brought it he would pay me, I made it and took it to him, the value was 3l. 10s. he said he had not got money to pay me then; he said if I would leave the clothes he would pay me the next day, which I refused to do, not knowing him; I asked him that if the landlord would be bound for the coat I would leave it, and he offered me this watch till the next day, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140088"></xptr>told him I would take it to a friend of mine and know the value of the watch; he told me it was a gold chain and seal, which I told him I did not believe it was, and as such I took it to Mr. Briggs; if I had known this watch was stole I would not have took it to Mr. Briggs, were I must be known.</p>

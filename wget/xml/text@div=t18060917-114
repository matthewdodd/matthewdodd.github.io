             sworn. I am a carpenter; on Saturday night, the 23d of August, I was just come home from my work, I was standing at my door, facing Mr. Harrison's shop, as I usually do; I saw the prisoner walk by Mr. Harrison's shop, he passed the shop and looked in, he was with another man; they went from the shop and they parted; I thought they were suspicious characters, I watched them; one went and sat down three doors from the shop, the prisoner returned back to the shop again, he put his hand into a crib bedstead for children, he did not take any thing out, he returned to his companion again, they both returned to the shop, and the prisoner at the bar took the coat out of the bedstead and ran off; I immediately left my door and followed him, I did not lose sight of him; I took him at the corner of Baker's Row, I collared him, I said, you rascal, what do you do with this coat, he had the coat under his arm; he began crying, I took the coat from him, and took him back to Mr. Harrison's shop; I gave Mr.

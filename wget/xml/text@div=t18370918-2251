                  </hi>. I went down to an acquaintance at Greenwich, and on coming back, I called at the Ship and Last, and saw this prisoner—she said she was in distress—I said, "I don't like to see any body in distress, if I had a copper I would give you half"—we had two or three pints of half-and-half, and then I said we would have something to eat, and we went from thence towards the Fortune of War, but on the road I took her into a cook-shop, and said, "What will you like to eat?"—we had five pennyworth of roast pork, and she put it in a paper—I said to her," Why don't you eat it?"—she said, "I don't like to eat it now"—thinks I, you want something to drink, and we went into the Fortune of War, and then called for a pint of beer—I went to pay, and missed a crown out of my pocket—I said to her," Halloo, this is not the thing; you put down that crown-piece again"—"I, "said she," I have no crown at all."—the policeman came up, and I gave her into custody, and in going along by the church at Greenwich, the crown dropped from her—I was a little astart of them, but I heard it.</p>

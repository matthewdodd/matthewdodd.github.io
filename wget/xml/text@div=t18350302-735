                  </hi>. I am in the service of Samuel Sherwood and Rich<lb></lb>ard Mason Wood, type-founders and printers'-brokers, Chiswell-street. One part of their premises comes into Artillery-court—the prisoner has been in their employ about two months—he was a printers'-joiner—I was present when the preliminaries were gone into between him and Mr. Wood, in the early part of December—he was to take the place of the journeyman who was then working for us—it was expressly en<lb></lb>gaged that he was not to do work at home, or to take materials home—I then left London, and when I returned I found him at work there—he was to be paid as the other men, from time to time, for the articles, deducting the timber that he had from time to time to make the articles—he was to give up working at home for any one, but to come and work as a journeyman there—he received money in the course of his employ, till such time as I could put his account square—I have seen the book in which his entries were made, and consider he has been overpaid—I have no other account of what he did, but by a book which he kept him<lb></lb>self, with which Mr. Wood furnished him when I was out of town—that book was missing on the Monday before these articles were taken—I saw it again in the hands of the prisoner's solicitor at Worship-street—I remem<lb></lb>ber, about a fortnight before this occurred, Mr. Wood accusing him of stay<lb></lb>ing away, and he said he supposed he had been working for somebody else—He said he had not, except a job of carpentering, which was not our trade, for a person to whom he owed some money—Mr. Wood said, "Mind, I shall not allow you to do so; but if it is so, all is well"—on Wednesday morning, the 18th of February, I came down stairs to go into the counting-house—I live on the premises, and am generally the earliest up—I am ge<lb></lb>nerally up at half-past eight or nine o'clock—the prisoner knew that was my habit—on that morning I received information, and went to the prison<lb></lb>er's work-room—I missed all that I had seen there before, on which he had been working, and for which he had drawn money—I missed part of two ruling-machines, twenty dozen of reglets, and about forty deal boards—I did not miss the mahogany—I made inquiries, and went directly to the prisoner's house in the Curtain-road—he was then at his solicitor's—I saw the deals in his passage, and the oak-staves in the court—the reglets are made from them, and we had missed staves, which were bought through the medium of the prisoner—he said he knew where there was a lot of staves to be sold—they were, perhaps, more than we should want, but they would do well to season: and he had the money to pay for them—I did not find any reglets, but I have seen some since, belonging to Wood and Sherwood—he had not been at work on the deal boards at all, and he had no authority to take them—he certainly had no authority to take a van at eight o'clock in the morning, and carry those things away.</p>

                  </hi>. I took the van on Wednesday morning, the 18th of February, to Artillery-court, about a quarter past eight o'clock, or half-past. I found the prisoner there—he put the wood and things into the van as fast as he could—I never knew the van loaded so quickly—a little boy brought them out, and the prisoner put them into the van—I said to him, "I can't load them so fast as this"—he said, "It don't make no matter, they are not going far"—when it was loaded, he told me to go on round the corner—he went on with me to the corner of Crown-street, and we had a drop of something there—I then went on, as he told me, to No. 86, Curtain-road—we then unloaded the van as quick as we could—he put some of the things in the yard, and some in the passage, I believe, but I was in the van all the time—he then paid me—I told my master where I had been, and said I thought he appeared very hasty—I have brought the articles here in the van.</p>

               <p>I had, he had no right to suspect me of any dishonesty—these ruling machines I made at home with stuff which I went and bought myself; and as I knew it would be my ruin to confine myself to his business, I made up my mind to complete these articles on my own premises, and I never had any other intention—I removed these things openly when the men were all about in the warehouse, and had been so for two hours—the car<lb></lb>man speaks of a hurried manner; certainly I did not wish him to waste his time, but I made no secret of it—he asked me for a pint of beer, and I gave it him—if you look at the book, you will be convinced that Mr. Wood cannot prove any thing against me.</p>

            . I recommended the prisoner to the prosecutrix as a servant. The prosecutrix complained to me after she was there that she had lost several things and suspected her honesty. On the last of March I went there again, and was by when the prisoner's trunk was searched, and saw the things produced taken out. I heard the prisoner own that the three 36 s. pieces were the property of her mistress, that she had taken them and left them with Mrs. Camm in order to buy her a capuchin.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she say she took them?</p>
               <p>Gray. She said they tumbled out of her mistress's pocket in a paper, that she took them up, and taking them out of the paper, delivered that again to her mistress.</p>

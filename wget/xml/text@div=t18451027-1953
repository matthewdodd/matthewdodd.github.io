On the evening of the 10th of Sept., I went to the Cock public-house where the prisoner lodged—I there found this shirt—it was produced in the prisoner's presence before the Magistrate—he said he had bought it about twelve months ago, and given 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. I know this shirt quite well—it is my work—I marked it, "Jacques Besset," in full, with red cotton, and the figure "6" also—the mark has apparently been picked out—I see the remains of it very plainly—I had occasion to look for this par<lb></lb>ticular shirt very early in the spring, I think in March, when Mr. Besset was sitting for his portrait, as it had a cambric front—I could not find it—I know that all my husband's linen, and everything in the house, was perfectly safe last Oct. twelve months, when I left my house to visit a friend in town—I had occasion to write to the servant, Ann Barrett, to pack up my husband's linen, and forward it to him—I did not take posses<lb></lb>sion of it again till Nov.; and as it was winter, he was going to wear calico shirts, and I had no occasion to look for the linen ones till the spring, when I looked for this, and it was gone—we were absent five weeks—we left the house in the care of Ann Barrett.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I see there is another mark upon this shirt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, "B. H.," immediately above where the mark has been picked out—I know nothing of that mark—the name, "Jacques Besset," is not readable now, but it requires seven threads to mark those small letters, and exactly seven threads have been broken—the shirt was made a year or two ago—it is linen—I made it myself—I told my husband I missed it the same day I could not find it—it was the only shirt he had with a cambric front</p>

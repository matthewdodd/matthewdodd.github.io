            , came to the prisoner's house. This deceased and I stopped at the door, and Chapman went to order a pint of beer; we stopped with a jack-ass; this was between eight and nine; it was very dark. Mr. Palmer brought the beer, and put it into my hands; it was light enough to see the countenance of the prisoner and deceased by the candle in the tap room. I was close to the deceased. The prisoner came out to the door with a pint of beer; he gave it into my hands; he said to the deceased, Are you not a rascal, and a villain, and a thief? The deceased made answer, and said, No, Mr. Palmer! and Mr. Palmer made answer, and said, You are. No, says he, I am not. I am no thief, nor yet a rascal, nor a villain. Yes, says Palmer, I can prove him a thief. Now, says he, I know you owe me a grudge for owing you 5 s. and then he said, Yes, you do, you owe me 5 s. The deceased made answer, and said, No, Sir, I paid you some. He said, if you say so again, I will knock you down; and then the deceased made answer, and said, Yes, I paid you some; and then he made no more to do, but Palmer knocked down the deceased immediately; I saw him, upon my word; I cannot say I see where he struck him. He got up, and said, very well, Mr. Palmer; and then he repeated his blow, and knocked him down again; I saw that; and the deceased got up, and got off from his premises, and went to Mr. Bennett's door, the next door, and there the deceased said to him, You struck me twice, now if you strike me the third time - I am off your premises - I will make you pay for it; and then Mr. Palmer said, Damn me, if I am to pay for it, I will pay for some thing; and then went, and struck him again, and then I never stirred an inch from the place where he struck him; I saw him strike him; I stopped at Mr. 
Palmer's door till my brother came out, and then I went away.</p>


               <p>Mr. Garrow. What was the deceased? - He was a <rs id="t17921215-43-viclabel254" type="occupation">bricklayer's labourer</rs>

               <p>Q. Had you seen the body while living? - I had on Monday morning; he was very black on the left side, and all round his loins and flank was partly black.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon; I live at Stoke Newington; I was sent for on the occasion, eight or ten days previous to his death, to attend the deceased; he then was labouring under a disagreeable fever and a bilious complaint. I treated him in the usual way; the medicines did not succeed; he died on Monday the 25th. I went down, and see that he was black on the side, and the blood was ready to burst through; a mortification had taken place; but I do not take upon me to say, he might not have died without that, but, I think, his death might be accelerated by this; I heard nothing of this before his death; if he had sent for me immediately, he might have recovered.</p>
               <p>Court. Your opinion is that the disorder might have occasioned his death without the blow. - He was labouring under a bilious fever.</p>
               <p>Q. That could not happen from the blow. - It might by the disturbance of the vessels that secrete the blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Bridges, a wheelwright, of 43, Duke-street, Westminster-road—at the firework explosion in West<lb></lb>minster-road I lost one of my children—on 19th July I left my home and went to Stratford; the prisoner's wife accompanied me; I was away from morning till night; I returned at 20 minutes after 11 o'clock—I don't know the prisoner; I knew his wife from the time the child died—I had not locked my house up; I left it in care of my children; when I returned home I saw the prisoner, and he said, "Here is a letter; I have had another, but I have lost it"—I was very angry about the letter he had lost—the letter which he gave me had been opened, but I took no notice of that to him—I opened the letter and read what was inside; there was a communication to me inside, in consequence of which I went to McBean and Sons; the letter told me I should receive some money there; I went there and I received half-a-sovereign, and they gave me this card.</p>

On 19th July I delivered a letter, addressed to Mrs. Bridges, 43, Duke-street, Westminster-road, about half-past 8 or 9 o'clock, to a man who was sitting at the window, smoking a pipe—he came to the door when I knocked and asked for Mrs. Bridges; he took the letter, and said, "All right"—the prisoner is the man—he came to me in a week or ten days afterwards in Webber-row, and said that Mrs. Bridges had accused him of detaining a letter—I said, "What has that to do with me?"—he went on to state that it was very hard for him to lose his liberty; while he was making his statement, a man came up, and said, "What you have told the postman is different to what you told me, that you received this letter and appropriated the contents"—the prisoner made no answer; they walked away together.</p>

I thought it was some petty bother, that he might have detained it a day or two—then a person came up and stated what I have said—I do not know Mrs. Norfolk; I never delivered a letter there that I am aware of; I did not see her that night—when I delivered my letter it was dusk; I did not observe Mrs. Norfolk at the window—I have been on that beat five years—I have not seen Mrs. Norfolk before that I am aware of—I cannot say who was the first person who told me about any charge being preferred—my fellow-servant had to attend at the police-court, and I was sent for the week after—I have not delivered other letters there since.</p>

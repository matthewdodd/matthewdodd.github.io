                  </hi> I am a lard-manufacturer, in Suffolk-place, Hackney-road—the prisoner was in my service for about four months, to superintend the business, and take charge of the factory—he lived in a cottage on the premises, rent free—on the 1st of Oct. on going to the premises, I saw drops of fat, form a vat in the factory which contained liquid fat, from the factory door to the cottage door in which the prisoner lived—I pushed the cottage door open, and found more spots on the cottage floor—the prisoner was not there, his wife was—I made a search and found six or seven vessels which contained the same sort of fat as was in the vat—while I was doing that, the prisoner came in—I asked him how the fat came there—he said be brought it in for his own use—I sent for a policeman, and in the interval the prisoner said, "I hope you will forgive me"—his wife was present—she said, "I hope you will forgive us both"—there was 23lbs. of fat altogether in the pans in the cottage, in the gross state, but the weight of the fat only was about 14lbs., worth 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner had no right at all to take fat for his own use—he had 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and firing, and the cottage to live in—he said he took this fat from the vat.</p>

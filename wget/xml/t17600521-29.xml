After this, Mr. Banes, a taylor at Hampstead, came to my masters, and said he had bought such goods of a man of Hampstead, who said he found them; he said the 2 pieces of dyed linnen were of no use to him, and he had brought them to Mr. Waltham's in Old street, and Mr. Waltham told him he had done them up for my masters but a few days before; master inform'd me of this, I went to Mr. Waltham's and saw the 2 pieces there. ( the 3 pieces were produc'd in court) I can swear to one of those pieces, the other I believe to be the same which I deliver'd, they answer both in quantity and length: there were marks pasted on at the end of each piece with a wafer, but the prisoner had taken them off; I also put a bill of parcels in the bundle, but that the prisoner pretended he never saw.</p>

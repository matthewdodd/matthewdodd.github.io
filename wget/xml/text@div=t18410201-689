                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 2nd of September two men had been fighting in a field at Tottenham Hale—I took one of them, and was taking him to the station, the prisoner jumped out of a field, over a ditch, hit me a very severe blow on the neck with his fist, told me to let the man go, and rescued him from me—they both got away—on the 3rd of September I went in search of the prisoner, and found him at the Re<lb></lb>servoir, near Lordship-road, at work—I said, "My gentleman, is this you?" and said I wanted him, and took him into custody—I did not say what I wanted him for—he resisted very much, by pulling strongly against me—helaid hold of the arm I held him with, and tried to twist his collar out of my hand—I drew my staff, and said he had better offer no more resist<lb></lb>ance but come along quietly, or he migbt get hurt—he then came with me about ten yards without resistance, then asked me to allow him to have his clothes—I said I would take care of them—he asked a second time for them, and I led him back for them—he took them in his arms, and said if I would let go of him he would walk quietly with me—I then let go of him, and put my staff in my pocket—he instantly threw his clothes down, and made a kick at my privates, but it did not take effect, it passed between my legs—he immediately caught me round my body and threw me down, then gave me a severe blow on the nose with his clenched fist—he gave me a</p>

               <p>severe kick over the eye, and another in the jaw, then tried to spring with his knee on my stomach, but did not succeed, as I drew my legs up—I then tried to get hold of his legs to throw him down—in doing so he drew my staff from my pocket, gave me a blow over the head with it, and another on the back of my head, then went before me and beat me across the legs with it—he then went away with my staff, saying he did not care if he got six months, he had given me a good <hi rend="italic">licking</hi>—I got up, but could not stand—Ifell down—I got up when I came to myself, and saw him walking away with my staff—nobody came to assist me—I went to a doctor—my head bled very much—I kept my bed for eight days, and did not go on duty for fifteen days—I felt the effects for a month.</p>

I went with the prose<lb></lb>cutor to look for the man who had been rescued the day before—we went to Lordship-road, and saw four men on the bankside—the bank has a road on each side the reservoir—I thought they might make off different ways, and sent him one way, and I went round the other to meet them—I did not see this happen, but when I got round to the side of the reservoir they were all gone from where they were at work—I ran on, and when I got to where I bad seen them at work, I saw several spots of blood on the grass—I went and found the prosecutor bleeding very much from wounds across the back of his head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand boy to John Rawlings, a currier, in Houndsditch. On Saturday morning the 20th of May, I was going over Tower-hill with my master's truck behind me, with 432 cap peaks—I looked round, and found the rope had been cut and the parcel taken off—I put the truck down, ran back, and found the prisoner with it under his arm—I called "Stop thief"—he dropped it in the kennel, and ran up Rose<lb></lb>mary-lane—I ran past the parcel after him—I then thought I should lose it—I came back and found the policeman with it—while I was putting it on the truck again, the prisoner and another came up—the other said, "I wanted a piece of rope—I said, "You are the person that cut it."</p>

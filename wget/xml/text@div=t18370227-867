                  </hi>. I live in Duke-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, and am a boot-maker. On the 25th of February, at half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was in the Edge ware-road—the prisoner came and spoke to me—I felt her hand in my waistcoat pocket, and I said, "You have picked my pocket"—she spoke to a person by her, and said, "This man says I have picked hit pocket"—I missed three half-crowns, four shillings, a sixpence, and some coppers—in going to the station-house she dropped something, which we took to be a half-crown, but could not find it.</p>

About twelve o'clock I heard a cry—I went up, and found the prisoner and three more women—the prosecutor charged her with the loss of his money, but did not say How much—we went on towards Portman-street—in going along she dropped something, but I do not know what—I asked her at the station-house if she had any money—she said she had not.</p>

I live with my parents at 297, Gray's-inn-road—they keep a shop—on Saturday, 23d December, between 2 and 3 o'clock, the male prisoner came in for half a pound of "pearl" biscuits, which I put in a bag—they came to threepence—he gave me a florin—I gave him the change—when he had gone, I tried the florin and found it was bad—I followed him, and saw him join the two female prisoners—they were waiting for him on the other side of the road—I followed them to the Caledonian-road, and the male prisoner went into a sweetstuff-shop—the females went a little further on, and waited—the man came out and joined them, and I followed them to the Roman-road—I then spoke to Policeman Y 129, and pointed the prisoners out to him—we followed them back to the Caledonian-road, and when we came to the Tower public-house the constable took the females—I</p>

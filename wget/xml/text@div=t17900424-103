He asked me for it: I asked him, for whom? He said, for Mr. Poynder, opposite the London-tavern: he is a bricklayer; I know him by sight; he lives opposite the London-tavern: Mr. Batchelor lives in <placeName id="t17900424-103-crimeloc542">Camomile-street</placeName>

My master came in when I was weighing it; he said he thought he was wrong: I let him have the bar; I followed him; he said the bar was to go to a building in Lime-street: instead of going to Lime-street, he came down Threadneedle-street to the back of the Mansion-house; he went down a place where there was no thoroughfare, and he turned back, and I stopped him and told him I must go with him, as my master knew nothing of the Gentleman: he said I had better it: I did, and I followed him; and he shewed me a building, and said that was it, but the men were at dinner, and he would fetch one of them: I saw a man in the building.</p>

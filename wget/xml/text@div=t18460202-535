                  </hi>. I am the son of Richard Goodwin; the prisoner was in his service; my father is proprietor of the Sunderland-wharf, St. Pancenas. On the 9th of Jan. I stopped the prisoner on suspicion, just going out of our wharf gate, with a piece of coal under his wnock-frock—I took him in to my father—he asked my father to let him go—he said no, he should give him in charge of a policeman, which he did—he had about eleven pounds of coal—this is the piece of coal, or it was a piece very much like this—we had such coal on our premises.</p>

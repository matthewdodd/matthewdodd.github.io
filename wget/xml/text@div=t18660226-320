                  </hi>. I am a ship-keeper in the service of the General Steam Navigation Company—on 16th February I had charge of the Sir Walter Raleigh, lying off Deptford, and I locked up the after-cabin—there was a coil of rope on the after part of the deck—the ship at that time was moored by the stern to a ring on the shore, by a rope about ten fathoms long—I went down in the fore-cabin about twenty minutes to 6, and while there I</p>

               <p>heard the watchman's voice—I went on deck, and I saw one or two of the party running up the embankment—it was too dark to discern who they were—I think there were three altogether—I went round the deck, and found the end of a large rope hanging over the ship's side, which had been previously lying in the middle of the deck—I got a light and examined the other rope, and found it was cast off, so that the ship was unmoored, but it was on dry ground, the water not being up—there were two barges near the ship, and it was close to them that the end of the rope was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am watchman to the prosecutors at Deptford—on the 16th, I was on the watch, and at about a quarter past 5, I saw the prisoners on the wharf with two other men and a boy—I saw them through the crevice of a board in the yard where I was, and to satisfy myself I got up a ladder and looked over the top of the board, so that I might swear to them, as I had been on the look out for them before—I saw Kiliher go along a plank up to the side of the ship, and I concealed myself behind a pile a few yards off—in a minute or so I saw him came back, and after that, I saw the two tallest go into the ship—I saw the end of the big rope passed over to Roberts, and saw him pull it—the other two then went to the side of the ship where the mooring-rope was—they were in the act of cutting it when I went round to give the alarm to the smith—I went down to the water gate, and a small boy called out to me, "What's the matter, George?"—I then saw the tall ones jump from the ship on to the barge where Roberts was—the two taller ones ran along by the shore—I caught Roberts in my arms, took him to the watch-house, locked him up, and went to get assistance; but in the meantime, he managed to get away—one of the pieces of rope now produced is a part of the coil which was on the deck—the smaller one is part of the piece with which the ship was moored.</p>

I am a smith in the service of the General Steam Navigation Company—on Friday the 16th, I was called from my shop by Leg—I saw three men running away—two got clear, and one concealed himself in a corner—that was Kiliher—I told him he had better give him<lb></lb>self up—he picked up half a brick and said, "If you follow me, you shall have this on your head"—with that he walked away on the shore side.</p>

I received a description of the three men, and proceeded to the Prince Arthur public-house—Bellingham was standing near the tap-room door—he said, "Oh, there you are!" and I said, "Yes"—I had not said anything before he said that—he said, "Let me have a drink before you take me away," and with that be took up a quart pot and drank—he then turned to the other two who were sitting at the table and said, "It is no use, we shall have to go; we may as well go quietly"—I called another constable, and we took them to the station, placed them with some others in the yard, and called the watchman in to pick out the prisoners—I then took them into the charge room, and told them I should charge them with attempting to steal a quantity of rope from one of the vessels belonging to the General Steam Navigation Company on the night before—they all three answered, "If you are going to lock us up, you must lock up Fashion, for he was the ringleader of it"—I took that man, but he could not be identified.</p>

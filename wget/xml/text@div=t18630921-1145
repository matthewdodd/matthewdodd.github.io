I am landlord of the Portland Hotel, London-street, Greenwich—on 18th August the prisoners came, Blair asked for a bottle of lemonade, Mortimer said you had better come with me and have a cup of tea, it will do you good—she said, "Then you will pay for it"—he said, "I have been paying for sufficient for you already to-day"—he passed some money from his hand to her hand, which she gave me, it was a half-crown—I tried it, bent it, and told her it was bad—Mortimer said, "Where did you get it?"—She said, "I got it from old Ironsides"—I returned it, she paid with a good shilling, and they left the house—I followed them, and saw them talking together—I spoke to a coachman, and saw Thomas go into Mr. Jeans', a confectioner's shop, and the other two prisoners remained fifty or sixty yards off—Thomas came out of the shop as I went in.</p>

I have been serving the Queen in India eight years, and was in the mutiny; I was in the General Post-office last winter, but a severe illness obliged me to leave; my discharges are in my pocket, and here is the ribbon of my medal.</p>

The prisoner was in the habit of coming to see my brother-in-law; he came on the morning of the 31st of March to breakfast; he said he was in distress, and had been in the watch-house all night - I let him lie down; he got up between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and I laid down - he then asked my wife to let him stop all night, which she did; the next morning my daughter brought down my watch, and put it on the table - the prisoner said it was a cold morning, and asked her to go and fetch a shirt collar which he had left up stairs - he then took the watch and went away; I had seen it safe about six o'clock that morning.</p>

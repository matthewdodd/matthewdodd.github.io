                  </hi>. I am a clicker, of 63, Murdock Street, Bethnal Green—I have been employed by the prisoner occasionally—I was at work there on the Monday night previous to his bankruptcy, and on Wednesday night, and I was there all day on Saturday, and was at work there on Monday morning—I was not at work on Wednesday—on Saturday I saw between</p>

               <p>two and throe gross of boots and shoes, the same ns usual, and several butts—the value of the boots and materials I saw was about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. without the machinery—I have not lately had an opportunity of seeing what there was up stairs—the last time I was up stairs was eight months ago, but I have seen him go up stairs and fetch goods down lately—I heard he had had a robbery—I cannot say who told me so, but I believe he did—I saw some of the articles I have spoken of after that—the place was in the same con-dition on Monday as on Saturday, but on Wednesday it was empty—there might perhaps have been six dozen of boots knocking about, but nothing worth speaking of—I last saw the horse and cart on the Wednesday night—it was standing outside the door at a quarter or twenty minutes past eight—when I went away I left it there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you ever sell a single pair of boots in your life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Many—they vary in value; some womens' boots are sold as low as 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pair, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a gross—the prisoner never got up any children's work, or very little—it was principally women's boots, varying in price—my duty was cutting them out—I also worked for Mr. London, of the Commercial Road—I work for the prisoner from six to eight in the morning and at night—I have seen boots brought from up stairs many times, to make up a quantity for customers—he dealt with wholesale people, and had to sell at the smallest possible profit—there were full three gross there on Saturday—they were about the place in different parts, some in the window, some on nails, and some in the back place, which the men were doing—there was only one person at work in the back place, I think, on Saturday morning, but there ought to be another one at night—I make the stock without the machinery come to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because: the boots were principally kid—I think the prisoner used to sell them at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pair—I never had anything to do with selling them—that is not a very high price for women's boots, whole-sale, I am paying 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Mr. London now by the dozen—I do not say that all these are worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—there might have been some enamel ones, and a few cashmeres, but the majority were the best—I have not reckoned them up, and I am not a good scholar—I arrive at the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because I think that a business like that could not possibly be carried on under that amount, for stock and floating capital—there were not goods out which were not paid for—they were boots in preparation of making—I do not think there was a shoe there—I believe the cutting press was a twenty-five inch one, that at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. an inch would be 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should think that the machinery was worth more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including the lasts—I mean to say that there was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of stock, besides the machinery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old, and am the prisoner's apprentice—I was at work with him all the week before his bankruptcy up to the Saturday—I did not go to the premises after Saturday—I slept up stairs in the back room on Saturday—I did not see any stock kept in that room that week, but boots and shoes were kept there sometimes—there were none in any room up stairs—I heard the prisoner say that he had lost some skins by a robbery from a shelf up stairs in the back room where I slept—I believe that was one Wednesday night, the Wednesday before the Saturday I spoke of—I was sleeping there on the Wednesday night—I did not hear anybody come in—to get to the shelf he spoke of, a person would have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186705060040"></xptr>
               <p>to stand on my bed or on a chair—I did not miss any skins—ho said there were six dozen; that would form a large bundle—I saw no such bundle there, but a week or a fortnight before the bankruptcy I saw him take away some goods in hampers with a horse and cart—there were about nine hampers altogether, and he took away three at a time—I could see through the canes that there were boots in them—the prisoner and I put them in, and the prisoner drove—It was towards the afternoon part—I did not go with him—the cart came back with the empty hampers, and he filled them again and took them away again the next day—I did not see him fill them—I assisted him to put them into the cart—I have seen him remove furniture in Mr. Matthew junior's van, not that week but before that—the prisoner and Matthews put the goods in the van—I only saw that done once—I did not see who went off with them, as I was called—I removed a hamper to 3, Viaduct Street—it was not a small one—Mr. Allen lives there, who assisted me himself—I do not know what it contained—it was very heavy—that was a few days before the bankruptcy—Mrs. Bent ley directed me to do it—I did not hear the prisoner say anything about a writ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe Mr. Bentley was out at the time. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I first went to live with the prisoner about two years ago—the making of boots has been carried on all that time—tho hampers are cane baskets, for the purpose of sending out goods—they hold three dozen full-sized women's boots, I think—they were not always in constant use during the first two years; one was in use, and I believe he borrowed two others—I have delivered goods myself in one of them—I have received money in payment for goods—I do not know how much a dozen for the best quality boots—I never took the money for a dozen—I have taken a dozen home, but cannot remember what I have been paid—the skins were supposed to be kept in the room were I slept, and were fetched down as they were wanted—a policeman came to the place on a Saturday, not the last day I was there, but a week before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It has been suggested that you did not wake up on the night of the robbery: did you wake up on the night of the policeman going there; did you hear that he had been into your room and that you did not wake up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not hear it—I found the window of the back room where I sleep, open in the morning; I had fastened it the night before—I had to go down stairs tho same night on account of the horse being loose, and at the same time I found tho window open—it was three o'clock in the morning—I had gone to bed at ten o'clock, and between ten and three the window had been opened by some one.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you find the window open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I went to bed I shut it, and at three o'clock, when I went down to the horse, I found it open again, before I went down—I sleep soundly; two policemen came.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you heard words between the prisoner and his wife while you have been living there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; whether true or not, the prisoner has said more than once that his wife drank too much—I know John Ferdinando—I do not remember his coming on Wednesday—I was not occupied in the room where the boots were, but in the back room adjoining—I used to go through the back room into the passage—I had nothing to do with the front shop—I used not to mind it whilst they were at their meals—some riveters worked there, besides Payne and me—I cannot say whether there were ever more than two gross of boots on the premises at ono time—I cannot guess at all how many there were—they were not sent away as soon as finished—I did not take them out—I only</p>

               <p>delivered quantities as small as a dozen—when Mrs. Bentley sent me to 3, Viaduct Street, Mr. Bentley was out of the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About the open window, which day of the week was that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The Wednesday week before I left; I left on the Saturday before the bankruptcy—the prisoner called me up, he was in my room before I saw the window open—he told me that the horse was loose, and I went down and fastened him up—I shut the window after I came back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a creditor of the prisoner—I did not prove the account under the bankruptcy—my debt is between 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to him two days after the last goods were delivered—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the invoice—aflter he had filed his petition I went there and asked him what for he had filed his petition; he would have done better to compromise with his creditors and make an agreement—he said he was afraid his creditors would not take his offer, and he had been robbed of a great number of his goods, which was the reason he could not pay—I said, "Bentley, what you say about being robbed is all <hi rend="italic">bosh</hi>, but you had better come up to the soli<lb></lb>citor and make an agreement with the creditors"—he tried to do so, but he had some bad advisers, I think—there was not much stock in the place then, that was after he hod filed his petition—I had been there before—there was never a very extensive stock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There never could have been a great deal, judging from the bankruptcy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the property he had of mine was materials, value 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., early in October—I called there two or three days afterwards and saw several dozens of boots hanging about, and a few kid skins—50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would cover the lot, leaving out the machinery—the highest price he could get from the wholesale houses for the best articles he manufactured was 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen, and 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 42<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the worst—he tried to make an arrangement after bankruptcy, and I think if he hod had any one else to advise him he would have done so—he tried to take it out of bankruptcy and privately arrange it—he has dealt with me two years—I trusted him never more than from 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took from him during the two years 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—ho paid me nearly every week—he paid all except the last lot—I was there mostly every week, sometimes every fortnight—I went there every week in October up to the bankruptcy—I saw no difference when I was there—he would make a very small profit on manufacturing, as he sold to the wholesale houses, five or six per cent.; the utmost would be ten per cent., and he might make bad debts, especially if ho took goods on credit.</p>

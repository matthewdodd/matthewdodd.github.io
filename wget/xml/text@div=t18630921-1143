On Monday night, 24th August, I was on duty in High-street, Woolwich—I saw some women on the pavement after 12 o'clock—they were prostitutes, and I know that some of them lived at Milk's house—they were making a noise, and I requested them to go away, or go in-doors—Mills came into the passage of his house, and said "You have no business to interfere with them, as some of them belong to me—I said, "It is my duty to do so"—I was about to go away from the door, when he rushed out, and struck me a violent blow on the cheek, and the next moment I was struck by Flynn, who lives next door to Mills, and was at his 'door at the time—I took out my rattle to spring it for assistance, and took out my staff to stand in my own defense—while I was springing my rattle, I received a violent blow from Flynn with some weapon which knocked me down insensible—I was holding my staff up to defend myself, and probably I may have touched him with it as he was following me up—there were forty or fifty people around me at that time—when I came to my senses I was being led to the station by two girls—I was off duty for a fortnight—I found I had been kicked under the jaw—my left eye was black, and a piece of skin was knocked off—I suffered much, and do still—I cannot get my mouth open yet, my jaw is so stiff, and the doctor says that it will</p>

I live at 2, Cannon-row, Woolwich, and am an unfortunate girl—on Monday night, 24th August, a little after 12 o'clock, I was on my door-step, which is only a minute or two from Mill's house—I heard a noise there, ran to see what was the matter, and saw the police<lb></lb>man holding Mill's door by the handle—he stood there two or three minutes—I did not see Mills then, but Flynn was standing at his door—there were a great many people in the street, costermongers, and a great many girls—the policeman went to Flynn's door, and told him to go in—he said that he would not while he was on his own premises—Mills then rushed at the policeman and hit him two or three times on the head with his fists—Flynn then hit the policeman with his fists three or four times up against the barrows; then the policeman pulled out his staff to protect himself, and hit Flynn two or three times on the head with it—Flynn hallooed for the poker, but a broom was brought instead from Flynn's house, and he hit the police<lb></lb>man with it, and knocked him down, and he was kicked on his head two or three times—a shovel was brought out of Flynn's house by some civilian, I do not know who; but one of the girls took it when the policeman was lying on the ground—I afterwards assisted some other girls in picking him up—I did not see Cassidy there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 77, High-street, Woolwich, and am a tailor—on the night that this <hi rend="italic">row</hi> occurred, I was standing outside No. 77—I saw it begin—I saw the police-constable there, and heard him telling the girls to go inside the door—there were three or four of them; they were not creating any disturbance; they were standing quiet, one of them sitting down; they went in after a while—Mills came out of his house, and there was a conversation between him and the policeman—at that time I saw Flynn come out of a public-house, which is next door, and go and stand at his own door—the policeman said to him, "Get inside your door," in a land and angry tone—Flynn said he was standing at his own door, and he should stand there as long as he liked—he was on his own premises—the constable told him to go in a second time, in a loud and angry tone, and Flynn said he would not go beyond his door; he could stop there as long as he liked—that was all that passed between them at that time—shortly after that I saw the police-constable struck by somebody; it was not Flynn—I swear that—the policeman was knocked down by the blow—I was standing out<lb></lb>side my own door, on the same side, and had an opportunity of seeing and hearing—Flynn's house is 76—I was outside that house—I lodge in Flynn's house—the policeman did not order me to go in—the policeman got up and drew his staff, and was following the man who struck him, but he was got away by his wife and a man—the policeman then went across the street and struck Flynn, who was standing alongside of a barrow there, a violent blow on the temple; the side of the head, which nearly knocked him down—he did not say anything before he struck him—Flynn was standing quietly by the barrow—the two or three women who had been there were then inside Mill's house—a crowd began to collect, and Flynn got a broom alongside of his own house—I did not see who gave him the broom—he followed the</p>

               <p>Policeman, who had sprung his rattle, and struck him with the broom on the head—I positively swear that that blow was struck by Flynn after the policeman struck him with the staff—there was about three minutes between the time the policeman struck Flynn and Flynn striking the policeman—I saw Flynn reel from the blow, about half way across the street—I was ex<lb></lb>amine before the Magistrate—I was not there when Flynn showed his head to the Magistrate—I had lived about five weeks in Flynn's house before this happened.</p>

Struck first, Flynn went to the other side of the road.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 67, High-street, and am a costermonger—I remember this <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I saw the policeman ordering the girls away, and heard him order Flynn in-doors—Flynn had just come out of a public-house; he was near his own door—I did not hear what Flynn said to the policeman—I saw the policeman struck, but not by Flynn at first—after he was struck he pulled his staff out, and struck Flynn, who was leaning against the barrow, a little on one side of the road—it was a violent blow—Flynn was not doing anything at the time the policeman struck him—he staggered back, and then ran to his door, got a broom, and struck the policeman—I am quite sure that blow was struck by Flynn, after the policeman had struck him—he was not interfering in any way in the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> that was going on—I was examined before the Magistrate.</p>

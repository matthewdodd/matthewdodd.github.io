                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 22.) On the 29th of March, at a quarter-past one o'clock in the morning, I went with the prosecuter and another officer to No. 2, Howard's-place. I went up one pair of stairs—I knocked at the door, and told the prisoner's husband I wanted to speak to him—he said he was in bed, but he opened the door, and I found the prisoner standing in the room—I said, "Have you pawned a piece of lines sheeting to night?"—she said "Yes"—I said, "Where is the remainder?"—her husband said, "There," and pointed to this roll, which was at the foot of the bed—the prisoner fainted, and sunk on the bed, on the floor—when she recovered, she cried very much, and said, "I know I took it, but it was through distress and want"—her husband said, "Oh Ann, how could you do so?" and he said when she brought it to him, she told him she got it of a person, and was to pay for it by weekly instalments—I found the duplicate on the mantel-piece.</p>

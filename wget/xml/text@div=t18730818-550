                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Nicholls, 127, Snow's Fields—on Thursday night, 24th July, about 6 o'clock, or a little after, George Hagley came to Mr. Praia's house, where I lived—I saw them go into the Rose public-house—I afterwards saw Hagley and the prisoner come out, and they fell down together—it was not much of a scuffle—I could see them very well from where I was looking out of my window—I only saw them fall once—I saw no blow struck—I did not see them get up—I directly ran down stairs to Mrs. Praul, and I afterwards saw Hagley come into the house—they Were drunk—Haley went into the back yard, and some little time after I went there and found him lying doubled up in the water-closet—his head was on the floor, and there were spots of blood on his head—the police and the doctor were sent for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was a stone-yard where I found him—he was half in the closet and half out, on his left side, with his hand under his head—when I saw him and tike prisoner fall, they had got hold of each other very tight, as if they were cuddling each other—they both fell at once.</p>

I am barman at the Rose tavern—I saw Hagley come in—the prisoner was at the bar at the time—a—man who was with Hagley called for a pint of half-and-half, and changed a half-sovereign—Hagley dropped a halfpenny—a woman and her brother who were there stooped to pick it up; Hagley <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the brother away, and stooped to pick it up himself—the woman went up and smacked him in the face, and with that the prisoner tried to part them—Hagley <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him on one side, and the prisoner shoved him outside the door, and put his foot against it—Hagley kept trying to come in again, and he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the door open and smacked the prisoner in the face with his fist—they went outside, and I saw nothing further—the prisoner returned to the house again.</p>

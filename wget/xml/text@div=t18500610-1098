                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, C</hi> 80). On Tuesday morning 21 st May, about a quarter or half-past twelve o'clock, I was at the corner of Panton-street, and Oxendon-street, Haymarket, and saw Dean talking to a gentle<lb></lb>man—the two male prisoners were on the other side of the way—Dean then went towards Leicester-square joined by the two males—I and another con<lb></lb>stable in plain clothes, who is not here, followed them along Leicester-square, to the corner of St. Martin's-lane—the two males then left Dean, and she went on a-head, and accosted a gentleman in Bear-street—the other prisoners were in sight at the time, five or ten yards off—she caught the gentleman by the left arm, walked with him a few yards, left him and went to the cor<lb></lb>ner of Leicester-square by the French Hotel, and she caught hold of another gentleman near Bear-street, at the corner of New Cranbourne-street—she went about three parts of the way with him down Bear-street, and then left him, and went with the two males into St. Martin's-lane, to Ben Caunt's, the pugilist's, public-house—they remained there drinking ten or twelve minutes—we watched them from the opposite side of the way—they all drank out of the same pot—they then went towards St. Martin's Church, and at the corner of Chandos-street there was a row with a drunken woman, they crossed over to it, and when they left there, a constable in uniform came up and they were given into custody—I searched Knight at the station, and found this gold watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his waistcoat pocket—I asked him whose it was; he said, his own, and it was given him by his father—the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist's assistant, and live in Bond-street. At the time this happened I lived at 2, Great Castle-street, Oxford-street—on the night of 20th May, about a quarter before eleven o'clock, I was in Picca-dilly—at twenty-five minutes or a quarter to twelve I saw the female prisoner in Bond-street—I accompanied her up Bond-street, to the corner of Oxford-street, where two men came up, and asked where a surgeon lived—I told them I did not know—I went with the prisoner to the eorner of Hanover-square, left her, and then missed my watch—I had it safe just before she accosted me—I was not near Bear-street at any time, Oxendon-street, or Leicester-square—the watch produced by Murrell is the one I lost.</p>

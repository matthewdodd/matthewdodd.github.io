                  </hi>. I live at 11, Osborne Terrace, Clapham—the prisoner was in my service for five days—on 29th May, I went to business at 8.15, and left my wife and children at home; one of my children is two<lb></lb>and-a-half years old, and the other a little one in arms; I had a nurse who had been with me since November—I was sent for at 1 o'clock, and got home at 1.20—I found my house in the possession of the police and firemen—I went over the premises, and in the lumber room found a portion of a hamper which had been burnt, and some charred straw—that was on the ground floor—there was also some fire-wood there not burnt—it had no business there—under the kitchen stairs I found two old chairs, two or three bundles of fire-wood, some tinder-paper and rags, all up together in a heap—the chairs were charred through, and part of the wood burnt—there were marks on the stairs such as would be produced by a candle being held to them—I then went on to the drawing room stairs—the banisters were split as if done with a knife, in two places, and there were marks of a candle—there were pieces of candle sticking in the wood—I found a hole in the wall, a little higher up, with matches and candle—it was only big enough to put two or three fingers in; it did not go through the wall—there were marks of burning round the hole—I went into the drawing room—I had locked the door in the morning when I opened the window—there were no signs of burning then—in the bed room the bed was all burnt, and the hangings on one side—I saw this candle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) found in the bed room—we have gas all over the house, and never use candles—when the prisoner came I had not time to go for her character—her former employer, Mr. Monnery, where.</p>

I am nurse in the service of Mr. Mell—on 29th May, about 11.30, I heard knocks at the street door—I was going down stairs, and noticed smoke coming up the staircase—I called out, "Where does this smoke come from"—there was no answer—I went up, and ran to Mrs. Mell's bedroom—the little boy was with her—the baby was in the nursery—I was down stairs at 10.45, in the kitchen—I went up stairs, but saw no signs of fire there—I ran down stairs with the baby, and found the little boy on the landing, by the drawing room door, playing with the handle—it was locked then—I then passed through the hall, and went into the street—the hall was full of smoke—I had seen the prisoner last at 10.45,</p>

               <p>she was then in the kitchen with me—I spoke to her again at 11.30—she had gone to mistress's bedroom with a cup of cocoa—that was before I saw the smoke—about the time I went into the street, I saw a gentleman carrying a basket of flaming straw—he threw it out of the door—I saw the prisoner bring some clothes to the door, and throw them out—I saw her in the dining-room first, after the fire—I said, "I wonder how this happened"—she said, "I don't know"—I went and looked in the coal<lb></lb>cellar, and found it full of smoke—that was under the lumber room—I afterwards went to the drawing-room, and found that full of smoke—up<lb></lb>stairs, I found a chair burning by the side of the fireplace—there was no fire in the grate—I had been in my bedroom in the morning; it was all safe then—about 4 or 5 o'clock I went in again, and saw my dressing<lb></lb>gown lying across the bed, with a hole burnt in it—the bed was scorched at the foot.</p>

I am an architect, and live next door to the prosecutor, at 12, Osborne Terrace—my attention was called to his house—I looked over the wall and saw smoke—I got over and went into the house—the smoke was coming from a wing of the house—I went into the basement and saw the prisoner in one of the rooms below, doing some work—I said "Do you know the house is on fire?"—she said "No"—I said "Well it is, and show me where the water is and I will help to put it out"—it was sometime in the forenoon, I don't know exactly the time—I went up stairs and the prisoner went with me—I took up a pail of water—I opened the lumber room door and threw in the water as quick as I could, it was fall of smoke but I could see no flames—I called in two or three men to get some more water, and as I threw some more into the lumber room I saw a flicker of fire in a basket of straw—I went in and took up the hamper and threw it into the street—it was burning then—I went to the front drawing room and found an easy chair burning—the room was open then—the chair was standing by itself, a little way from the fire<lb></lb>place—I also found some clothes burning, and when I went down I asked the prisoner if she had taken those clothes upstairs—she said "No"—I</p>

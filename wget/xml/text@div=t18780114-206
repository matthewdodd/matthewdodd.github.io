I am an oil and colourman, of 6, Hammond Place, Chatham, and 6, Old Bar, Brook-Mr. Daniel Gibbs is my manager at Brook—the prisoner has been a carman in my employ about five years—it was his duty to get corn and fodder from Mr. Driver every week, and every Saturday to get an invoice or bill from Mr. Driver for the fodder that had been supplied; he would take that bill to Mr. Gibbs, the manager of the shop, who would give him the money to pay, and on Monday morning he would bring me the bill receipted—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)</p>

There is a person of the name of Stephens in Mr. Driver's employ—on Wednesday morning, 2nd January, I received a bill from Mr. Driver by the first post—it was the prisoner's custom to go from my place at half-past eight with a horse and cart; I said to him "I have received this bill from Mr. Driver, do you know anything of it?"—he said "It is a mistake, we don't owe anything there; if you will give me the bill I will see Mr. Driver"—I said "I will see him myself "—in the evening I went to the stable and said to the prisoner "Now, Reed, I will go along with you and see Mr. Driver about these accounts"—he then said "I will make a clean breast of it, sir; I have received the money and receipted the bill" and he said that he would pay it in a week—I said it was impossible that he could do that, no one would lend him the money to do it, and I gave him into custody.</p>

I did not take it with the intention to defraud either Mr. Naylor or Mr. Driver; I took it for a short time, thinking to make it up. On 18th December I renewed my life policy and security for £20; on the 31st I sent it to the office, and on the 3rd January I was to receive the money to pay this bill with and to pay a quarter's rent; that was my intention. I did not intend to defraud, and I will try and pay the money: that was my first intention, and it is my intention now.</p>

I was at the corner of Grotto-passage, between nine and ten o'clock—there were two girls there—I saw the prisoner there—he called one of the girls on one side—I do not know what passed between them—they had some conversation—Dibley, who was one of them, said to the other girl, who the prisoner was in conversation with, "If you do not come away from that soldier, I will get your brother to give you a good <hi rend="italic">hiding;</hi> it is like your impudence talking to a soldier"—the prisoner came up to the girl and said, "What do you mean"—the prisoner and Dibley both struck each other on the face almost together—Dibley hit him with her fist—I do not know how he hit her, but it did not seem to take any effect upon her—Muggeridge came along a few minutes after and said, "Hey, hey, <hi rend="italic">Bet</hi>, what is the matter! come home along with me, <hi rend="italic">Bet</hi>, and we will go to bed; and if he follows we will bl—y well <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> him out of window"—the prisoner said, "What did you say?"—Muggeridge repeated the words—the prisoner said again, "What do you say?"—he repeated it again, and Dibley said, "Ah, so we will"—the pri<lb></lb>soner then drew his bayonet—Muggeridge was standing on the edge of the kerb—the prisoner was in liquor, and not able to account for himself—he drew his bayonet, and fell over with it—he struck Muggeridge with it, and Mug<lb></lb>geridge ran across the road—I went to him directly—he was screaming and crying, "Oh my eye!"—he said he was cut in the eye—he held his hand over his eye—the prisoner stood a few minutes—the constable came up, and as soon as he did so the prisoner walked a dozen yards, and the constable took him—the prisoner was very much in liquor.</p>

On the night of the 7th of Dec, about ten o'clock, I was standing right opposite my own door, with two or three more young lads, and saw the prisoner touch Dibley underneath the chin—I cannot tell whether he did it in a familiar way, or as if he struck her—she shoved him back, and said, "Don't take liberties with me"—he then pulled out his bayonet and went as if he run it into her—she ran back and he did not touch her with it—she came up and stood at the corner—the prisoner was at the other corner—I said to the young woman "Why don't you go away," and I merely mentioned in a joke the words "Chuck you out of window," but I did not mean any harm—I never spoke to the prisoner—I was speaking to the young lad who was standing there—I did not mean any one when I said, "Chuck you out of window"—I merely said it in talking to the young lad there—I do not recollect anybody saying, "If you will come with me I will throw you out of window"—when I said the words, all of a sudden the prisoner drew his bayonet and stuck it in my eye—I put my hand up to my eye, and said, "Oh my eye"—he was not across the road, there was a little passage, he stood at one corner and I on the other—I was there altogether not more than ten minutes—he had put his bayonet up, after drawing it out to the young woman—I was wounded just under the left eye—it was not a cut, but a poke—the doctor cannot say whether it has hurt the bone or not, as the swelling is not gone down—I did not say, "I will chuck you out of window" more than once—I was speaking to any one—I cannot tell what I meant by it.</p>

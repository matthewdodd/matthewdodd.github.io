                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Bills, of North-place. About six o'clock in the morning of the 13th of July I got up, and about seven missed my little boy's cap and other things which I had left on the table the night before—the door was left a-jar while a pail of water was fetched—these are my things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old. On this morning I was coming across the Ben Jon son's-fields, about a stone's throw from the prosecutrix's—I saw the prisoners with a bundle—I knew them before—one was kneeling down tying up the bundle, and one carrying three bonnets in his hand—I asked where they were going, and Mead said he was going to his sister's—I said that was not true—they said yes it was—I went my way, and they went theirs—they tied up this green cape in this handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a labourer. On the 13th of July he said a boy was leaving a bundle—I told him not to take it in—he said, "Oh, he will be back in five minutes—he is gone to fetch his little sister"—about half-past eight Bull came back—he said, "If you please, Ma'am, I have called for that bundle that I Ieft here"—I said, "You were to come in five minutes, and as you did not I took the liberty of opening the bundle, and there is a frock in it dripping wet"—he said, "It was not wet when I left it"—I said, "It was; you must get your mother—I do not feel justified in giving it you"—he went off—then Mead came in and said, "Where is the bundle you had of my brother?"—I said, "There is a frock in it wet"—he said, "It was not when my brother left it"—I said, "It was; and as you</p>

               <p>have told me a lie you may go and fetch your mother," and I shut the door—he put his head to the window and said, "Do you intend to give up the bundle?"—I said, "No"—he said, "If you do not I will d—d soon fetch a policeman and make you"—I said, "If you will I will give it up"—he ran away—I opened the door and saw two policemen—I called them and gave the things up.</p>

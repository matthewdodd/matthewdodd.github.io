I live at St. James's Road, Walthamstow—on 1st June Francis came to me and said, "I come from Dr. Jones, of 19, Finsbury Pavement, to look at the horse, chaise, and harness"—I had advertised a horse, chaise, and harness for sale that day—he asked me what the price was—I said, "Fifty-five guineas"—he said he supposed 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would do if the doctor would like it—he had the horse put into the chaise and tried it, and liked it very well—at four o'clock on Saturday afternoon, the next day, he came back and brought this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it purports to be signed by Dr. Jones—Francis wrote his name on the back—he said I should not get the money unless he wrote his name at the back—he wrote "William Smith" on the back of it (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "No. 21033. Threadneedle Street, London, June, 1866. Bank of London. Pay to Mr. Smith or bearer the sum of 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Signed, W. Jones." Francis said he had brought the cheque for the horse and chaise, and the doctor had just signed the cheque before he came away—he said that the doctor had made it out in his name because he did not know mine, as I had not advertised the sale in my own name—he gave me an address, Milton Street, City—</p>

               <p>I afterwards presented the cheque, and it was dishonoured—the bank had been closed two days—I afterwards saw Dr. Jones, and in consequence of what passed I gave the prisoner into custody, when I saw him—that was at 4, Trafalgar Place, Park Road—I have since seen my chaise at Mr. Barber's, in the Walworth Road—I was induced to part with that chaise and horse, having known Dr. Jones for a number of years, and knowing he lived on Finsbury Pavement—I parted with it because he represented that he came from Dr. Jones—not knowing the bank was stopped, I thought the cheque was genuine.</p>

I am ostler at Mr. Barber's livery stables, Cam<lb></lb>berwell Gate, Walworth Road—on Sunday morning, 3rd June, the dark man, with whiskers (Wells), came to my master's place, he said his name was W. Smith, and said to my master, "Can I leave this four-wheel trap?"—he had a four-wheel trap with him, he said, "Can I leave this four-wheel trap, and you lend me a gig?"—my master said, "Yes," and lent him one—he came home with it the following Friday afternoon, and paid me what my master charged—he said, he should come for the four-wheel trap on the Monday or Tuesday—he came on the Monday evening, a little after 7 o'clock—before that I had seen Policeman 42 P, who told me not to let the trap go—when Wells came for the trap he was given into custody.</p>

I met him by appointment at the "White Bear," in King William Street—I told him the horse and trap was 55 guineas, but that I got it for 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "Very well"—I went by appointment at 3 in the afternoon, and met Smith, who handed me the cheque, and said, "My name is on the cheque, and you can put my name on the back of it before you give it up"—I said, "Can't you do it?" He said he had no pen and ink, and I said I would do it—I went and fetched the horse and trap—Smith gave me half a sovereign—I can clearly see I have been made a dupe of by these vagabonds—they don't bring up the right parties at all—the prosecutor did not go to the bank till the Monday morning—he does not know whether the money is in the bank or not.</p>

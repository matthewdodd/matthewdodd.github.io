Sexton was brought to me and I found on him 1l. 3s. 6d. in silver, a half-sovereign and a clasp-knife; it was then considered that Mitchell was concerned with him - he was fetched, and one crown, 7s., and a knife were found on him; we went before Mr. Orm at Stanmore - he has not sent any depositions - it is not customary there.</p>

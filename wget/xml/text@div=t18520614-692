                  </hi>. I live in James-street, Kennington, and am servant to Clarina Lonsdale; she keeps a grocer's and a general shop, and sells cigars. On Wednesday night, 26th May, about 10 o'clock, I and my aunt were sitting in the parlour—we heard a noise like the shuffling of feet under the window—I went into the shop, and saw some one standing at the window—I only saw one—I went to the door, and the person was gone—I examined the window, and found it broken, and the cigars strewed on the pathway—they had been taken out of the case of cigars—the window had the appearance of being cut—I had seen the window safe and the cigars safe about ten minutes before—the shop door was shut, and fastened by a latch—I helped to pick up the cigars that were lying in the pathway—there were about eighteen.</p>

               <p>being broken would be louder tban the shuffling of feet—the glass bad the appearance of having been cut out with a glazier's diamond—it was cut in a round manner at the top—the piece that was left in the frame was not cracked at all—there were no splinters—our house is in James-street, Kennington—this was on the Derby day—I did not see many people about—they were gone to see the people coming from the races—there are a good many small houses in the street we live in—there are other shops besides ours—a number of boys live in the neighbourhood, and are always about—I know Ablett lives in the street, and I believe the other prisoners do.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, in James-street, Kennington, four doors from Miss Lonsdale's. On Wednesday, 26th May, I was at our door, about 10 o'clock in the evening—I saw three of the prisoners, Cunning<lb></lb>ham, Ablett, and Ede—I knew them before—I had seen them a good many times—I saw them that evening standing at Miss Lonsdale's window—they were close to the window—there were some others with them, but they were behind them—there were about ten altogether—the three prisoners that I have named were the only ones who were close to the window—I can swear positively to them—I have no doubt about them—I did not see them do any<lb></lb>thing—I saw them about half an hour afterwards—they passed by me—I did not remain the whole time at the door—I had been on an errand—I passed them, and then I returned—I was not away many minutes—when I returned I stood at the door again—they then ran past me, and I saw Cunningham and Ablett putting their hands into their pockets—I could not see that they had anything in their hands—I then went and helped Miss Weaver to pick up the cigars that were lying on the path.</p>

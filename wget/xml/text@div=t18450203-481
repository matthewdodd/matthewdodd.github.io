                  </hi>. I live in Lower Shadwell, and am clerk to John and Thomas Charrington, coal-merchants. On the 28th of Dec. the prisoner came to our wharf, and asked the price of coals—I asked his name, where he lived, and whether he sold coals—he said, "Yes," and ordered three tons—he said he lived at No. 121, Long-alley—he did not say whose business he had got there—I booked his order, and asked him for the money—he said, "I have not got the money with me, but I will send it back by the carman"—I said, "It is usual to pay for them; understand, the money must come back by the carman"—I repeated those words again (it is customary in the coal-trade for all strangers to pay before the coals are shot)—I sent the coals the same evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to the prosecutors—I received orders to take three tons of coals to the prisoner's house in Long-alley—I took a receipt with me for the money—my orders were to bring the money home to the counting-house, and to take the money before I shot the coals—I went to Long-alley and saw the prisoner—I showed him the receipt before I shot the coals—he said he would pay me as soon as the coals were shot—he said the money was all right—the place I took the coals to was in Long-alley, about seventy yards from the public street—I shot them on that condition, that the prisoner promised to pay me as soon as they were shot—when I had shot them he called me into a little room adjoining the shop—he gave me the receipt back, and said he could not pay me, his friend not having come forward—I said I should get into a sad noise at home, for not taking the money home—he said I should not get into any difficulty, the money should be right on Monday at dinner-time—there were no more coals where these were shot—I could have got them out again with other help—I asked where his friend lived—he said in Brick-lane—I went and enquired at coal-sheds along Brick-lane if they knew a Mr. Manley, but I could not find any person who knew him—I went back to our wharf and told Mr. Wade I could not get the money, and that the man promised to come on the Monday at dinner-time and pay for them—I went to the prisoner's premises on the Monday, as he did not come—I saw him sitting in the back room adjoining the shop—I said, "You have not been according to promise to pay for the coals"—he said, "I was just talking about you, my friend has not come"—I waited there about ten minutes, and persuaded him to come to Mr. Charrington's office, in Fenchurch-street, which he did—I did not find the friend—some of the coals were ordered to go to Broad-street-buildings before they were shot—they were weighed while we shot them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How much were the coals? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The bill was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw him weigh up several small quantities—there are a great many houses and shops in Long-alley—it is a great thoroughfare for small shops—when he said he had been talking about me I said, "Come with me to Mr. Charrington's office"—he said he wanted his tea—I said it would not take more than ten minutes—he went to Mr. Charrington'Si and he sent me for a policeman to take him, as soon as he got him in the counting-house—there was not any name over the door of the prisoner's shop on the Monday that I could see—I looked for the name—I did not see it—I have not been there since.</p>

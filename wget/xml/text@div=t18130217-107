She asked for half a quire of white and brown paper. I told her that was threepence. She said, if she took another half quire could not she have it for five pence halfpenny. No, I said, we make no abate meat at all. She then asked for a quire. I gave it her. She gave half a crown. My sight not being so cleaver, I took it to Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones said, it was a very base half-crown. He came with me, and asked her where she got that half-crown. She said she found it in the street. He said, he would send for a constable, as she had bad money about her. When the constable came, he took her backwards and searched her. The constable has the half-crown. I was not present when she was searched.</p>

I went forward into the shop, where I saw the prisoner. I asked her how she came by that half-crown. She said she found it. I said, I believed her to be a bad woman, and I would send for a constable. I accordingly did send for a constable, and in the interim my son came into the shop, and in the passage leading to behind the counter, he picked up a something, and gave it me. It was a paper, containing six counterfeit shillings. When the constable came, I gave him the half-crown and the six shillings. The six shillings were picked up by my son after I said I would send for a constable, and charged her with being a bad woman of that description. He picked them up about two yards distance from the place where the prisoner was standing. I delivered precisely the some shillings to the constable, as my son delivered to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linen draper, of 285, High Holborn. The prisoner was in my employ six weeks—on or about 4th Aug. he said that he was unwell, and desired to leave me—I agreed, and he left, but there was no settlement—I had missed property eight or ten days before that, and mentioned the matter, not to him personally, but in his presence—he said nothing that I heard—I missed some more property, but not half of what has been found—the officer brought some part to me, two or three days after the prisoner left, and made me look round, and then I missed a large quantity—there were fire shawls, two muffs, two victorines, some lace and muslin collars, and several other articles, all of which I identify—they were safe a very short time before, and had not been sold—the value of the first parcel sold was from 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the second, 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and the third, from 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of No. 5, York-place, Walworth-road. The prisoner has been a customer of mine for about four or five Sunday mornings—he invariably had something in his hand when he came, generally a paper parcel—last Sunday fortnight he came with an immense bundle on his shoulder; he put it on my block, and said, "It is excessively hot"—I said, "Yes,"—he said, "I wish you would allow me to leave this parcel here till to-morrow morning, for it is so excessively hot I cannot carry it further"—I said, "I had rather you would not leave it here; our place is very greasy, and I do not know what it contains"—he said, "Pray let me leave it," and I allowed him to leave it in the back part of the shop; he then purchased 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of meat, which he did not pay for, but said, "I will come in the morning, fetch the bundle, and pay the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I saw no more of him till Tuesday, he then said that he had come for some things out of the bundle; he opened it in the shop and took two pieces of, perhaps it was silk, out; wrapped it up, and then left the shop and purchased some paper for the remainder—I said, "It is an unpleasant thing, take it away—he said, "I will take it away at night"—I afterwards communicated with Coppin, the sergeant of police; he came and I showed bin) the articles—the articles I gave him afterwards were what I received from the prisoner—I was present on the Friday, when Coppin and the prisoner were at my shop—the prisoner said, "Good morning, Sir, I have come for my parcel"—I told Coppin who he was; he got before him, and said, "You do not know me"—he said, "No"—Coppin said, "I am a sergeant of police, and before you can have that parcel I must know more about it"—I have heard the sergeant examined—the account of the conversation he has given with the prisoner is quite correct.</p>

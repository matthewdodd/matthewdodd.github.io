                  </hi> I am a fishmonger, in Richmond-terrace, Walworth. On 16th Aug. the prisoner came, about half past 10 o'clock at night—he bought some oysters and bread, which came to 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;—he gave me a coun<lb></lb>terfeit shilling—I put it in my waistcoat pocket—I knew ft was bad before he left the shop, but my attention was drawn away by other customers—he received his change, and left—he was well known to me—he came again, with a female, as near 12 o'clock as possible—he did not come into the shop, the female came in, and she tendered me another counterfeit shilling—I took up the shilling, and told her it was a bad one—she went a few paces from the shop, and went to the prisoner, who was standing next door but one—she said it was a bad one—he appeared a little surprised, and he staggered back to the shop—I told him of the other shillings—he said he had passed no bad money, and he walked away—I followed him, and met a constable—there were several persons following me at that then—I gave</p>

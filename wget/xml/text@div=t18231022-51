            . I belong to the ship Margaret. On Sunday, the 21st of September, I was in the Minories, and saw the prisoner Smith talking to a man; it rained hard. I lost my road, and the man said to her,</p>
               <p>"There is a drunken sailor, you had better follow him" - she walked with me, and shewed me the way towards my lodging. she took me to a room - I sat down. Davis came in; I asked if she was mistress of the house; she said Yes - she went out again. I took my watch, and put it into my hat, which was on the table. Smith sat by my side; then jumped off my knee, and left me directly. I took up my hat, and my watch was gone. I could see no number on the door; so I made a scratch on the door-post with my knife. I informed Avery; he took the two prisoners - I saw them in custody two days after, and am certain of them. I was with no other woman.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On Sunday night, about eleven o'clock, I met the prosecutor coming out of Cable-court, Cable-street - he said he had been robbed of his watch, and took me to the house where he had made a notch on the door-post. I searched the room, and found nobody. A person could easily reach to the table by coming to the door. From his description of the women, I apprehended the prisoners on Monday night, two doors off, in bed together. They declared their innocence - I secured them. Marlow saw them next day. Another female was at the bar with them; he pointed them out directly.</p>

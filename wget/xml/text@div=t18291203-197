            . I was with Bigley; what he has stated is correct.</p>
               <p>JOHN WRIGHT. I am a Police-constable. The prisoner was given into my charge; I asked him where he got them- he said, "From a building," but would not satisfy me from what building.</p>
               <p>RICHARD SMART. I had a tile-heap at Half-mooncrescent: I looked at it the morning after this happened, and at least one hundred tiles had been taken.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you not aware there was another person? A. I have heard so; I have not told the prisoner if he would tell me who the other was I would let him go, nor did I authorize my son to write word so to him - the prisoner is married, and worked for me for four years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am in the habit of jobbing for myself, and had a job for Mr. Schofield; the tiles I had were part of what I had left - here is a bill of them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

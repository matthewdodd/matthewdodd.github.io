As he was going round to the other side the table, to receive his money of the other clerk, Mr. Dickset asked him how long he had belonge d to the ship? he said, 19 months: he was then asked the captain's name, he could not tell, upon which we suspected him; we asked him if he knew several of the officers, he could not tell any of their names; we sent for a constable, and in about two or three minutes after he declared he was never on board the ship Burford, and that his name was

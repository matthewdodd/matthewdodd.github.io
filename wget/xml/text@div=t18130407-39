            , my young man, shewed her the muslin. The young man left the prisoner and was gone to some other part of the premises. I saw the prisoner in a great bustle with her cloak. She had a very large mantle on, and from that I suspected she had taken something. I saw her in the act of drawing her clothes together. I was on the opposite side of the counter, and stood before her. I went to where she was. I turned over the goods to try if I could miss anything. I could not. I looked hard at the prisoner, and was satisfied in my own mind that she had taken something. She after that sat down in a chair; I could see the goods stick out. I then was certain that she had something. I made up my mind. I was determined to search her before she left the premises. She got up from the chair, and went four or five yards. I told her I should like to look under her cloak before she left the premises. She then immediately dropped the goods from under her cloak. I picked them up. She wished me to let her go. I told her I could not. I sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the other woman gone away - A. No, they were both detained, and taken to Marlborough-street office. The prisoner was committed. The other woman was discharged.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming into your master's shop - A. Perfectly well. On the 20th of February, the prisoner, accompanied by another woman, came in and asked for a piece of muslin. They were shewn her. The woman that was in company with the prisoner purchased a small quantity that came to three shillings. The prisoner purchased nothing. The other woman wished to see some Irish linen. I left them. I had farther to go in the shop for the Irish linen. When I came back, I found her sitting in the chair where I left her. At the time I was gone in the front shop, there was something in the prisoner's conduct that gave me suspicion. The prisoner retired from the counter towards the fire-place. It was plain to be perceived that she had something under her cloak, and when Mr. Stratton. said he wished to search her, she dropped the five pieces of muslin. The prisoner seemed very much confused. I saw it drop from her myself. This is the muslin; it is the property of

                  </hi>. I am female searcher at West Ham police<lb></lb>station—on 13th May, about 5.30, the prisoner was brought to the station—I searched her and found one table napkin, a purse in her dress pocket, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bronze—when I unfolded the table napkin, she said "I took it out of the drawer, it belongs to my master, don't let any one see it, it will go harder against me"—she also said she took the shawl because she thought it belonged to the other servant, and the might as well have it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Northumberland House, Forest Gate—the prisoner was our general servant four months—I lent her a silver watch to hang in the kitchen—I missed it on Saturday, May 11th—she left the house unprotected—an the Monday, in consequence of what I heard, I dismissed her—previously she wanted to buy a box—I gave her an empty one—she packed it and put a cord on it—there was a lock but no key—she asked leave to let it stop till the morning—I gave her leave—I went with my stepdaughter and opened the box—I found these things: a shawl, a curtain, a pair of cuffs and three books—they are mine—I gave information to the police—I met a constable near Forest Gate station, and another talking to him—the prisoner came up and said "Have you found the watch?"—I said "No, but I found things in the box that do not belong to you"—she did not reply—I said "You had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805270062"></xptr>
               <p>better come back to the house along with me," and she came back with the constable—I brought the things down—she said she did not know the curtain was in her box—the curtain was rolled in paper—I also showed her a Church service, telling her I found it in her box—she said she did not know it was there—only my stepdaughter and a little girl live with me—no other person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I have independent means—I did not dismiss the prisoner because she stole my watch, but for being absent when I was not at home—I did not accuse her of stealing it—I paid her a month's wages in advance when I dismissed her—I know she is defended by the charity of her neighbours—I gave her some curtains to make up for one of the rooms—she did it properly—this is the remainder—she said I did not find it in her box, because it was wrapped up in paper—I lent her a drawer with no key—the former servant had the same drawer—I did say at the police-court "She might have taken the shawl out by mistake and put it in her box"—two others had access to the box between 10 A.m. and 5 P.m.—I was ignorant of the law when I opened it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The two girls who were in the house with me are here—I know the shawl was in the house after the prisoner came—it was not in the drawer when I gave it her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am stepdaughter of the last witness—on Monday, 13th May, I went with him to the servants' bedroom—I saw the box with a cord on it, which my stepfather had given the servant—he opened the box in my presence—I had been in the house all day—no one had interfered with it—I saw the shawl taken out of the box—it had been lent to me by a friend—I had had it three months—I put it in a clothes basket—I never gave the prisoner leave to take it—I saw if in the basket about two months before—my stepfather also found this Church service which I used to keep in the breakfast parlour—I never gave it to the prisoner, nor authorised her to take it—he also found this pair of cuffs—they are my sister's—she is aged 8—the name "Com<lb></lb>fortable" is on them—I was present when the constable came.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. My mother married the prosecutor, and I have lived there since—my mother is dead—a groom was in the service at the time the watch was stolen—he was there not more than a week, perhaps three days—I was told he is a married man—he was there the day before the prisoner was given into custody—there was no suspicion till I missed the watch—when my stepfather went out he did not tell me he was going to prosecute—he said he should speak to a policeman—I do not think he intended to prosecute—I never missed the piece of curtain—after the curtains were made they lay on the breakfast parlour table—I am 16 years of age—there are four bedrooms in the house—my little sister sleeps in a top room—I sleep on the second floor—Mr. Price also sleeps on the second floor—I lent the prisoner two books, "Routledge's Christmas Annual," and the "Haunted River"—she used to go to church—I did not lend her my Church service—I did not know she took it—I missed it—I never asked her for it—I asked my sister—I went to church, but not on the day I missed it—my sister's name is Jessie.</p>

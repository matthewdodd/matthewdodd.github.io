            . I live with my father in Regent-street, which is about five minutes walk from Great Marlborough-street. On the 26th of May, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, my father and mother were out - I and my sister Ann were in the shop; a person came to purchase some albums.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and say if you think he is the person - Q. He is the person - I have no doubt, or I would not swear it - I saw him walk by the shop about nine o'clock; he walked by more than once, and afterwards came into the shop and desired to be shewn a Ladies album which was in the window, for he wished to make a present of one to a lady. I shewed him one with a plain lock - he asked the price - I told him 1 l. 15 s. and 10 s. for the lock; it had a lock and key attached to it - I said I had one with an embossed lock, which came to 35 s., and the lock to 12 s. - he said very well. He put his hand into his right hand pocket and said</p>
               <p>"That will be 2 l. 7 s. won't it" - I said it would. I heard money rattle, and thought he was going to pay me; he had put the plain one on the counter, and the one with an embossed lock upon it; and said he wanted a purse, which was in the window - I did not exactly recollect what purses were in the window, and having some in a glass case on the counter I opened it and shewed him one. I was standing outside the counter by the side of him - he asked for a purse from the window - I had to go round the counter to get it, and my back was turned towards him, and on my turning round he was gone, and the books also. I ran round and called Watch! the watchman was not in the way, nobody heard me execept the servant of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the window did you go quite up to it - A. Yes, and just as I got to it I missed him and the books; before I opened the window - I only turned my back to him as I turned round to go behind the counter. He pointed out the place from which he wanted the purse, I could not get at it without turning my back to him.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time was your sister present - A. She was in the shop, and I was just inside the door. The prisoner had been waiting some time, passing up and down - I dare say he passed the shop eight times - I noticed that to my sister before he came in. I thought he was waiting for somebody; my attention was directed to him before he came into the shop by his passing in that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of noticing his features - A. Yes, there were three gas lights, two in the shop, and one opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see him - A. On the 8th of June, about eight o'clock in the evening. I was going down Cleveland-street, just by Union-street, (with my two little sisters to the mantau makers) and saw him - I left go of the children, and directly went up to him and said,</p>
               <p>"It was you who robbed me, on such a day in my father's shop," he said</p>
               <p>"You are bringing a mob round me and insulting me - quite a disgrace" and then pushed me away.</p>

                  <persName id="t18240715-100-person905">Q. </persName>
            Had you at that time seized hold of his person - A. I had - he endeavoured to get away - he went over to a butcher's shop, and said to the people assembled</p>
               <p>"Give me a coach" - he spoke of Marlborough-street, and Carburton-street; he went out of the shop - I told I would not let him go; he went out twice to go away - I ran after him and caught hold of him - a little girl came up and I asked her to fetch an officer, and directly afterwards Schofield and another person came up and took him, and when I got to the watch-house he said he would ruin my father - I said he had robbed me in my father's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his hands - A. He had a ring on the little finger of his right hand - the officer said he did not understand his name, he offered to write it himself, and when he put his hand out I saw the ring - he said his name was

             - he did not write. He took out a watch or time piece, saying, I shall remember it was such a time that you put me in, and I will make you remember it, - he had the watch in his hand when he made the observation.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. On what day of the week was the 26th of May - A. Wednesday. It happened by candle-light - I should think he was four or five minutes in the shop - my sister was not in the shop all the time - we have only one counter - he was dressed much as he is now, except his trowsers: he had a blue<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150040"></xptr>coat, and his trowsers were either unbleached Russia duck or light cloth, a kind of drab colour; he wore a black hat, which was on all the time; his neckcloth was something of the same kind as he has now. I have always described his dress as I have now - I never said he wore a brown coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any effort to get away - A. Yes, he did, three times - he pushed me away; I never said that he pushed me down, he pushed me nearly down - nobody went for a coach - he desired to be taken into some shop; I said certainly, it would be most proper - he said</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, let me go into some shop" - he went in of his own accord; I followed him - he asked somebody to go for Mr. Abraham's, of Marlborough-street, and likewise to Carburton-street, where I now know that he lodged, and that he was clerk to Mr. Abrahams.</p>

            . I was at home, with my sister, on Wednesday evening, the 2d of May - I know the prisoner, I saw him pass my father's door several times, about half-past nine o'clock, or twenty minutes to ten - I speak from the appearance of the evening, not from any clock - we have two gas lights in our shop, and one opposite; my sister made an observation to me about him; I then saw him come into the shop; I looked at him, but did not remain in the shop an instant after he came in; I stood just inside the door, he came in, and I went into the parlour, which joins the shop - I had seen him pass seven or eight times close to the window; I saw him each way he went, he looked in at the window; there were albums and purses in the window - after I got into the parlour I heard my sister call Watch! - he was then gone - I saw him at Marlborough-street office afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your opinion as to his being the person who came into your shop - A. I was quite certain that he is the person; I never entertained a doubt of it.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Harrison, pawnbroker, Tottenham-court-road - on Thursday or Friday 27th or 28th of May the prisoner came to our shop - I had seen him pass our door before.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your belief as to his being the person - A. I believe it was the prisoner - I have seen him pass the shop more than once on different days.</p>
               <p>Q. When the person came to you, are you sure that it was the same person you had previously seen passing - A. Yes, he came with a square book bound in morocco with a plain brass lock and key to it, and wanted to sell it; I opened it and asked what it was for, he said it was for setting down extracts; he asked thirty or thirty-five shillings for it, which I thought too much. and did not buy it; I believe he had dark clothes on; his coat was buttoned; I think he had a black coat and blue trowsers on; I believe it to be the prisoner; our shop is at the corner of Hanway-yard, nearly opposite Russell-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. At what time did the prisoner come - A. Between three and four o'clock; our windows are filled with goods, which darkens it; I will not be positive of the colour of his coat or trowsers, I know it was a dark coat, and very fashionably made.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. The individual you saw was a person you had seen before - A. Yes, my attention was directed more to his features than his dress; I verily believe it to be the prisoner; I have no doubt about him.</p>

Carburton-street is about a mile from Mr. Denham's, or may be rather more.

            . I am journeyman to Messrs. Chaffers and Mills, pawnbroker's, Greek-street, Soho. On the day after these albums were stolen, a hand-bill was brought to our shop; it was on the 27th or 28th of May: A person had been to our shop a quarter of an hour before the bill was brought, and offered an album, bound in blue morocco, with a plain lock and key; he asked two guineas for it. I had seen him once before at our shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner that young man - A. No; he was very much like him, and had the same coloured hair, but was not quite so fair, and was rather stouter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in his general character like the prisoner - A. Yes; he was about ten minutes in the shop. I refused to take the album in: he called again in about a fortnight, and offered me two razors; I did not buy them; he was then about five minutes with me; knowing him to be the same person who had offered the album I intended to stop him - I asked him what the razors cost, meaning to get round the counter to stop him, but upon my putting my hand on the flap of the counter to lift it up, he immediately slipped out of the shop, leaving the razors behind; I produce them - I have not seen him since. I appeared at Marlborough-street when the prisoner was apprehended,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150041"></xptr>and stated this. Mrs. Clifton claimed the razors. I am certain the prisoner is not the man.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. The person was so dissimilar that you have no hesitation in saying he is not the man - A. It was not him; I have not the least hesitation in saying so; there is a resemblance between them. Cook, a constable desired me to attend at Marlborough-street; I had given him information about the razors. Nobody but me was in the shop - both the apprentices were absent. Directly the man went out I alarmed Mr. Mills; he is not here. Cook (who had left the hand-bill) called, and said he had taken a man for stealing the albums; I said I had two razors. I went and saw the prisoner in the lock-up-room.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. When the man brought the razors you intended to stop him - A. Yes. I thought if I made an alarm before I got round the counter he would make off. Immediately on seeing the prisoner I said he was not the man.</p>

            . I have been an officer in the French army. I was in Cleveland-street, at the corner of Union-street, when Miss Denham stopped this young gentleman - he conducted himself with great propriety as I thought: he did not attempt to escape - they both crossed over to me. The lady begged of me to stop him, saying he had robbed her; I asked of what; she said, of albums, which I did not understand, and asked what they were - she said two books: the prisoner denied it, and said she mistook him. I observed to her that she should be very cautious in making so serious a charge, without being perfectly satisfied. They went into a butcher's-shop; he offered to go to Marlborough-street, and desired a coach might be got, and said he would pay the butcher if he got it. I told her Marlborough-street was a respectable street, and as he appeared a respectable young man she would find who he was, and had better go; she said he would run away; he made no attempt to go away.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. She however applied to you to stop him - A. She did; I advised her to go to Marlborough-street with him, and feeling for his situation I said I would go and inform his friends.</p>

            . I am a butcher. I remember this young gentleman coming into my shop; there were not three persons in the street at first, but there were several afterwards; Miss Denham came in after him; I saw her meet him as I sat in the shop. I did not observe him make the slightest attempt to go away - he came in and said,</p>

            . On the night the prisoner was taken, I was at Shortland's house, in front of the window, putting in a square of glass, and saw Miss Denham and this young gentleman together in the street; he came into the shop, and stood as quiet as possible, and did not make the least attempt to go away.

            , my servant was also at home. I think it was on a Wednesday; I have a distinct recollection of the day, from various circumstances; the servant let him in at seven o'clock in the evening - he enquired for me; I went into the back parlour to him - he wanted to speak to me on some business which I had spoken to him about in the morning - I was about ten minutes in the room with him; I then went down stairs, and sent the servant up to him with coffee. I did not go into the room again that evening; the servant took him up candles afterwards - I had heard him ring the bell, and asked what it was for, having two bells, which ring alike; I thought it was a gentleman on the second floor, and enquired why it was not answered; the reply was that Mr. Robinson had rung for a candle. I did not see him again that night, but am sure he was not out of the house; he supped about half-past nine o'clock, and had a little ham, which Susan carried him; she had to go out for it, and came up to me for the money. All the family retired to bed a little after ten. - if I do not see the door fastened the person on the first floor does. I did not see it fastened on that night. I swear he did not go out from seven o'clock that night, till after breakfast next morning. I am certain it was on the 26th.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. When did they first apply to you to say where he was on the 26th - A. I attended his second examination. Mr. Fitzgerald had called to enquire about his character on the night he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell at what time he came in on the 25th - A. Why he was rather late on the previous night; it was the night Harris's balloon went off - he did not sup at home. He came home to tea on the 27th about half-past six o'clock; then took a short walk, and returned - I think he had no supper that night.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in Term time - A. Yes. I have particularly considered the transactions of this day.</p>
               <p>Q. What is there to fix in your mind about his having coffee and ham, and ringing the bell so often on this particular night - A. Why I can give you a reason; I was up stairs with the lady on the first floor, and spent the evening with her - I am not in the habit of going up there much; I was out the day previous, and she was to have gone with me to see my mother, but it was thought best for her to stay at home - it was on the day the balloon went off, and the first time I had taken such a walk after my confinement. I was in the habit of seeing what clothes he wore; he had no blue trowsers - I have seen him in white ones; I never saw him in a black coat; I have seen him in two blue and one green coat. I, my husband, my servant, and Ann Grissell (in whose apartment I was), were all at home on that night.</p>
               <p>Q. On the oath you have taken did you not send a black<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150042"></xptr>coat to him at the watch-house - A. I did not; I sent his best blue coat, no black coat was sent from my house. The lodgers can go out, but cannot come in without having the door opened to them; he had a blue coat on when he came in - I think he wore such a handkerchief as he has now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he generally board with the family - A. Yes; I had my tea before he came home that evening. He has a top room for a bed-room, and sits in the back or front parlour, which ever I happen to be in. Mr. Abrahams came to my house with my husband on the morning after he was apprehended; nothing of his was taken away but a clean shirt and handkerchief, a pair of clean white trowsers, and his blue coat, from that time to the present. Mr. Abrahams has called at my house once since - but has not been in his room. I sent him a pair of black trowsers. I opened his box with the officers. I was at Marlborough-street, but was not examined.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. If anybody goes out and shuts the door after them, they cannot get in without knocking - A. No. Susan generally attends to the door. Schofield came to my house on the morning after he was taken, and searched; nothing was found belonging to anybody. I think I have seen him in blue striped trowsers some time ago - his habits were very regular.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember one night his having coffee and ham - A. Yes, it was on the 26th of May; I let him in on that night between six and seven o'clock; he went into the front parlour - my mistress saw him there. I took him coffee almost directly, and about half-past eight took him candles into the front parlour: he had some ham for supper about half-past nine - we went to bed a little after ten that night. He was not out of the house after he came in at half-past six; if he had been I should have let him in when he knocked - when he rang the bell I answered it.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Are you the last witness's daughter - A. No, her niece. I know it was on the 26th, because my aunt went to see my mother, after her confinement; she had not been out the day before: it was the first time she went to Westminster after her confinement.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not go out on the day the balloon went up - A. Yes, that was the day he went out - this occurred the day before the balloon went up; my mistress had spent the evening up with Miss Grissell; she is generally down in the kitchen, and has her meals there - she used to have tea with the prisoner, when he came home to tea, but did not on that evening - I do not recollect what trowsers he had on; I have seen him in blue-striped and in black trowsers; I never saw him in a black coat - I took some things to him at the watch-house the day after he was taken - I have lived nearly twelve months with my aunt; we have one lodger besides Miss Grissell, it was Major

               <p>Q. On what day did your mistress go to see her sister, (your mother), after her confinement - A. On the day the balloon went up - Mr. Robinson had the coffee and ham the night after; he never went out after he came in, between six and seven o'clock - the parlours do not communicate; mistress saw him in the front parlour; I was down stairs at the time, and did not see them together; I had not seen him in the back parlour - mistress gave me the money for the ham, she had it from master.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. At what time was the money given to you - A. I went for it a little after nine o'clock; my aunt and uncle were up in Miss Grissell's room; my uncle gave it to his wife, and she handed it to me, it was sixpence; I got the ham from the corner shop, which is about two minutes walk.</p>

He has an entailed estate - he is above want or necessity - he could have had money from me at any time - I made him a ward in Chancery. When this charge was made, I advertised to bring persons together, who might have charges against him. I have taken every pains to discover his innocence or guilt. I have seen several young men in our neighbourhood who might be mistaken for him - I never saw him in drab pantaloons - I have taken pains to find these albums; if he is discharged. I shall take him into my service again. He is allowed 90 l. a year by the Court of Chancery.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. Were you not aware when you advertised that Mr. Denham had advertised - A. I had seen such advertisements - he has not worn a black coat for the last year; he had one at the death of his mother some time ago; I think he has blue trowsers - I have papers in my hand dated the 26th of May, with which he was sent to the office of the Clerk of the Rules, about six o'clock on the 26th - the rule was to be served in Staples-Inn; he did not return to the office that evening. I had given him leave to go home, after serving the rule - he had not asked leave - he generally left about six o'clock - he sometimes wanted to go to Turnham Green to his aunt. He could not obtain the rule before six o'clock or after nine; I know that he did obtain it; the latest time that I saw him was between four and five o'clock I think, I have only two clerks he did not particularly take the out-door business.</p>

I took out my watch, and said, about one o'clock; she took up the watch, and went into a back-room: presently came a soldier and hit me two blows: I went down stairs; there the soldier ill-used me. I asked for my watch; the prisoner ran out at the door, and I after her; she escaped from me two or three times; she got into an alley, I closely pursued her; she called out watch; a watchman came and took her to the watch-house; then I desired the watch might be returned to me; she denied very strongly having it: I went with the constable to the door; the same soldier came and opened it; we went in; the watch could not be found; we took the soldier to the watch-house; then she gave the keys to the watchman, and the watchman went and fetched the watch; (produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether you did not give me the watch upon some consideration?</p>
               <p>Lemonere. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harris. I am constable: on the 6th of October, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house: as far as I could understand, the prosecutor had lost his watch; he was in a great flurry; he said he lived in Hedge-Lane; a watchman went there, and brought this woman that now interprets; he said he could find the house out where he was rob'd; I took the beadle and a watchman; he conducted us into Swan Yard; he ran up some steps, and knocked two or three violent raps at the door; a soldier came and opened the door; the prosecutor said, that was the man that beat<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176410170017"></xptr> him down the steps: I asked him where the woman had been? he said, down stairs; I went and examined below, but could find no watch: in the corner of the parlour there stood a stick, which the prosecutor said was his: I brought the soldier to the watch-house; we talked to her for an hour and a half before she would tell where the watch was; she said she knew nothing of it: I told her, as it was the first night I ever watched, I would discharge her if I could, if she would tell where it was; she said, if I would let her go home, she would tell me where it was: she gave the soldier the key, and said it was in the second or third drawer, where it was found. The Justice discharged the soldier.</p>

               <p>I was very dry and thirsty; I went in at the Globe Tavern to get a gill of wine: as I was tucking my gown up to go home, this gentleman came out after me; he took hold of me, and pull'd me about; I could not get rid of him; I asked him what he wanted with me? he asked me if I would go to cushee? [to bed] I said I did not know what he meant; he insisted on my going to drink with him; I went in at the Star-Inn; he call'd for a pint of porter; I said I could not drink porter; he call'd for some other liquor; I said I never drink any spirituous liquors; then he call'd for some wine for me, and asked if he could have a bed that night? the waiter told him he must pay two shillings for it; he said something else, but I did not understand it. The mistress of the house said, Nancy, I would have you go home: when I got up to go away, he flung down the money for the beer and wine, and followed me; when I got to my own lodging, I said, Sir, you can't stay here all night: he pulled out his watch, and said he had no money: said I, then how could you go to a house and ask for a bed for you and me. if you have no money: he said he would leave his watch for half a guinea till morning; after he had done what he wanted to do, then he wanted his watch, and made a noise for it: my husband hearing him, came and put us both out of the house together: after that he was sociable again.</p>
               <p>Q. to constable. Is the soldier the prisoner's husband?</p>
               <p>Constable. The soldier owned de did live with her, but she was not his wife.</p>

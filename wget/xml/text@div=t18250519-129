I paid for it and went away, leaving my brother with the boy, by the horse, to look after it. I had not given orders where to have it sent. I have a two-stall stable in Ham-yard, Great Windmill-street; I left my brother in care of it while I went to the Greyhound; and as I came back I saw the prisoner riding away with it - I knew his person before by seeing him about the market - I saw him going up Duke-street on it; I had not time to speak to him; he was going quickly; he never brought it back; I have not found it since; I had neither given my brother nor the boy authority to dispose of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Who did you buy it of? A. I know the man by sight but not by name; I bought it in the market, and might have sold it directly, if a good price had been offered, but I had a customer at home who I thought it would suit.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry Stop thief? A. I did not know but my brother had sold it, thinking if he had got a good profit he might have let it go; most of the people had left the market; it was dusk - the light of the gas glanced on him; I could see him as plain as I can see your face; I had seen the horse for two hours before, but did not buy it till near eight o'clock; it was a light dapple grey horse, six years old, (reckoning to May,) about 15 hands and an inch high, had a cut tail, not very long, and had not been bishoped; it was about a half-bred horse, and in good condition; it had been fired; it had rather a violent cold, and I did not know whether it would get better or worse; I have seen the man I bought it of since; I did not perceive that it was lame; I should call it a lightish grey; I did not see the prisoner again till he was at Bow-street - I never dealt with him; I might be thirty or forty yards from the horse.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother. I saw him buy this horse about eight o'clock, or a little after - he paid for it and went away, telling me to wait with it till he came back; it was dusk; I cannot say where he went; I gave the horse into the hands of a boy to hold by the halter when my brother was gone; it had no bridle or saddle. I knew the prisoner before by sight; about half-past eight he came round to me and looked at the horse, and asked me if it was for sale; I said I did not know, for I was waiting for my brother to come back; he asked me to let him see the horse go; I rode it up and down two or three times; he said that would do, and asked me to go and take a drop of gin with him; I declined at first, saying I could not leave the place as my brother might return and miss me; I afterwards agreed to go and take a drop of porter with him, at the first public-house in Long-lane; I gave the horse into the boy's hands to mind, and then went with the prisoner; I stood with the public-house door in my hand, to look after the horse while I drank; as it was a strange horse I thought it might get from the boy - after drinking with him he paid; he then asked if I had any objection to his riding the horse; I said "You have seen me ride him up and down, and therefore you cannot want any more;" he asked if I was afraid he should eat it, or ride away with it, and as soon as I turned from the door for a necessary purpose, he whipped the horse out of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190046"></xptr>the boy's hand, mounted and rode him off, and turned down Duke-street, towards Little Britain; I waited there for two hours, expecting he would bring it back, but have not seen it since; it was a grey gelding; I saw my brother pay 7 l. for it. I saw him at Bow-street two or three weeks after, and am sure of him; I knew him when he worked with Mr. Hall, of Gravel-lane, and cannot be mistaken in his person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him by name? A. Yes; I do not recollect ever speaking to him before. I could see the horse for fifty yards; I dare say it was half-past eight; I had seen him many times before; I thought he might give me the gin for my trouble in riding the horse to shew him; he did not ask the price of it, nor was any mentioned, as I had no order to sell it. It is two years since I knew him in Gravel-lane; he worked at Hall's stables. It was a light dapple grey horse, about fifteen hands high, and a short cut tail: it was not bishoped, nor its ears cut, and was six years old this month; I had it in my care about half an hour; it was a quiet horse, but I thought it might get his halter out of the boy's hand. I have not asked the prisoner for any money, nor did my brother ever tell me that he had; I know nothing about that; I believe they have offered something. I live at No. 20, Coal-yard, Drury-lane, and job at times.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner; I met him on Tuesday night, the 3d of May, about half-past nine o'clock, in company with another man, in Church-street, Brick-lane; I said nothing to him about this horse, not knowing any thing of it.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW to WILLIAM ROWLAND. Q. Where is the boy? A. He is not here; when I came back he was gone, and my brother was gone - he was a strange boy - I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you tried to get a little money about this? A. No, Sir - I certainly should have liked to have had my horse or the money - I never asked for any money - I have been asked by his relations to take money - I never offered to settle it for money - I do not know Elliot by name - I may know his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never offered, in his presence, to take money? A. Of course I would have taken the money, but I should have gone on with the prosecution - they offered me 7 l., which I said I would take for the horse; they proposed it, not me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not, in the presence of Elliott, Crane, or Rogers, proposed to take 7 l. for the horse? A. I should certainly have liked to have had the money, but they proposed it to me; I said I would take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, "How much will you give," or words to that effect? A. No. I said "If I take the money I shall expect 7 l. for the horse."</p>
               <p>CHARLES ROWLAND re-examined. Q. Did you take any steps to find the boy? A. Yes; he was gone in a moment: I gave him the penny as soon as I missed the horse, and then went after it, and the boy went - I did not ask his name or address - I could not find him out. I ran round the corner to look after the horse. I waited two hours for the prisoner; he never returned.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you make any offer to him at Bow-street? A. I did not; he made the proposal to me. I heard nobody offer to settle it with him at Bow-street, or at any other place.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Has he made this offer to any body else? Yes; they were in my company at a public-house over the way; he made the offer twice or three times in my presence and others, and said he was ashamed to bring the thing into Court.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say he made the offer at Bow-street, was that before your nephew was committed, or after? A. Before; I had not the presence of mind to tell the Magistrate of it. I thought my nephew was innocent.</p>

            . I live in the City-road. The prosecutor offered in my presence to give up this prosecution for money, yesterday, and this evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? A. I was asked by the prisoner's father to come to speak to the prosecutor, that he might lean to mercy.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor know you before? A. No. He said to me directly I was introduced to him, that he had no inclination to prosecute, and if I would agree to give him 5 l. he would not appear.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who introduced you? A. I do not know his name, but he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the person say who introduced you? A. He wished me to speak to him not to interfere any further than he could help - he said it was not his inclination, for the horse was of very little value. I was in Court when the prisoner's uncle was examined. The man who introduced me has just left the Court.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you to do with it? A. Nothing further than the father said he was distressed at his son's being in trouble, and would I speak to the prosecutor to lean to mercy - as he was in the habit of bringing goods to my shop, I said I would. I first asked Rowland if he had any case against the prisoner; he said, "Yes, I have, but my intention is not to go against him if I can settle matters with any one who will come forward and advance 5 l."</p>
               <p>Q. Now, before he said that, on your oath, had you not asked him if he would take money? A. No; I said it was a pity he had not some friends to come forward and advance it, but I had not the money about me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask whether he had really lost a horse? A. Yes; he said he had - that he only wanted the money for it, and did not intend to do any thing further if he could get the money. I do not know the attorney in this case. I live at No. 29, Anderson's-buildings, City-road, and keep the house.</p>

               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You went to him at the father's desire, and the prosecutor proposed, himself, to take the money? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BROOKS re-examined. I am a horse-dealer, and live in Ropemaker-street, Little Moorfields, on the first floor.</p>


               <p>MR. LAW. Q. It was at Bow-street that the prosecutor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190047"></xptr>himself proposed to give this up for money? A. Yes; he said,</p>
               <p>"I will take your note if you will promise to pay me 7 l."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He did not know you before? A. No; I suppose I might be pointed out to him - he came up to me.</p>

            . I am a stable-man, and lodge at No. 5, Chapel-street, Grub-street, Cripplegate. I worked for Mr. Rhodes, in the Borough, last, but am out of place now. I know the prisoner's father - he did not apply to me to interfere in this business, but I was standing outside the gate this afternoon, and the prosecutor agreed to take 7 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer that? A. It was offered to him by Mr. Cutts (See page 369,) and he offered to take it if the money was put into a persons hands who he could depend upon, and the man is outside who was to have it put into his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it refused? A. It was refused in one respect, because none was given.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prosecutor propose to take it? A. He agreed to it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you here? A. I came merely to hear how the case went on; I was here last night, and they were arguing about it then, at a public-house over the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were? A. Rowland and his brother - Elliott and William Brooks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you first hear Elliott and Brooks propose to him to make it up, or did he offer it to them? A. Elliott made the offer to give him 5 l. last night.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Before Elliott offered 5 l. had Rowland said any thing about 7 l.? A. No; he said he wished to have the whole of the money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was that before or after Elliott offered 5 l.? A. After-7 l. was mentioned as the whole, and today it was agreed that he should take 7 l. The offer to day was made by Cutts; he was at the public-house last night, but I do not think he was there when the offer was made; he was in the same box.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought you here? A. I was asked to come and state what I had heard; I know the prisoner's father very well, and was asked since five o'clock to come and state what I had heard. I came here to hear the trials, and happened to go to the public-house, as I knew the prisoner.</p>

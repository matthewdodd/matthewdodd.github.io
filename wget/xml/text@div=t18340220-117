            . I am a patten-maker, and live at No. 1, East-street, Globe-fields - I went to dinner on Friday - the prisoner and two others were together - they said they had a truck to sell - I asked the prisoner what sort of a one it was - he said a spring-truck, and wanted 2l. 10s. for it - I said master wanted to buy one, and he had better bring it down about nine o'clock on Saturday morning, or after twelve o'clock - this was between one and two o'clock - he came again about seven o'clock that night and brought the truck; he said his brother had sold the spring truck - but he had brought this one, which was as good as the other, but had no spring - I said he had better come at nine o'clock in the morning - he asked me to let him leave it at our place - I said I could not - but he left it, and came again next morning - he offered the truck to both me and master, but the policeman was with Mr. Jones when he came to bargain for it, and he was taken.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. How many people were with the prisoner the first time? A. Three - the prisoner and another spoke to me - the prisoner offered the first truck for sale - he was sober then, but not when he came at night - he was not particularly drunk; he was in liquor - he brought the truck in question with him - it was not sold at all.</p>

            . I am a policeman - I apprehended the prisoner in the warehouse of Mr. Jones, Old Montague-street, Whitechapel, nearly two miles from the prosecutor's - I had been sent for - I was concealed in another room, when the prisoner came in, and Jones asked him whose truck it was he had then for sale - he said it was his own property - he asked him the price of it - he said, 1l. 15s. - Jones then brought him into the room I was in - he repeated that it was his own property - I said, "I doubt you did not come honestly by it" - he said it was his own - I asked of whom he bought it, and where - he said, of a man in the City-road - I asked him what name - he said he did not know the name - I asked what he gave - he said, 1l. 2s. - I said I was confident it was stolen, and took him into custody to the station-house - he overheard me mention to our Inspector that I knew from whom the truck came; as I had received information - I was in the act of booking the charge, and he said, "I was not aware who you were; but I will tell you the whole truth" - I said, "Do not make any admission before me, because, anything you state now, I shall be bound to give in evidence against you" - he said he was drunk, and intended to make good the money to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HODGES re-examined. I have seen the truck - it is the one I lost, and worth 1l. 10s. - I have known the prisoner ten years - he lived in Spitalifields, I believe - he is a chair stuffer.</p>

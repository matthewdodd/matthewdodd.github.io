               <p>+ This was made a capital offence by an act made in the 9th year of King George the First.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grigson deposed, that he had part of a stack of hay burnt, and that he suspected the Prisoner, because he had been informed he said he would do for him. That he is a farmer in the same neighbourhood, and there had been some law suits between them, and that he is forced to carry arms to defend himself from the Prisoner, because he would lye lurking about the fields with pistols to do him a mischief.</p>
               <p>Several persons were produced by Mr. Grigson, who saw the hay on fire, but could not prove any thing against the Prisoner, not even so much as seeing him near the place under any suspicious circumstances or unreasonable hours: they could only say, that there had been differences between them, and that the Prisoner had threatened to do for Mr. Grigson. <rs id="t17450530-29-verdict182" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and follow the business of a watchmaker, at No. 29, Paradise-row, Chelsea. On Friday afternoon, the 9th of February, about three minutes after three o'clock, I was sitting in my parlour, adjoining the shop, and heard a noise in the shop—I thought at first it was a cat—it was like a cat in the window—I went out and looked but could see nothing—the window appeared quite safe—I returned into the parlour again, and at twenty minutes after three o'clock I went into the shop, and noticed the watches on the right-hand side were moved, and a sil<lb></lb>ver watch-case was taken away out of the window—the pane of glass had been cot some years ago, and puttied across; but I found a small square piece, about two inches and a half square, cut out of it, so that a hand could have been put in to take the watch-case—I have not Been it since—it if worth about 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

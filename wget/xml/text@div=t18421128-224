                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer, on board the <hi rend="italic">Jupiter</hi> steam-boat. On the 24th of Sept I gave the prisoner six wooden bowls, to take on shore to the Cock and Lion, and leave them there for me—I went the same evening, and saw them there—I went to look for them on the Tuesday morning, and they were gone—I then went and found the prisoner at the Black Boy, the next public-house—I asked where the bowls were—he said he had them—I said I would have them directly, as I was going to Bristol the same day—I hurried him to let me have them—he said I should have them if I waited till he had had his breakfast, which I did—I then said, "<hi rend="italic">Ben,</hi> if you have sold them, or got rid of them, tell me, and I will release them"—he said he had sold them for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but he would not tell me who had them—I went to Bristol that day—I did not see any more of him till the day before yester<lb></lb>day—I have never seen my bowls.</p>

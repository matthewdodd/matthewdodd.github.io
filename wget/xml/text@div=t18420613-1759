                  </hi>. I live at Stanhope-cottage, Park-village East, Re<lb></lb>gent's-park. On the night of the 20th of May, between nine and ten o'clock, I was in the Lower-road, Islington, with two Mends—one of them poke to two young women—I went on some little distance, and finding he did not follow me, I returned and interfered with my friend—the prisoner and two others passed while I was speaking to my friend—the prisoner knocked one of the female's bonnets over her face, and pushed against her and my friend—I asked him what he meant by that behaviour</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184206130046"></xptr>
               <p>—I cannot say whether he made any reply, but he sparred up to me, and I believe I struck him—I am not certain whether he struck me first, or I him, but I would rather give him the benefit of it, and say that I struck him first—we had a fight, and exchanged a good many blows—the en<lb></lb>counter took some time, at least many minutes—at first I had the best of it, but eventually my arms were pinned behind me by somebody—I was severely used behind, and likewise by the prisoner before me—a good many pressed round me—by the time I speak of a crowd had collected—finding that I got the worst of it, I ran a short distance, and got in at the doorway of a baker's shop—the prisoner followed me, and the mob behind him—eventually a policeman came up—I gave the prisoner in charge, and he gave me in charge—we were both taken to the station, and I there missed my pin and the front of my stock—it was two pins, a diamond and a ruby, with a chain attached—it was in the front of my stock, which was detached from the part that goes round my neck—the prisoner was searched—one pin and the front of the stock were found in his hat, and the other pin in his hand or his waistcoat-pocket, I am not certain which. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by.</hi>

Between nine and ten o'clock, on the night of the 20th of May, I found a crowd of people in Queen-street, Lower-road, Islington—the prosecutor was standing with his back against a baker's shop-door, and the prisoner was standing in the front of him, in a fighting attitude—the prosecutor called for my assistance—I im<lb></lb>mediately went, and he complained of being assaulted—the prisoner, at the same time, complained of being assaulted—through the crowd of people that had assembled I was not able to settle it, and took them both to the station—they both went willingly—the persons were hooting and hissing the prosecutor—he had no hat at the time I first met him—I did not no<lb></lb>tice his stock—at the station the prosecutor said, "I am the sufferer, I have lost the front of my stock, with two pins and a chain attached"—I was then ordered by the inspector to search the prisoner—I first took his hat off—he had it on, and in it I found this front of the stock, one pin, and a small chain attached—while I was placing it on the table, be put his hand into his left-hand waistcoat pocket and took out the diamond put his which I immediately took from his hand—he said, "I am sure, I don't know how I came by them."</p>

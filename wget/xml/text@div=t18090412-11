               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in the shop - A. I am not certain of it, I was in the shop. On the 1st of April, between six and seven in the evening, I came to the door; we have got a large window inside of the shop, it has got a quantity of lace hanging upon it; on my coming there the prisoner saw me; she ran away;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120009"></xptr>there was a number of women standing there. On her running away. I looked at the lace, I saw there was a deficiency of one piece of lace; I pursued the prisoner and caught her at the corner of the market; I found the lace in her apron; she said some person had given it her, or she had picked it up in the street, I do not know which; I am sure I had not sold the lace. I had seen it hanging on the window an hour before; there were others serving in the shop, but none near the lace; I was serving the lace.</p>
               <p>Q. Can any body standing in the street, take this lace off the windows - A. Yes, they could if they were to put their hand forward.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Please you, my lord, if it was the last minute I had to speak or breathe, I never entered the shop to buy, sell, or thieve; I happened to be going along the street on the other side of the way, I saw great number of people standing at his door, I suppose forty; I went over to see what it was; he had a great quantity of laces hanging out to attract poor distressed people, as he always has; you may know by the colour of the lace that it was never taken out of the shop, it was on the ground; a woman took it up, she said it was hers by her picking it up; she was going to lay it down; one of the women said do not lay it down again; she gave it me. I was very much distressed indeed; I thought he would never be the worse for it; I was out of work and very much afflicted with sickness - and as I stand here he has sworn false as God is true, what he has spoke against me.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Blanch ?</p>

               <p>Q. What day of the month was it?</p>
               <p>S. East. I can't say I remember the day of the month; it was after the fire at my master's house.</p>

               <p>S. East. That was on the 20th of Feb.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know it by to be after the fire?</p>
               <p>S. East. Because I know it was about 2 days after my master had received his money of the insurers.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the answer your master made to Mr. Blanch?</p>
               <p>S. East. He said he would pay him on the morrow at 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what day of the week they had this discourse ?</p>
               <p>S. East. I believe it was on a Friday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did your master live at that time?</p>
               <p>S. East. He lived in St. Martin's Street, at the house of Mr. Wychart: he went there from Mr. Davis's, his father-in-law.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live then?</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mr. Blanch come on the morrow?</p>
               <p>S. East. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Thompson see him?</p>
               <p>S. East. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your master?</p>
               <p>S. East. I don't know where he was: I heard he went out a little after 7 in the morning; but I was then, I believe, asleep in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue there after this?</p>
               <p>S. East. I only continued there 'till the Monday following; master did not return.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember going along with Mr. Lowden to the prisoner since he was in Newgate ?</p>
               <p>S. East. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>A list of creditors and their several debts produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this list?</p>

               <p>Q. to Mrs. Wychart. Look upon this notice.</p>
               <p>She takes it in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Wychart. I remember a copy of this notice being put upon the dining-room door. I had twice notice of it before it came.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that delivered to you?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wychart. I can't tell the time, but it was deliver'd to me by this gentleman (pointing to Mr. Cheshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon the date of it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wychart. It is dated the 24th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Cheshire. Look and see which were the days appointed for the commissioners meeting.</p>
               <p>Cheshire. The Days were the 2d and 9th of May, and the 10th of June following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the commissioners meet at Guildhall on all these days?</p>
               <p>Cheshire. They did; I was present at the meetings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Thompson surrender himself upon either of these days?</p>
               <p>Cheshire. No, he did not; and the commissioners said till past 12 o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any excuse sent by him for his not appearing?</p>
               <p>Cheshire. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Goostree. Had you any notice sent to you for enlarging the time?</p>
               <p>Mr. Goostree. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cheshire. Had you any petition for longer time?</p>
               <p>Cheshire. If there had been any I should have noticed it, and inserted it in the Gazette.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was taken into custody and knew nothing of the statute of bankrupt being taken out against me; what effects I had I surrender'd up. I have been in the north of Scotland and had no knowledge of this notice. I have had nothing to subsist on, either victuals or drink. I was put into New-prison this day is a month, and there were strict orders given that I should not see or speak to any body while I was there. I had not liberty to set pen to paper.</p>

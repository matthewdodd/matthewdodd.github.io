                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and lodge at No. 2, Neptune Street, Wapping. On Thursday night, 12th March, I met the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185704060061"></xptr>
               <p>M'Donald at a little before 10 o'clock, at the corner of Neptune Street, in Ratcliffe Highwayh—he asked me to take a drop of ale, and we went into the Neptune public house, and had a drop of ale—I did not see any woman with him when I went with him, I had seen her before I saw him—she was not in the public house when I went in, nor was Elsworthy—nothing took place in the public house; I came out and left M'Donald there—when I got out, M'Donald walked up behind me, and struck me with his fist in the neck—Elsworthy came up at that time, and I asked him what was the matter with M'Donald—he said he had been drinking—Elsworthy did not do anything to me at that time—I left him, and M'Donald followed and struck me again in the street—the second time he struck me in the month—Elsworthy and M'Donald both ran after me—I ran away—there were three of them at that time—they did not overtake me—I ran round, and went to my lodging at No. 2, Neptune Street—about a minute after I had reached my lodging, the prisoners came in—I was in the parlour, in the first room—M'Donald raised his hand up, and in his hand I saw a knife; I saw it glitter—I said to him, "Bob, don't cut me, if you please"—he ran at me, made a lunge, and stabbed me just above the left groin—he struck me, and cut me, and left the knife in me—I laid hold of him and threw him, and the knife dropped on the ground—I threw him into the fire place, and as we were both down together, Elsworthy catched the tongs, and aimed to strike me, but I <hi rend="italic">dodged</hi>, and the blow fell on M'Donald—I had not done anything to either of the prisoners before I was stabbed—I cried out for some one to take the knife—there was a man there who had charge of the house, I do not know his name—I cried out to take the knife; that I was stabbed—he did not take it, it lay on the hearth—after it fell from me, I jumped up and caught Elsworthy; he got to the hall—I struck him, and we both fell into the street—I do not know what had become of M'Donald, for the gas was out—I cannot tell who blew it out—there was a gas light in the room when M'Donald struck me—while we were in the street, the police<lb></lb>men ran up and took charge—I pointed M'Donald out to one of the officers as the person who stabbed me—I was taken to the station, and examined by the surgeon.</p>

I saw the prisoners about 10 o'clock that evening, in the Highway, near to the Cock and Neptune public house—there was another one with them; they were quarrelling with the prose<lb></lb>cutor—I went and got them all away, and in five or ten minutes I saw the prosecutor run up a bye street, and the policemen ware after him, and M'Donald said, "Come on, let us go to the Cock, we shall meet the b—there, and we will have his b—heart out."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a broker's man; I was in possession of the house No. 2, Neptune Street. On the evening of 12th March, between 10 and 11 o'clock, the prosecutor came in, and he took my hat in<lb></lb>stead of his own, and directly afterwards the two prisoners came in—I did not see that M'Donald had anything in his hand, but he took hold of Brown and threw him on the hearth, and Brown called out, "I am stabbed! I am stabbed!"—when they were on the fender, Elsworthy came in and took the tongs, and went to strike Brown, and in the room of hitting him he struck M'Donald—they got up sparring together; the gas light all came down, and four chairs were broken—they all went out of the door together—I called out, "Police!" and gave Elsworthy in charge, with the tongs in his hand, in the street—the constable searched M'Donald for a knife; he could not find it—I went in doors and found a knife on the hearth; I took it to the station, open, and gave it to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in High Street, Whitechapel. On the evening of 12th March, I went to the station, in Leman Street, and examined Brown—there was a wound of three inches long, and one inch in depth, on the upper portion of his groin, dividing the muscles—it was a deep incised wound, and it was bleeding—I have been attending him since—he is not quite recovered, he is partially paralyzed in a portion of his leg—this knife decidedly is such an instrument as would have inflicted such a wound—if it had gone straight in, it would very likely have been fatal.</p>

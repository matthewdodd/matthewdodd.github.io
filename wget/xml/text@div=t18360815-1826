                  </hi>. I live at Chapel-street, Mayfair.

I was on duty in Oxford-street—Kimber gave the prisoner into my charge—she had a basket on the ground—I took two shillings in bad money from it—I kept them in my possession, and have them now—the prosecutrix said she gave her in charge for giving her a bad half-crown for a good one—I told the prisoner to give her back the good one—she said she had not another half-crown about her—she pulled some shillings out of her pocket and showed me—before I took the two shillings I observed her throw something in the basket, and then I took the two shillings—they were not hid—I took her to the station-house,</p>

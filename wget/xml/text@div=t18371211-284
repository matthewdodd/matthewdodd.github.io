                  </hi>. I lodge at No. 18, St. Ann's-court, in the one pair back room, and am a tailor. I was in the Ship public-house, in Wardour street—my wife and a Woman came for me—I went home after that, and was in bed by half-past-nine o'clock—I had a tea-caddy in my room, and this money in it—I was awoke by the door opening, and said, "Who is there?"—no one answered—I got out of bed and saw the shadow of a woman—she stooped down to my table and took the caddy, which struck against the jug and basin—it was die prisoner, she had no business in my room, and she had got the tea-caddy off the table—when she was brought back the policeman had it in his hand.</p>

On the 22d of September, I was in Dean-street, Hampstead-road, late in the evening. I met the prisoner in Tottenham-court-road, and went with her to a house. I had four half crowns and six shillings in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220020"></xptr>pocket. I staid with her about ten minutes, she went away first - I followed her, and directly I got into the street, felt in my pocket, and missed my money. I had given her 2 s. I went to a watchman, who found her in a passage in the street, in about five minutes, and found three half crowns and a shilling on her. She said next morning, that it was mine, and wanted me to take it, and let her go. I was quite sober.</p>

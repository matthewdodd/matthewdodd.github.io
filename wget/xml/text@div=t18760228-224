On the 27th October, rather late in the day, the prisoners and a third person were present—Miller told me to fetch up five rolls of floorcloth, irrespective of pattern, from downstairs for Mr. Starkey; he is an old customer—I was assisted by Mr. Miller in getting them up—Miller told me to fetch a porter and I fetched Jones—he put three of the rolls on his barrow, I think, with the assistance of some one outside—Miller and Colville saw this—Miller then sent me on an errand, but I stood at the corner of Watling Street so that I could see, and the goods were taken across Cannon Street, which is not in the direction of Starkey's—when I returned the porter was there waiting to be paid for. his job—the next morning I saw the third person who was in the shop the day before at the door—afterwards Miller came and asked me if I had seen him, mentioning his name—I answered "Yes," he had gone to Lombard Street to Martin's Bank—Miller said something about"30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the beggar yesterday, he is trying to do me," and that he would go after him—he did go and when he returned I asked him if he had seen him—he said "Yes, I caught him at the bank and put my hand over his shoulder and took some of the money that had been paid him"—I have since seen the five rolls of floorcloth at Dowgate <hi rend="italic">Wharf Cross-examined by</hi>

(<hi rend="italic">It was handed in and read: it referred to certain lengths and patterns of cloth, on October 27th, Francis Crossley.</hi>) The intima<lb></lb>tion given is that Francis Crossley would be responsible for those goods, but not necessarily so.

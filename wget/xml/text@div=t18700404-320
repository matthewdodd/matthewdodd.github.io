                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alfred Hollamby, a bricklayer, of 18, Wargrave Road, Earl's Court, Kensington—about 4.30 on the afternoon of 28th December I was in Wright's Lane, Kensington—I had 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my hand, and four oranges and six eggs in a paper bag in my arm—the prisoner came up to me and asked what I had got—I said that had nothing to do with him—he went to take my money, and I struggled—with that he up with his fist and struck me across the face and gave me two black eyes, and my nose bled a little for two or three days afterwards—he took my money and went away—I don't know what became of him—I went and gave information to the police—I gave a description of the man—I had not been drinking—when he struck me I became unconscious from the blow, and they tried to persuade me I had been drinking—I saw the prisoner in custody at the station-house—about five weeks ago he was placed with others—I picked him out directly; he has a cast in his right eye—I am tore he is the man.</p>

I live at 17, Blythfield Street, Ken<lb></lb>rington—on the evening of 28th December I saw the prosecutrix in Wright's Lane—I saw the prisoner come out by the workhouse; he took the woman down the lane, and took the money away from her, and struck her on the eye; he also took from her four oranges and some eggs—I was about ten yards away from him—I saw some silver in his hand—she tried to prevent his taking it—he afterwards went into the Devonshire Arms along with a woman, and gave her some beer, and he was eating the oranges—he then came out again, walked a little way, and then began to run—I and the woman he gave the beer to went after him; we could not catch him—the prosecutrix was quite sober—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

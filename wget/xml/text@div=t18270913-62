Bank note, a gold brooch, set with garnets, worth 10s. or 20s. - I lost ten or twelve sheets - I am single, the prisoner has attended me as servant for three or four months - I did not hire him; he had access to my linen - I had seen the snuff-box in a small box in one of my drawers, some weeks before; the box was locked, and in my bed-room drawer, which was not locked; the prisoner absconded about the 23d of June, and I then missed the things; he had to attend on the family of the house, as well as me; he left the house suddenly.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at No. 43, Drury-lane. In the beginning of July I bought of the prisoner, a gold snuff-box, which I have returned to Dr. Clendinning - I gave him 8l. 12s. for it; there was an advertizement afterwards, and I went to Bow-street about it - I also bought of him some sheets and shirts, for 6l. 19s., and some table-cloths; he was very genteely dressed, and represented himself as having come to London for pleasure, and having been rather too extravagant, was obliged to dispose of his property to go home to his friends in the country; he did not name what part - I produced the property at Bow-street, and detained a few articles, in order to produce, if the prisoner was taken; he came again, about a month after the first transaction, and offered to sell me a brooch - I secured him immediately - I have kept a shirt and gold pencil-case, which he sold me.</p>

I then passed again to the wharf and returned in about three minutes afterwards; and I observed the tail board of the cart being up. I looked in and saw two sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any of the prisoners before you saw the cart. - A. No, I observed M'Quyenny, Nichols, and Groute, at the stable door.

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners. - A. The whole of them. On Tuesday the 29th of March, in consequence of a search warrant, I went to Ingram Wood's stable situated on Frier's hill, Great Hermitage street, accompanied with Gillmer the officer; and Ingram Wood was with us. He gave the officer the key of the stable, and Gillmer opened the door. There I saw a sack and part of another standing on the ground, direct in front of the door from the appearance of these sacks I had no doubt they were the sacks that were taken from the wharf. I asked Ingram Wood if they were the sacks he brought away the night before from the stable, on the wharf in the hearing of the officer; he said they were, and in the same state they then stood. I looked into each sack, one of which contained oats, and the other a mixture of beans; on taking a handful of the beans, I knew them to be the property of Mr. Hoare.</p>

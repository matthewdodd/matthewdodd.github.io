                  </hi> I am a widow, and live at 19, Albion-street, Hyde-park—on 28th June, I was passing that house, and saw a bill up, "House to let"—I went in—I did not see the prisoner there; I saw his mother, and she referred me to his stables—I went there and saw him, and communicated with him as to his selling the house, and my taking it furnished—he said he had had a good deal of trouble with it, and wished to sell it—I did not ask him the price then—I did subsequently, and it was arranged—I think I saw him the second time, a few days after the first—he asked 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the house and furniture; I offered him 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he took it—there was an agreement in writing, this is it—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">d July,</hi> 1859, <hi rend="italic">by which the prisoner agreed to sell, and the prosecutrix to purchase, all the furniture and effects in the house for</hi> 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">payable in two sums of</hi> 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">in considera<lb></lb>tion of which the prisoner undertook to execute a proper assignment of his interest in the said house, viz., a term of one year and nine months</hi>)—I had no profes<lb></lb>sional person to draw up the agreement; it was done by a friend, Mr. Johnson—I attended at the prisoner's house on the 2d July, with Mr. Johnson—on that occasion the agreement was drawn up, and I then paid 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in part payment, to the defendant—previously to this, Mr. Johnson, in the presence of my brother and several persons, asked the defendant if there was any judgment or bill of sale, or anything to affect the property; and he</p>

               <p>said, "Certainly not; do you think that I could do such an ungentlemanly action?"—I do not think it was said to him more than once, but it was very distinctly and very pointedly asked him; for the gentleman said, "Remember, we have not searched, and we take your word;" he said, "You may rely upon it," and I did—when I paid him the money, he said, "As my neighbours are very disagreeable people, it would be as well that you should not mention to them that you have bought the house, but only say that you have rented it of me for 12 months"—I did not say that I would say so, or that I would not say so, I at once confessed it—I should not have parted with my money if I had known there had been any bills of sale on the property—(<hi rend="italic">Two bills of sale were here put in; one of the</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">d February,</hi> 1857, <hi rend="italic">of the furni<lb></lb>ture by the prisoner to Jacob Bell, as security for the repayment of</hi> 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">and another of the</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th September,</hi> 1858, <hi rend="italic">to William Bayne, for</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BEST</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">contended that as the prisoner had been distinctly asked whether the property was subject to any bill of sale, and had distinctly denied it, and as the money was paid on that assurance, it was, in fact, obtained by a false pretence; and, therefore, he urged that there was evidence to go to the Jury.</hi>

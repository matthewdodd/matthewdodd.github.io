On the 17th of March, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I went out with my sister - I locked the door, and left the windows quite fast, leaving nobody in the house; my husband was gone to work - I and my sister-in-law went to the Anchor, about a quarter of a mile from our house, to see her off to Uxbridge - while waiting there, a man, who I did not know, brought in the body of a silk dress, which I knew to be mine - he said he had met two men with large bundles, and had picked that up; I immediately went home, and found a pane of glass taken out of my kitchen window, on the ground floor - the window had been opened, and closed again; the door was still locked - I unlocked it, went in, and missed these articles; the bacon was a small bit, which had been cut off a flitch.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hamptonwick, which is eight or nine miles from the prosecutor's, On the 18th of March I apprehended the prisoner at Hampton-wick, at work as a carpenter at a gentleman's -I searched his house with Newman, and found a small bit of bacon; we also searched the house of a man, named Cramp, a very little distance from the prisoner's house, and found some dresses in his box - we did not apprehend him - I searched for him afterwards, but he has absconded; I do not know whether he was acquainted with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you have been ever since endeavouring to find Cramp? A. I have.</p>

            . This appears to be part of the bacon I lost; it fits exactly with what was left behind - in our absence my brother had cut off a small rasher, but some part corresponds now; here is a piece I have brought from home, which corresponds with it - the dresses and things found at Cramp's are ours.</p>

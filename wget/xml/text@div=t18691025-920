                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman X</hi> 240). I was on duty about 4.30, near to Chilworth Street, Paddington, on the 18th September, when I was called into the Railway Tavern—the prisoner was leaning against a partition in front of the bar—the potman requested me to remove him—I asked him to go quietly, as they had refused to serve him with more drink—I told him the best thing would be for him to go home—he was drunk—he used foul language, and said he would not go out of the tavern for anybody—with a little force, and by the aid of the potman, I got him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186910250044"></xptr>
               <p>outside—he then went a distance of about 6ft. from the front of the house and commenced shouting—I asked him again to go away quietly but he continued making a noise and caused a disturbance—I told him if he did not desist I should be obliged to take him into custody—he then turned round and made a rush at me with some instrument in his hand, and which he had withdrawn from his sleeve—he said that if I dared to touch him he would kill me, or anyone who went near him—he attempted to strike me, bat as his hand was coming down I caught hold of his wrist, and so avoided the blow—we both fell on the ground, when he tried to wrench the instrument into my ear—I still held him by the wrist, and by degrees and with great difficulty I got it from him—he then kicked me severely on the thigh, from the effects of which I am now suffering, and also struck me in the chest with his fists—we had four or five ups and downs in the road—he said he waft an Irishman, and a Fenian, and dared any Englishman to go near him or touch him—with assistance, but with great difficulty, I took the prisoner to the police-station—I am still under the surgeon's hands, and have not been on duty since—I am suffering inwardly—I spat blood about four hours and a half after it happened, and the next day as well—I had never spat blood before that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been in the police force? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two years—he tried to strike me with the instrument when on the ground—after I caught hold of his wrist we both fell and struggled together—I threw him several times, and I fell heavily by the side of the kerb-stone—I took him out of the bar with very little force indeed—I pushed him out backwards—I cannot say whether I saw James Whiteman there—he was before the Magistrate—I did not see him, as far as I know, near to the tavern—I had enough to notice the prisoner—the prisoner had the instrument in his hand when in the public-house—we got behind him, when we found he would not go, and eased him out—I can't say whether the potman said before the Magistrate that we carried him out—he remained quiet for some time when outside—a great many people advised him to go home—he did not say "I am an Englishman, and shall go home when I like"—he talked about being a Fenian when he rushed at me with the instrument—he was halloaing, and I thought I was justified in taking him into custody—I told him as many as a half-dozen times to go home quietly—he did not say anything about being a Fenian when we were on the ground—he made a stab at my chest—I was on the top of him when we fell—I took the instrument from him whilst we were struggling on the ground—I thought I should be killed if I did not get it from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farrier, living at 6, Eastbourne Mews—I was at the Railway Tavern on the afternoon of Saturday, the 18th September, and saw the prisoner outside, after he had been put out by the policeman—the latter tried to persuade him to go away quietly—the prisoner was shouting and swearing, and saying he was a Fenian, and would stab any—Englishman who came near him—I saw that he had a carpenter's plough-iron in his hand at the time—part of the iron was up his sleeve; then he held it like a dagger, and tried to stab the policeman with it, but the officer seized his hand and prevented him from doing so—the instru<lb></lb>ment was not more than four inches from the officer's chest when he seized his wrist—I did not see him assault any other person but the constable—the blow was given with violence.</p>

               <p>who came near him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes. I believe I said so before the, Magistrate—I have had no conversation with the policeman since that time—I saw a person named Whiteman at the tavern—I did not hear the prisoner say that he was an Englishman, and should go when be liked—the word "Englishman" was not mentioned at all—I think the constable threw the man down once—there was a great deal of scuffling—the policeman was uppermost twice—on one occasion he fell on the kerb<lb></lb>stone.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Gloucester Mews, Eastbourne Terrace—I was at the Railway Tavern on the Saturday afternoon in question—I saw the prisoner there—he did not attempt to stab anybody-my attention was not drawn to anything till I heard a struggle outside—I then saw the policeman and the prisoner on the ground together—the prisoner had an instrument in his hand, which the, constable took from him—he had the same instrument when in the bar—the constable took it from him as he knelt upon him—there was, no bad language that I heard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he singing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was, but not annoying anybody—it is not true that the policeman and the potman carried him out—the policeman carried him out alone—there was no violence used by the prisoner—the policeman caught hold of him and carried him out back<lb></lb>wards—he had the instrument in his hand at the time, and could have used it freely whilst being carried out—he had every chance of doing so—I heard the policeman, when they were outside the house, persuade toe man to go home—the prisoner, in reply, said, "I am an Englishman, and will go when I like"—the policeman walked away from him about ten or twelve yards—the first I saw of the struggle outside was the policeman trying to wrench the instrument out of the man's hand, as he lay on the top of him—I saw them get up, when the policeman tripped the prisoner and fell on him again—I did not see the prisoner attempt to strike the policeman as they were on the ground—I was trying to unbuckle the policeman's cape, and must have seen it if such was the case.</p>

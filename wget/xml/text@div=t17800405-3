            's, and charged him with having stopped one of them in the Park, and robbed him. I was ordered to search him, and in his left-hand breeches pocket I found this pawnbroker's duplicate (producing it). I asked him how long he had had the watch, for the duplicate is of a watch pawned for a guinea and an half? He said he had had the watch six months. I asked him if he had ever pledged it any where else before? he said, yes, once in Westminster. I asked him where he bought it? He said a girl gave it him about six months ago. I went to Mr. Priestman's and found the watch there, which tallied with this duplicate. By the name of the maker of the watch, we found the watchmaker, and he directed us to the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>When that gentleman took the duplicate out of my pocket, I thought it was the duplicate of a watch which was my own, and which I had had about six months, that was the reason of my making that reply; but when I examined it in the morning I found it to be the duplicate of another watch which I had pawned for a man the night that that gentleman was robbed. I can prove that I was at No. 8, in Gerard-street, from near six in the evening till near eleven at night, except in the interim between eight and nine, when a young man called and asked if I was there; he was showed into the kitchen to me. He is a whitesmith by business; he had been in town some time, and was out of employ; he said he was going into the country to seek for some work. He said he would sell me his watch cheap as he was short of money and was going to seek for work. I said I had a watch of my own, and did not want to buy one, neither had I money to purchase it. He then asked me to pledge it for him, for as much as I could get upon it, and he would wait till my return. I said I would. I went to Mr. Priestman's and pledged it for a guinea and an half, and brought the money and the ticket back to him. He then said I should have the duplicate. I gave him half a crown for it. He sat down some little time, then took his leave and went away. I stayed there till near eleven o'clock.</p>

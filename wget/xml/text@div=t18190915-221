On the 31st of August I was in Whitechapel, and saw the prisoner with three other women. I asked her if she wanted to buy a necklace? I shewed them to her. She took up one and then another; I asked 9 s. for them. She whispered to the others, and then said she would lash and bolt - I did not know her meaning, and asked her for the beads. The other returned her's, but the prisoner kept what she had got, and offered me 7 s. for them - we agreed for 8 s. She said she had no money, but would get some at the pawnbroker's; she ran into the shop, while the others held me, and kept me outside. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150071"></xptr>prisoner then came out, and said I must go home with her. She met a man, and they ran off together; I followed her into Essex-street, she then offered me 5 s. for the two She took me to George-street, and went into a court - I was frightened, and said I would not go there. She ran off with the property - the other woman held me the while. After she went away, the woman let me go, and the man laughed, saying, I looked like a fool. I am sure she is the woman.</p>

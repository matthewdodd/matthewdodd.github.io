                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Garrett, a carpenter, and live at No. 76, Harley-street. The prisoner lodged in our house in April last, during which time Patience Witts came to stay for a few nights—I had some conversation with her in the prisoner's presence, respecting the Saving's-bank—Patience Witts began talking about it first—they began <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi>, and we had a little <hi rend="italic">romance</hi> about her bank—she said she had a sum of money in the bank, in St. Martin's-place—she had three boxes which were kept on the landing—I saw her deposit book one day as she was putting her clothes into a large box—she said she kept it at the bottom of her box—she said that in the prisoner's presence—the prisoner staid at my house about a week after Patience Witts—she then went into the country by railway—she gave me half-a-sovereign on leaving—I remember a parcel</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184308210033"></xptr>
               <p>coming for her—I took it in myself, from Stagg and Mantle's—she said she had been to Stagg and Mantle's, and purchased some things, and that parcel came from there—all the things were made up that she bought there—when I took the parcel down stairs she opened it—it was calico that she showed me, and a cotton gown which she bought for her mother, and a quantity of things—I have seen the prisoner write—I cannot swear to this signature in the book—I believe it to be her writing—I have received three letters from her. On the Saturday before the Monday she went into the country, I was walking with her in St. Martin's-place, and she said, "That is where Patience Witts keeps her money"—she said, "Let us go there"—I said, "What is the use of going there unless you have got the bank-book?"—she said she wanted to know which door they went in at—I said, "The front-door, I dare say."</p>

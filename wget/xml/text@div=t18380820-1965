                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 10th of March there was a robbery committed in Orchard-street—I was employed, and I took the two women—I then heard of this robbery, and the prisoner was in<lb></lb>dicted; last Sunday I went down to Minchinhampton, in Gloucester<lb></lb>shire—I took the prisoner there on Tuesday—I told him it was for robbing Mr. Oborne—he said "I know nothing of it"—he then said, "I thought they were her own things"—I said, "She passed as your wife"—he said, "She was not"—he then said the property was pawned in four or five different places.</p>

I did not know any thing of stealing these things—I looked into the box the day before I left, and saw the duplicates—I had inquired about it, and the woman said Mrs. Oborne had borrowed them for a day or two—I said, "Very well; I will put up with any thing for her" I oaly left my wife and family on Tuesday last.</p>

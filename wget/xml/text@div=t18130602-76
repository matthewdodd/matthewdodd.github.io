               <p>MR. WEBSTER. I reside with my father, who is an Inn-keeper at Derby. On the 3rd of May, I was in the coffee-room of <placeName id="t18130602-76-crimeloc399">the Angel, St. Martin's-le-grand</placeName>

Shortly the prisoner went again; I looked over the screen to see what he was doing; I saw him at the cupboard, at the further end of the room, and away from any of the company; he put his hand in the cupboard, reached something out, and put it into his pocket, two or three times; I heard a tinkling noise like spoons. I went up to him, and collared him. I told him he was stealing spoons; he shuffled himself about, and took out of his pocket three table-spoons, and put them into a knife-tray. I told the prisoner to sit down; I told one of the company to call Mr. Robinson, the landlord; and Mr. Robinson came in the room. I told Mr. Robinson that I saw him take the spoons, and that I believed he had some still more upon him. Mr. Robinson sent for a constable; the constable came, and told him to get up to let him search him, and when the prisoner got up there was another spoon under the seat where the prisoner had been sitting, and during the time the officer searching him a tea-spoon was observed to be sticking out at the bottom of his galter which he pulled out, and threw across the room. He was then taken in custody. The prisoner said before the alderman that he was in liquor at the time; I did not observe it.</p>

            . I am beadle of Cornhill. On Friday, the 25th of November, I was fetched to Mr. Day's - I searched the prisoner and found two tongues, one in each of his coat-pockets. I said it was a bad concern; he said he should not have done it, if he had not been persuaded by another person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. He was errand-boy in the house? A. Yes; three persons were called into the counting-house to be searched. I asked where he was going to take them to; he said he could not tell. I said he had better tell all about it - and he said he should not have done it if he had not been persuaded.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAM DAY. I have other partners - the prisoner was our weekly servant. I sent for the beadle - saw him search the prisoner, and take the tongues from his pockets - they are worth 2s. each - he had been nearly four years with me, and behaved very well.</p>

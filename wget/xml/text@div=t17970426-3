            , In York-street, Covent-Garden: Early in the month of March I lost a small parcel of books, which are specified in the indictment; upon searching the premises and not being able to find them, I concluded they had been delivered to somebody by mistake; in consequence of information some time after, I went to a bookseller's in Piccadilly, Mr. Stewart's where I found two books that I had lost, he was going to sell them by auction; he gave them up readily, and told me that the person who had sent them there for sale was in the room; he came forward, and said, that he had bought them of a stranger.</p>
               <p>Q.What were those two books? - A.Warner's Albion's England, a quarto volume, and Sir David Lindsay's works, a small duodecimo; the manner in which I discovered the remaining seven was pretty similar to the manner in which I discovered the other two: a gentleman told me if I went to a bookseller's in Princes-street, I should there discover them, which I did, and they are now in Court; I found them at Mr. Stace's, in Princes-street, Leicester-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you found those at the auction? - A. I believe, about the 21st or 22d of February, but I am not exact as to the time.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the other seven? - A.Two days afterwards; the books have been in my possession ever since. (Produces them.)</p>

             sworn. - I am a bookseller: The prisoner at the bar brought two books to me about the 10th of February, I am not quite exact<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260009"></xptr>as to the day, I think he asked me seven shillings for them.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that much under their real value? - A. It is much under what they sold for; but, I suppose, there is not one in an hundred who would have given more for them, or so much; Mr. Stewart, a bookseller in Piccadilly, called upon me a few days after, and told me he had a library of books that he was going to sell, and if I would put a few lots in he would be much obliged to me, that he had not enough to make out two day's sale; I told him I had a parcel of rubbish which I should he very glad to get shot of, and I sent these two among the rest, I attended the sale, and met Mr. Leigh there; we parted and met again in the evening at the Public-office, Bow-street; Mr. Bond said, I was in a very disagreeable situation, as I could not produce the man I had bought them of; I had lived with Mr. Lackington, where I had bought books of him several times, I knew his person well; the next day, as I was passing along Cattle-street, I very fortunately met the man; I asked him if he was not the man who had sold me two books; he asked me my name, I told him, and he said he did; I then desired he would go with me to the Public-office, which he refused at first; he made some trifling resistance, I took him by the collar, and insisted upon his going, I tore his coat a little, and then he said he would be very willing to go if I would let him walk on quietly; I took him to the office, and delivered him to one of the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know these books again if you were to see them? - A. Yes, perfectly; these are the two.</p>

             sworn. - I am a bookseller, in Princes-street, Leicester-square; the prisoner at the bar, on the 8th of February, brought two books to me, and told me he had a large and valueable collection, but these were the only two he should part with at present.</p>
               <p>Q.What were those two? - A.Patengenius's Zodrac of Life, and Turberville's Falconry; I asked him if they were his own, and he said I need not be afraid; that he was very well known to Mr. Stewart, down the street, who was a very good customer of his, and also was well known to Mr. White, in Fleet-street, to whom he was distantly related; that he had made this collection in his early days for his entertainment, and now, in his age, he was obliged to part with them from distress; he said he hoped he should be able to purchase them back again, and asked how long I would keep them; he expressed a with that I would keep them two months, in which time he should he able to purchase them back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say this of the two, or the seven? - A. He spoke of the seven; he asked me to keep these books two months, and he said he would allow me twenty per cent, for my trouble; I told him I wished he would not consider me as a pawnbroker, that if he came within a month he should have the books, and I would only charge him ten per cent; when I pressed him for his address, he did give it me, but very unfortunately I forgot to take it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you those books of him? - A. Yes. seven books.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy these books of him, the Vision of Pierce's Plowman, Fletcher's Purple Hland, Bulwer's Artificial Changeling. Evans's Mirror, and Scotch songs? - A. I did; I kept them by me till Mr. Leigh claimed them; I had sold one to a book-binder, and when I found they had been stolen, I gave him his money back, and returned the book to Mr. Leigh.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM STEWART sworn. - I am a bookseller, I had an auction of a gentleman's library in the month of February; Mr. Eglin sent me some books of his to put into the same auction, he sent me fifty or sixty lots, among them were the works of Sir David Lindsey, and Warner's Albion's England; the books being upon view for some days, some gentleman informed Mr. Leigh that I had them, and he came to me and claimed them, and I delivered them to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Leigh. I know these are the books I lost, they are all of them books of a very rare description; in Fletcher's Purple-Island, thee is a manuscript note at the beginning, giving an account of the author, and in the Vision of Pierce;s Plowman, it says, perfect, except the title; these very books were part of the library of Mr. Dodd, the comedian, which I myself sold by auction; I had purchased them in the sale by commission, for a gentleman, they are very rare, and very uncommon books, and at the termination of the sale, I had tied these books up together.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you bought them in your name or his? - A. I had bought them neither in my own name nor his; I had bought them in the name of Higgins.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any claim upon him till you had delivered the books? - A. None in the world, and then I have a claim of ten guineas upon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever see me in your shop but once, and that was about nine months ago, to enquire for an edition of Borlase's Cornwali, I never was in your shop in my life, except that time, nor I never attended any public sale.</p>
               <p>Mr. Leigh. I never saw him till Mr. Eglin brought him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have carefully concealed this from every friend, I have neither money to see counsel, not any thing else; the facts are re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260010"></xptr>duced to a very small point, I bought them of a Mr. Brav, and paid for them; I had bought books of him before in the same way, not that it is in the way of my profession, but I have a pretty good idea of these things.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 67, Roscoe Street, Plaistow—on 17th. April, about 12 o'clock I was in Great Prescott Street, Whitechapel—I had had too much to drink—I noticed two men coming-across the road towards me—when they got up to me they tripped me up:—as far as I can remember one hit me on the foot with his foot—I fell, received a kick, and remember no more till I found myself in the police-station—T found I had lost my hat and handkerchief—the policeman afterwards gave them to me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> H 156.) About 12.30 a. m. on 18th April. I was on duty in Great Preseott Street, Whitechapel—I saw the prisoner And a man not in custody, loitering at the corner of Magnum Passage—I con<lb></lb>cealed myself in a dark place and watched them—I saw Bamford come out of St. Mark's street very drunk—the prisoner and the other man crossed the street and stopped him—I saw him fall. And they fell on the top of him in a kneeling position—a soon as they saw me they got up and crossed the street to where I had previously seen them standing—the prisoner spoke to the other man and they walked up a passage—I followed them—the other man was carrying this hat—the prisoner looked back and saw I was following them and the other man threw the hat down and ran away, at the same time the prisoner threw this handkerchief down in a doorway—I ran and caught hold of him—I told him I wanted him—he said "What for?"—I said "You have just robbed a man in Great Prescott Street"—he said "Not me; I have been to see my cousin"—I picked the handkerchief up and said "You shrew this down"—he made no answer—I took him back into Great Prescott Street where I found Bamford close to where I saw him fall—had no had—he said—"That's the man that knocked me down"—I asked him where his hat-was—he pointed to the prisoner and said "That man stole it"—I asked him if he had lost his handkerchief and he said "Yes"—I produced the hat and handkerchief, and he said they-were his property.</p>

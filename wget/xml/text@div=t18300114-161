            . The prisoner and I have lived together<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140080"></xptr>for eight years: we lodged in St. John's-court - the decaesed child was twelve months old: its name was Joseph - it was mine; he is the father - we have two more. On Sunday evening, about six o'clock, we were both very much intoxicated; we were in the back room second floor, with the three children - we have two rooms; the prisoner was by the fire - I aggravated him a great deal, more than a man could bear, and spit in his face; he had the iron heater in his hand, and was going to stir the fire with it - after spitting in his face I went about two yards from him, and he accidentally threw the heater, not with the intention of hurting me or the child - it went through the child's head - the child was at my breast; I went to the fireplace when I spit at him - I went very quick, and sat down two yards from him; he then threw the iron - he threw himself down on the ground, cried, and got up again; he flew to the table where the knives and forks were, and was going to make away with himself - I took them from him, and said, "Don't, Charles, make away with yourself;" he went out for a few minutes, and then returned - a gentleman came and took him in charge; when the iron struck the child, I showed him what he had done - he said, "Mary, Oh, my God! I have hurt my baby;" I kept it in my arms - blood came from it - he took it into his arms, kissed it, and told me to put it to the breast - I said it was of no use, for it was dead; he wished it to be taken to a doctor, but it was of no use - it did not live above two minutes after it was struck; we had been quarrelling for a quarter of an hour - he was always very fond of the children, and indulged them in their faults; no blows had passed between us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was he not particularly fond of this child? A. Yes; he maintained and treated me kindly - I had been brought home very drunk that morning, and he was a good deal intoxicated; the heater was in his hand at the time I spit at him; it was the heater of an Italian iron - the child being killed sobered me, and I recollect what happened; I do not recollect raising my hand to him - I am sure I spit at him.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH STEWART. I live in the room over the prisoner. On Sunday evening, between five and seven o'clock, I heard the prisoner and Blagg quarrelling, for a quarter of an hour before I was called down - I heard both their voices, and something fall down; Blagg called me down, and asked me to take her child - I said I could not, as I saw it was dead; Perry stood behind her, and begged me to take it to the doctor - I said it was of no use, the child was dead; they had both been very much in liquor all day, and on Saturday evening; the prisoner continued in the house a short time, then went out, and came in again - he appeared in a very distressed state; he was a quiet wellbehaved man, and a tender father when sober - I have seen the woman very much intoxicated before, and him drunk; they never had words when they were sober.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 6th of December, about seven o'clock, I was directed to the prisoner's lodgings by the patrol; I found him and Blagg sitting in the room, with two or three children - I asked what had been the matter there; they seemed confused, and I thought endeavoured to conceal the real cause - I said it had been intimated to me that murder had been committed in the house, and I would open every room but what I would find it out - Blagg then said, "I and my husband have been quarrelling, and our child has been hurt;" I asked where it was - she took me into the next room; I there saw the child on the bed, a little warm, but quite dead - she told me how it happened; the prisoner was not in the room - I went into the room where he was; she took the iron from the fire-side, and said that was the iron it was done with - they both appeared half drunk, and, I am sorry to say, he did not appear to have the feeling he ought; a conversation passed with him, which I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was half drunk? A. Yes, and rather confused in his manner - the woman appeared more alarmed than him; the iron was clean, but perhaps it had been in the fire.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 6th of December, at a quarter-past six o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner at the corner of Sharp's-alley, West-street, very much in liquor; I said, "What brought you out in this state? you are drunk, go home" - he said, "Patrol, I wish you or somebody would shoot me;" I pressed him to go home - he asked me to shake hands, saying he would go home. I went to the house about seven o'clock with Hooker, and found the child dead - Hooker said, "How was it done?" Perry answered, "Neither of us did it, it was done between us" - Hooker asked what it was done with;" the woman said, "The iron-heater," and gave it to them from the fire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he and his wife had been quarrelling? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am house surgeon of St. Bartholomew's-hospital. I saw the child about eight o'clock that evening; it was quite dead - I found a wound on the left side of the head; next day I opened the head, and found another wound in the right side, in which the bones were broken inward - they had broken outward at the other wound; there was a wound through the brain leading from one fracture to the other - all the wounds had been given at one time; the instrument had pierced through - this iron would have effected it, if thrown with violence; the point must have struck the head - if it had struck in any other way, it might have produced death, but would not have made such a wound; if the iron had struck the woman, I cannot say what would have been the effect; it would depend on the strength of the throw - I think she might have had a severe wound, if it had struck her with the point; the child's wound would produce almost instant death.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It might not have penetrated the scull of a grown person? A. I should not expect that it would.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I solemnly assure you I had no intention of doing it, neither before nor at the time; she abused me more than a man could hear, and attempted to strike me, then spit in my face, and ran across the room - having the iron in my hand to stir the fire, I threw it at her, and struck the child; no man can have suffered more than I have since.</p>

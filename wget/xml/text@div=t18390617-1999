                  </hi>. I am a hoop-merchant, and have one partner. We carry on business at Bermondsey. On the 20th of May we discovered 78lbs. weight of nails, but we had previously lost many other parcels—they were a peculiar sort, but there are other nails of the same sort—I went, from information, to the prisoner Lawrence's marine-store shop, in Mill-street—when I got there she and her husband were at home—I waited till the officer came—I had one of these nails in my pocket—I asked her husband if he had any nails of that kind—he said he had—I said I wished to see them—he went into the back-room, but could not find them there—he then said they were up stairs—he went up stairs, and brought down a sack containing the nails, in a bag—they were the same sort I had had stolen from me, and the bag must have been mine, as it had my initials on it—I think the prisoner Lawrence was silent, but her husband said she had bought them—there was a good deal of fretting and crying from her, but I believe she said but little—this is the bag and nails.</p>

I went to the house re<lb></lb>specting the nails—the prisoner's husband said they had bought a quantity of nails of that description, and they were up stairs—I went up with him, and brought down the sack—the bag of nails was in it—I then took the husband to the station-house, the woman begged I would not take her down, but allow a person to remain with her—she was not in a fit state to go and I left a man with her—her husband said the nails were purchased on the Saturday night, but he did not buy them.</p>

I know the prisoner Lawrence by sight—I went and cautioned her three or four days to buy nothing of my boy—and the last time I went her husband told me he would not—I went to the prisoner, because she so often bought of boys—I thought my boy had got into bad company, and I told her not to buy of him—I did not take my son with me, but she knew him well—she used to take him in, and give him some meat, and he used to go in and out there—I have cautioned her not to buy of my son, when he was there himself.</p>

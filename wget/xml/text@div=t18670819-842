                  </hi> I live at 1, Cross Street, Stockwell, and am a labour<lb></lb>ing man—on the morning of 11th August I was on Clapham Common, I had a hamper with vegetables and other things in it—I sat down there and placed the hamper in front of me—there were two men with me, help<lb></lb>ing me—there are some posts close by—the prisoner and some other men came round us, and I got up for the purpose of leaving—I was turning to go through the posts, when the prisoner struck me, and told me to leave go of the hamper—they all began punching us when we were going through the posts—there were about ten of them altogether—one of them took my cap, I did not see who it was—they ran away with the basket—it was taken from me by force—they all ran in different directions, one had the hamper—I ran after them, and caught the prisoner about a quarter of a mile off—I did not lose sight of him—he was taken to the station by the police—Goulter, who was with me, swung his arm round and struck one of the men, and the prisoner jumped over the rail and struck him—the basket had a canvas cover when we fetched it, and it was quite full—the police<lb></lb>man found it—it is in a very different state now—I have not any doubt that this is the man.</p>

                  </hi> I was with the prosecutor between twelve and one—we had been to the station to get a basket—he was carrying it, and some persons came up, the prisoner is one of them, and asked for some beer—I took hold of one handle of the basket, and another man took the other, and we tried to get it through the posts—the other men hindered us from getting it through—one of the men kicked the basket, I cannot say who it was—I threw round my hands and struck one of the men—the prisoner jumped over the rail and struck me a blow, and the others ran off with the basket—I pursued the prisoner; when I came up with him he dodged among some trees—I went round in a different direction, and he walked away with his hands in his pockets—I am sure he was one of the men—I speak to him by his features and dress.</p>

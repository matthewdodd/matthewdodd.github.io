                  </hi>. I am a professor of the Royal Academy of Music, and live at No. 1, St. James's-terrace, St James's-equare, Notting-hill; it is in the parish of St. Mary Abbotts, Kensington. On the night of 7th Feb. I went to bed about half past 10 o'clock—I left my silver flute in a case in the dining room—it cost twenty-eight guineas—it was the first time for four years that I left it there—my house was secured in the ordinary way when I went to bed—about 2 or half past 2 o'clock in the morning, I was disturbed by a breaking noise, as if of some one on the stairs—I got up, and went down into the parlour—I found the place in confusion, and my flute case lying empty on the floor—I then heard a noise, as if of some one escaping from the back—I afterwards went to the police station, and gave information—I found a screwdriver lying on the parlour table—these are the pieces of my flute (<hi rend="italic">looking at some broken pieces</hi>)—these forks, spoons, and sugar tongs are also mine—they are marked with my initials—an attempt has been made to efface them; with some they have succeeded; in others they are quite visible—all these articles were in my house on the night in question when I went to bed.</p>

I went to Mr. Wells's house—I examined the back kitchen window—I found a pane of glass removed from the window—there were marks of violence used by some instrument, which corresponded with this screwdriver—I also found that the back of the bolt of the door had been cut away—by those means a person would be enabled to effect an entrance to the house—I examined the garden, and found several footmarks there—I afterwards obtained a boot, which I got from the prisoner Raines in Newgate—I com<lb></lb>pared that boot with the footmarks—I made an impression with the boot in the mould by the side of the other marks—I afterwards measured the two impressions, and compared them—they were the same length, and the same width across the ball of the foot, and also the width of the heel—it was a high heel, and there was a hollow in the centre of the foot, and the boots were rights and lefts—I compared both—the ground was very wet—it was a very wet, showery morning—it was in a state to retain an impres<lb></lb>sion—the impression I found was rather a deep one, about an inch and a half in depth at the heel part, and the sole part about half an inch—it was as if a person had jumped from the wall, which is about five feet high.</p>

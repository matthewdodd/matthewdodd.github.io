I went to the back part of the house, and Hutt and Gray waited in the front. I found him at the back of the house at Ball's Pond; it was dark. He came upon me before I saw him. We found the things in the house, as the witness has described.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was a month after the robbery. He went quietly with me; he made no resistance.</p>

            'S Defence. I bought the coat of a man, who told me it was concerned with a robbery, and not to wear it till it was altered. The evidence of Mrs. Gray is true. I told her what I did, out of revenge to my brother, in consequence of a family quarrel. I never said the things were taken to my mother's house; and I can produce two witnesses to prove that I was at home on the night of the robbery. I said my brother was concerned in it, out of revenge, that was my only motive.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 899). I have been in the force nineteen years—previous to the 9th September I had received instructions with reference to the prisoners, and in consequence of those instructions I have from time to time watched their movements for the last twelve months—About 10.30 p.m on the 9th September I was near the corner of Addle Street, Wood Street—I saw the three prisoners together—I followed them into Silvet Street, Falcon Square, and Noble Street, where Evans left Davis and Robinson, and went into a doorway on the left-hand side, and Davis and Robinson went into one on the right-hand side—the door that Evans went into I have since ascertained was No. 13, and that into which Davis and Robinson went, Nos. 28 and 29—they were there two or three minutes, and then left the doorways and joined each other, and went to the corner Of Falcon Square—a man came but of No. 13, stood on the edge of the Kerb, and looked after them—I also saw another man looking at Davis and Robinson from the court nearly opposite where they were standing—I fol<lb></lb>lowed them through different bye-streets until they came to Beech Street, where there was a fire—Davis and Evans went into the crowd, and Robin<lb></lb>son went a little further on—after some little time Evans atid Davis joined Robinson, and they went together along Barbican into Crown Street—at the corner of Wilson Street Evans and Dttvis went into a public-house called the Plying Horse, and Robinson remained outside looking about—then he went into the public-house and joined Evans and Davis—I saw them sitting on a form and handing beer one to another—they were all three together, and were looking at something which appeared to me like a key—they remained there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and then went to the corner of Sun Street, Bishopsgate, where they stood talking for two or three minutes—they then went down Bishopsgate to the corner of Houndsditch—they went down Houndsditch talking and laughing till they came to Aldgate, where Evans and Robinson went down a court or passage—Davis remained at the end looking about—I saw Evans give some<lb></lb>thing to Robinson down the court, which he put into his right-hand coat pocket—they then went into the Turk's Head public-house—a man came and spoke to them—they sat down on a form and had some beer, passing the pot from one to the other—I got the assistance of another constable, and Was about taking them into custody when Inspector White came up; I told him what had happened, and what I was going to do, and we all went in—I said to the other officer, "This one, this one, and that one"—the fourth man said, "Do you mean me?"—I said, "No, not you," calling him by his name—the others asked, "What for?"—I said, "For loitering in the steets for the purpose of breaking into warehouses"—Robinson said, "I don't know what you mean"—I took Robinson to Seething Lane—on the way to the station I had hold of his right arm, and with my left I hit against his pocket, where I saw him put his hand in—I put my hand in and took out three skeleton keys—at the station he put his band into his trousers pocket, and said, "You may as well have them all," and he gave me these</p>

               <p>skeleton keys (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I searched him and found another key in the same pocket—I asked him how he accounted for them, and he said he had had them given to him—I asked Evans where he lived, and he said No 21, Busby Street, Mile End New Town—Davis gave me an address, but said, "It is no use your going there, for I don't live there"—I have seen Envas and Robinson together night after night—I afterwards went with Sergeant Moss to No. 13, Noble Street, and found one of the keys given to me by Robinson would open that door—they would open all the door I saw tried.</p>

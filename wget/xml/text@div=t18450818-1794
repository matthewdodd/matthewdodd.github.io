On Sunday, the 22nd of June, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in the Caraberwell-road—I went into Windmill-lane, and saw Hare and Payne, and a great many other persons—Hare was rather drunk, and was stripped to fight—I requested him to go away—he said he should when he liked; but when he found I was desirous for him to go, he went, and the people separated after a few minutes—some time afterwards I received information, and went to Nelson-street, and saw Hare throwing up his hat and jacket, and there were fifty or more persons about—I went to the Walworth-road, and got Wigzell—when we got to the bottom of Windmill-lane we saw Chantler at a distance, and beckoned him—when we got to Nelson-street I saw Hare in fustian or corded trowsers—he had no coat or waistcoat on—his shirt-sleeves were tucked up, and his handkerchief tied round his waist—he was throwing up his hat and jacket, and challenging any one to fight—he challenged several in my presence—he did not speak to one alone—I went up to him with Wigzell, and said he must go to the station—he wanted to know what for—I said he would know that when he got to the station—he went a short distance very quietly, then turned very restive indeed—I requested him to go quietly, and told him we were taking him to the station—he requested to know the charge—I said, "Being drunk and disorderly, and creating a disturbance"—he said he would not go, life or death first—he laid himself down on the ground seve-ral times—after we got a short distance Payne came up and caught hold of Hare by the braces and shirt, and said he would be d—d if he should go; he should go along with him—I told Payne to take his hands off him, or I would break his arms with my truncheon—he continued to hold on to Hare several times after that—Hare laid himself down on the ground, and said, if we would allow him to button his shirt up, he would go quietly—I had seen him kick out several times before that—we allowed him to get up, and he was about buttoning his shirt, when he clenched hit, fist, struck me in the face, and made my nose bleed—he struck Wigzell, who very nearly fell, but he held on by Hare, and kept himself up—I then drew my truncheon, and struck Hare on the head, who fell to the ground—when Hare struck me in the face my truncheon was in my pocket—there was a hooting and shouting of the people, and a singing out to Hare not to go with us—he got up, and struggled, and the mob all closed in upon us—we were being overpowered, and I went to the corner of Wind-mill-lane, to get more assistance—Wigzell and Chantler remained with Hare—I returned with three other officers in about three minutes—Hare</p>

I went with Kayser to Nelson-street—I saw Hare there—I never saw him before—he was throw-ing up his jacket, and was stripped to his shirt, wanting to fight somebody—Kayser told him to go quietly—he said he would not—then Kaysef took him, and I assisted him—Hare asked us both several times why we were taking him—Kayser said, "For being drunk and disorderly"—he said he would not go, and he kicked me first in Nelson-street—I drew my staff, and told him if he kicked me again I would break his legs—when he got round the corner out of Nelson-street he struck me in the face with his fist—he struck me five or six times in the face, and kicked me several times on my right leg—Kayser struck him—neither of us had struck him before he had struck both of us in the face—I should say there were up wards of 200 persons present—I saw Payne there—he came up to Hare, and said, "Tom, go home; don't go with them"—I said he had better mind his own business, or he would get locked up himself—he then took hold of Hare by the braces, and said he would be d—d if he should go, and struck me in the fate—soon after this Kayser went away, and when he was gone Hare struck me in the face with his clenched fist—when I took my staff out I had kept it in my hand, but I had not used it up to this time—Chantler was at this time with me—the people got in between Hare and us to rescue him—I am certain Henry, James, and William Goodright were amongst the persons who assisted at the rescue—when Hare struck me in the face, I struck him across the shoulders with my truncheon, and knocked him down; and I struck him on the feet when he was on the ground kicking, to keep his kicks from me, when he was trying to kick me in the privates—he did not kick me there, but he was aiming at that part—I had known the three Goodrights before, and they got between Hare and me—one of them got hold of me, but I could not say which—Hare knocked me down, and I was kicked and jumped upon—I lay insensible on the ground several minutes—I was kicked in my side and the back of my head—there were many of the mob besides the prisoners interfering at that time—Hare got away from me—I got up and tried to follow him, and I was knocked down by a man who is not here—I got up, and went to</p>

Goodrights there, Flinn, Pass-field, Mannix, and Shae—I saw Flinn have hold of the officer's belt, pull-ing him across, and striking him—Mannix had hold of his belt at the same time, and another person who is not in custody—I saw Wigzell on the ground, and Payne had hold of Chantler's staff—I went in and saw William Goodright stamping on Wigzell as he lay on the ground—I went to assist, and I heard some one say, "There is the b—y cork-cutter gone to help the <hi rend="italic">Peelers"</hi>—James and Henry Goodright were edging in against the officer, and Shae was inciting Hare on, and saying, "Go it, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>—give it him, <hi rend="italic">Tom."</hi>

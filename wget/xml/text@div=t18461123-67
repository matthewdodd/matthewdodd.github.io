                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in High-street, Stepney. On the 31<hi rend="italic">st</hi> of Oct. I was called in to attend the deceased—I found her affected with pleurisy, of which she died—I did not examine her right side when I first saw her, to see if it was bruised—I touched it with my hand—I was not aware at first that she had received blows.</p>

                  </hi>. On Tuesday afternoon, the 8th of Sept., I was in Samuel-street, at my house, No. 23—Mary Fitzgerald, the mother of the deceased Julia Fitzgerald, lives at No. 8—I saw the deceased run into the street to rescue her mother from Mrs. King, the mother of the prisoners—Richard King stood against his own door, and by the time Mrs. King got up to the door he struck the deceased a violent blow on the shoulder—I saw Green standing at her mother's door—she said, "I will rule this roast, I will have a ringer in the pie," and struck the deceased a violent blow in the chest—the prisoner Sumner had a child in her arms, and gave her child to somebody at the door and said, "Here, take my child, I will have her b—y liver out"—she gave her a violent blow on the side, saying, Take that, you b—h"—somebody said, "Here comes the policeman," and I turned away—the policeman went with me up to the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the deceased's mother. On Monday, Sept. 7th, I had a struggle and contest with Mr. King—I went next day to get a warrant against him, both before and after the assault on my daughter—on the 8th of Sept., between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing talking to Mrs. Swancey—Mrs. Green and Mrs. Sumner came to the door—Mrs. King shook her fist at me, and said, "You old cat, I have got you, and I will serve you out"—I heard a noise, ran across, and Mrs. Green said, "I will rule this roast, and will serve you out"—my daughter had some things which we work upon, and ran out with them in a cloth—Mrs. King knocked me down—my daughter saw me and ran to my assistance—Mrs. Sumner struck her a violent blow, and as she entered the door she struck her a violent blow on the right ride—they struck her several blows in the house—she came to the door—Mrs. Green struck her a violent blow in the side, and she nearly fainted—Richard King struck her a violent blow over the right eye and in the side—she had the marks for three weeks, and William King held her while the two sisters beat her—he is a young man about twenty-two—he is not here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who are the slop-sellers for whom you work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Robertson—my daughter and I both did slop-work—Mrs. King was not security for our work—she was for some which had been taken home—I owed her 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. rent when this took place—it was back rent, which we had been paying off, and had been owing since Christmas—our circumstances are very bad—I was going out that afternoon with a bundle of work, which Mrs. King took from me—it was waistcoats, trowsers, duplicates, some bits of ribbons, and other things, not the principal things which were in our lodging—the duplicates fell out—some were picked up—the bundle was in a table<lb></lb>cover, which was mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body with you there - A. Yes, a corporal belonging to the same regiment. I went into the public-house at near eight at night. I left it at nine at night. I drank gin hot during the time I was there. I was perfectly as sober as I am now. There were several other persons in the house; there were two or three girls of the town in the house dancing with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, he was there at that time; he continued there until half past ten. I went out at nine. I went home and returned again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he there when you left the house - A. Yes, and when I returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. No, I never saw him before to my knowledge. li might be near ten o'clock when I returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the house when the prisoner left it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he leave you in the house - A. It might be a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, as near as I can guess. When I left it I proceeded home the second time. It was about a quarter before eleven. In my way home I proceeded through <placeName id="t18140112-37-crimeloc197">Tothill-street, Westminster</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18140112-37-crimeloc197" type="placeName" value="Tothill-street, Westminster"></interp>

As I was going up the street, the prisoner crossed over the road to me; he came up and said something, but the words I cannot express that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120020"></xptr>made use; at the same time he pulled my watch from my fob. It was a silver watch, a seal, key, and a ribbon to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this taken from you by force against your will - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the person who took your watch afterwards - A. He ran away from me immediately; I hallooed out immediately that I had lost my watch; corporal Lee came to me; he picked up my watch-case; the prisoner returned to me, and said, God d - n your eyes, do you mean to say that I have robbed you. I said, yes. He struck at me immediately, and on my turning round to save the blow he ran away. I saw no more of him that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when he was apprehended - A. One day last week, by Pace, the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how can you be sure that the person that took your watch was the prisoner - A. I can swear to it. I saw him in the house the evening before. I might be in the house an hour and a half, or better. While he was dancing I observed his countenance, his figure; I knew him again when I returned to the public-house, and I knew him to be the same person when I saw him in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt the prisoner is the man that took your watch in the way that you have told us - A. I can swear he is the man, without doubt.</p>

            . I am a corporal in the 3d regiment of foot guards. I was with the last witness on the night of this robbery, at the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there - A. Yes, I am sure I saw him. I never knew him before to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave the public-house with the last witness - A. No; I went with him when he returned, and came with him when he came away the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his watch taken from him - A. No, I cannot say I did. I heard him call out that he had been robbed. I was about three paces in front of the witness when I found the outside case of a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. After this did you see any person come up - A. I saw the prisoner come up; he said, d - n your eyes, do you mean to say that I robbed you. The prosecutor said, yes, I do. The prisoner struck at him; I ran in between to save the blow. The prisoner returned, and ran away. I saw no more of him that night. I am positive the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the outside case - A. That is the outside case of my watch; I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into this public-house to have pint of beer after I had done work; on my returning home I saw the prosecutor coming up the street; he had some girls of the town with him; he said he had lost his watch. He challenged me with the robbery; he said I had robbed him of his watch. I asked him if he meaned to say that I had robbed him of his watch; he said, yes. I offered to strip my clothes off for him to search them; he would not. About a month after, he got a constable to take me up. I am innocent of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. I think you said he took the watch by force - A. Yes; he came up against me, and made use of some words that I cannot express. I thought it was to rob me. He pushed me against a shutter, and took the watch from me.</p>

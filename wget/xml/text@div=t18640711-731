I am the wife of John Evins, a private in the Royal Marines—on the 8th of January, the prisoner came to my house, and asked me if he might sit down as it was very cold—I said, "Yes; but I was going out into the stores to take some work I had done"—I went out, and left him—I met a woman; from what she told me I turned round, and saw the prisoner coming out of the door with a bundle under his arm; when he came in he had none—I went to look after a policeman, but could not find one—I never saw anything more of the prisoner until I saw him in custody—when my husband returned on the Friday I told him—he looked over the bag and missed some articles.</p>

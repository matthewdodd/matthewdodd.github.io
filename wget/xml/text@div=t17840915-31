               <p>Then how came you to suspect money had been taken out? - Because it had been accidentally left open: the prisoner had been ill, and I thought must want money, and yet he always seemed to be flush of money, his wages were but fourteen shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Court. You should rather have locked up your till, than have left it open; it is a temptation to a man to take it.</p>

               <p>Jones. He said he took it in change of a man in buying a stove; he acknowledged taking it before the Alderman, I was present.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. Your own folly in telling a story, which you knew must be contradicted the next minute, has prejudiced you very much with the Court.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Has the man any family? - He has a wife, but I do not know whether they live together.</p>
               <p>How did he behave before this? - I have nothing to alledge against him.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. Your attention is very laudable, but I would recommend to you never to take that method again, by leaving temptation in people's way; a drawer open with money in it, is a temptation, and especially where you yourself have told us, that the prisoner was in a state that made him want money.</p>

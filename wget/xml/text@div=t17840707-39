               <p>The prosecutor did not lodge at my house, he left his charge in my possession, he came home sometimes once a week, and sometimes once a fortnight; I missed this watch out of my possession on Trinity Sunday, and I went up to the prisoner's room, and asked him if he took such a thing, and he freely confessed he did.</p>
               <p>What promises did you make him? - So far as this, if he would tell me where the watch was I would take the watch out again and redeem it; then on the Monday there was another box found open, and the gentlewoman said she would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Did you promise him that you would not prosecute him if he would tell you where the watch was? - I told him as far as that.</p>
               <p>Answer me this; did you promise him, or give him to understand in any way, that if he would confess where the watch was you would not hurt him? - I said I would not prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Court. Do not you know that is a very wrong thing? - I had been out of work five months at that time, and if I had not found out where the watch was, I should have had it to have paid for, and that was the way, I thought to come the easiest way over him.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know any thing more about it? - No.</p>

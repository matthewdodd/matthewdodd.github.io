                  </hi>. I am an inmate of St. Pancras-workhouse. On 12th Jan. some stone was being brought into the yard—Jennings was employed to bring some—I saw Bushell take a shovel, and put it into Jenning's barrow—I told Jennings there was no shovel allowed to go out without Mr. Somer<lb></lb>ton was there—he and Bushell both said it was all right—I gave Mr. Somerton information the next day—on Sunday morning Bushell said to me, "There is a piece of work about these shovels; what have you been saying?"—I told him, and he said, "If you have not done more than that, there in no harm done; the man that took the shovels out has put them away; I am going out to-morrow to take my wife and family"—he said he had sent down to Tolliday's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the stone-yard, at St. Pancras. I missed two shovels on 12th Jan.—they had brand-marks on the handles—they never came back—the prisoner Bushell was at work that day in the stone-yard, and so was Nathan—Jennings was employed in bringing stones into the yard, and so was Tolliday, I believe, by the wharfinger—I went to Tolliday's house on the following Saturday—I found him in possession of this shovel, but by reason of the brand-mark being erased, I would not swear it is ours—our shovels are marked in this way.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Bushell. Q.</hi> Had I no use for a shovel in the yard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he last load of stones did not go out on 12th Jan.—I did not say, "Take that shovel and load the cart"—there was no cart being loaded that day.</p>

               <p>shovels in the yard—I missed two when I took stock, on the Wednesday night—I have no doubt that it belongs to the parish—those which are in my care I have under lock and key at night—the yard is attached to the workhouse in the King's-road—the foreman of the road may have some shovels, but I cannot say anything about them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 320). On Monday morning, 23d May, about 1 o'clock, I heard a man screaming in Bluegate-fields, Victoria-street—I beard a man say, "I have got it," and saw Hurley leave the crowd and go into his own house, about ten yards from the crowd—I knew him before—the prosecutor, came up, very much excited, and the worse for liquor—I saw Brown standing in the crowd, dressed as she is now—I believe she it Hurley's sister—I apprehended them both in the neighbourhood about ten minutes afterwards—I told them the charge—Hurley said that he was not there, he was in bed at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hurley. Q.</hi> I live at No. 6, do I not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the crowd was opposite the court by your house—I cannot say who it was that said, "I have got it"—I had hold of the two witnesses, and held them till the prosecutor came up; he said that they were there, and I told them to come to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hurley's Defence.</hi> I hope you will take into consideration that the prose<lb></lb>cutor first said that he was lying at the end of the street, and then in the middle of the road. There is no lamp in the street, and it would be impos<lb></lb>sible, unless you know a person well, to recognise anybody by his features. The prosecutor was so intoxicated that he could know nothing. I had been to a meeting, and taken too much to drink; I laid on the bed till 12 o'clock, when I went out to get something to drink, but the houses were shut. I was standing at my door, and saw the last witness coming up. I stepped across and said, "Is your name on the bill to perform at the Phoenix on Monday night?" He said, "It is." I saw the prosecutor stop Lynes, and went in-doors and took no notice, because there are always <hi rend="italic">rows</hi> in that neigh<lb></lb>bourhood. I was sitting in-doors, and my sister came in. She offered me some gin, which she had at home in a bottle. I went out for it, but had not</p>

               <p>gone two steps when the policeman said, "I want you, and you too." I went to the station. The prosecutor was intoxicated. Is it right for me to be convicted on a drunken man's evidence? He does not say that he got up and was attacked a second time.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk to Martha and Mary Wray. They had a cask of colour at their wharf on the 12th Oct.—it was missed—I did not see it previously to its being stolen, but I know there was a cask of that de<lb></lb>scription landed from a vessel—it is now here—it agrees with the description in the invoice—I have got the manifest here—it is one of the three casks mentioned in this manifest—the whole weight was 8cwt. 3qrs. 14 lbs.—it is addressed to "D. Jones, High-street, Kensington."</p>

                  </hi> I was at the wharf on 12th Oct. I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner kick a piece of tarpaulin out of his cart into Mrs. Wray's warehouse, and Holland, who has been convicted, rolled the cask of colour into the tarpaulin—the prisoner immediately got out of the cart and assisted him to lift it into his cart—it appeared to be heavy—the prisoner immediately drove the cart away—I gave information to the warehouse-keeper, and he dispatched a man after him.</p>

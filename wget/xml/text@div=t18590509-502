                  </hi>. I am an engineer—Buckley was in my employ as errand-boy—on 3d May I missed a considerable quantity of copper; this produced is a part of it, but this is not the large quantity—I found this folded up near my counting-house—I afterwards went with a policeman to Wall's—he stated that he had made a bad job of it, and he hoped I would be as lenient as possible—his wife was given in charge, but as she was near her confinement I did not press the charge—I heard Wall asked if he had bought any copper that day, and he said he had not, and asked his mistress whether she had—the constable then asked him if he had any copper at all—he said he had a little, and he took out these four pieces which had been in my place two hours before; he said he gave 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for one portion of it, and his wife gave 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for another portion—when Buckley saw Wall, he said, "That is the man that bought the copper of me"—Wall first denied it, and then admitted it—the value of this would be 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I weighed it in Wall's scale.</p>

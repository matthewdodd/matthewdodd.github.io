                  </hi>. I keep the Coach and Horses public-house, in Welbeck-street. On the afternoon of the 18th of February the prisoner came to my bar and asked for half a pint of porter on credit—I would not serve him, and just previous to that I had put two bottles of wine on a shelf by the bar—I turned to the bar-parlour, by the fire, and returned in about five minutes, and missed a bottle of wine, the pri<lb></lb>soner was gone from the house-about twenty minutes after, I saw him at the corner of the mews, where my house is, and accused him of it—he de<lb></lb>nied it, and abused me very much—I went to a stable just by, where I knew he was in the habit of going, and in the second stall of the stable I found part of my bottle of wine—I got a witness, and went into the har<lb></lb>ness-room to see if anybody came to take it, and in about twenty minutes the prisoner came to the stall and took the wine—I seized him, and said, "Then I have got you at last?"—he said, "Yes"—it was red wine in the bottle, the same as I had lost—the flavour was the same as mine, and the mark on the bottle was the same as the other-nobody but him could have taken it, as it was gone momentarily.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 110.) I apprehended the prisoner—he said he was sorry for it, but he had been drinking or he should not have done it.</p>

A man came before me, apparently accidentally, I put my came up across myself and the lady, to prevent his coming against us, and he passed us, and just as he got by, the prisoner came up with his hands closed before him, he appeared to come against me accidentally, he unclosed his hands, and got hold of my chain and seals, and made a violent pull at them. I put my hand down to save them, and having a chain round my neck, and fixed to the watch, he did not get them away with that pull, he then gave the chain a twist, and laid hold of me by the collar, and swung me round, and at the same time forced the chain away and ran off. I pursued, and when he got about five yards, (I was close to him) he turned down a very narrow alley, at the end of which there was some steps, and at the bottom of these steps, he turned into another narrow alley on the right, it was only wide enough to admit of one person; and, at the corner, I was in the act of seizing him, when he knocked me down, and said,</p>
               <p>"You *** what do you want with me," and ran off immediately along the passage, and while I was raising, and nearly up, four or five of his gang kicked me on the loins, and on my back. I cut at them with my cane, and ran off after the prisoner, who was still in sight, the passage being so narrow, the gang could not get before me without knocking me down. I ran after him, he was turning round a gateway, at the end which led into Sun-street - I was nearly up with him, I there was seizing him, when one of the gang who had knocked me down, seized me, and said,</p>
               <p>"You *** what do you want with him, he has nothing of yours." I said,</p>
               <p>"You villain, let me alone." I struck him in the face with my cane, which was in my right hand, and with my left arm shoved him away and disengaged myself. I still had sight of the prisoner, and had hardly got under the bar which crossed the gateway, when he got under the bar into Sun-street, I after him, and hallooed out Stop thief! - I had not lost sight of him; he ran on, and got to the end of Sun-street - still in my sight. I was so close to him, as to keep cutting at him with my cane, and occasionally hitting him; he was crying Stop thief! as well as me, and at the end of Sun-street, a coach was passing, (it was at Bishopsgate-street end) which nearly stopped him from crossing Bishopsgate-street; he did however cross the street, and I after him, close by him, and still in sight, and at the end of Union-street, he laid hold of me himself, and said</p>
               <p>"You b - y villain, what do you want of me, don't follow me," and then let me go. I followed him, still crying Stop thief! will no one stop a thief; a man then seized him, and appeared in the act of letting him go, when I came up and cut at them both, supposing he was one of the party also - he did let him go. I still ran crying Stop thief!</p>
               <p>"You villain, will no one stop you;" he then ran down Union-street towards the church. I pursued, keeping close to him; a man came up and was going to seize him. I heard him say,</p>
               <p>"Don't stop me;" he was gone a-head, and the man let him go. I said,</p>
               <p>"That is the villain, why don't you stop him;" the prisoner, then turned down another street, I still pursuing and calling out; a quantity of people were round and alongside, down the street, which was Duke-street. I was again in the act of seizing him, when a man seized me by the throat, I fell down, fainted, and lost him for the first time, and he got away.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you declare safely on your oath that he is the man - A. I have not the least doubt whatever. I had him in view ten minutes or upwards, and have not the least doubt whatever of him; the chain broke from the watch in consequence of the violence of the pull. The metal chain round my neck kept the watch.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You did not call Stop thief! till you got down the turning - A. Yes, immediately as he took them. He was not out of my sight till I fainted, except in turning the alley for an instant.</p>
               <p>Q. When the gang were kicking you, you lost sight of him - A. Yes, but the passage was so narrow, I could not help seeing him, and there was nobody to be seen before me but him. I am sure I caught sight of the same man again. I saw him at the watch-house five or six minutes after I fainted, and recognised him among a number of people. I was led to the watch-house, in consequence of what the mob said. The constable produced the chain and seals. I claimed them in the prisoner's hearing, and found one seal was gone; one had my initials and crest on. When I said one was gone, the constable said,</p>
               <p>"I think I heard him drop something, and I will go and see;" he went and brought in the other seal covered with mud. I was very ill used, and bruised dreadfully. I am bruised now all over my body.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are you sure I am the man who robbed you - A. I am, I positively swear it, I have no doubt of it.</p>

            . I live in Nicholl-street, Bethnal-green. On the evening of the 10th of July, I was with Mr. Trust about half-past nine o'clock, in Sun-street, nearer Bishopsgate-street than Finsbury-square, a man crossed us, Mr. Trust put up his cane to prevent his coming against us; he passed us, and instantly the prisoner came - the lamps were lit. I am quite sure of him, he came with his hands folded before him, and with his right hand gave Mr. Trust rather a violent blow (it was more a push than a blow) and with his left snatched at his seals, which hung out visible, the snatch turned him round, and he directly ran down a passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether he did any thing else - A. No, I was alarmed; he ran down a passage, the prosecutor followed him, and so did I a little way down, till I found myself surrounded by five or six men. I then returned, and afterwards saw some persons running out of another gateway, but could not distinguish them.</p>

            . I am a plaisterer, and live in Bishopsgate-street. I was coming down Union-street, about half-past nine o'clock at night, on the other side of Bishopsgate-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180019"></xptr>and heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw five persons, three of my side of the way, and two on the other side with the prisoner in the centre; they were running, and all crying Stop thief!</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive he is the person you saw in the centre of the five - A. I am - I stepped into the road and seized him by the collar, because he was in the centre, and pushed him to get him into Bishopsgate-street to the light; the party of five closed in upon me, and I saw no person near me but these five; there was a cry of floor him, serve him out. I was hit over the head and shoulder with fists, I kept still pushing him towards Bishopsgate-street, but they hustled me. I was then struck two or three times with a stick. I could distinguish nobody coming up, and thought it dangerous to persevere, and let go. I met Mr. Trust in Duke-street, he complained of being robbed, and afterwards went to the watch-house, he had a swelling on the hip where he had been kicked; the prisoner was there. I was quite sure he was the man I had hold of in Union-street, and told him so.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What induced you to fix on him - A. Because I knew all the party. They were running and appeared to be guarding him, and he was a-head of them. I had watched them in the streets before.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Union-street, Spitalfields. On the 10th of July, about nine or ten o'clock at night, I was standing by my door and heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw a man go up Duke-street, which is about a hundred and fifty yards from my door. I went up Steward-street, thinking the party might come that way, and at the bottom of that street I saw the prisoner run by. I have not the least doubt of his being the man. I have seen him about before. I seized him; he was crying out Stop thief!" himself at the time. Directly I caught him he held up his right arm, and called out Charley! Charley! and at that moment, something fell from his hand, I could not see what it was. I thought he had something else in his hand, I forced his hand open and found a gold chain, and three seals, a key, a gold ring, and part of another seal. I took him to the watch-house, and in about twenty minutes, the prosecutor came in. There were six or eight people there. Directly he saw the prisoner he charged him with it, the moment he saw him. I showed him the property, and asked if that was all he had lost. He said part of a seal was missing. I said I heard something drop, and thought I could find it. I went to the spot where I took him, with a light, and in less than two minutes I found the part of the seal, where I thought I had heard him drop something. It corresponds with the part that remained. The prosecutor claimed it, he described it before I went after it. He said it had a white stone in it.</p>

               <p>"That is the man" - he was then pointing to the person whom Miller had seized, I losed him, and directly went to Miller's assistance, and held the prisoner while he wrenched the seals out of his hand; he cried out - Charley, Charley! and, as I thought, wanted them to rescue him; there was five or six of the gang hallooing out</p>
               <p>"Rescue him" and using very bad expressions. We took him to the watch-house, I heard nothing drop. I afterwards saw the prosecutor at the watch-house.

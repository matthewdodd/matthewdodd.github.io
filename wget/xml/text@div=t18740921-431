I am assistant to my father, a grocer, at Mortlake Green—on 15th September the prisoner came into my shop for some bacon—I served her—she said she would pay for it in the morning—she went out, and returned shortly afterwards not to buy any things; he told me some story about a woman who was tipsy in "her bed, and asked me what she should do—after she was gone I missed a piece of bacon—there were no. customers there then—shortly after, she came in for some butter and paid for it, and in going out I saw a piece of bacon under her arm—I followed her and asked where she had got it—she said she had paid 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it at Mr. Crunch's, the grocer's, in High Street—I said she had not, she had just taken it off the counter, and I had missed another piece also, which I believed she had—she said she had not, I might go to her house and search—I went to her house with the constable, and he found the piece of bacon in the back kitchen—I can swear it was the same piece I lost, it weighed about 3 3/4 lbs.—the prisoner was not sober, but I believe she perfectly understood what she was about, for when she saw the policeman she ran away from him. Frederick Orgles (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant-V R</hi> 18). I went with Mr. Hancock to the prisoner's house—she saw me coming and ran away—I ran after her and told her that Mr. Hancock charged her with stealing a piece of bacon—she said she did not think' he would have been so hard upon her, as she had dealt with him—she said at first she had bought" the piece of bacon, and afterwards that she was going to pay for it—in the back kitchen I found another piece, which Mr. Hancock claimed—she said she did not know how it could have got there, she believed she had bought it—she had been drinking, but knew what she was doing—she ran about 200 yards before I caught her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, in the employ of Mr. David King, of Mitre-street, Aldgate. On Saturday morning, 10th March, about 11 o'clock, I was in the workshop mixing some paint, which was to be sent to Black-heath by the prisoner, who was in the employ of my master—the prisoner went to a bench and took something, and placed it in a bag; I asked him what he was doing—he said it was only a copper pan he was taking—I told him to leave it alone, there would be a disturbance about it—he said it was all right, and master plumber had given it to him—he put the bag into the cart, and went away with it, and I followed him to Kent-street—I saw him get out of the cart, and go into a marine store shop, and take the bag in with him—I saw him place some lead and a copper pan in the scale—I saw him take them from the bag—I went into the shop, and saw the man give him half a crown and some halfpence—the man then took the lead out of the scale—I told him it was stolen, and he must return it—the man gave me up the lead and the pan, and the prisoner returned the money; I allowed him to go on his journey to Blackheath, and I went to my master.</p>

On the Friday I had been working for Mr. King; I had brought home some lead, but not the copper pan—I had placed the lead under the bench; it was Mr. King's lead—no one had a right to take it—I did not give the prisoner any authority to take this lead or this pan—there is no pretence for any one having perquisites.</p>

My husband keeps a general shop in Lisson-grove—this day month I saw the prisoner served with some cheese—he gave my husband a shilling—he put it into the till, where there was only a sixpence, and gave the prisoner the change—I saw my husband go to the till, ten minutes afterwards, and take out a bad shilling—I went out, found the prisoner in a public-house, and told him he had passed a bad shilling—he said that he had not been out that day—I went to fetch my husband, and when I returned the prisoner had gone, and another man stood up in his place—I afterwards gave the shilling to a constable.</p>

I keep the Hercules, in Lisson-grove—on Saturday night, 10th October, between 10 and 11 o'clock, the prisoner came in for a pot of porter—after he had left, my son Henry, who had served him, showed me a bad florin—I have seen the prisoner in the house several times—he came in again in five minutes, and I called him up to the counter and said, "Do you see this? Do you know what you have given here?" and showed him the bad florin—he said that he knew nothing about it—I sent for a policeman, and gave him in custody.</p>

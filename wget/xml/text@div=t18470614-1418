                  </hi>. I am salesman to Mr. Stephen Roberts, a tailor, is High-street, Whitechapel—our shop adjoins the yard of the Kent and Essex Tavern, which is closed at night. On the 15th of May, about a quarters past twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner at the corner of the Kent and Essex gateway, with a policeman—I saw a waistcoat in the prisoner's hand—it was my master's—I asked him where he got it from—he said he had found it behind the gate—the policeman was about closing the gates of the yard—when the prisoner was brought in, he said to my master, "I took the waist<lb></lb>coat intending to pay for it next week"—he was given to the policeman—this is the waistcoat.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 168.) I am in the habit of closing the gates of the Kent and Essex Yard, in Whitechapel. As I did so on Saturday night, the 12th of May, about a quarter past twelve o'clock, the prisoner came and took up something behind the gates—I said, "What have you got there?—he said, "Never mind, I work for the next shop"—I told him I must see what he had got—I had got hold of his coat, and Jacobs came and took the waistcoat from his hand—I was afterwards called to take the prisoner for stealing it—he said he took it with the intention of paying for it the next week—I heard him mention that he had agreed to have a pair of trowsers.</p>

G. on the near side in a circle tarred; I missed it before five o'clock in the morning; I saw it again in the afternoon, at Tomkins's, in Webber-row, Sr. George's Fields; I am sure it was the same sheep I had lost; you go through a shop with a wash-window into a yard, and in that yard I found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the yard from the street? - A. Not without the door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door open when you went? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It is not customary for the salesman to go with his drover to market? - A. No; he takes the sheep, and then I go to the market.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen these sheep before they went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150083"></xptr>to the market? - A. I had seen it on the Sunday; it was one of a lot of ten.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not your own marks? - A. No; the mark of my employer.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it customary for you to put a private mark of your own, besides the mark of your employer? - A. Sometimes if there are sheep marked much alike, our men have a private mark of their own to put upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. But these sheep had no private mark? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to swear that the dirt on the face was occasioned by design? - A. No, I cannnot.</p>
               <p>Q. Tomkins's is a butcher's shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tomkins made no difficulty in telling you he had the sheep? - A. He was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. But you had no difficulty in finding the sheep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who was the proprietor of these ten sheep? - A. Mr. John Graves, of St. Alban's, grocer and miller.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any more than ten with that mark? - A. No; they were all horned sheep, and the rest were all pole sheep; if they had been all horned sheep, I should not have missed it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am drover to Mr. Payne: On Sunday night, the 1st of February, I took his sheep into the pens before eleven o'clock in the evening; there were ten horned sheep among them; they were marked with a round O, and J. G. in it, with tar, and an ochre mark down the forehead; I missed one of the sheep about twelve o'clock at night; I searched about, but could not find it; on Monday afternoon I found the same sheep at Tomkins's, with three others; I am sure it was the same sheep.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Will you venture, upon your oath, to say, that these ten sheep were ever in Smithfield-market? - A. I cannot say that they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you dare swear you ever saw it in the market? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That one might have been lost before you penned them? - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not often happen that a sheep may mingle with another drove? - A. Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. And all the diligence and anxiety you can use for your master, cannot prevent it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far had you drove them? - A. From Islington.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you not miss it between Islington and Smithfield? - A. No, not till I parted them, and then I missed one.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I am a master drover; I drove for Mr. Fountain, in Newgate-market: On the 1st of February I was out all night in Smithfield-market; I saw the two prisoners in the market against Mr. Payne's pens; I saw them lurking about the pens, as they always made it a practice of doing; I saw them first between eleven and twelve o'clock; I saw Fossett take a sheep out of Mr. Payne's pen; Hannikin was standing by; it was a horned sheep; they put it into Mr. Boys's pen; they were both together; they turned some more sheep out with it, and drove them down to Durhamyard, Chick-lane; when they had gone a little way, Hannikin said to Fossett, take them to Tomkins's, in Webber-row, and tell him they came from me; I then went and told Mr. Payne's man of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sheep were there? - A. I think there were about a score.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Don't you know that Fossett is himself a <rs id="t18010415-138-viclabel773" type="occupation">master drover</rs>? - A. He has been a drover some years, and Hannikin is a master drover.</p>
               <p>Q. You are all drovers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You talked of lurking about the market just now - it was where they ought to be, in the way of their business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you never say it was Hannikin, the boy, that lifted the sheep over the pens? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both in the pen? - A. No; Fossett was in the pen, and Hannikin stood outside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they not see you? - A. No; I was in the pen, doing some business for myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You were watching these men then? - A. No, I was doing some business.</p>
               <p>Q. You supposed they were going to steal the sheep? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not call out to them, and tell them, if they did not desist, you would punish them? - A. I was afraid, I had been threatened so often.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Robinson, Mr. Payne's drover, there at the time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as Robinson returned, you told him what you had seen? - A. I did not see him till the morning, I had to go to Holloway.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave the market immediately after this? - A. As soon as they turned down Chick-lane, I went to Holloway.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that? - A. Half past three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you tell a single creature in the market, though you were in there till half past three o'clock? - A. I told Gordon of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell a single creature of it, till after you came from Holloway? - A. No, I did not see Robinson till after I came back, and then I told him they were gone to Tomkins's.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, have you never said it was Hannikin that lifted the sheep over the pen? - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard of a reward of twenty pounds, if these men are convicted? - A. I have not,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150084"></xptr>I did not do it for the reward: I did it to stop such people; I have lost fourteen sheep myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you quite sure he is the man? - A. Yes; there were about a score in the drove, and four of them were put into Mr. Tomkins's; there was one horned sheep; it was marked down the face with ochre; I did not observe the other mark; I stopped the sheep for him; I staid there about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour; Tomkins helped to get them in.</p>

               <p>Q. Which way did he go then? - A. He went up Duke-street, which leads to Blackfriar's-bridge, and the Borough, both.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to have any thing to do with it? - A. I was going to work.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to find you out on the part of the prosecution? - A. I heard my master telling some gentlemen about the sheep.</p>

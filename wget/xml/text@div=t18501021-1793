                  </hi>. I keep the Star and Garter, Shoreditch. On 27th Sept., about half-past twelve o'clock, the prisoner and four others came, and called for a pot of stout—I gave it them, and two glasses—they drank it, and got <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> one another about, and broke one of the glasses—I said, "You have broken the glass"—one of them said they had not—I said, "Nonsense, there it is lying at your feet; I don't suppose you broke it purposely; it cost 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; if you pay 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I will pay the rest"—they did not offer to pay for it—I went round to shut up the house, and three of them <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me up in the corner, and held me there—the prisoner picked up the glass, chopped me in the face with it three or four times, and left me for dead—I was all over blood—my nose was cut open to the bone, and ray lip was cut right through—they all ran away—I had not known him before, but I am sure of him—he was brought back in ten or twenty minutes.</p>

I was in the Star and Garter, and saw the prisoner and five or six others—Mr. Wilford said, "There is a glass broken"—one of them said there was not—Mr. Wilford said, "Yes there is," and walked round the counter to put the shutters up—he said, "Come, pay for the glass"—one said, "How much is it?"—he said, "As you own to breaking it, it is a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. glass; pay me 3<hi rend="italic">d."</hi>—they said they could not pay till Monday—he said, "There are five or six of you, pay me now"—they all rushed to the door—the prisoner took the glass from the floor, and struck Mr. Wilford—blood flowed profusely—I only saw one blow—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I had never seen him before.</p>

I was at the Star and Garter—the glass was knocked out of one of their hands, and the prisoner, Saunders, and Bracklin, got up, and rushed to the door, sending Mr. Wilford into the corner—the prisoner struck him on the nose with the broken shank of the glass twice—I have no doubt he is the man.</p>

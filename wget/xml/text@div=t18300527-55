            . I am a Police-officer. The witness told me he had been robbed of his watch - I went in search of the prisoner, but she was gone; I found her four days afterwards - she denied the robbery; I got this watch through the medium of a woman who called herself her sister.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the second examination he asked the Magistrate to let me be remanded another week, and during that time he came to Clerkenwell-prison to me - he said he suspected a person who frequented the road, and wished to find out the right person, and if the right person could be found, or he could give any account of the watch, the boy would give him 1l., and he would keep him away - he put several questions to me to know if I knew where the woman lived; I never saw the prosecutor till I was at the office.</p>

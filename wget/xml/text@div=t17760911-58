               <p>On the 4th of June I went to see the landlady I lodged with when I first came to London in Dyot-street; I came to the house about ten o'clock, and staid above an hour; the prisoner ran after a young lad to lick him; the lad came into the house, and the prisoner after him; I knew the prisoner when I first came to London, we lodged in the same house four years ago, I was glad to see him; I sent for a pot of beer to treat him, we sat awhile; when that pot of beer was out, he sent for another; I got up and insisted on going home, he said, he would see me safe home.</p>
               <p>Where did you live? - I lodged in Bedfordbury; instead of bringing me up Monmouth-street, he brought me up Drury-lane; my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110068"></xptr> friends were at the Three Tuns in Monmouth-street waiting for me, I told him so; he said, he would see me safe home, which I was glad of, for I thought he was very honest; when we were in Drury-lane, he insisted upon keeping me out all night; I told him he had much better take my life than offer to keep me out, or to use me ill; when he found he could not get his ends, he wanted to use me ill in the street; I took him to a public house, and treated him with two pints of beer, he seemed to be good-natured then, and would not offer to use me ill; I treated him with the beer thinking to get rid of him; when I came out of the public house, just at the corner facing <placeName id="t17760911-58-crimeloc292">Brownlow-street</placeName>

               <p>What time do you suppose it might be when you came out of the house? - The watchman was just crying half after eleven o'clock; he swore a great oath, that as he could not have his ends of me, he would have my things.</p>
               <p>What did he knock you down with? - His fist; I fell upon my left side; he took my hat, a sattin cloak, a striped lawn apron, and two handkerchiefs, one was about my head, and the other about my neck; when I recovered myself, he was gone.</p>
               <p>Did the blow take away your senses? - Yes; I was not sensible for a few minutes, he carried my things off, I never saw any more of them.</p>
               <p>Did he take away any money from you? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you any money? - Yes; about eighteen pence in silver and three pence halfpenny in my pocket at the time, which he did not take.</p>
               <p>Did he demand any money of you? - He did not.</p>
               <p>When you treated him with the two pints of beer, did not he see that you had money? - I took out some halfpence to pay for them.</p>
               <p>Did you take out your silver with your halfpence? - I cannot justly say; I went home.</p>
               <p>Did you know where the prisoner lodged? - No; this happened on the 4th of June, which was a Tuesday, and I did not know till the Sunday following; I went to the justices on Monday, when I found where to get him.</p>
               <p>Where did he lodge? - Some where about St. Giles's; I went up Tottenham-court Road and found where he worked, and brought an officer with me to take him; I found out where he resorted on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>When was he taken up? - On the 28th of July.</p>
               <p>Have you ever recovered your things since? - No, none of them; he sent me a letter that he would pay me so much a week for them, since he has been in hold.</p>

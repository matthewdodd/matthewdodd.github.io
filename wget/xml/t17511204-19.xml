When I came to him, he put his hand into his great coat, he said, your money sir; said I, you surprize me very much, to ask me for my money at this time of the day, in so publick a road; I made no offer to give it him, I believe he was confounded a little, there was a pause about a minute, then he put his hand into his great coat again; and said, Come sir, don't dally. I still made no offer to give it him, but was thinking to myself whether I should or should not. Then he said, Sir, I am in great distress, give me any thing you can spare. Then I took off my glove and put my hand in my pocket, and was going to give him some money, but had a thought to count it, which was 6 s. and gave it him. I had my watch in my pocket, the chain hung out, he never ask'd for that; but said, thank ye sir; I said, much good may do you; and at that time I had no thoughts of going after him: I recollected I had seen some people as I came, I rode back, knowing if I gave the alarm he must be taken; he went off towards Uxbridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was you going?</p>
               <p>Ansell. I was going towards London. I rode and alarmed the people before he had robbed me five minutes; they were at the Old Hat. Then I believe the prisoner was out of sight. Some of the company galloped away without knowing who they were to go after; but I described the Prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175112040011"></xptr> riding a brown or bay horse, at the time he might be about half a mile from me, to some of them. When I came to Hanwell-Heath, I observed them all to turn out of the road towards Brentford. I turn'd short to go a nearer way. And believe I was within 3 or 400 yards of him when taken, but it was on an elbow, so that I could not see him. When I came up, Mr. Knevett was at the side of him, he was also surrounded by three or four horsemen more, I don't know them all, one was

               <p>Q. Was there no arms?</p>
               <p>Ansell. There was not, he presented none to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you under any surprize or apprehension of danger when you gave him your money?</p>
               <p>Ansell. I was, or I had not given him any money. I should not have given it him out of charity.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was taken, what did he say for himself?</p>
               <p>Ansell. He seemed very penitent, and declared it to be his first offence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing in his hand?</p>

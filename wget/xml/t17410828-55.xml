            . Last wednesday was sevennight about 9 or 10 o'clock at night, the Prosecutor brought me a warrant against the Prisoner for robbing him of his watch, and gave me notice of a house where she had left it for some money. I went down to this house, and made a little noise, and in a very little time the woman of the house brought me the watch, and said she had lent some money on it, but hoped she should not come into any trouble about it. As to the Prisoner, I gave my watchmen orders to take her into custody if they met her, and I was call'd up about 3 in the morning to take charge of her, and she confess'd the fact before the Justice.</p>

            . An Irish woman brought me this watch, and desir'd me to buy it. I was unwilling to have any thing to say to it without seeing the owner of it, and so she brought the Prisoner, and I lent her some money upon it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going to see for my husband, and the Prosecutor went with me to my lodging. He had no money, and I would not give him my company without, so he gave me his watch to get some money. <rs id="t17410828-55-verdict267" type="verdictDescription">

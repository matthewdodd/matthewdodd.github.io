I live at 4, Champion Place, Upper Clapton—about 11.45, on the night of 1st December, I went to bed after seeing everything fastened safely up—about 2.15 a.m. I was aroused by the springing of a rattle—I opened my window, went down, and admitted Policeman 290—I accompanied him to the back garden—I saw the staircase window open as I went down, and the glass broken—it was closed when I went to bed—the parlour window had been closed with a catch—I found it wide open, and the parlour in confusion—the drawers had been pulled open, and left so—a large drawer which was supposed to contain plate was open, and the con-tents strewed about—I afterwards saw Hankin in custody, wearing a scarf of mine which I missed—these are my boots.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they all dressed in soldiers habits? - A. This man had a white frock on.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you suppose this is the man that robbed you? - A. Because it was a light night, and I could see all their persons very plain; I have had them in my eye ever since; I am sure he is one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before? - A. Not before that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you took such observation of them, that you are sure he is the person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the robbery did you see the prisoner? - A. I believe about a month after; I saw him in a hackney-coach; I knew him there, before I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made such observation before you were alarmed, as to be able to know him again? - A. Not before I was alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no suspicion then that you were going to be robbed? - A. Yes, I had; I did not like the looks of the men, and I took very great notice of them; it was the longest day, and a very remarkable day; the man's life is a very great object, and therefore I am very clear of what I say; when this man took hold of my hand, I stood sideways, and saw every motion of him as plain as I see you now.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your watch ever found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. How long did this transaction take? - A. They were with me I dare say five minutes, or six minutes, as nigh as I can recollect; I begged of them not to hurt to me, for they had got all I had.</p>

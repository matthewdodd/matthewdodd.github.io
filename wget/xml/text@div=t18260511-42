On the 5th of May I dined out, and returned in a hackney-coach, which the prisoner drove: on getting to the coffee-house he demanded 12s. - I took 12s. from my purse, intending to pay it, but desired the witness, Thomas, who was by, to ask him the reason of so extraordinary a demand. I left my purse on the bar-counter while I turned round for an answer, keeping the 12s. in my hand - I left Thomas at the bar, to speak to him about it, and while Thomas was turning to me with his answer, I was surprised at seeing the prisoner moving off without his fare - I had six new bright sovereigns, and about 7s. in silver, in my purse; the prisoner has never demanded his fare of me. I dropped the 12s. into my pocket, being tired, and went up stairs. I did not miss my purse till morning not thinking of it. I applied to Read, who apprehended the prisoner the very next day, at six or seven o'clock in the afternoon - he was then dressed entirely in new clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. At what time did you come home? A. About eleven o'clock. I was sober, and as capable of doing business as I am now - I had taken 12s. out of the purse, and put it on the barcounter; I was much fatigned, but perfectly sober; I saw nobody take it. Thomas and the bar-maid were at the bar. The prisoner was close to the counter, leaning over it - it is about eighteen inches wide.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. Are you sure you did not take the purse up yourself? A. I am.</p>

            . I am a clerk. I was at Oliver's coffee-house on the night of the 5th - the prisoner came into the house after the prosecutor; there was an altercation about the fare; the prosecutor stood with his purse on the bar-counter, and the prisoner on the other side; when I found Mr. Owen so deaf that the prisoner could not make him hear. I spoke to him. The prisoner was leaning on the bar<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110030"></xptr>quite close to the purse; he demanded 12s. - Mr. Owen wanted to know the distance he had driven - there was an altercation, and all on a sudden the prisoner left, without receiving his fare.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you make any observation to Mr. Owen about his purse after the prisoner was gone? - A. No; I did not miss it at the time. Owen is my uncle - I had rode with him in the coach.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Mr. Owen did not refuse to pay? A. No. The prisoner muttered something when he went out.</p>

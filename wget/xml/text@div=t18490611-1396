                  </hi>. I live in Swan-street, Dover-road, and am in partnership with Judab Joseph and another; we are furriers—John Boots was in our service when he was taken, and Joseph had been, but was not then—on 26th May, 1 was awoke by my servant, between six and seven o'clock in the morning—I went down and saw the policeman Wild—from what he said I went to my warehouse; the door was not fastened—I went to the station, and saw a bag of rabbits' down, which I have no doubt was ours—our warehouse contained down of that description—I have no doubt that the bag was ours—John Boots did not sleep on the premises—it was his duty to see that the warehouse was safe at night, and to bring the keys to our counting-house, which he did—he had no right whatever to be there at six in the morning—eight was his time.</p>

I was watching thsee premises in Union-yard on 26th May—I concealed myself in a cab which stood there without a horse—I was able to see the premises—I had been there three or four minutes when I heard some persons talking—I saw the prisoners talking together about five or ten minutes before five—John then got up some crates, and got into the warehouse—he pitched out a bag of down, and jumped upon</p>

               <p>it—he went back to where Joseph was, and said something, and Joseph came I and looked in the cab—I took them both towards the station—John slipped his jacket and ran, I ran and took him—Joseph had been in a position where he must have seen all that was going on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Joseph Boots. Q.</hi> Did you see me near the premises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in conversation with your brother—I had seen you two or three minutes before you came to the cab.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I went to speak to my brother, and he said, "There is some one in the cab." I went, and there was you, with a prostitute; the female came out at one door, and you at the other, and her petticoats were all up, <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You may say so, but it was not so—I admit there was a female with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">John Boots. Q.</hi> How came you with your belt off, and your cape off, and your rattle out of your pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is my business, I expected to have to take you both, and was prepared for you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On 26th May, at five in the morning, my brother Joseph came to Union-yard, where I reside, to accompany me to the van office, near the Compter, expecting that morning to receive a parcel from my sister, who resides at High Wycomb, Buckinghamshire, agreeably to a promise made to me by her a week previously; as soon as my brother Joseph had aroused me, he proceeded to the top of the yard into Cole-street, which is about thirty yards from my dwelling; as soon as I had dressed myself, I went to my master's stable and loft, to see all things were safe, as is usually my practice the first thing in the morning: on arriving there I ascended the loft, and having on the previous day, Friday, the 25th May, left a bag of rabbit-down below in the yard, I endeavoured to make room for it in the loft, but in so doing, had the misfortune to knock down another bag. I then descended from the loft, for the purpose of fetching my brother to my assistance, whom I found still waiting for me in the road. We returned together; and as we passed down the yard, we perceived a cab standing in the yard, which had arrived there about half an hour previously; perceiving a tremulous motion from the same, our curiosity was excited, and I made a remark, I did not care who was there, I would look in, when to my surprise I found a policeman having connexion with a female; he jumped out of the further door, the female endeavoured to escape by the door at which my brother and myself stood, which prevented her egress for a short time; her person was then exposed, and her dress in a disordered state; the policeman then rushed round the back of the cab, and caught hold of me, upon which I remonstrated; he then stated he had been watching me all night, and said he should take me into custody, and my brother also, and proceeded with us to the station-house. On my way I requested the policeman to go with me and call my master, which he refused; I then endeavoured to escape from him, and <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to my master myself, which the policeman and another prevented. The policeman states he was watching me all night; if so, it could not be in the cab, and his companion, it appears, was quite sufficient to draw off his attention. The facts are simply these, I detected him, and not he me, in the neglect of his duty, and in a criminal act, for I make no doubt, upon inquiry he will be found to be a married man, probably with a family, and in order to save the publicity of the case, and himself probably reported, he had no other alternative left than to trump up the charge against me to save himself. I have lived seven years with my present masters, and have not even so much as been suspected of a robbery, and feel proud in assuring this Court I am both</p>

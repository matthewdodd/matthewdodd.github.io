I am a milkman, of Highfield Road, Kensington—on 12th March I saw the prisoners in Slaidbourn Street, and Simmonds asked me to buy a hearthrug, as he had a friend who had one to sell—Evans was not quite close to him, and I don't know whether he could hear what was said—he made an appointment to show me the rug, and after serving my customers I went to Simmonds' house, and saw him and Evans there in a back room on the first-floor, an empty room—they produced the rug, and asked me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I offered 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they said "Will you make it 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?"—I said "No!"—I gave them 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and brought it away—I gave the money to Evans.</p>

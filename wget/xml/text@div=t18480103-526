                  </hi>. I am a Greenwich pensioner. On 29th Dec. I met the prisoner at the Royal Hospital public-house at Greenwich—I told him I wanted a bed—he said he would get me a respected bed—I went with him to an eating-house—there was another college man with him, and two females—I proposed paying for five plates of soup, but I could not—I put my hand in my pocket to get my money and missed my purse—it was safe when I left the Royal Hospital public-house—we had walked from there to</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, R</hi> 2.) Between eleven ad twelve o'clock on the night of 29th Dec., I heard an altercation between the prosecutor and the prisoner—I went in, and asked what was the matter—the prosecutor said he had been robbed by the prisoner—a policeman was there, and the prisoner was showing the policeman his cap, and that he had got nothing about him—I took the cap, and felt this purse round the edge of it—I sent the prisoner to the station, and found in his left shoe this half-sovereign, and in his right shoe these two half-crowas.</p>

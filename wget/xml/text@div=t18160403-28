            . I live at No. 1, Stone-cutter-street. On the 26th of December, the prisoner brought part of the property to my house; the part which Dickins found. I sent to Bow-street for Dickins, Two other men came with the prisoner; it was about half past eight o'clock when they came, and Scott requested me to leave them until the following morning. He did not come the next morning; and upon that, I gave information to Dickins.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been in the habit of going to Roberts's house as an acquaintance, and unfortunately he has conceived a jealousy against me about his wife. I have been in a respectable situation in life, and am sorry to be placed in this situation. Mr. Dickins has told Roberts there is a reward, and that is what I am prosecuted for. I can prove I never brought any bundle on the 26th of December.</p>

            . I was in the employment of Mr. Roberts, about Christmas; I have seen the prisoner at the bar at his house three or four times. I was there on the day after Christmas Day, and the prisoner never brought a bundle there. Mr. Roberts bid me, whenever I went to shave any where, if I could see any thing, to take it, and he would buy it.</p>

               <p>George Roberts. That boy was not of a good character; he is a notorious thief; he was convicted a short time ago, and if he is now asked how he gets his living, if he tells the truth, he must say by thieving. I never sent him out to shave any one but once.</p>

               <p>COURT. To Samuel Howsham. Were you convicted before - A. Yes, my lord.</p>

               <p>George Roberts. Yes, and he was flogged every morning in Bridewell.</p>

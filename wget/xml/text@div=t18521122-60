                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Queen-street, Tower<lb></lb>hill. On 22nd Nov. I went to bed about half past 11 o'clock—I and my wife went to bed together—we were the last persons up in the house—the house was then safe—the back parlour window was shut up, but I will not say whether the catch was fast or not—about half past four in the morning I and ray wife were awoke—I laid a little longer—I then put my arm round towards my drawers, and I put my hand on a man's arm—I seized hold of him, and said, "I have got a thief!" and I told my wife to get a light—the man got from my grasp, and got under the bed—it was dark all this time—my wife got a light, and the first sight I saw was the prisoner lying all his length under the bed—I armed myself with the poker, and got under the bed and seized him—I held him till my child got a policeman—when I first laid hold of the prisoner he was at the drawer—I felt the drawer open—I reached</p>

               <p>Does the person who lets out the lodgings, live in the house? - No, he keeps a shop at the end of the court; he lets out the house in tenements.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. What time these things were taken, you do not not know? - No.</p>
               <p>You never found any thing but this gown? - No; the prisoner had been at my apartments four times.</p>
               <p>Any body might see he had a bundle? - Yes; I had undoubtedly a strong suspicion of him, seeing him lay in the passage; when I came out in the morning, at half past three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to him then? - No; sometimes people are locked out.</p>
               <p>Did you tell any body that you saw this man there? - Yes, I told my husband, before I knew the things were gone; I said, that young man will not hurt us, he is some young man locked out of his apartment.</p>

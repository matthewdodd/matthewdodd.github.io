            . I live at Paddington. On the 26th of July I went round to several toll-gates to collect the money which had been received that day; between six and seven o'clock in the evening I was at <placeName id="t18190915-179-crimeloc961">Kilburn-gate</placeName>

I stood against the gatepost, they came through the gate, and paid the toll, Henley put up his stick, struck me, and cut my hat and head, said I should not transport another man, and swore at me. He stunned me - my head bled. He and all the party jumped out of the cart, he seized me by the throat, and swore he would have my bi - dy life. I had 322 l. in my pocket-book. I kept my hand on it, and resisted. They rushed on me, one laid hold of my watch, and tried to get it out, but did not succeed. Henley held me. They had an instrument with which they cut my two fingers, as I held my pocket-book; several people came to my assistance. They all got into the cart and rode off. I am not certain that Harper was one of them.</p>

            . I am a surveyor, and live at Paddington. On the 26th of July I was coming from a public-house, I was about forty yards from the turnpike, when I heard a noise, and saw Henley strike Kelly over the head, with both hands, as hard as he could; Kelly took a whip from a carter, and returned the blow. Henley jumped out of the cart, and said,</p>
               <p>"I will serve you out for the old iron rig." He had convicted a person of stealing iron last Sessions. Henley began to beat him, the rest got out of the cart, and a scuffle ensued. I pulled Kelly from them, and kept them off - his head was hurt, and his hat cut; his two fingers were cut, and bled. I begged of them to go away, and let the passengers go through - for near fifty coaches and carts were kept from passing; they went away. I do not know whether Harper was one of them.</p>

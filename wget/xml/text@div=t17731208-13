            . On Sunday the 6th of June last I saw Mr. Johnston, the prisoner, in the forenoon, at the Grecian coffee-house in Devereux-court; he told me he had been disappointed in a bill he expected to have received money for, drawn by some banker, and accepted I think by Lord Townshend; that he had given this bill to some person in the city to get discounted, and the person would not return it him, to remedy which, he said he had applied to his mother in Ireland, who had sent him a bill for 22 l. 10 s. which bill he said he had given to a Mr. Hunt, his taylor, in order to pay him for a suit of clothes he had of him, and to receive the balance in cash; he asked me if I would walk with him to the taylor's, who lived in a court in Holborn; I went with him; I waited at the door till he came out; he said the taylor had not got the remainder of the cash, but that he would call at the Grecian in half an hour with the balance, after deducting five guineas for the clothes; we went to the Grecian coffee-house and called for something; the taylor did not come till about an hour after, which was I believe between one and two o'clock; Mr. Johnston immediately quitted me, and went with the taylor to another box; when the taylor went out, Johnston came to me and said the taylor was gone to try another friend to get cash for the bill, and would be back in ten minutes; Mr. Johnston and I went out of the coffee-house; he said he would go to the taylor and get the bill back, and requested I would get cash for it; he went to the taylor and I went to a steak house; he returned between a quarter and half an hour after to me at the chop house Wych-street, with a bill; I had not the cash, and as it was a Sunday I thought he could not get the cash of the merchant on whom it was drawn; I went to Mr. Cappock; he gave me cash for it; he remained in the chop house; I received of Mr. Cappock twenty one guineas, a six-and-nine-pence, two shillings, and threepence in copper, and I left the bill with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Johnston with you at that time?</p>
               <p>Howly. No. I went back to the steak house and gave Mr. Johnston the cash. On the Thursday following I was in the city; I called at No. 4, in New Broad-street, where the bill is specified to be payable, and enquired after Mr. Knox; I could find no such person; I went to Old Broad-street; I could find no such person there; I went to a coffee house, and looked over the merchants list; I found there was a Knox and Mercer in Crosby-square; I went there; Mr. Mercer was within; I asked him if he had any correspondence with Mr. Bevan's house at Dublin; he answered, no.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Mercer here?</p>
               <p>Howly. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then that is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Howly. I went back and enquired at Mr. Johnston's lodgings; I found he had given orders that he should be denied to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Johnston lodge?</p>
               <p>Howly. In Devereux court; he was not at home I believe. I went to the Grecian coffee-house about two o'clock; there I saw Mr. Cappock; he told me it was a forgery. (The bill<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177312080010"></xptr> produced by Mr. Cappock.) This is the bill I had of Johnston; it is just the same except No. 4; I told Mr. Cappock, agreeable to Mr. Johnston's information, that the parties lived there upon whom it was drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner write the name

               <p>Prisoner. He has mentioned Lord Townshend's name; I never said that; it was Lord Townshend's agent; he only heard that insinuated at my lodgings; he breakfasted and supped with me that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you from Ireland?</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner?</p>

               <p>Cappock. Yes; when I received it Mr. Howly told me Knox and Co. whom the bill is drawn upon, lived at No. 4 in New Broad-street; I looked over the bill at night, and observed it appeared to me that the bill, the indorsement, and the acceptance, were all the writing of one person; I told my man to go next day and enquire about it; he returned and told me he could not find any such person as Knox and Co. Mr. Howly came to my house on Tuesday; I told him I thought it a bad bill, and I chose to detain him till I could find Johnston.</p>

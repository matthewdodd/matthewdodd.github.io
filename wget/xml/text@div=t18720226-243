                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 169). On Thursday morning, 15th February, I was with Downes, in Threadneedle Street, and saw the prisoners—I knew them, and we watched them—they went into the crowd, and Morris and McCarthy pushed against the crowd at the Stereoscopic Com<lb></lb>pany's window—Larney was pushing about in a very mysterious manner, and then they followed a lady who was carrying a reticule—I saw Morris with his right hand under his left arm, and as soon as he went from her side, I saw her reticule hanging open, and I spoke to her—we followed them from about 11.18 till 1 o'clock, and saw Morris make several attempts to pick ladies' pockets, and to open several reticules—McCarthy was always behind Morris, at the back of the ladies, and Larney was either in front of them, so as to impede their progress, or standing on the kerb-stone—we followed them to Princes Street—two ladies were waiting by the Bank of England for an omnibus—Morris and McCarthy pushed themselves in front of the ladies, and Larney stood on the kerb-stone, watching for the police—we were in plain clothes—Morris put his hand behind him, and one of the ladies observed him and moved away—I then saw that the lady's reticule was open—she fastened it up again—an omnibus came up, and stopped; and as soon as the ladies moved towards it, the three prisoners pushed them selves in front of them—Morris put his right hand under his left arm, and as soon as they got past the ladies, they all ran separately into Threadneedle Street—we pursued them through several streets into Lombard Street, where I saw Morris apparently looking at something in his hand—I saw him give something to Larney—he then put something into his left-hand trowsers pocket—they ran into Gracechurch Street, where we got assistance, took the three into custody, and searched them on the spot—I found in Morris's left-hand trowsers pocket 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, also this purse—we took them to the Station—I had seen them all three together more than once before—the lady's name is Scott.</p>

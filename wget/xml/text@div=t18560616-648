               <p>fins at one end of the barge, and the remainder at the other end—Middleton assisted me in the loading; and when I put those bundles into one end Middleton covered them over with a tarpaulin, the barge was swung round, and then the remainder were put into the other end—there were ninety-five bundles altogether—this whalebone (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is similar to it—it has a peculiar mark on it, A in a diamond—it was cleared out about 4 or 5 o'clock—lighters are not always swung round; there was room at the end we began at, to have put all the rest of the whalebone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, living at No. 4, Wharf-plan, Canning-town. On Tuesday, 3rd June, I was on the pier in the neighbour-hood of the East India Docks, from 9 o'clock till about half-past—Fry, who I knew before, came out of a barge which was lying alongside the per loaded—he asked me if I had got anything to do, and I told him "No"—he asked me if I would go and fetch the punt' <hi rend="italic">Rover,</hi> and take it to Mr. Stotherd's road, at Wapping—he said that the key was <hi rend="italic">up her head</hi>—I was to have 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but from what afterwards came to my knowledge, I did not take it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THOMPSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in work at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I had nothing to do—I have been on job work for Mr. Mare for two years, when he has anything to do—I first heard of this robbery on Tuesday, the 3rd, when I was on the steam-boat which was to take me to the Victoria Dock—there is a landing-place there; there is one on the north side of the river, it is recently opened—I landed on the lighter, alongside the Victoria Dock, but the punt was not there—I started by the steam-boat about 5 or 10 minutes after the conversation, which was on Brunswick Pier, Blackwall—I went directly, and did not find the punt.</p>

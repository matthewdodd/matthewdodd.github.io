                  </hi>. I am timekeeper to the Midland Railway Company, at Falcoln Yard—on 2nd September, in consequence of what Parker said, I went to the prisoner, who was in the yard, employed as a ran guard to look after the goods, by Hawkins, a contractor—I said to the prisoner "Leave the yard, and do not attempt to re-enter it; if you do I shall have to give you in custody of the police"—he did not answer, but looked at me in a surly manner, and looked towards the gateway—he had some bread and cheese in his left hand, and an open pocket-knife in his right—as I followed him to the gateway Parker said "Can I not look him up for his abuse of me?"—I said "No, but you can summons him"—I saw that the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187104030028"></xptr>
               <p>had not left the premises, and spoke to him sharply, and said "Why don't you go?"—he looked at me in a surly manner and replied "I will go pre<lb></lb>sently"—I put my right hand and pushed him by his neck—I had to push him about four feet to push him clear of the gateway—as soon as he recovered his balance he put his bread and cheese into his pocket, and came towards me to attack me—I stepped back into the gateway and said "If you come any of your nonsense with me I will punch your head"—he answered "You punch my head?"—I said "Yes"—he made a swinging blow at my chest which missed me, and I struck him with my fist on the side of his head—he then struck me, and I struck him again on his shoulder—he then struck me on the muscle of my right arm, and I felt myself injured, and saw blood running down from my fingers' ends—I said "Good God, I am stabbed!"—he shut up the knife, put it in his coat pocket, and ran away—I was taken to the hospital—I remained there five weeks, and have been two weeks ill at my own home—I have to act as a messenger, as I can do nothing else—I still feel pain.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MORTEN</hi>. The prisoner and Parker both worked for the same contractor, but not in the same van—the prisoner was moving as if he was going; he was in the gateway when I went up to him, he had only about four feet to clear it when I pushed him—I used sufficient force to push him out at the gateway, and he just put his hand on a post to steady himself—I did not push him as hard as I could, or he would have gone down altogether—it is not a fact that if he had not touched the post he would have fallen—I then saw by his looks that he was going to attack me—he did not hold up the knife; I wish I had seen it—I struck him first—he struck me once, and I struck him twice in self defence—I stepped back and avoided his first blow.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a van in the yard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the prisoner was properly in the yard—I was turning him out of the yard in which he pro<lb></lb>perly was, because a porter told me something—he had a right to be there, and was supposed to be there in the discharge of his duty—I did not see him do any wrong, but the man told me the boy had threatened to strike him—I ordered him to leave the yard because I had reason to believe there was going to be a breach of the peace—it is part of my duty as time keeper to keep order in the yard—I was afraid there would be further disturbance, and I thought if the lad kept outside till the van came out there would be no disturbance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, in the employ of Messrs. Hawkins, railway carriers—on the 2nd September I was at Falcon Yard and saw the prisoner there, I did not know him before—Mr. Gardner ordered me to draw up for a load, and the prisoner drew his van round in the way, and put his horses on top of my feet—I said "Gently, young man"—he said "Get out of the way, you old b—r"—I said "Look here, my lad, I do not want such language used to me, I don't use it in the Company's service, and if you use such language to me I will have you turned out of the yard," and I complained to Mr. Nicholls—no blows passed between us—the prisoner was not driving the van, he was conducting it.</p>

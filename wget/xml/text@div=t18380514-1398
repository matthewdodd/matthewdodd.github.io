I have known the prisoner, Smith, from a child—she was frequently backwards and forwards at my house—her mother worked for us fourteen years, and we were in the habit of receiving her at our house, and getting her situations, but we refused, ten or eleven months ago, to receive her any more—on the night of Good Friday, I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock—the street-door was left on the latch-key, so that the lodgers could let themselves in with a key—it cannot be opened without a key—I locked the shop-door and the pass<lb></lb>age, and took the key out—about half-past four o'clock next morning, I was called by the police—I missed the key of the shop-door from the bed-room—I came down stain, and found the street-door open, and the door leading from the passage to the shop—the key I had taken up stain was in the door, which was open—I went into the parlour, and found the doors of a book-case open, and missed from there a silver watch, a deal-box con<lb></lb>taining thirty-three silver spoons, some gold rings, and an opera-glass—I usually kept that box up stairs, but omitted to take it up that night.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 27th of August, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoners in the City-road, near the bridge - Smith had this parcel on his shoulder, and Jones was a little behind him; I followed them some distance, and Smith gave Jones the parcel - they went to Mr. Pearces' shop, a plumber, in Plumber's-row, and Jones threw the lead into the scale; Mr. Pearce came into the shop - I told him I suspected it was stolen; Jones said it was not, that he had brought it from his own house in Golden-lane, and it was his own - I said I had seen them come in a very contrary direction, and asked if they had not brought it from the back of Mr. Rhodes'; they denied it- I asked Mr. Pearce to assist me in taking them to the station; in going along Smith struck Mr. Pearce, pushed him down, and attempted to escape, but we secured them- at the station-house Jones said they had picked the lead up, but they thought it was no harm; I found some lead had been taken from a gutter in one of the houses at the back of Mr. Rhodes', and I found the lead which the prisoners had, fitted the gutter exactly - the nail holes all matched, and it exactly corresponded where it was cut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What did Jones say when he got to the shop? A. He said he had brought some lead, and that he wanted some glass for it; the lead had been taken from the top of a kitchen adjoining a house - Jones said they picked it up in a field; a boy, who came and swore he saw the prisoners pick up the lead in a field, is not here - he gave evidence at the office against the prisoners.</p>

            . I am a lead-merchant and glasscutter - I live in Plumbers'-row, The prisoners brought this lead to my house on the 27th of August; one of them put it into the scale - my son was in the shop; when I came out the officer asked me to assist in taking the prisoners - I was knocked down in going along, and a staff, which I carry in my pocket, as a warrant-officer to the Commissioners of Sewers, was bruised; I was dragged in the mud for a considerable distance.</p>

            . I know Mr. James Rhodes. The officer called, and showed me some lead; I went to one of Mr. Rhodes' houses, and the lead fitted the gutter exactly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When had you seen it safe? A. Not since it was put up, which is three years ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are the houses inhabited? A. No - this lead was on a kitchen which leans against the house; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080094"></xptr>lead being off would have let the rain in - I had been in the house three days before, and there was not any appearance of rain coming in.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. We went down by the side of the New-river, and saw this lead laying among the grass, in a field - I took it up, and we went to a shop; a boy saw us find it.</p>

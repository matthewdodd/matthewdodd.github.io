                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 602). On 13th February, about twenty minutes past four o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Cannon Street, carrying a basket—I stopped him, and asked what he had there—he said, "Some mussels"—I looked and found it was so—I said, "What have you got about you?"—he said, "Nothing"—I felt his pockets and said, "There is something very heavy here"—he said, "It is only my coffee can"—I drew it out (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it fits round the leg or round the chest—I said, "What have you got in it?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "It is very heavy"—I drew the cork, smelt it, and said, "It is wine"—I took him to the station, and found a smaller tin in his breast pocket, made to fit, and also containing port wine—the inspector asked him if the tins belonged to him—he burst into tears, and said, "No, they were given me by somebody else, at the place; I wish I had never brought them away"—he gave his address—I went there and found in a cupboard two bottles of port wine, and four sample bottles, similar to those which are used in Messrs. Field's warehouse.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are they very common bottles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a great deal of wine of the same kind comes over, and is sold by the different wine merchants—I believe it is very difficult to judge of wine—I know that his wife is in delicate health—he has three children.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Kearns, Major, and Field, wharfingers, of Thames Street—the prisoner has been in their employ as wine cooper about three months—we had some port wine in a cellar on our premises where the prisoner was working—he left about a quarter-past four o'clock—I have tasted the wine in these tins; it corresponds with the bulk in our cellar, and I believe it to be ours—the prisoner had no authority to take it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is there plenty of port wine in London? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I missed no wine, because half a gallon would make no difference in a large cask.</p>

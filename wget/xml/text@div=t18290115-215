               <p>JESSE FULLER. I am a constable of Brentford. On Christmas day I went to Mr. Trimmer's, at nine or ten o'clock at night; I found the prisoner there; Wyatt went up stairs, and found these articles there; I then charged the prisoner with them - she cried, and said it was all her husband's fault.</p>

            . I was with Fuller. I went up to the bed-room, and searched a box at the foot of the bed; I found these articles - there was another box in the room, but it did not belong to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Were you a witness at the trial on Thursday? A. Yes; the things for which the prisoner was tried then were found at the same time; she was acquitted.</p>

            . I live at Kingsbury. On Christmas night the prisoner was in my service: the officer came, and apprehended her husband that night; I went with him to the room where the prisoner and another female servant slept - the prisoner's box was searched, and the articles here produced found in it; I know these articles to be my husband's - it is our custom to have bells hung to the shutters; I do not hang them - on Christmas-night the man was taken, and I had all the servants' boxes searched.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Had you missed these things? A. No. not till the box was searched; the prisoner's husband had lived in the house before - we did not know at that time that they were married; he had been discharged on the 9th of September, and had been forbidden the house; but when my husband heard they were married he gave him leave to come, and he came once or twice; the box was not locked - her husband may have gone into the room and she not have known it; he may have visited the house unknown to me.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. At the time her husband was in your house, did he sleep there? A. No; he had no business in the bed-room of any of the female servants.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know how this box came to be searched? A. I believe she was asked if she had any objection to have it searched - that was in consequence of her husband being taken; I think I had seen this buckle about the end of September.</p>

            . I came into Mr. Trimmer's service on the 8th of July; I knew the prisoner, but did not learn that she was married till about a fortnight or three weeks before Mrs. Trimmer knew it; there were no other servants but Summerfield and myself; I did not place any of these articles in her box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you tell that she was married? A. No; I persuaded her to tell her mistress herself - she did not, but Mrs. Trimmer asked her, and she told her; her husband might have gone into her room, and I not know it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My fellow-servants all knew that I was married - my husband came to the house, and slept with me on the night of the Sydenham ball; all the servants knew it - my master was out.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you not tell my friend that you slept with her every night? A. I said so, but I did not sleep with her every night, nor in the same room every night: I slept in the house with her.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you able to say what room they slept in that night? A. If he slept in the house, he slept in Mr. Trimmer's bed; I did not see him on the premises, nor see her in bed.</p>

I saw two gold pins of mine on the corner of the drawers in my room, at ten minutes before nine o'clock—I then went to business—I went home in about twenty minutes, and the pins were gone—here is one of them now produced—it is mine, and is one of those that were safe when I went out, and missed when I came back.</p>

               <p>room, to go to business—when I got on the landing I looked into the back room where the prosecutor sleeps, and I saw Moody there—she had nothing to do with the house—I asked her what she wanted, and she said, "Mrs. Kelly, a dress<lb></lb>maker"—(there was no Mrs. Kelly lived in the house)—I asked her who sent her there—she said she came from a Jewess in Clare<lb></lb>market—I said I would see to that, for I believed she was there on a wrong purpose—I went with her part of the way, as far as Wild<lb></lb>passage, and then I thought I had better take her to the station—the thought then came across my mind that the prosecutor's two pins might have been left at the corner of the drawers in his room, where he generally leaves them—I went to the shop to him, and he returned home and missed them.</p>

I stood in the front part of the office at Bow-street, where the remanded cases come out of the van, and I saw Moody hand some<lb></lb>thing to Prendergast, who was there waiting, before the prisoners came in the van—Moody beckoned Prendergast, and handed something to her, and the moment she handed something to her I laid hold of her hand, and called Pocock, we moved the other prisoners, and this piece of paper, with this pin in it, was dropped on the floor by Prendergast.</p>

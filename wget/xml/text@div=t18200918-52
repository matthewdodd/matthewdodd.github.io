This was Wednesday, I think. He said he kept the note in his possession till he offered it for the oysters. He distinctly stated he did not know the person's name who gave it to him, nor where he lived, but it was in the neighbourhood of Long-lane. I asked where he sold oysters, he said no where particularly. I said,</p>

             re-examined. Griffiths was present with me when the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"That is my master, and the man who paid me the note" - I should think he must have heard it. Griffiths said he knew nothing of him.</p>
               <p>JURY to BAKER. Q. Did the man remain with you from the time you received the note, until Holden came up - A. Yes. The note remained in my possession until gave it to him. The vessels were alongside each other.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman D</hi> 124.) On Wednesday morning, the 2nd of June, about a quarter-past four o'clock, I was on duty in Adam-street, Marylebone, and saw the prisoner put her head outside of the door of No. 40—she looked round, looked on each side, till she saw me, and directly with-drew her head, and closed the door—in consequence of this, I watched the house till about a quarter to five—I then saw the prisoner coming out with two large bundles, one under each arm—she merely came outside the door, I suppose not half-a-yard, before she saw the shine of the leather at the top of my bat, as I was watching round the corner on the opposite side of the road, from fifteen to twenty yards from the door—on seeing me, the prisoner</p>

               <p>directly threw the bundles behind her into the passage, went in, and closed the door—I waited a few minutes, then went over to the door, tried it, and found it fast—I continued to watch the house till saw the door open about an inch or an inch and a half—that was about a quarter-past five—I put my fingers inside, and tried to open it, but found some one pushing against me—I then put my shoulder to the door, forced it open, and saw the prisoner standing behind it, with the two bundles by her side—I said, "Do those bundles belong to you?"—she said, "Yes, they do"—I said, "Had you been an honest woman you would have taken one of those <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> in the street, and not have watched till the policeman was out of sight"—there was a cab-stand fifteen or twenty yards from the house—she did not make any answer to that—I said, "Did you," or "have you lived in the house?"—she said, "Yes, I have been living with an old lady on the first-floor, up stairs"—I said, "I must trouble you to show me this old lady up stairs"—she said, "You can go, and I will wait here"—I said, "Certainly not, I shall not part with you, nor yet the bundles, until I have seen the old lady"—she went me up about four stairs, then suddenly turned—round, and said, "I suppose it is no use telling you a lie?"—I said, "No, nor a thousand will not satisfy me until I see the old lady"—she said, "The truth is, I have been living with the old lady in the front kitchen, down stairs"—I said, "We will go down stairs and see the old lady"—she was very unwilling to go down—I insisted on her going down with me, and she went down—I went to the door of the front kitchen—on going down she said, "It is of no use for you to knock, for she is as deaf as a stone"—I knocked repeatedly with<lb></lb>out receiving an answer—I said to the prisoner, "Is there not a window to this kitchen?"—she said, "Yes, in the front area"—I went into the front area—the prisoner went with me, after a good deal of hesitation, I took hold of her by the arm—I looked through the window of the kitchen—there was no shutter to the window—I found the kitchen quite empty, and said to the prisoner, "This is the second falsehood you have told me, when are we coming to the truth?"—she made no answer to that—I then went towards the back yards—the prisoner offered me half-a-crown, and said, "This will do to get you something to drink, or I have a crown; or, I think I have 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said, "This looks blacker still"—I had hold of her at the time, and said I should not part with her till I had seen the lady in the front shop up stairs—I said that, because I suspected something was wrong, by her offering me the money—she said she wanted to get away without paying her rent—she gave me no other reason for offering me money—I then tried the back kitchen door with my shoulder, and heard the lock make a noise as if the door was coming open—the prisoner directly turned round and said, "You have come to the truth; do not say I did it, for I have not seen her since last night"—I felt in the keyhole of the door, and not finding the key I said, "This looks very suspicious," I directly took the prisoner up stairs to the door of the shop, which is on the ground-floor, knocked, and asked to be admitted—there was a female in the room who declined to admit me, as she was undressed—I asked her if she knew the party I had outside—I asked her whether she knew her by her voice, and I asked the prisoner to speak—I believe the words she said were, "It is me, Miss Smallbone," on that Miss Smallbone said, "It is Mrs. Hunt she is living with, an old lady in the back kitchen down stairs"—I then said to the prisoner, "It has come to the back kitchen, has it? you must go with me"—I went down with her—as she was going down she said, "As I told you before, it is no use for you to knock, for she is as deaf as a stone."—I knocked at the door repeatedly, but received no answer—I inquired for the key—the prisoner said she had not</p>

               <p>got it—I said, "This looks very suspicious"—she said, "Do not say I did it, I have not seen her since last night"—I said, "Where is the window to this kitchen?"—she said, "In the back yard"—I took her dress, about six inches in extent—it appeared to have been recently washed, the arm of the grown was wet—I have the gown here—there was a small area in front of the window, about two feet wide and three feet deep—there was no railing round it—I got down into it, to look in at the window—while doing so P✗ heard a noise, and on turning round I saw the prisoner attempting to get upon a wall about seven or eight feet high—she got on a place where the water-butt stood, about six feet high, and attempted to raise herself up by the water-pipe—I pulled her back, and said, "What are you doing?" or "What is this?"—she directly pointed to the water-closet, and said, "I want to go there," and appeared to be very much agitated, and her tongue was protruding from her mouth—I allowed her to go to the water-closet—the door was not closed, I put my hand in to prevent her closing it, fearing she might do some injury to herself while there—she was there I suppose about two minutes at the most—I opened the door directly, and saw her with her clothes up round her neck, and hands behind apparently twisting her clothes, and as I supposed attempting to strangle herself—I said, "What the devil are you doing? come out"—I took her out, and said, "I must give you into the custody of another constable—I took her with me to the street door, and opened it—I directly saw constable Jackson passing on the other side, called him in, and gave her into his custody, and said, "I have found the body of the old lady, take care of this party"—I had seen the legs of the old lady in the kitchen—I said, "This is a very suspicious affair; I suspect I have seen the body of the old lady"—and wished him to take care of her till I came back—she made some remark on that, but I do not recollect it—I then went down to the back kitchen again, got in at the window, and saw the body of the old lady with her head under the fire-place, and her neck bent—her head was, apparently, as if she was looking through the bottom of the grate—there was a cord several times round her neck—I drew the body out about six inches, and remained in that position till the surgeon saw it—there was a quantity of blood under the head—it had run from the head to the right, and formed a small pool near the centre of the room—Dr. Moat came in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I went to him directly after sending the prisoner to the station—there was a table by the window, and a turn-up bedstead—it was turned up at the time—the door was locked and the key was out—I came out by the window—Jackson was still in the house with the prisoner at that time—I said to her, "I have found the body of the old lady"—she made some remark, but I did not hear it—I directed Jackson to take the prisoner and bundles to the station, and then went for Dr. Moat—after he had seen the body, a constable named Killingback had charge of the room—the premises were constantly watched till to the inquest—after I had put Killing<lb></lb>back in charge of the premises, I went to the station, and charged the pri<lb></lb>soner with murder—she said, "I did not do it, I have not seen her since last night"—I opened the bundles at the station—there were several petticoats, aprons, night-gowns, and shifts—they were marked "M. S."—they all were afterwards shown to Elizabeth Wills, the deceased's daughter—I afterwards went back to the house in Adam-street with Mr. Hunt—a poker was found by the body—I returned to the station-house, and searched a reticule and other things which the prisoner had with her—she was searched a reticule and other things which the prisoner had with her—she was searched by a female—I found four letters in her reticule, one partly torn up in her hand, a glove, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., all in silver—these are the letters—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the inquest</p>

                  </hi> I am a daughter of the deceased—I have been shown some articles of wearing-apparel by the policeman, and recognize several of them as having belonged to my mother—here is a new flannel petticoat, a shift, two aprons, a morning gown, and two yards of calico—I was with my mother when she bought the calico, a short time before her death, at Mr. Laking's, in Cross-street—this pocket handkerchief and other things belonged to her, and I fancy this other petticoat did form the width round the waist.</p>

               <p>About five O'clock in the morning of the 2nd of June, I was called to see the body of the deceased—I found the head lying under the grate, partly across the fender, the right shoulder and neck across the fender, the head being under the grate among the cinders—the legs were slightly bent, the hands were stretched out under the grate, a little beyond the head, and just beyond the hands was lying a thimble, under the grate—there was some blood lying under the head and under the shoulder—I noticed a string round the neck—it was passed six times round the neck—I also noticed that the string was quite loose—I did not see the ends then—it was loose enough to admit the hand of person, or two or three hands—no bruise was visible in that position of the body—I did not shift the body on that occasion—I no<lb></lb>ticed a mark of violence, that had occurred from an injury inflicted since death—the bone was not fractured, nor the skin broken, it was dried or red—it was a dry red, harsh and greasy—it would not result from fire—it would result from the application of a blow shortly after death—a blow before death would produce a very different appearance—it would produce a blackness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you judge whether that was a blow of any violence or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not tell whether it was an actual blow, or merely pressure, but there was considerable force—I think the woman had been dead for about eight hours—it was half-past five when I made my notes—I had gone home and dressed before that—I think it was about a quarter-past five when I saw the body—it was fully dressed, with the exception of the head—the cap was off, lying underneath the grate, and the false front of hair with it—there was no fire burning—I did not then trace from what part of her person the blood came that I saw about the head, but it came from the mouth—it might also have come from any wound which I had not then seen, as I did not lift the body up; but it was also flowing from the mouth—on the same day I proceeded to make an examination of the body—for that purpose it was lifted from the floor on to a shutter—a halfpenny and the key of the room door was found underneath the body when it was moved—I then no<lb></lb>ticed that a very extensive bruise had been given over the socket of the right eye, inflicted during life—there was a slight mark of pressure on the bones at the back of the neck, and a slight mark of pressure on the top of the head—both those marks appeared to have been made after death—I examined those marks immediately, to see whether they were of any importance, and found them to be of none—I then proceeded to make an internal examination of the body—I found the brain perfectly healthy, and the skull very sound—I found the ribs broken on both sides, very extensively, eight on one side, and six on the other—I found that those ribs had been broken during life—I found that the lower rings of the wind-pipe had been pressed from each side towards the middle, so as to break them in the centre—there was no evidence whether that injury had been inflicted during life—I could not tell one way or the other—the right lung having been diseased for many years, was broken up in its diseased false texture, which it had acquired from disease for a number of years, and was lacerated by the projecting piece of one of the ribs, so that the blood flowed from out of its texture into the air-vessels to a con<lb></lb>siderable extent, and that was the source, and the only source of the blood that was found lying on the floor—the blood having flowed into the air-ves<lb></lb>sels, escaped by the mouth—that was only the case with the diseased lung, the left lung was slightly diseased—I think that injury to the right lung would not of itself have been mortal—the left lung was much more healthy</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184708160079"></xptr>
               <p>than lungs are usually found in persons of her age—it was slightly diseased—it had been inflamed at times, there was no laceration of that—I found everything else extremely healthy—I ascribe the death to the same power that broke the ribs—the same power being continued would inevitably stop the person's power of breathing—the same, or even a less pressure than that which broke the ribs, would stop the power of expansion of the chest, and cause death, but how soon death would ensue would depend on the age; with a young person not very soon, in a woman of her age I suppose a minute and a half.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the injury you found on the ribs of the deceased might have been inflicted in about a minute and a half? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might have been done instantaneously—the circumstances I saw about the deceased's body do not warrant me in concluding that the injuries must have been inflicted by more than one person—I think that one person could stop the circulation of the air-vessels of the wounded person by a string, by the fists, or by the knees; and, at the same time, break the ribs on both sides of the body—it could be done by sitting on the body and squeezing the throat—that is quite speculative—you asked me to imagine how it was done, and I have done so—I cannot imagine how it is possible that blows could have produced such a state of circumstances—it is quite impossible.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the presumption that a poker had been used by any person or persons seeking to destroy the life of the deceased, do you now think that you can account for the possibility of the death being caused by one person and one only? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The breaking of the ribs by blows would not necessarily have done any mortal injury, but that the ribs might have been broken to all that extent by one person, there can be no doubt—if a body were fixed in a position, very difficult to imagine, namely, tied ready for it, and one person was to go about with a poker beating it all over, taking excellent aim at each rib, they might, <hi rend="italic">seriatim</hi>, break every rib—in my opinion it is quite impossible that the ribs could have been broken by the poker, but I am taking your hypothetical case—I think it quite impossible that the use of a poker would account for the appearances I found about the body—the blow below the orbit of the eye would not be likely to be occasioned by a poker—I believe the poker was not used at all—the only way in which I can imagine this to have happened, is by the sitting on the body, and by the pressure of both sides the ribs were broken—I believe the woman to have been lying on her back on the ground—I assume</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184708160080"></xptr>
               <p>the ribs to have been broken by the bumping of the assailant on the chest of the deceased, and at the same time assailing the throat as I have represented—I am not driven to assume that that was the mode of death, because I am other<lb></lb>wise unable to account for it—the compression of the throat was not necessary to death—I believe the compression of the throat had no effect in extinguishing vitality—I form the same opinion with reference to the rope round the neck—the bumping would be unnecessary after once the ribs were broken—the first bump might break the ribs, and after that the sitting on the chest would be sufficient to prevent the deceased breathing—the mere lying of the weight of a corpse on the chest would have been sufficient—I do not think that one bump would produce the breaking of all the ribs—the power of bumping is merely the rising up of a body and sitting it down again—I cannot describe that as considerable, but previous to the bump she must have received the blow over the eye, that was a blow given whilst the woman was alive—I examined it—I did not lay it open—I am quite certain that that injury had no reference to the death—the bone immediately under the spot where the blow was received was not fractured, or driven in—the bone is very thin there, and it might be driven in to a considerable extent, and yet produce no injury—the blow was immediately over the frontal sinus, the vacant space in connection with the cavity of the nose, that was not broken in—there was no injury about the head inflicted whilst life remained—there was a mark over the forehead of an injury that had occurred after death, at the root of the hair—the head was very bald, but not quite bald—it was much easier to ascertain that the fractured rib driven into the deceased's lung had produced the discharge of blood that escaped from the mouth, than it was to account for the means by which the broken ribs had been fractured—it was occular—I could trace the stream of blood from the spot—I consider that suffocation produced death, and that suffocation was caused by pressure on the chest, and preventing its expansion—I believe the hemorrhage had nothing to do with it—death from hemorrhage would have occurred in three or four hours per<lb></lb>haps—I form my opinion of the woman having been dead about eight hours, from experience, and from the rigidity of the muscles, I am chiefly guided by the rigidity of the muscles, making allowance for the heat of the weather, it was very hot weather at that time—she might have been dead six or twelve hours—I might be as much out as that, but it is not likely.</p>

                  </hi> I am surgeon, practicing at Brighton—I attended the prisoner's brother at two different periods—his complaint was delirium on both occasions—it was very slight on the first, but much more severe on the second—I have never attended the prisoner professionally—I am a gene<lb></lb>ral practitioner—I have attended many cases of suppressed menstruation—I am senior surgeon at the Lying-in-Institution, that is an infirmary in which all the diseases of women are likewise treated—fits of different character are occasionally the consequence of suppression of the menses—I believe that a</p>

               <p>continuation of those fits for a number of years might contribute to a per<lb></lb>manent injury to the brain—I have heard the whole of the evidence in this case—I should describe the fits, from which the prisoner is said to have suf<lb></lb>fered, as hysterical fits—a person would not have a fit without the brain being affected—the proximate cause of the fit would be some operation on the brain—if these fits were repeated over and over again, it might superin<lb></lb>duce disease of the brain—I have know persons suffering from these fits, arising from the same cause, who have lost their reasoning powers for short periods while under the influence of the fit, and for a short period afterwards while the brain was recovering itself—I do not believe that a person would be able to distinguish what she was doing, or the circumstances surrounding her, during the fit; she would be gradually coming round after the fit—the continuance of these fits would operate prejudicially to the health in every respect, and I should say it would operate upon the mental powers—that is the case with every disease that has its origin in the brain, or by which the brain is at all affected—where there is disease in one member of a family, it is likely that there would be a predisposition to it in others, in some diseases particularly—if there was such a predisposition in a family, any exciting cause would be likely to produce insanity.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose in the course of your experience, your atten<lb></lb>tion being particularly directed to the diseases of women, you have met with innumerable cases of women suffering more or less inconvenience from an obstruction of this kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have—it is a complaint to which very many young women are subject—if a person is in a situation that requires them to work or exert themselves for their livelihood while labouring under this obstruction, of course they will have fainting fits—during those fainting fits the patient would be quite insensible, and incapable of any determinate action; during the fainting fits, but not during the struggling—I should describe the fits which the prisoner is said to have had, as fainting fits—I have heard it stated that on one or two occasions she screamed and was violent, with a convulsive action of the muscles—those I attribute to hysteria, but I attribute both to the same cause, the obstruction—I do not recollect ever meeting with a case in the course of my practice in which a woman became permanently insane from fainting fits or hysteria—in a fainting fit the patient would be per<lb></lb>fectly quiet and insensible—persons are very violent in some cases of hysteris, but equally incapable of determinate action—I have know the fit last for many hours—with proper applications persons would recover earlier than they would without—it is followed by lassitude and depression of spirits, until nature recovers herself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a person to have been subject to occasional obstruction and irregularity of this kind, would any successful effort of nature causing a discharged, have a tendency to relieve the inconvenience that would be felt by the want of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have noticed that at the time the discharge comes on they are rather more inclined to have fits—if a person suffered from suppres<lb></lb>sion, and had a return, they are nearly sure to have a fit at the period of the return—the return is the consequence of an effort of nature, and is curative as far as it goes—the fit would mark the crisis—if it were followed or accom<lb></lb>pained by a return of the natural action, it would be curative for a time—there always increased irritation in the female constitution at the time the discharge commences, even where they are in good health, but not such as to cause fits—I am speaking of a case where there has been suppression for a considerable time.</p>

               <p>anything like insanity in the family, drink would be more likely to promote those appearance—I have heard the evidence that has been given in this case, with reference to the fits and the obstruction of the menses—there is no doubt that is continuation for a long time might affect the brain, and that affection of the brain might be exhibited, by melancholy, or violent excitement—I mean excitement of such an extent, that I have a person labouring under such an obstruction, and she is obliged to be put under restraint—that continues for a few days—I should say during the period of that excitement, they would not be capable of knowing what they were doing, and would not be answerable for it; and during that violent paroxyam they have a greater hatred to their immediate friends than to other people—I have known females of a naturally kind and humane disposition who have exhibited those symptoms of ferocity under such circumstances—it is a very common symptom.</p>

On the 19th of February I was near the Pavilion theatre—I had some money in my pocket—I went there about half-past six o'clock, and was standing in the avenue, going in—I had five pence and four half-pence in my pocket, loose—I lost them—I do not know how, but they were taken out of my pocket—one penny was left—there was a very great crowd there—I saw the female prisoner near me—she did fiot appear to press against me.</p>

               <p>in Knight's-court, Tenter-street, St. George's. On the evening of the 19th of February, I was going to the theatre, and saw the female prisoner with her left hand on the person of Mrs. Woodward, and she handed song copper coin from her person to the male prisoner—I have not the least doubt about it—shortly after, directions were made to move on, as the barrier was clear, and we went into the pit; and as soon as I got into the pit I saw Mrs. Woodward there, and spoke to her.</p>

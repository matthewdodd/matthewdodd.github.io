                  </hi>. I am a carman of 5, Little Suffolk-street—on the night of 5th June, I was in Lant-street with Joseph Wade about a quarter past 12 o'clock, and saw some people standing on a door-step—the prisoner was one of them—I said to him, "You are right enough, old <hi rend="italic">pal</hi>"—I spoke to all of them—I walked on a step or two, my friend came up—when I turned round, my friend and the other had got to fighting—I went back to take Wada's part, and took hold of the prisoner to keep him from Wade, he being the biggest of the three—the prisoner, I believe, struck me first—we fought, and went down twice—the prisoner was on top of me—he got up first, and I was getting up, when I felt something like a kick under my left shoulder—the prisoner ran away, and I was picked up, and I was five days under the doctor's care for a stab in my back.</p>

The deceased George Mitchell was my husband—I know Williams and Davis, bat not Walker—on Saturday, 11th August, Davis called on my husband and they went out together—my husband returned home that night and went out again on the Sunday morning at 6 o'clock—he was then in very good health—he returned at about 5 minutes to 12 with John Kay and another man, a stranger—he was then very bad; he had some braises, and one of his eyes was bleeding—he sat down in a chair, went to sleep, and never spoke again—I sent for Mr. Leech—he died at half-past 4 on Monday afternoon.</p>

I live at 25, Long-lane, and was a fellow-workman of Mitchells—he came to me on the morning of this fight and told me to meet him at a coffee-house in Union-street—I did; there were several persons there but I did not notice either of the other prisoners—we went down the Cat and met Davis, Williams, and several others, who I do not know, at the Victoria Theatre—we went to Battersea into a small field wide of the park—the deceased and Williams went into the park and stripped, they shook hands and commenced fighting—Davis picked Williams up when he fell, more than once—I call him a second, I suppose—I saw Williams strike the deceased but no one else—the fight lasted close upon half an hoar—I saw Walker pick the deceased up more than once, and put him on his knees; he acted as what you may term a second—I went home with the deceased after the fight and left him at his cottage—I was with him the whole of the time—he received no blow on his way home.</p>

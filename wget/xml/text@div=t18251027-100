On the 23d of September I was sent for to the watch-house, and saw some boards there, one of which had a particular mark upon it, which I had marked myself, in the way I generally mark boards, with the day of the month, or a cross. I saw the prisoner at Marlborough-street next morning; I had paid him on the Saturday night before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you swear to any other board? A. No. I believe them to be ours. This one is marked with black lead, and is worth 8 d. or 10 d.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About half-past twelve o'clock at night on the 23d of September I saw the prisoner with these boards on his shoulder; the serjeant of the watch said, "There is something fallen down;" I said it must come that way, as no one had passed my box - I waited till the prisoner came up with the timber on his shoulder, and said, "My friend, where did you get these?" he said, "My master gave them to me, to make a hod;" I said, "It is very odd he should give you these, when shorter pieces will do - I shall take you to the watch-house." He then threw them off his shoulder, and tried to escape from the serjeant, while I turned to lock my box, but another watchman was there, and he stopped him - the serjeant took up the boards, and we all went to the watch-house. He said, "Oh! that I was dead - I stole them;" he said at Marlborough-street, to Mr. Kinnaird, that he had stolen them from Mr. Cubitt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you say to him before that? A. Nothing, but that I should take him to the watch-house, which was about a quarter of a mile from the place. He kept begging of me to let him go - he was not quite sober.</p>

            . I was officer of the night. I was at the watch-house when the prisoner was brought there; he said his master had given him the boards; I said, "I am sure your master would not give you such things as these;" he then said he had taken them from Cubitt's buildings - I went there in the morning, and made inquiries.</p>

               <p>Q. What the man that was laying down - A. Yes, sir. He took it away and gave it to Blade, and Blade gave it to another.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man that was laying down - A. Robertson.</p>
               <p>Q. And then the other, Blade, received it of him - A. Yes, and he gave it to another.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Blade standing - A. Not by him within two or three doors of the house. He got up and put it under his coat, and then gave it Blade. Then he went back again and did it again. He went and laid down a second time, and he went and he gave that away a second time, and we stopped him with a ham. There was a young woman with me. He told us if we would say nothing he would give us something to drink. We went and told Mr. Stiles, and just as we went in two patrols came up and stopped him. They brought them into Mr. Stiles.</p>

We did; we thought some one would tumble over him, and when he saw some people busy in the shop he turned upon his side, and took one of the hams from off the bench in the shop. He went away with it, and gave it to Blade. That was just above him he crossed over the street, and went to the door again, and laid down in the same manner as before. He took another ham, and gave it to the same man, and that man gave it to another. Then he came back the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170028"></xptr>third time in the same manner.

               <p>Robertson's Defence. I am entirely innocent of the charge. I was going home on Monday last, I was stopped by the patrol. I am sure I never saw the men nor the women. I have been at a house where the women were common prostitutes. I have four small children, and get my bread by hard work.</p>
               <p>Blade's Defence. On Monday, the 8th instant, as I was going up East Smithfield, I saw a man come out of a door with something under his arm. A man came from the other side of the road, and challenged me with stealing a ham. I immediately ran across the road to the patrols.</p>

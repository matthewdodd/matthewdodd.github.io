                  </hi>. I am a mason, of 26, Milk-street—on the night of 13th January, I went home about 6, and found the outer door shut, which was usually left open—I rang the bell, and when I got in I missed a cloak of my wife's—my wife went and searched for it—she came and told me something, and I afterwards saw it on the stairs, near the outer door, and near the water-closet—I picked it up and took it back, up three pair of stairs, where it was taken from—I afterwards gave it to the policeman—I saw the prisoner when I found the cloak—it was lying close by her side—I said to her, "You have something there that don't belong to you"—she said, "No, I have not"—she works in the house, but I had never seen her before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When you came to the top of the stairs after me, and said I was wanted, did I not go back with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, you never moved a peg—I did not see you have the cloak.</p>

                  </hi> Junior. I am the son of the last witness—in conse<lb></lb>quence of something that occurred, I watched the water-closet, and saw the prisoner and another woman go in—the other woman was a hand who works there—the cloak was in there before they went in; when they came out, I looked in, and the cloak was gone—I told my father, and he stopped on the stairs—the other woman went back into the work-room, and the prisoner went down stairs—my father went up to her and stopped her—I afterwards saw the cloak, after she had dropped it—I did not see her drop it—I saw it on the floor, at her feet—the other woman was four flights of stairs up—it could not have been thrown down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Why did you not stop me at first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because there were two of you—I told my father to stop you—the cloak was not thrown down stairs while you were at the bottom of the stairs; there was no one there to throw it down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say when they went down stairs, you went into the water-closet? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, of course both the women were out of my sight at that time.</p>

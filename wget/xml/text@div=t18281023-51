               <p>Q. Did he follow you into the Three Tuns? A. I never looked back to see, and never saw him afterwards; I desired somebody to come back with me, to see if the children were not murdered, as I was afraid be was murdering them; I was taken to a doctor's shop in Fleet-street - I was able to walk there; I was supported by some friends; I was not married before I married the prisoner - my children are young; I was supported to the doctor's in Fleet-street - I do not know his name; he is a surgeon - he looked at my wound, but I cannot tell what was said, though I still had my senses: I was taken up into the street, put into a coach, and taken to the Hospital - my wound was dressed there; I remained in the Hospital five weeks; I was at Guildhall twice - I think it was a month before I was able to go before the Alderman, but I cannot justly say how long.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time you came home till he cut you in the neck, there was every expression of kindness on his part? A. Yes; no anger at all - he was very kind that night; every thing appeared kind and affectionate on his part, from the time he brought me from the public-house; I did not see the knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is your name Ann or Hannah? A. Hannah; I have had four children by the prisoner - three of them are alive; the eldest is turned seven, and the youngest is three years old - I have been married to him going on for eight years.</p>
               <p>Q. He is rather weak in his mind I understand - not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230033"></xptr>strong understanding? A. He is not very stout; I cannot say any thing of his mind - he is in general in the same way; I do not know any difference; I thought him a sensible man myself - I never heard that he was thought weak in his understanding.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he had any cause for it or not I do not ask, but was he not very much given to jealousy? A. I cannot think he was given to jealousy at all - I have no reason to think it in the least; I do not think he was at all jealous - he had once left me for three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not jealous then? A. He pretended so; he left me, and took his clothes off with him; I cannot tell whether he was jealous or not then; he went out, and said he was going to take a walk - I asked if I could not go with him; he said I should not, and as soon as he went out, I put on my bonnet, told my little girl to mind her sister, and followed him, but lost sight of him; I returned, and found that he had got back as soon as me - I followed him in, and followed him up stairs (we then lived in Collingwood-street), and as soon as I went in he said, "Oh, you have been having it - you have been having it:" I said,"Oh, James, what have I been having?" he then began to abuse me in a most disgusting manner, which I cannot repeat; I went down stairs to the door, because I would not hear his words - he came down to the door to me, and asked what I had done with his black trousers; I said I thought he had taken them up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the disgusting words imputing some infidelity to you? A. Yes, but there is a clear proof that it was quite false; I do not know my landlady's name - I was not there above seven or eight weeks; we lived two years in King-street, Smithfield, at Turnbull's: I cannot say that he was jealous there, for he frequently offered me protection - Mrs. Turnbull and I were very good friends; I have no reason to think he was jealous, or he never would have a desire for me to go on the town to get money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean, on your oath, that you never heard, and did not understand that he was very weak in his understanding? A. I never observed it, nor ever heard it; I swear I never knew of any deficiency in his mind more than wickedness - he was excessively wicked.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that his life is now at stake? A. My life was at stake as well as his; I never considered my life safe with him - I do not wish him executed; it is my wish to save his life, but my own as well.</p>

On the night of the 9th of September, I was serving in my shop between ten and eleven o'clock, and heard the cries of Murder! upon which I rushed out of my back-door, and saw the prisoner's wife rushing out of the passage; I followed her into the Three Tuns - she was then bleeding very much from the neck, as I suppose; when I went in, I saw the blood come from her throat - it flowed in considerable quantities; she immediately requested somebody would secure her children from being murdered by her husband - I went up to her room with a constable, and saw the prisoner; we apprehended him - he stood by the bed side in his shirt, and on his right-hand sleeve there was blood; they asked him if he had cut his wife's throat; his answer was "She must have done it herself, for he knew nothing of it" - the knife was not found at that time; I was not present when it was found, which was two or three days after - I was at Guildhall when it was produced: he was taken to the watch-house - I was not intimate with them.</p>

            . I was dresser at St. Bartholomew's-hospital when this happened; I was present when the prosecutrix was brought in - she was rather taint, and had received a deep wound in the throat; I did not imagine that it would prove fatal; there was a great hemorrhage, the carroted artery was not divided, the wound was hut two lines off it - the pulsation of the carroted artery was very visible - if that had been cut, it must have proved fatal; she was able to leave the hospital much sooner than she did - she had recovered strength enough to leave in about a month - it would not have been proper for her to leave before.</p>

            . I am a leather-dresser, and live at No. 22, Crown-street, Soho. I worked for the prisoner at a shop, which he hired of Russell, in Fetter-lane, not where he lived; he borrowed a knife of me on the 9th of September, between two and four o'clock in the afternoon - he told me it was to skin a cat - I saw the knife again at Guildhall; after he had borrowed it he asked if I would turn the grindstone, and it was ground in the form of a table-knife - I turned the stone, and he ground it round, which would make it sharper than when I lent it him - I am quite sure I saw the same knife before the Alderman; he appeared at times very low in spirits.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known him long? A. I have seen him about for three years - I only knew him while I worked for him, about seven weeks - he has worked for three hours together without saying a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not appear at times in a very low and melancholy state? A. He did - he always behaved with the greatest kindness to me, more like a brother than any thing, but latterly he got exceeding low and melancholy.</p>

            . I am a boot-maker, and live in Fetter-lane - I sleep on the same floor as the prisoner. On the night this happened, I was sitting in the room with my wife and children, between ten and eleven o'clock; I heard a shriek and a cry of Murder! I expected it proceeded from Abbott's room - I went into the passage, still hearing the cry of Murder! I knocked at the door and called Abbott; I had no answer, but still heard the cries of Murder! and forced the door open; I heard a scuffle towards the door and went back to my own door, stood with it in my hand, and saw Mrs. Abbott come running out of the room; I saw some one behind her in the door-way - she was coming towards my door, and for some reason, which I cannot account for, I shut the door<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230034"></xptr>- I did not see her afterwards; I heard her running down stairs, but did not go down myself; I opened my door, went and knocked at Abbott's door two or three times - he came to the door, and said in a very slow tone of voice,"Did you call, Mr. Fitzgerald?" I said "Yes, what have you been doing?" he said, "I have been asleep;" I then saw some blood on the side of the door, and in the passage - I said "Why, your wife must be cut terribly, how has this happened?' he said he knew nothing at all of it - she must have done it herself; I saw some blood on his shirt sleeve, and asked him how that came; he said he supposed it must have come from a cut on his knuckle (he had cut his knuckle that day, and came into my shop and shewed it to me just after it happened) he then went into his room; I followed him, and he went as he was getting into bed - I said, "Abbott, it is no use you getting into bed, you will have to go into the watch-house;" he said "Do you think so?" I said "Yes, I am certain of it;" he said, "Then I had better dress myself, I suppose?" I said "Yes, by all means, get you clothes on as soon as you can;" he put his trousers on, and was putting on his waistcoat; several persons then came up stairs, and he was secured - they asked him how he came to do it - he said "She must have have done it herself," and that she had attempted to hang herself some time before; I never heard of that before - the room was searched twice in my presence, but the knife could not be found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you known him long? A. About twelve weeks; he always appeared to me depressed in spirits; he would go in and out of the house with his head hanging down, and never speak unless spoken to - he appeared to be under jealousy; I did not know that till the day this happened; about twelve o'clock that day I had seen him in and out very frequcutly - I went up into my room, and said "Abbott seemed very uncomfortable to day" - they had been quarrelling a few minutes before that; when I had said that he came to my door, knocked, and said he wanted to speak to me - I went into his room; he put the door too, and said "I want you to give me some advice about my situation;" I said if I could give him advice I would, but I did not like to interfere between man and wife - he said "I am very miserably situated; I wish my wife would stop at home, and pay attention to her home the same as your's - she can earn money at glove-making at home, but prefers going out charing, that she should have an opportunity of going with other men," and the three children he declared were not his own, neither of the three; he was always depressed, and never spoke unless spoken to - he was under a strong fit of jealousy I have no doubt.</p>

            . I live in Fleur-de-lis-court. On the 9th of September, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was looking from my own window, and saw something fall from the window of the room in which this deed was committed; I was not well at the time; what it was I cannot tell - I did not hear it sound as it fell; when I heard the instrument could not be found, I mentioned this, and they went in the direction I said it had fallen.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was on duty on the night this happened; I went there, and found two watchman and several people round the prisoner - he was sitting down in his room half undressed; I looked about, but could find no knife - I went to the top of the house to look for it, but could not find it; one of the parish-beadles brought it to me two or three days afterwards; Self saw it afterwards, and claimed it - I produce it just in the state I received it; the prisoner said nothing about the knife.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SELF. That is the knife I lent the prisoner - it was rusty when he had it; it was in the form of a shoe-maker's knife, but he ground the two corners off.</p>

            . I live at No. 24, King-street, West Smithfield. The prisoner and his wife lodged in my house for upwards of two years; for the first eighteen months of that time, he and his wife were remarkably comfortable, sober, and quiet - after that, I observed a remarkable change take place in his mind - he was very much depressed in spirits; he certainly laboured under an infirmity of mind - under jealousy; I frequently said so; he appeared for the first eighteen months remarkably kind to his family, sober, and remarkably industrious, and his general demeanour was very affable - he seemed happy in the bosom of his family; but for the last six months he was in my house, he seemed quite a reverse man; he would pass up and down without speaking to any body - in fact, the whole house pitied him: he left my house fourteen or fifteen months ago.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness: for the first eighteen months the prisoner lived with us he was very cheerful, and after that I observed a great change in him, and so did all the house - he fell into quite a melancholy state, frequently reading and praying: before that he worked night and day for his wife and family, and was a very kind loving husband - he used to carry the children out, and take delight in his family.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he leave your lodging of his own accord? A. My husband gave them notice on account of their continually quarrelling.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230035"></xptr>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The woman has said she never knew him to be jealous; was he to your knowledge, and that of the whole house, jealous for the last six months? A. Yes, he made no secret of it; his wife knew he was jealous, and owned to me that he had reason for it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. She owned to you, he had reason to be jealous? A. Yes, and she told me the fact: I told my husband of it that Saturday night, when Mr. Abbott came up very much distracted in mind - Mr. Abbott told me of it first; and two or three days after Mrs. Abbott said to me "Mrs. Turnbull, I am ashamed to look you in the face, for my husband has told you the circumstance"- I told my husband of it that night; we could not sleep in consequence of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep company with her much? A. Yes, she was frequently borrowing, and what she wanted I let her have - she told me of this five or six months before they left our house.</p>
               <p>Q. You continued on the same terms with her? A. Yes - they were lodgers and we did not wish to expose them to the house; we gave them a week's notice before they left - we did not give them notice when this happened, for they said they would try and live comfortably, and I was to keep it to myself.</p>

             sworn. - I am shopwoman to Mr. Wilmot; about half past nine in the morning of the 7th of January, the prisoner came into the shop to complain of some Irish she had bought a week before; she then wanted to look at some calico, I turned to get it, and while I was turned, she laid hold of the piece of print which she took; I turned my head quick, and she asked me if it was not a shawl; I said, no; she laid it down again, and said, the calico was not thick enough; I turned again, and I saw her put the cotton under her cloak; I let her go out of the shop, and sent the boy after her; he brought her back, and I said, I wished to speak to her; she took it from under her clock, and threw it over the counter, and begged forgiveness.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to change a piece of linen, and asked her to let me look at a piece of calico, she did, I paid for it, and came out of the shop; she called me back, and sent for an officer, saying, I had taken it, but it lay on the counter when I went in.</p>
               <p>Fletcher. I saw her take it from under her cloak; I have known her for a number of years coming to the shop.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to her character.</p>

               <p>Lewis. I am sure I lost between 4 and 6 l. I found the window broke that goes into the bar. I went up stairs, and found the prisoner was gone; I advertised him: he was brought to me afterwards, I think about 5 weeks ago: he owned to the robbery directly. I asked him how he could rob me, who had been kind to him. He said, never master behaved better, he never lived so well in his life: he said, after he had done the robbery, he sat out that morning for Bath, and was there almost 3 weeks; and when he had spent all the money, he came up to town again. I asked him how he got the till out; he said he wrenched that open with a lathing-hammer (which I had in my house) and took the beads off the sash-window to get in; he said he was sorry for what he had done.

               <p>Lewis. That was fastened with 2 bolts and a spring-lock.</p>

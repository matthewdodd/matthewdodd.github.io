                  </hi>. I am barman at the Hand-in-Hand, Holborn, kept by Ann Halliford—on Saturday night, 12th April, about 9 o'clock or 9.30 I shut up the front door, I am sure it was past 9 o'clock—I came out as I heard a noise of glass breaking—I went up stairs to the leads over the parlour, and saw the staircase window open—I went down and called in a constable from the street, took him up on the leads, and saw the prisoner getting out at the window, which is over the water-closet, with a bundle in his hand—as soon as he saw the constable he threw the bundle down on the leads, which forms the water-closet roof, against the window—these clothes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) dropped out of the bundle—it contained women's clothing—I had seen my mistress fasten the window at 4 or 5 o'clock—there are two</p>

               <p>fastenings on it—three panes of glass were broken and the fastenings were undone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How could anybody get to the water-closet roof? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The bar door is always open for customers, and a person going up stairs to the water-closet, could go four stairs higher to the leads, and then break into the house again by the window; that is the only way it could be done—the water-closet is not outside the house, but the roof of it is—the leads door is always open for airing the place—anybody could get on the stairs without being seen—I was about three minutes going for a constable—you did not seem to come down in a hurry, and the constable told you, that if you did not, he would force you down—if he had not pulled the stuff out, you could not have been frightened at it—I did not hear you say anything about Easter—no one caught hold of your throat—no man in a high hat was there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 86). Cox called to the Hand-in-hand, at about 9.15 on this night—I went up stairs with him to the first floor land<lb></lb>ing, and saw the prisoner on the second floor, outside on the water-closet roof, with a bundle in his hand, and a scarf tied round it—as soon as I got outside he dropped the bundle—I told him to come down, but he stopped there some time, I said that I should have to force him dowm, and took my truncheon out—he then came down, and when he got to the bar the landlady gave him in custody—he said "You might have let me get over the Easter holidays, and then I should have given up all robberies and gone to work"—I searched him and found 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. all but a penny.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Hand-in-hand—these clothes are mine, some of them lay on a table in my bedroom, which is close to the staircase window—this suit of clothes and petticoats, were in one of the top drawers—the room was in a very disordered state.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> About 8.30 I was in the Hand-in-Hand, having a pint of stout, I went out the backway to the water-closet and heard glass breaking. Knowing that there was a bagatelle-room up stairs, I went up, saw the door open and a little flat place; I went out there, looked up and saw some clothes lying all about the tiles; I looked up higher and saw the window open and three or four panes of glass broken, while I was getting up I out my finger with the glass. I tied the clothes up, intending to take</p>

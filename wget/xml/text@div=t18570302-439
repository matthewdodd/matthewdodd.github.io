I was awoke on Saturday morning, 14th Feb., by Mrs. Hill, about half past 5 o'clock—I went into my yard, I did not see any one there the first time—I went back and put on some clothes, and got a light—I went and opened my coal cellar door; I saw the prisoner standing inside my coal shed—I flew at him and caught him by the throat, and pulled him into the yard—I asked him what he did there; he said in broken English, "Don't take me, don't take me," and struck me on the head—he struggled very violently—I held him till the constable came, and took him—I then searched the coal shed, and found these two bundles, which contain the different articles which have been mentioned—my house is the end house, and there is a wall eight or nine feet high round the garden, from the street—my coal shed adjoins the street, and there were marks of my tiles having been disturbed—they got over my garden, and to the other garden, and came back again—there were marks of some one getting over the wall, and over to the next gardens.</p>

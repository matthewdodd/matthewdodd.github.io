                  </hi>. I am the wife of Leonard Just, and live at Haliford Road, Essex Road—on 17th April, about 3.15 I was returning home for a walk—I saw four men standing at the corner of the Morton Road—the prisoner was one of them—as I was going round the corner one man caught me round the neck and held me very tightly—it hurt me very much—the prisoner came in front of me and took away a gold watch and chain, and ran away—when the prisoner had got a little way the man let go of me, and they all four ran away—I called out—I went home and sent for a policeman, and made a statement to him—I next saw the prisoner on the Monday or Tuesday following, standing at the Half Moon public-house—I could not then find a, constable—on the 25th April I saw him again, but could not find a constable—on 1st May I was sent for to the station-house, and was taken into a room where there was a lot of men—I picked out the prisoner—my watch was worth 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

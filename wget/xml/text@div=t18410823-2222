                  </hi>. I live with my father, a labourer, in Fleur-de-lis-court, Spitalfields. About five o'clock in the evening of Tuesday, the 17th of August, I was crossing Stewart-street with my brother Samuel in my arms—he is six months old—I felt a snatch, and missed a necklace from his neck—I turned round and saw Mr. Cheesman, and saw the prisoner running—I did not see who did it—Mr. Cheesman ran after him and over<lb></lb>took him—the necklace was produced by Mr. Phillips.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the prisoner go behind the witness, snatch the beads off the child's neck, and run away—I followed him—he ran off and threw them down—I took them up and pursued him till the policeman took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jacob Careass, who is a profess<lb></lb>sor of music. The prisoner was in our service for about six weeks—I sent her up to my bed-room for my apron, and recollecting that I had left my pocket there I followed her up, and found her pulling the clothes over which laid on the drawer, to look for my apron, as she said—my pocket was then untied—I had left it twisted round with a string—I asked her who opened my pocket—she said she knew nothing about it—I told her she had, and I knew she had got some money of mine in her mouth—I took out of her mouth one shilling and two sixpences—I opened my purse in my pocket, and missed one shilling and two sixpences—I had counted the money the night before—my husband gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

               <p>In April 1784, at the gaol delivery of Bristol, this woman, (but I must beg just to say how I knew her; my memory of her person did not serve, but I went to the Compter, and there from the questions I asked her, and her answers, I perfectly satisfied myself that she is the woman;) she was brought up at the end of the gaol delivery; she had been then ten months in prison, or near it; I should have discharged her then, but Townsend came down, and swore that he was present when she was convicted; and that to his knowledge she had had the King's pardon, on condition of transportation; I was very doubtful whether I ought, or could with any propriety, detain her, but however I did detain her; on my return to town, I applied to the Secretary of State; I informed the under Secretary of State I should discharge her; I applied also to Sir

            , and just before the gaol delivery 1785, I met Sir Sampson, and he told me that he understood that it was not the intention to prosecute her; the gaol delivery was held again last-summer, then that woman, as knowing her in the way I described her, and another woman were brought up; they had both been committed, as I saw by the calendar for returning from transportation, and they were discharged; after they were discharged, money was given them to maintain them, they were sent up at the expence of the corporation in a waggon to London; I have heard that the other woman had actually got into an honest sober way of life, but that she has since fled on hearing that this woman had been taken up, she was in Bristol, for no charge but this; I enquired about it.</p>
               <p>Court. This case is attended with some singularity; fortunately for her, Mr. Recorder of Bristol has attended here, and has given such evidence upon the subject, as induces us to think that this woman ought to be acquitted; we are of opinion that as she was discharged by proclamation she was set at large by legal authority, she could not have continued in gaol if she chose it; therefore she is at large against her consent; we think her life is not to be taken away by this charge.</p>

            , you have been acquitted of a capital felony; but as it appears by the evidence of the Recorder of Bristol that you were discharged by lawful authority, the Court have therefore been of opinion that you ought not to forfeit your life for so being at large; yet you will be in danger of being apprehended and tried for being at large again; the safest way therefore for yourself, is, that you should remain in custody of the law now, in order to be sent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130169"></xptr> out of the kingdom on your former sentence.</p>

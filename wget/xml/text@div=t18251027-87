I went out on the 22d of September, and staid about an hour; when I returned I sat down on the steps with my child, talking to my next door neighbour, and while there the prisoner run down the stairs, and passed me at the door, with a very large bundle in her apron. I am quite certain of her person. These articles had been in my drawers in my room, and the door locked. I had left the key on a shelf in the passage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. What time did you go out? A. In the morning: while I was sitting on the steps she touched me on the shoulder, and said "Let me pass;" as soon as she had passed me I said "Where did that woman come from?" Mrs. Monkley said "From down your stairs;" she took the child from me, and said "Go up, and see if you have lost any thing;" I went up and missed the property. I should think a person could not have seen the key.</p>

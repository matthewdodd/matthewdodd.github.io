            . I live at Mousewell-hill. On the 26th of February I was going along Clerkenwell, and was there told by a stranger, that the prisoner had robbed me, and was directed to a person, where I went, and found it was so: the prisoner was <rs id="t17660409-42-deflabel254" type="occupation">employed to drive my cart</rs>

I took him up, and charged him with it; he owned he had sold as many pieces as he had received 5 or 6 shillings for, joists and boards of different lengths; that he had sold them to people to burn as he went along, 5 or 6 at a time, more than I have laid in the indictment; some of them were as good as new for repairing.</p>

            . I keep a chandlers-shop in Cow-cross; I sell wood and coals. On the 12th of February last, the prisoner came into my shop, and asked me if I would buy 2 or 3 pieces of firewood. I went with him to his cart; there were 2 or 3 pieces of joiks; I bought them of him; and at different times, to the best of my knowledge, I bought as many as came to 5 or 6 s. the man at the next door told me he was afraid the prisoner did not come honestly by the wood; I would have nothing more to do with him. Mr. Griffin came to me, and I shewed him the wood, some found, some not; I bought them for firewood.</p>

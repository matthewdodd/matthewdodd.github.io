            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in High-street, St. Giles's. The prisoner came to our shop on the 24th of August, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon; she offered a gown to pawn, but I saw part of a duplicate on the neck of it - I asked if it was her own - she said two women gave it to her to pawn, and they were at the door - I went to the door but there were no women there.</p>

I was in St. Giles's, and met two women who lived in a house with me - one of them went away, and the other asked me to go and have some beer with her; she went back, and came back in about a quarter of an hour, and said she had had some words with her husband, and asked if I would pawn it for her; she directed me to go to the corner of the gateway; the pawnbroker asked me if it was my own - I said it was given to me by a woman in the street.</p>

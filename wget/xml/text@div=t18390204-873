I was in Tennis-court, King-street, Southwark, on Thursday, the 7th of February, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—I saw a horse and cart standing still it was a very bye place, my curiosity was excited, and I hid myself where I could see the cart, but nobody could see me—in about ten minutes I saw the prisoner coming down a turning called Bowling-green-lane, and he look the mare by the reins—there was another man with him—the pri<lb></lb>soner then took the cart down Bowling-green-lane into King-street, and on to Maze-pond—I followed them—the other man saw me, and he went away—when the prisoner got to Maze-pond, he looked round and saw me—I then went and asked where he was going—he said, "Home"—I said, "What, are you the carman?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Where is your whip?"—he said, "Up in the cart"—but there was no whip there—I said I should take him to the station-house—he said it was very hard, as he saw the horse and cart standing, and he was going to take it home; but he was going in the wrong direction—I asked him what was the direc<lb></lb>tion on the cart—he could not tell me, but I found on it the name of Mr. Muggeridge, Tottenham Court-road—the cart was then three or four miles from there, and the prisoner was going in a contrary direction—I took the mare and cart, and my brother officer took the prisoner.</p>

On Friday, the 20th of September, at half-past seven o'clock in the evening, (I am certain about the time,) I was standing at my bar with the servant at my side, in the usual course of my business - two persons came in; my lamps were alight in all part of the house, and the street lamps also.</p>

               <p>Q. Suppose you had gone out and seen your wife or son twenty yards off, should you have known them - A. No, not by the daylight. Two persons came into my house to the front bar - the front door is in Oxford-street; I have also a side entrance in Old George-yard, the entrance to Mr. Bushnell's coach-yard. Customers come in at the front door, but some come in at the side, as well as the lodgers,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230013"></xptr>I never recollect seeing either of the two men before. Barnett was one of them. My servant was in the room last before the alarm. My bedroom is the first floor back room; I have a contrivance by which if any one enters that room a bell rings violently in my bar. Nobody but my family have a right to go into the room - the key hangs in the bar. While the two men were drinking in the bar the bell rang, and in consequence of what my servant said I ran immediately up stairs to my bed-room, and met Holland four or five yards from the door, on the third step of the stairs. I did not know him before; I could not see his face; I demanded to know who he was; I believe he said,</p>
               <p>"Who are you?" or</p>
               <p>"What is it to you?" Upon which I said,</p>
               <p>"Somebody has entered my room, and you are the first man I met, and I will secure you." On my seizing him, he caught hold of my collar and a struggle ensued; we came a few steps down, and I called for a light; my servant immediately left the bar, and brought me a candle, and while I was struggling, the other two men, whom I had left at the bar, passed my servant, and I was collared by some person behind, who pulled me and Holland down the stairs together; we fell down together, and the third man knocked the candle out of the servant's hand just before we fell. Holland immediately got on his feet, and made out at the side door; I started the very moment after him. I was on my feet as soon as him, and was never above half a yard from him; he turned out into Oxford-street, then to the left hand, ran against a person, and I caught him, and he was secured. I took him back into my parlour, and said I suspected I had been robbed. Upon going up into my bed-room with a candle, I found the door open - nothing was gone. I returned down stairs, and fastened my side door, and left two persons to guard it. I then went to the bar with a large stick, and was bolting the front door in Oxford-street. I heard a scuffle behind me in the bar, and saw Barnett struggling with two or three men - he had a stick in his hand - he was secured. I did not see him searched.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Are you sure you never lost sight of Holland - A. Never. I have six or seven lodgers; the side-door is for their use, and persons coming to them. A bookbinder lodged with me - he died six weeks before; his name was taken off the door two days before the transaction. Holland said he had been up stairs after the bookbinder, but did not know his name: his room was on the same floor as my bed-room. I have but one staircase.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. How long were Barnett and the other man at the bar before the bell rang - A. Three or four minutes; my servant had given them a glass of rum and water - the other man asked me to drink. I cannot say who the persons were who came behind when I was struggling with Holland.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How far is the bookbinder's door from yours - A. Nearly opposite; his widow remained there, and was at home at the time; she has moved now. Some implements of housebreaking were brought to me from the parlour afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Suppose the door had been left open half an inch, if any person gave it a shove, would the bell ring - A. Yes, my Lord. I do not think it could have been left ajar; I had not been up there after eleven o'clock. The bell does not ring when the door shuts; there were no marks of violence on the door, but by some means the bolt was put back.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Clayton's service as barmaid. On the 20th of September I was in my master's bed-room, at six o'clock in the evening; I put the bell spring on the door when I came out, locked the door after me, and took the key down, and hung it up in the bar - I am sure I locked it. I was in the bar when the bell rang; I had been out of the bar for a few minutes before that, but when the bell rang, the key was still where I had hung it. I did not see the two persons come in to drink. When the bell rang, my master went up stairs - he called for a light - I went towards the stairs with a candle. At that time Barnett and another man stood at the bar - they both passed me in the passage, and the other man, who has escaped, knocked the light out of my hand; and before that, Barnett ran on the stairs, and took my master by the collar, and pulled him down, and then the candle was knocked out. I saw no more - I went to the bar. Barnett came and paid me for the rum and water - I took the money. I saw Holland brought back; Barnett stood at the bar then, and did not offer to run away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The front door was open all that time - A. It was not fastened. Barnett remained at the bar four or five minutes before Holland was brought back. My master went to the door to fasten it; Barnett went and held up a stick to strike him, but was prevented by somebody who was by - he was taken into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. He paid for his rum and water and was going away, and your master stopped him - A. Yes; he held his stick up; he did not attempt to do any thing before my master endeavoured to stop him. I told the Magistrate about Barnett's collaring my master on the stairs; they did not say they had come to help him. I should think the stairs are about a yard wide. I stood at the foot of the stairs (not on them) when the man passed me, and knocked the light out - it was not done by accident. I know it was dark at the time; for I had been at the front door just before, and it was quite pitch dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Then inside the house, with the candle put out, how could you see - A. There was a light from the bar. I left the room about six o'clock - the alarm was above an hour after.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not you say, when you were examined before, that you had not been out of the bar from the time you locked the door, till it happened - A. Not that I know of. My master's back was towards Barnett when he raised the stick to strike him; also when he went up stairs to pull him down.</p>

            . I am a Clerk in the Bank of England. On the 20th of September, a little past seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Oxford-street, coming from the city; I went into Clayton's house; it was dark in the street - I should think it was a quarter or twenty minutes past seven o'clock; there was not sufficient light for one man to know the countenance of another in the street; it had been dusk for forty minutes before I went in. My attention was attracted by a crowd round the prosecutor's house; and on going in, there was a great confusion inside. I saw Holland in the parlour, sitting near the window, with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230014"></xptr>his right hand towards the window; and while he sat there he took a letter out of his pocket, which he was going to tear up; some persons prevented him, and in the mean time I heard something drop from him. I said to the persons about me,</p>
               <p>"Take care of your pockets;" and a short time after that, Barnett was in the room, and I saw him take something off the table, as I thought. I tapped the landlord on the shoulder, and in consequence of what I said to him he (the landlord) immediately went out of the bar towards the front door - Barnett went out rather behind him - he went and bolted the front door. Barnett lifted up a stick which he had in his hand, and was going to level it at the landlord's head - I prevented him - he immediately turned round, and swore he would knock me down, if I prevented his going out, saying he had particular business, and would go. The landlord had bolted the door. Barnett walked to the bar - I observed him put something into the left side of his coat; I saw him afterwards throw a dark lantern down in the parlour; I picked it up, and accused him of throwing it down - he denied it - I gave it to the landlord. A phosphorus bottle and picklock key were found in the grate immediately behind Barnett. Nobody was so near the grate as him - nobody but him had an opportunity of putting them there - he sat with his back to the fire-place. We attempted to secure him; he struck me with his stick several times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. He said he would strike you or any person who prevented his going out, as he had particular business - A. Yes. There might be ten persons in the parlour where the grate was. I did not see the phosphorus bottle found. It is a good-sized room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Had you passed any church, to know the time - 
               <persName id="t18221023-9-person169">A. St. Giles's</persName>
             clock struck seven as I was in Broad-street, a little beyond Drury-lane, but not so far as Middle-row. Clayton's is nearly opposite Dean-street, which is ten minutes walk. I had called at a snuff-shop for about ten minutes, in the way. I got to Clayton's a quarter or twenty minutes after seven o'clock, and saw a crowd round the house before I arrived. It was dark when I heard the clock strike; I could not then discern a man's countenance. The alarm had taken place before I got to Clayton's.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did the persons in the parlour come in before or after you - A. Some before and some after.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you pick up more than one picklock key - A. I did not pick it up; I saw but one found - that was in the grate or on the hearth.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always said it was near to where Barnett was sitting - A. To the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said it was picked up off the ground where Holland sat - A. They both sat in the same situation.</p>

I was in the parlour when I heard the first noise; eight or ten people were then in the parlour - I went out of the house on being called away. I was standing at the bar, and saw Barnett attempt to strike Clayton as he was fastening the door - he went away then to the other, and said if he could not get out at one door he would at the other.

             re-examined. The prisoners were taken out of my house by the constable, at the front door, near this spot - they would not have to pass the place where the keys were found. My parlour is particularly light; it is all a glass front. I should suppose that Holland was taken not above three minutes after the two persons came in - it could not have exceeded five. A phosphorus box, a picklock key, and a dark lantern were given me by the witness, and somebody brought me some matches. None of them are mine.</p>

            . I saw Holland running outside Clayton's house - he was secured, and taken in; I went in, and in the parlour where he was, I picked up a few matches; some of them were under where he sat, and some by the seat by the fire. Barnett was not sitting by the matches at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How many other persons were in the room - A. A number of others; but none so near the matches as Holland. I gave them to some man in the room.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took Barnett into custody, and found a large knife on him at the watch-house. As I was taking him along, he made several faint attempts to escape, by endeavouring to snatch his hand from under my arm, and to trip me up two or three times.</p>
               <p>HOLLAND'S Defence. I came out of the country, and was in town about twelve days. I wanted to get some books bound, and was recommended to a binder at Clayton's - I went there about seven o'clock, knocked at the door on the right hand side up stairs, several times; nobody answered - I turned to the other door to knock, and it instantly flew open. I heard the prosecutor cry out that he was robbed, and came down to get out, thinking he might suspect me to be implicated.</p>
               <p>BARNETT'S Defence. I went in to have some rum and water - there was a piece of work on the stairs. I went there with other people. Clayton was coming down with two or three people - I was rather in liquor, and he nearly pushed me down. I went back to the bar, and finished my glass.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave Barnett a good character.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 23rd of May, between seven and eight o'clock, the three prisoners met me - they were strangers before; they are in the same unfortunate situation as myself - they stopped me, and asked for some gin; I said I had no money - they said they would have some; Carlton and Dockerty said they would take my handkerchief off my neck, to get the gin with - Burke said, "Don't take the handkerchief - if she has not got money she cannot give us any gin;" Burke then went down <placeName id="t18300527-199-crimeloc1063">Cow-heel-alley</placeName>

            . I am an headborough of St. Luke's. About eight o'clock on Sunday morning, the 23rd of May, I was coming up Golden-lane, and saw a crowd at Cow-heel-alley; I went up, and saw Archer crying and bleeding at the mouth; she complained of having been ill-treated, and her handkerchief taken off her neck; she went with me, and pointed out the prisoners running down the lane - I followed, and lost them in Playhouse-yard; I took Dockerty in half an hour, and in half an hour afterwards I took Carlton at her mother's - she said they were the girls; Carlton told me at the station-house that she had not got the handkerchief, for a girl named Burke had it - I went to Burke, found her in bed, and the handkerchief in her room.</p>
               <p>Carlton put in a written Defence, stating that they had quarrelled with the prosecutrix, and the handkerchief had come off her neck and was picked up by the other girls.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he give you the watch again?</p>
               <p>Jones. He did not give me the watch again, but he put it down into a great chair, for I missed the watch and seized him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you seize him?</p>
               <p>Jones. I saw him in the street, and seized him, and he was brought back into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him lay the watch down?</p>
               <p>Jones . I saw him take it from under his coat, and lay it down in the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he came with a false message from Capt. Johnson: What did you say to him?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing?</p>
               <p>Stead. Yes, I lost my husband's watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it when you lost it?</p>
               <p>Stead. In a room up two pair of stairs, where I lay sick.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who took it?</p>
               <p>Stead. Yes, the prisoner took it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he took it?</p>
               <p>Stead. He came and asked, whether there was not a sailor's wife lived there, and said he had forgot her name? The nurse that was with me, told him, yes, and that her name was Stead; he said he came from Capt. Johnson in Soho-square, who had brought a letter from the West-Indies from her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing?</p>
               <p>Stead. If your lordship pleases, I'll tell you. I was very ill; he said he had not the letter then , but would bring it the next day; he went out, and came back again in half an hour, and said the Capt. will not be easy till he sees you. I said I could not go, for I was so ill that I could not tell what to do; I said I would send somebody with him, and he said it was too late; but I ordered the nurse to go with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it?</p>
               <p>Stead. About half an hour after eight at night; I got off the bed , and saw the watch hanging up; he sidled up to the chimney-piece, and put one hand up, with his handkerchief in it, to his face, to hide what he was doing, and the other he put up to the watch; he had a sort of bundle in his breast, and I was afraid he had got pistols, and that he would shoot me; then he took the watch, and said your servant madam, and run down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the watch again?</p>
               <p>Stead. No, nor I never saw the prisoner till he went before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Stead. The day that Mrs. Jones took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see the watch in the room while I was there?</p>
               <p>Stead . Yes: I went to Newgate to see him, and found him out among the prisoners, tho' he was in disguise: I asked him concerning the watch, but he would not tell me where the watch was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had I the same cloaths on then as I have now?</p>
               <p>Stead. No; you had a duffle coat, a check'd shirt, and a colour'd handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Mary Blundell (the nurse.) The prisoner came and asked for Mrs. Stead.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed in the room the first time he went there?</p>
               <p>Blundell . I was not there the first time, but I was the second, and my mistress looked at the watch to see what it was o'clock; the watch was there when he was there; I went along with him, and he run away from me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go along with him?</p>
               <p>Blundell . I was to go to the Captain's, and I went all over Soho-square, and enquired of all the chairmen, and every where, and there was no such person as Capt. Johnson.</p>

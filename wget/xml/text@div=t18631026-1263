I am a boot and shoe maker, of Westow-hill, Forest-hill—I have also a house at 5, Church-street, Deptford—on the night of 30th September, I left that house about half-past 10—I locked the shop up, and put the key in my pocket—I left my little nephew and an old man, who works for me, in the house—they had gone to bed—I returned at twenty minutes before 12—I had some difficulty in opening the door—I did not examine my shop that night—I merely went in, and locked the door, and went to bed—on the following afternoon I made an examination; I found the door had been forced open; the screw of the latch had been forced right through—I missed fourteen pairs of strong boots, value 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner had worked for me about a month before—I received some infor<lb></lb>mation from the witness Brown that day, in consequence of which I gave information to the police, and went with them and saw the prisoner taken into custody.</p>

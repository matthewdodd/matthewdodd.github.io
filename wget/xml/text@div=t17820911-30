I shewed them some flowered muslins, then they desired to look at some plain, then returned again to the flowered, and had one yard and a quarter, at 6 s. a yard, and went away, nobody was in the shop at the time, and nobody came in after. I saw the muslin till they came in, and missed the muslins directly, I followed them into Bell-lane; they went into a public-house, and

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father, John Warner, and another—we are brass-founders, in Jewin-crescent, Cripplegate. The prisoner had been in the service of our firm twelve or fifteen months—her was to lacquer brass articles after they were finished by the mikes—she came at half-past nine o'clock in the morning, and left at five in the evening—on the 14th of December I went to a pawnbroker in St. John-street, and saw some articles I knew were mine—I went to the prison<lb></lb>er's house the same evening, with an officer—I found there a bottle-jack, two brass figures, three pairs of candlesticks, and some duplicates, and gave her into custody—she said she was very much distressed—I said I thought it exceedingly strange that she should do such a thing, but I made her no promise—she said it never would have been had it not been for the good-for-nothing old woman, Mrs. Eagles, who had given her all the articles.</p>

Warners' service, and have been brought from South<lb></lb>lampton, to enable the prisoner to put any questions to me—I had sold the prisoner a tea-kettle, and some candlesticks of this shape, but not this pattern, also a warming-pan, a lamp, and footman—part of these things would go through her hands—the figures would, but the stands of these did not belong to our manufactory—it is not customary for Messrs.

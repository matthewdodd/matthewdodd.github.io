On Tuesday, 30th Nov., about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner carrying something from Mr. Robinson's granary—on seeing me he put it down on the ground, and stood still until I came up to him—I found a quantity of oats in a nose-bag, and asked what he was going to do with them—he said they were for his horse—I said, "Your stable is not on this side the road"—he was going across the road from the granary; he said, "No, I brought them from the granary"—I said, "Does Mr. Robinson allow you access to his granary when you like?"—he said, "No, do not say anything about it, I got in with a key which I found"—he gave me a key, which I tried; it fitted the lock—there were three pecks of oats in the nose-bag.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Edwin Webb—Lambert is my niece—about six weeks ago I saw a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in an envelope in a drawer in my room, in my sister's house, which is the house of the prisoner's mother—I missed the note a fortnight after I saw it—I know the number of it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the note; No. 89,998—I afterwards went to the house of Heritage, and asked her whether Lambert was there—she said no, she had not seen her—I asked her whether she had not been there all night, she said "No"—I asked her whether she had been purchasing any new things—she said no, she had not—she said what new things she had got in the house were what she had bought for her and her two daughters—she said she knew nothing aboutit, nor had she seen her spend any money at her place—I asked her if she had seen Lambert with any money, and she said she had not—I told her what she had robbed me of, and she said she did not know anything at all about it—I fetched a policeman and she still said she had nothing—the policeman searched and found a lot of new things in the place—Lambert said she had given her a sovereign—I told Heritage what Lambert said, and she did not deny it—she gave up a half-crown of the money—she said she paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. where she changed the note, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the girl gave her when she came back—she did not say the name of the person.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Heritage.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Ohilton, an eating-house and beer-house keeper at Plaistow—on 13th March, Heritage brought this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and tendered it in payment for a bill of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that her husband owed me—I took the note and went up-stairs to fetch down the change for her; I found I had not sufficient—I applied to my next-door neighbour, Mr. Bradbury, who changed it for me—Heritage said that she had a sister who had died, at Pontefract, in Yorkshire; that her sister had left her a legacy, and that the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was an advance of that legacy.</p>
               <p>

               <p>clothes in her place belonging to Lambert—she said, no; what new things there were in the house, she had bought with some money, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that she had received from some friend—I then searched the house, and found a pair of new boots concealed in the back-room up-stairs under some matting; and I found the skirt of a new dress; it was brought to me by Heritage's little girl, who stated to me that it was Lambert's—I found a pair of sleeves in a drawer in the front parlour, and two jackets—I also had a bonnet brought to me by Heritage's daughter; I told Heritage she must put her bonnet on and go with me—she put her hand in her pocket, and gave me a half-crown—I said, "Whose is that?"—she said, "That belongs to Lambert; she gave it me to take care of"—I then received 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Heritage's daughter—the daughter is fourteen years old—I then conveyed the prisoners to the police-station—on the way Lambert said, "I did take the note"—Heritage was about a step before me then—she might have heard what Lambert said—I told Lambert she must mind what she was saying as I might say it against her—she said she did not care, she would speak the truth—she said, "I did steal the note"—I did not then tell Heritage what Lambert had said—Lambert also said, I gave it to Heritage to mind for me; she had it a month; she went and changed it, having a beer score to pay—I can't say whether Heritage heard that—she did not say anything—I can't say whether she could have heard it—she was not above a yard and a half before us—she might have heard it—I never told Heritage afterwards what Lambert had told me—I gave it in my evidence before the Magistrate—I found some more things in a woman's house named Mayne, bought by this money—I took Mrs. Mayne also to the station—Heritage heard the statement Mrs. Mayne made about those articles—they were all together—Mrs. Mayne stated that the girl came to her house and stated that she had left her situation and was going to another, and would she assist her in making up her things.</p>

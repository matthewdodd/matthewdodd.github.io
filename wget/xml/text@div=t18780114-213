I am the prisoner's wife, and live with him at 14, Bloxam's Buildings, Denmark Hill—on Saturday afternoon, 22nd Dec., became home about half-past three—he had been drinking, but was not to say drunk—we had a few words because he would not give me his money as he usually did—he went out several times for a few minutes, and about 6 o'clock, after I had given the children something to eat, he jumped up and caught hold of me by the right arm, and shut the room door—I screamed out—my landlord came and pushed the door open—I struggled into the passage and outside the street door—he said "Come in, you silly woman"—I said "No, you have a knife"—I did not see the knife, but I thought he had one by the way he acted—he swung his right arm round four times, and the fourth time the knife went into my arm—he then went indoors—I stayed out in the front, holding on to the fence till the policeman came—it was only the one blow—the wound bled—I was attended by a doctor for three days.</p>

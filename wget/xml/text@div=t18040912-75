               <p>Q. Did you pursue him? - A. No, he stopped at the hosier's window; I went out, and going across I saw another hat gone; I pursued him, and took him with the hat; this was the third hat I had lost within the space of two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the hat from him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your property? - A. Yes; I brought him into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the hat? - A. Five shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What is your partner's name? - A. I have none.</p>
               <p>Q. The hat was upon a rail, extended from your shop into Middle-row? - A. No farther than the depth of a hat crown.</p>
               <p>Q. But at the outside of the window, that if any body was walking along, or if there was a croud, they might easily be knocked down? - A. They could not, for this reason; they are tied.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner drunk or sober? - A. At the time, I thought he was intoxicated; I will not swear one way or the other.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen him there before? - A. I had seen him there about two hours; I did not observe him the whole time; I had business that called me out, and when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120072"></xptr>I came back, in the space of two or three minutes, he took the hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. - Q. Do not you know that a party of soldiers had a dinner, and had been drinking, at the corner public-house? - A. At the Cock and

             the soldiers were dining.</p>

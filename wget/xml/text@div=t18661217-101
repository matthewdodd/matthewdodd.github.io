                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—I returned home with him about half-past eleven on the evening of 20th October—I was sober—my husband had had too much—my boy was rather rude, and he was going to hit him, I wanted to prevent him and got knocked down or fell down, I then felt some hot water on my right arm—I was lying on my stomach—I rose my head a little and saw the water pouring out of the kettle—it was a very heavy kettle—my husband had it in his hand, I sup<lb></lb>posed</p>

               <p>him to be trying to save it if he could—it was very near the hearth—I became insensible for a few minutes—the water was poured over the upper part of my arm and head—it was a very awkward fireplace, the least thing would knock the kettle off—my husband was rather out of temper with the boy and me—my arm was dressed by a surgeon—I have no use of it now—it was done momentarily—I think the kettle must have fallen down.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother and stepfather (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>)—I recollect their coming home on 28th October—he was very drunk—mother seemed as if she had had one glass—I wanted to get her into bed, to get her away from him—an old lady who lives there came in and wanted to help get her into bed; the prisoner would not let her, he was going to turn her out, mother would not let him—he threw her on the bed and knocked her head against the wainscoat, he then threw her on the floor, then lifted her up on a chair and set her on his knee—they then both fell down together, he picked her up, she wanted to get away from him, and then he threw her again on the floor by the side of the fender, and the kettle somehow came over them, I don't know how—I did not see the kettle in his hand at all.</p>

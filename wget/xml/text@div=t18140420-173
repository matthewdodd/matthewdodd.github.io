On my going up stairs I observed to my servant maid that there was a strong smell of sulpher; that I would be satisfied as to the cause. As I went towards the accompting-house, the smell was stronger still. I could perceive no fire. I then went through a passage into the back warehouse or shop. The first thing that struck my attention was a private door being opened, and a table removed that generally stood against it, and a can of oil thrown down. I immediately suspected some one had entered the house. Being without a weapon I went to the dining-room and procured a poker, and returned to the spot. Underneath a bench I observed a man secreted, or secreting himself. I told him to come out, which he did; but the moment he came out he sprang at my collar; I parried him off, and struck him on the side of the head with the poker. I knocked him down, but observing him to be upon the alert, (I had not injured him sufficiently so as to prevent him injuring me), therefore as he was rising I struck him another blow upon the back of his head, but not so hard as to prevent him closing with me, and in that act the candle went out or fell from my hand. I was anxious to get him towards the front door. My servant had gone to that door, and had called for assistance. I dragged him towards it, but in going through the passage I had to open a door; at that moment he sprang out of my hand and ran into the street; I pursued him, and called watch, but I could scarce perceive him twenty paces from me; and being fearful of misguiding the hue and cry, I stood still, and called watch. After some time, the patrol came up, and he and I searched the premises together to see if we could find any one else. We could find no one else, but we found a pair of boots and a hat. While we were making this search, the watchman of St. Sepulchre's parish came to tell me that he had taken the prisoner, and he was in the watchhouse. I went there; the prisoner was there with his head bleeding very much, and he owned the hat and the boots immediately. I asked him if he meant to murder me; he said, God forbid. I asked him what drove him to commit the act; he said, necessity. I think he said he was driven to it by distress. It was not until after, in the day time, that I found the lock of my desk had been forced, and this instrument I found. I found the wood work had been cut away from the lock; the bolt is perforated with this instrument; it is the blade of a plough that a bookbinder uses. That instrument was found in the passage.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 19th of March last, I stopped the prisoner in Skinner-street, about two o'clock in the morning. He was without hat and shoes; his head was all over blood. I took him to the watchhouse, and I took Mr. Ayres to see the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the night this happened I had been over the water to see my father; returning back to my wife, I was knocked down on the bridge. I was stunned with the blow. Coming along Fleet-market I laid me down and slept, and when I awoke I was alarmed with the cry of stop thief. I lost my hat and boots. I was so alarmed when I got to the watchhouse I did not know what I said to questions they asked me.</p>

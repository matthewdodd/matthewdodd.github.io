            . I held an appointment in the Customs, and am superannuated with a pension. I have known the prisoner Rigaud nearly two years - he lived over Westminster-bridge; I forget the name of the place. I first knew the female prisoner about May last, by taking her two letters from Rigaud; she then lived in the Borough - I saw her once there: she and Rigaud afterwards lived together, as man and wife, at Kentish-town. I frequently went there of a morning, and always found them both there - she went by the name of Rigaud. Last summer Rigaud proposed to me to go to Margate with him, as he was going to see a sick sister, at the baths at Boulogne - this was the Thursday before Sunday, the 10th of July. I at first objected, on account of leaving my wife, not being in the habit of ever leaving her. Rigaud said a sea voyage would be the best thing for my health - he prevailed on me to go. The two prisoners and I went down on Sunday, the 10th, and on Monday we went round the island, and to Ramsgate, to see after the packet, which was gone, or they would have started that day for France - we returned to Margate, and on Tuesday, the 12th, went to Dover; we got there about five o'clock in the afternoon, and while we were at tea Rigaud took a letter and a paper from his pocket, which he said was from Mr. Collins, whom I knew - Rigaud told the female prisoner it was a commission, and must be executed before they went to France, and that next morning he was sure of receiving a remittance, which he had written to Mr. Collins for; he immediately quitted his chair, and went out, and when he returned he said he had found two clergymen, and therefore should be sure - but we must make haste, as they were going out; he said I was to see the lady sign the commission, and to sign it also.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you knew the female prisoner by the name of Rigaud? A. Yes, and also as Eliza Foster, in May or the end of April, before they lived at Kentish-town - he said her maiden name was Eliza Foster; I never called her Eliza Foster till we got to Dover, but there he informed me she was entitled to some property, coming from a deceased relation, I think an aunt, and the reason of his wishing to hide the name of Rigaud was that she was of age, and had been kept by Lord Oxford, and, as his wife had left him, they should be very comfortable together.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he first tell you her name was Foster? - A. In April or May, when I first knew her. When we were at Dover I accompanied both the prisoners to a clerymen's house - he was out, and we went to the Rev. Matthew Armstrong's - the female prisoner was sworn - Rigaud and I witnessed her affidavit; we then went back to Payne's Hotel. Next day the prisoners set off for France, and I for London.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this affidavit - whose signature is this,"John Green," as a witness to it? A. It is not mine; the first time I saw this one, was in Mr. Freshfield's, the solicitor's, office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Rigaud at Hayes-place, Lisson-green? A. Yes, about the latter end of August; I was there one morning when he asked me to witness a power of attorney, for selling stock - I did so; this is it (looking at it) - it is signed Eliza Foster; I have attested - the signature I saw the female prisoner sign, and Rigaud witness it; I hesitated to witness it - he said it was merely signing the power of attorney, to avoid her going forward through the pressure of a crowd.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What do you represent yourself to be? A. I was formerly comptroller for the port of Xerumentra - I have ceased to be so six or seven years; since that I have been endeavouring to recover a large property, but have not succeeded. I am nephew of Mrs. Margaret Farmer, and have a suit before the Court of Chancery, upon that claim; that is not the claim in which I said I did not succeed. I have met with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160004"></xptr>>no opposition from the Bank solicitor on that claim, except being sent to the Court of Chancery. I knew

            ; I have lost sight of him five or six years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he live at No. 9, Manor-terrace, Chelsea? A. I cannot swear that; I had given all my affairs into Rigaud's hands, as agent, to recover 50,000l. for me; he has mutilated my papers, and taken me in. I represented that Oldham lived at No. 9, Manor-terrace, at a Mrs. Day's - I believe he lived there, but never went to see.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not call at that very house, and desire Mrs. Day if anybody called to inquire for Oldham, to say he lived there, but was out of town? A. No. I went there for Rigaud - I did not at first recollect the place. I visited a Mr. Day there, but you said Mrs. Day - I saw several women there, but whether any of them was Mrs. Day I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You visited them? A. No - I have been there with Rigaud, but never eat or drank in the house. I believe I went there but twice - I do not think I ever went there alone - I might, but it was after Rigaud had taken me there. On my oath I do not recollect going there alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not call on Mrs. Day and say something about James Scuddemore Oldham? A. I went with Rigaud - he went into a house just by, and begged I would deliver that message to Mr. Day; Rigaud had no waistcoat, and was ashamed to go himself to the house, and begged of me to call and say if Mr. James Scuddemore Oldham was not in town, to inform any person who inquired after him that that was the case - I delivered that message to some woman. I have often seen Rigaud without a waistcoat - this was in April or May 1825; it was five or six months before we went to Margate, which was on the 10th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did you know the prisoner Baker's mother, who lived at No. 3, Brandon-row? A. I never saw her mother. I took two letters to Brandon-row for Rigaud - he stood at the corner of the row at the time; we were walking into the City together, and he requested me to leave them, as he had promised to keep away from the house - I do not know that the name of the place is Brandon-row, but it was close by the King's Bench Prison. I saw a woman there, who immediately called the female prisoner down, on my saying I had a letter for Eliza; I do not know whether that woman was her mother - Rigaud said she worked for a Mrs. Baker, and I should see"Mantua-making done here" written up; I never knew the girl's name was Baker till she was a prisoner - I was told she was Eliza Foster when I went with the letter - I did not know her by any other name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you knew her as Mrs. Rigaud? A. I never knew her go by any other name than Rigaud; I never thought her his wife, because I knew his wife. - When I delivered the letters to her, Rigaud told me she wanted two months of being of age. I entered into no bond whatever - I signed some papers. I do not know what a bond is - not an Ecclesiastical bond.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you not introduce a woman to Rigaud yourself at Dover, as Eliza Foster? A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not represent to Rigaud that Eliza Foster, living at Dover, was entitled to property of her aunt's, in the Bank, and request him to manage the business? A. I never did in my life. On our arrival at Dover a letter was received from Mr. Collins, enclosing the commission to Rigaud; we went to Mr. Armstrong's about six or seven o'clock in the evening, I think, and were there ten or twenty minutes; there was a curtain put down, and candles in the room - I cannot say what time it was. Rigaud received a letter next morning, from Collins, with 25l. - they then set off for Calias and I for town; I did not see them again till about the end of August. I never wrote to Rigaud on this matter. The signature to the affidavit is not my writing. I have never said I did not see Baker sign her name. I gave evidence at Bow-street, and do not know whether my evidence was taken down - something was read over to me. I read the paper which Baker signed at Lisson-grove - it was left in Rigaud's possession. I first saw the paper with my name to it in Mr. Freshfield's office in November - he shewed me three or four papers; the affidavit was shewn to me, but I never saw the power of attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person named

            ? A. I knew him about two years ago, when I had the misfortune to be in Whitecross-street prison, for about ten days; he was steward of the ward. About April 1825 I went to ask Alfrey to become one of my securities to a bond I was to give upon administering. I saw Rigaud in White cross-street prison after I made this communication to Mr. Freshfield - he gave me some duplicates in Whitecross street prison; I redeemed the property, pawned it again, and lost 6s. 6d. by it. I gave him the duplicates and a sovereign out of my own pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. How came you to go to Mr. Day's in Manor-terrace? A. I had met Rigaud with Day.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to call at Brandon-row? A. When I got to the Elephant and Castle Rigaud asked me to deliver a letter to a lady, and said he would give it to me when he got to the corner of the street - I delivered it without looking at the direction; I recollect the female prisoner had her thimble on, and her needle in her hand. This is the instrument that was executed at Mr. Armstrong's (looking at it) - it has my signature. I saw the other parties sign it; I thought it extraordinary that Rigaud read it instead of Mr. Armstrong.</p>

            . I live at Dover. On the 12th of July, 1825, this commission was put into my hands - I administered the oath to the party described as Eliza Foster - the bond was then executed; the commission and bond were returned to the parties, who went away with it - I do not know any of the parties, - I perfectly recognize Rigaud's features, but cannot connect him with this proceeding.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect what time of day this happened? A. No; I only recollect the transaction by having signed the papers.</p>
               <p>The following documents were here read - the commission and oath, the bond, which described Eliza Foster as living<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160005"></xptr>>at Dover, and Rigaud at Fir-tree cottage, Camden-town; also the letters of administration, and power of attorney.</p>
               <p>MR. WATSON. I am a clerk to my brother, a proctor, of Doctors' Commons. Rigaud gave me instructions to extract these letters of administration - I afterwards received this letter from him, by the two-penny post; I believe it to be his hand-writing - I had seen him write before. I obtained the commission, affidavit, and bond, according to the letter - I received the bond back, inclosed in a letter, and extracted the letters of administration.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had Rigaud employed you before? A. I had seen him several times before, as surety in administrations.</p>
               <p>Rigaud's letter to Mr. Watson, with instructions for a commission, in order to obtain letters of administration, in the name of Eliza Foster, of Dover, neice, and only next of kin of Mary Foster, late of Brook-street, Holborn, naming Francis James Rigaud, of Fir-tree cottage, Camden-town, and John Green, of Camden-terrace, as sureties, was here read.</p>

If was brought back again on the 8th of August, 1825, and on the 11th of August it is transferred to Eliza Foster, spinster, administratrix to Mary Foster, of Brook-street, by power of attorney, (granted to Messrs. Everett,) to Peter-Bacon, of the Stock-exchange.</p>

In July, last year, both the prisoners came to me at Calais; Rigaud called on me alone, and next day introduced Baker to me, as Mrs. Rigaud - I had never seen her before; (looking at a letter, signed Mary Collins) - this is not my hand-writing; it bears a very trifling resemblance to mine: it is a better hand than mine; I know no such person as Miss Eliza Foster, of Dover, to whom it is addressed; it says, "Favoured by Thomas Jones, Esq.;" I know no such person; I do not know the aunt of Eliza Foster. No Mary Foster was ever in my service - I was never at Philadelphia.</p>

The letter signed Mary Collins was dated Bordeaux, the 27th of June, 1825, addressed to Eliza Foster, Dover, informing her of the death of her aunt, Mary Foster, on her passage from Philadelphis, with the writer, stating that she had left a small sum in the Bank, Long Annuities, when she had left England in the writer's service, and advising her to administer, in order to obtain the same.</p>

On 24th May I went to the corner of Gray's Inn Road, in consequence of information, with Constable Bannister —I saw the prisoner leave a public-house with another man—they went into Holborn then into Leather Lane, and then into a thoroughfare in Back Hill—they remained there about half a minute and then went into the Farringdon Road, talking for a few minutes—they separated, the other officer followed the one and I followed the prisoner into a urinal—I said to him "Have you any bad money?" (the other officer had joined me at that time)—he said "If I have I am not aware of it"—we took the prisoner a little way' and searched him—a brown paper packet containing three paper parcels, and in each parcel was ten counterfeit shillings, each divided by a piece of paper, had been found by the other officer in the prisoner's great coat pocket; he asked him where the other man was, and he said that he was with no other man—I said "How can you say that when I watched you myself with the other officer at the corner of the Gray's Inn Road?" he said "I never saw that man before in my life" he was quite half an hour with that man—it was pouring with rain the whole time—the other officer took him to the station and I walked close behind—he had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good money—I was in plain clothes.</p>

On 24th May I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner and another man coming out of a public-house—I made a communi cation to Harnell, who joined me—I followed them to Leather Lane—they went into the Coach and Horses, and after that up the Farringdon Road near a lamp post, they were evidently examining something under the lamp—they then separated—the inspector and I were together then—the other man ran sharply towards the corner and I ran, but could not see him—I rejoined the inspector—I went to a urinal, took hold of the prisoner's right hand and said "What became of the other man?"—he said "I have been with no other man"—I said "You have, and I know what your game is, and I have been watching you some time," or "some days;" I had watched them on a previous occasion—he afterwards said "I have never seen that man but three times in ray life"—the inspector asked him if he had any bad money in his possession and he said "If I have I am not aware of it, you can take me to my place of business and search me"—I had known them</p>

               <p>both by sight—we took him into the fire engine station, searched him, and in his right hand great coat pocket I found this packet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there were three packets wrapped up in newspaper, each containing ten counter<lb></lb>feit shillings rolled in paper separating each shilling—this was underneath a handkerchief and a tobacco pouch—I said "Harry, there is something wrong here," and I opened the packet and saw what they were—I said "Here is a load and a half of <hi rend="italic">brakes</hi>" that is a slang term for shillings—the prisoner said "Good gracious, that man must have put them in my pocket"—I said "Then in that case the best thing you can do is to tell me where to find that man"—he said that he did not know where to find him—I found two florins, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers, good money, upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw what Harnell saw—I have no doubt his eyes are as good as mine—I heard Harnell give his evidence—I did not hear him say anything about examining something—the prisoner had something in his hand, it appeared from where we were standing to be of paper—I won't swear it was not the tobacco pouch—I knew the other man by the name of Captain; I followed him, but lost sight of him—I said that I could not swear upon which side of the prisoner the other man was walking.</p>

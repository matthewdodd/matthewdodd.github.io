               <p>Q. How long had he been your apprentice ?</p>
               <p>Cheltenham. About fifteen months. Some time past, I could not apprehend how he came by so much money as he spent, going to clubs, and being out late at nights. I ask'd him how he supported it. He said he borrowed the money. Last Monday I put six-shillings and six-pence into the till, with two farthings, all in copper. I went out of the way in the afternoon, and desired my wife to keep the children out of the shop. When I came home at night, I sent him of an errand. Then I told the money, and found nine-pence missing. In the morning I went out again, and when he came to my wife for the key, I bid her tell him I was gone out, which she did. After that I told [I had an opportunity, he being gone out] the money, and missed one-shilling and six-pence more. Then I charged him with having taken this money. He owned it, and shew'd it me in a canvas bag. I ask'd him for the key with which he open'd the till, and after some time he produced it; and after that he own'd to me he had, within a fortnight, taken out about seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promises?</p>
               <p>Cheltenham. I said, I am glad I did not mark the halfpence, and that I'd beg the court to be tender, and send him on board a ship, sooner than hang him.</p>

            . I happened to be at the prosecutor's, and heard the prosecutor charge the prisoner with taking two shillings and three-pence. He own'd it, and said he had taken about seven shillings out of the till, since he had had that key; which was about a fortnight. I saw him deliver the key to his master, and I opened the till with the key myself.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I never tried the key, and am very innocent of what I am charged with; I had borrowed half a crown on Sunday last of Mr. Twycross, and in the evening, I changed it into halfpence, being very dry, with a milkwoman in Fleet-Street, to drink a halfpenny worth of milk.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Twycross. I am a victualler, and live in Long-Lane. I have known the prisoner about a year and half, and I never heard any ill of him. He borrowed half a crown of me last Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in one piece?</p>
               <p>Twycross. I do not know that now.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it?</p>
               <p>Twycross. Much about three in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he go afterwards?</p>
               <p>Twycross. Indeed I can't tell.</p>

            . I have seen both the medals; this is the medal that I stopt, (holding one in his hand) the prisoner at the bar brought this to me, and asked me if I bought old silver; I said, Yes; he asked what I would give him for it; I said, it is a very pretty thing, may be I could give 16 or 18 s. for it; he immediately agreed to take that; I asked him how it became broke; he said he and his brother had broke it, and he had a mind to sell it; I asked him how he came by it, he could give me no account; I asked him where he lived, he first gave me a false account; I told him I should not part with him till he told me, and also how he came by it; at last he said he had it of Mitchel and that he himself lived at the Bull-and-gate in Holborn; I asked him who Mitchel was, and where he lived, he said he could not tell; upon farther asking him, he said he lived at the Half-moon tavern; I asked him if Mitchel had given it him, he said no; he said he had seen it lie in the dancing room, and he took and put it in his pocket in this condition; I carried the medal over to Mr. Holiland, and sent the prisoner over under the care of a constable.</p>

I live at the Half-moon, Cheapside, my master trusted these medals to my care; I missed them on Saturday from out of a drawer; the prisoner denied having the other medal for some time, but at last he owned he took them both, and that he took them out of the drawer; he afterwards carried me to a silversmith, in St. Paul's Church-yard, there he had sold the silver of the other; there we found it.</p>

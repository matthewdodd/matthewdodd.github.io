               <p>What were the words he said? - He said, I insist on you to untie your cloak; I untied it, and he took it from off my shoulders; then he insisted on my pocket handkerchief, which I gave him, and he lapped my cloak in the pocket handkerchief, and gave it to a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270071"></xptr>man that I never saw before or since; and the prisoner gave the two shillings to that other man also; he kept nothing to himself: the prisoner twice wanted to run away, and I held him by the hand; and the third time he wanted to get away; I ran and shouted, stop thief! I never lost sight of him till he was stopped; it was a moon-light night, and I saw clear: then he was taken to the watch-house: it was about half past eight: I am sure of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court. Upon the oath that you have taken, are you really married to this man or not? - No; we are not married; but we stand together such as man and wife: it does not signify.</p>
               <p>Court. Then, gentlemen, there is an end of this indictment: the law requires the property should be proved as laid.</p>

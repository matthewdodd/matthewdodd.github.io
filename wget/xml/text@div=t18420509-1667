                  </hi>. I am a sawyer, and live at Woolwich. On the 19th of April, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the sign of the Duke on Horseback. The prisoner was then sitting on my right-hand side, close to me—after sitting some time I found his hand in my pocket, and caught hold of it—I missed my money, and collared him—he tried to get away—I charged him with robbing me—Inspector Browne came up outside the house, and I think the prisoner said, "I have got your money"—I can swear I had two half-crowns, a sixpence, and some halfpence, but I cannot say how many—I missed my handkerchief from my hat, which was on my right-hand side—there was nobody but us two sitting there—I had given him some bread and cheese and beer, because he asked me for charity.</p>

Q.</hi> Had you and I been previously at any other public-house drinking together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—you followed me into the Duke on Horseback—you remained in the same room as I did—I went into another room besides the room I was robbed in, the back tap-room—then we came into the parlour, the bar is opposite the parlour—we sat in one room, but we went into the tap-room—you and I were in the tap-room first—previous to that I was with you at the Ordnance Arms—we staid there perhaps three-quarters of an hour—we went in between eleven and twelve o'clock—you kept following me from one house to another—I wanted to get rid of you—I do not know that I was in any other house with you—I started in the morning with a sovereign and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I said I had got 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the remainder of the money was yours—did you change the sovereign in my presence, so that I might see you had the money? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I changed it at the Crown and Anchor, Market-hill, about half-past six o'clock in the morning—I had a friend with me, who saw me change it—I never saw you till between eleven and twelve—I was a little intoxicated, but I could take care of myself—you were neither drunk or sober—you never said you must go, and did not want to drink more—you followed me into the room—we were about forty yards from the house when Browne came up—you did not tell the landlord in my presence that you had my money, till I got you outside the house—I charged you at the station with stealing two half-crowns and my handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the R division of police. About five o'clock in the evening I saw a crowd at the corner of Beresford-street, about forty or fifty yards from the Duke on Horseback, which is on the other side of High-street, I went up and saw the prisoner and prose<lb></lb>cutor struggling—I asked the meaning of it—the prosecutor said, "He has got my money, he has robbed me"—the prisoner was evidently trying to get away—he put his hand into his pocket and took out two half-crowns and sixpence, and said, "Here is his money, I have got it"—I took him to the station, and found this cotton handkerchief in his hat.</p>

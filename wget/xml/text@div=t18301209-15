               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know Mr. White, who keeps a shop near yours? A. Yes, nearly opposite; the Bell public-house is next door but one to me- I did not perceive that the prisoner was intoxicated; he might have been so without my observing it - the sound I heard was more like a person falling against the window, than it being starred; I have a show-glass, and the inside pane of that was also broken; the watch could have been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090015"></xptr>taken without breaking that - the watch hung on a brass rail in a row: the pane was nearly all broken to pieces - a window is starred very gently: this was a loud crash - I was not aware that a watch had been gone till the prisoner presented it; I have found that he lives with his parents in Ratcliff-highway, a very short distance from me - he is a journeyman cabinet-maker; I was rather confused at the moment, and did not perceive whether any part of his person was cut.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The show-glass was broken? A. Yes - the watches hung between the window and the windowsash, which is only to keep the dust from the goods, and slides; the space between the two sashes is about fifteen inches - the outer window being broken would be sufficient to get the goods; they were both broken at the same time.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty on the 30th of October in Ratcliff-highway, at half-past ten o'clock, and heard a rattling of glass - I was ten yards from the spot; I ran down as fast as I could, and when I came up to Horne's window, he had the prisoner by the collar; I saw the watch in the prisoner's right-hand - he delivered it to Mr. Horne, who gave him in charge; I took him to the watch-house - Horne brought the watch to the station, and delivered it to serjeant Morgan, who gave it to me - on the road to the watch-house I asked the prisoner the reason he did such a barefaced trick as to break a window in that kind of way; I did not make him either threat or promise- he said he had done what he meant - that he meant to break the window and take the watch, but did not say for what reason.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you there at the beginning of it? A. I did not see him break the window - I heard the glass rattle; he did not appear the least in liquor when I took him to the watch-house; I swear that from his conversation, and his walking so quietly with me all the way; he never resisted in the least - he was in my care for I suppose a quarter of an hour, while I was taking him to the watch-house, and did not appear the least intoxicated, while in my care; nobody was present when I had this conversation with him - the prosecutor did not accompany us to the watch-house; he said he meant to break the window and take the watch, but did not say whether he meant to thieve it, or to do it out of spite, or what.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure he did not say he meant to break the window, but not to break the watch? A. No, he said to break the window and take the watch - he did not speak loud; I cannot swear he had not drank any thing, but he appeared to be sober while walking with me.</p>

            . This is my watch, and hung in my window; I had never seen the prisoner before to my knowledge: I did not know his father then, but his mother used my shop - I never quarrelled with her; the price of the watch is 4/. 10s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you had property of more value exposed in your window? A. This was the highest priced watch; there were other goods there - the officer came up in a minute; the prisoner was standing on the pavement - I never saw him on the ground, nor did I see him get up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was intoxicated at the time, and as I passed the shop I slipped by some means, and fell with my arm in; I suppose by some means the wrist of my coat must have got entangled with the watch; I found it in my possession - I just went to the door and delivered it to Mr. Horne - I do not recollect whether he was outside the door or not.</p>

            . I keep a shop nearly opposite Mr. Horne, in Ratcliffe-highway, and am a grocer and cheesemonger. I was standing on the curb-stone, opposite my window, looking at Mr. Horne's window, and saw the prisoner walking on Mr. Horne's side - he appeared very intoxicated, from the way he fell into the window; he made a sudden stagger and went right up against Mr. Horne's brass bar, which protects the window, with his elbow and arms through the glass - he recovered himself and went about half a yard, or nearly a yard, and stood there till Horne came out to him - I went across in about five minutes, and it was said the young man had got the watch in his hand, and I made some observation; I had seen the prisoner several times - his mother is a neighbour; I have been acquainted with her these six years - as far as I could judge this was accidental; there was time for him to have got away if he was disposed, but he stood turning his face towards Horn's window - when I crossed over he appeared quite stupid and senseless, that might have been seen by any body.</p>

            . I live next door to Mr. Horne. I was standing in my shop, and heard the crash of the broken glass - I ran to the door; some persons were collected, but not a great many - I saw the prisoner among others; he was extending the watch in his hand, saying,"I am the man, I am the man," repeatedly, and he went on towards Mr. Horne's door immediately, and very eagerly returned Mr. Horne's watch - his conduct appeared very strange to me; I should rather have taken him almost for a madman from the way he spoke - he did not appear in possession of his faculties, far from it.</p>

On the evening of the 30th of October, the prisoner came into the house between nine and ten o'clock - he was drunk then; he had half a glass of gin at our house - his mother came and took the rest away from him.</p>

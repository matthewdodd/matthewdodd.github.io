Tucker and Forman, of Chard, and had the papers sent there—I also wrote to them to see what could be done, and got this letter from them, which I believe I showed the prisoner, to show him that I could not be made safe—I then received this letter from the prisoner, it is written by him. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 30th August, 1867, from the prisoner to Mr. M. T. Bartlett, stating that he would come' down to-morrow afternoon and have a chat about drawing out the money.</hi>) On 1st September I sent the prisoner this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was from M. T. Bartlett to the prisoner, stating that he did not see how he could secure himself even by a life policy, and had not had any letter from his sister saying that he could do so.</hi>) On the 19th September I received this letter from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 18th September, 1867, stating</hi>, "Polly is extremely anxious to know what has been done about the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and, as I am anxious to tell her by the next mail that leaves, will you instruct Mr. Tucker what has been done?

I have enclosed Polly's authority, and if you like to go to the expense of appointing another trus<lb></lb>tee in my place I shall be glad by your giving me a proper release."

I feel sure Mary Ann will act up to whatever she agrees to, and will not repu<lb></lb>diate the authority she has signed." About the beginning of October or November the prisoner told me that he had got my brother's consent—he said he would go to the Bank of England and get a power of attorney to transfer the stock—he said he was going to send 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Australia to bring his wife home, and hoped to see her sitting in her own chair in February</p>

Grossmith's, perfumers, in Newgate Street, to be identified—when I went to the Bank of England I signed a book there, and Mr. Irving gave the prisoner a cheque—this produced is the transfer I signed.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Gethin Bartlett—I remember his receiving a power of attorney—I cannot remember the date, but Thursday, to the best of my knowledge—I saw the prisoner on that day—I was in and out of the bar parlour all the time he was there—when this paper came by post ray husband looked at it and told me it would have to be witnessed—I cannot remember all that was said, as I never expected to hear any more about it—I said to the prisoner, "Mr. Turvey has agreed to be the witness;" as near as I can remember, he asked who Mr. Turvey was, and I told him a grocer—I had spoken to Mr. Turvey in consequence of a communication between me and my husband—when the prisoner came the prisoner asked me if Mr. Turvey was handy—I said that I knew; he was not, for he had gone up the road with his cart—he said, "He will have to sign his name"—I said, "He cannot do that, for he cannot write"—the prisoner said that it was only a form, and if I put Mr. Turvey's name that would do just as well as sending it to his house—I, then put Mr. Turvey's name on the paper as a witness—this, "William Turvey,† grocer, 24, Custom House Terrace, North Woolwich Road," is my writing—the prisoner said that he was going to Red Hill to get it signed by my husband's brother—I do not remember any other signature—my husband wrote his name first, and I wrote this afterwards, and after the prisoner had had some refreshment he put the paper in his pocket and went away with it—the prisoner tried to induce my husband to sign his brother's name here, and said that, as he had signed in the Bank books, there would be no more harm in his doing so—he did not do so—it was after that that he said he would take it to Red Hill—I did not read the power—I do not know what is in it even now—I remember the Saturday when my husband came from London with the prisoner—he was not there very long—on the same evening my husband gave him two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I am a member of the firm of Irving and Slade, stockbrokers, of Copthall Court, Throgmorton Street—I first saw the prisoner at the end of September, between the 24th and the 27th—I heard a person talking to a clerk in the outer office—I saw him, and he said that he required a power of attorney—he spoke about transferring stock which stood in two names; I said that it would be necessary for the persons in whose name the stock stood to attend at the Bank of England, or to give a power of attorney—he called again on or about 30th September, and I received his instructions for a power of attorney, took them down in writing, and he signed them; this is the paper I wrote.

               <p>necessary to pay an extra fee—I believe he said that it was of no import<lb></lb>ance, or that there was no hurry for the money—I said that, as we were not acquainted with Mr. John Gethin Bartlett, it would be necessary that he should be identified by some one we knew, or by some respectable person in the City; he said that that would not be difficult, as Mr. Bartlett had lived in the City ten or eleven years, and an appointment was made for Saturday—he came on the Saturday, and said, "I have Mr. Bartlett out<lb></lb>side in a cab; you said that it would be necessary to have him identified; can you or one of your firm go with me to Newgate Street to have him identified?"—I said, "I dare say my partner will go; he is out on busi<lb></lb>ness," and the prisoner stayed till Mr. Irving returned—while he was waiting I put forward the ticket to the Bank of England, and instructed them to make the transfer; they made no objection—I went to the Bank, and saw the purchase of the stock, and the sale was concluded—I drew this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and handed it to Mr. Irving.</p>

Freshfield, but I do not think they issue them entirely in blank; the attorney's name would be in blank, but the name of the person and the stock never is—when a power of attorney is given out and sent into the country, I am perfectly convinced that the head part is filled up, because we always make an entry in our books before we send a power away—the date would be left blank till the person signs it—the name of the person "John Gethin Bartlett" is filled in in the middle—the name of the attorney is left blank, it is filled up now—if not correctly described in the Bank books they would not issue the power.</p>

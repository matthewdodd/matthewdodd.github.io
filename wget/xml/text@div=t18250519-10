               <p>MR. LEE conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>MR. JOSIAH ROBERT HARRISON. In the year 1819 I was in possession of one hundred sets of prints from the original plates of Hogarth; there were one hundred and eight in each set; they were delivered by the printer to my friend Williams<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190010"></xptr>- I found them at his premises, where I had directed them to be sent - I examined, and collated them there, with the assistance of the witness Steeds; they were in a ware room, which I frequently went to, and were removed in December, 1821, by the carrier, to Thornton-heath, near Croydon, where I resided; I saw the bundles from time to time, but whether they were correct or not I could not tell, not having occasion to examine them - I moved from there to Brixton in October or November, 1823, and they were moved in a caravan, and were constantly under my observation till May 1824, when I counted the bundles, and found the number of bundles correct, but on opening them I found eleven bundles contained five sets instead of six - I have never seen them since. I inquired about the trade if such impressions had been offered for sale - the retail price was twenty guineas a set, and the wholesale price 15 l. 5 s.; I never sold a set under that price - there were no sets in the market at any time, except two, which I sold to Mr. Wilkinson, and I have since had them back. On the 30th of April I saw the prisoner, and told him I understood he had delivered four or five sets of Hogarth's prints, to Mr. Harding, for sale, and begged to know where he got them from; I said nothing whatever to induce him to confess. In answer to my question he said they were my prints, and that he took them from my parcels.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When you saw him he was in Newgate? A. No, at his own house in Great Bell-alley, Coleman-street; I told him I had been robbed, and understood he had sold four or five sets, and said, "Bannantine, as it is said you have done so, pray tell me how you got them."</p>
               <p>Q. Were you desirous of discovering the receiver? A. My object was to discover all who were concerned; I had no suspicion then who the receiver was: I have now.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your object now to prosecute the receiver if you can find him? A. That will depend upon circumstances. Dixon, the printer, delivered the prints at Mr. Williams's, by my order; I put no mark on them: there are no others like them; we can distinguish them from other impressions by the colour of the paper and ink. I can swear to both.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Harrison's employ. In July 1819, I received these prints - I ticked off Mr. Dixon's bill (which I produce) when they were delivered, and if I found one impression more that was stated in the bill, I put it down in pencil. I found one hundred complete sets, and some odd prints; I collated them all at Mr. Williams's, in Cornhill, and tied them in parcels of six sets each - I could tell them from any other impressions, both from the ink and paper. I was in the house of Messrs. Boydell and Co. eight or nine years - I never knew these impressions sold for less than 15 l. 5 s. in the trade. The prisoner was Mr. Williams's shopman; the prints were at the top of the house at first, but afterwards moved down to where he had access. I know these prints by the colour of the ink, the paper, and method of printing - I produce a set.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know where they came from? A. From Dixon's, who printed them; I did not see them delivered: I found them at Mr. Williams's, and collated them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did these come from to night? A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were these produced before the Magistrate? A. I did not examine them; there were some there bound in a similar manner. Both the sets which I have examined are undoubtedly two of what were at Mr. Williams's.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. How can you take on yourself to say that? A. The colour of the paper and appearance altogether convince me of it.</p>

            . I am a copper-plate printer, and was employed by Mr. Harrison, who bought these plates of Messrs. Boydell and Co.; I printed one hundred copies from these original plates, by his direction; there might have been one or two over, but they were all sent: we sometimes have an accident, and do not like to send a bad impression. I cannot identify them by this light, as my eyes are not good.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not print them with your own hands? A. No. I looked them all over; I am sure there was not two extra copies taken, for I saw them taken off the press; it could not be done behind my back.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. When prints of such consequence are entrusted to you, you exercise more than ordinary care about them? A. Oh! Yes. I have been a printer forty years.</p>

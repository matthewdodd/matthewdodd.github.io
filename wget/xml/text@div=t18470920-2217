                  </hi> I am the wife of William Bywater, of St. Paul's Deptford—I knew the deceased for seven years—her name was Mary Hutch<lb></lb>ings—she was the prisoner's wife—I lived next door to them. On Sunday evening the 22nd of Aug., I was called into their house, about eight o'clock, or it might be a little before—I directly went up stairs, and found the deceased down by the side of the bed—she was dressed—she was very bad indeed, and complained of pain at the bottom of her stomach—she was very sick—I undressed her, and got her into bed—the prisoner was at home, their two sons and the youngest daughter, that is all the family that are at home—the de<lb></lb>ceased said she was very poorly, and I went down stairs to the prisoner, to get some brandy for her—I got some from him, he mixed it in hot water, brought it up stairs to me, and I gave it to the deceased—she drank it, and threw it up immediately—the prisoner had sent out the boy for the brandy—I had no conversation with him while the boy was gone for it—when I first went into the house, he said to me, "Mrs. Bywater, I wish you would go up to my wife; she is very bad, and she has been taking some d—stuff or other" that was before I went up stairs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you asked him to make some tea? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he did so, and he told me that he had made some before, in the after-noon—I gave the tea to the deceased, she threw it up directly—I also gave her some beer, which she threw up—I came down stairs, and said, "Mr. Hutchings, you must send for a doctor, and you must have some brandy for Mrs. Hutchings, she is very bad"—the eldest son at home went for Dr. Downing, who came about nine o'clock or half-past—I got the assistance of Mrs. Moulton, a neighbour, to attend on the deceased—she continued getting worse, and died about half-past one on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What sort of a woman was Mary Hutchings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was a very nice woman, and one might be very comfortable with her—the prisoner and her lived on very bad terms—I had no conversation with the prisoner before his wife's death, as to the state in which she was—I do not remember it—I told him once that Dr. Downing said she was in a dangerous state.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he state at that time why he broke open the drawer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because he was afraid his wife had got to it; that he threw it away in case she had got to the arsenic—he did not know whether she had got to it, or whether she had not, but he threw it away for fear she should get to it, as she was so bad—he did not say, in case she <hi rend="italic">had got</hi> to it, but in case she <hi rend="italic">should get</hi> to it—I might have said "in case she had got to it"—I do not know that I did.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he give you any reason for having broken open the drawer and emptied the stuff into the fire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, because my mother had told him she had taken jalap, and he said he thought she had taken something more than jalap—that was all he said about it—it was then that I went up stair and found my mother groaning—I found that my drawer was taken out, and placed on a box—the lock was broken, as if it had been forced, and the bottle was gone—the drawer was lying a very short distance from the bed where my mother was—I do not recollect that my mother spoke to me when I went up—I said nothing to her then about the drawer or the bottle—I did when I went up a second time—the first time I went up I put the lock on the drawer again—my father came and helped me to nail it on—her went up with me—I got some nails, put the lock on again, and put the drawer in its place—my father helped me to do it—I heard nothing pass between my father and mother on that occasion—there were no other bottles or any medicine in that drawer—I think my father came down out of the room with me after mead<lb></lb>ing the drawer, I am not certain—I went up a second time, after I had my tea—after putting on the lock, I went down and had my tea—me father was there while I had my tea, as well as I can recollect—I think there was ten poured out for my mother—I cannot say who took it up to her—I do not think I did—some tea was taken up by somebody—I saw it taken up, but cannot tell who took it—I cannot tell whether it was my father or my little brother—I cannot say who poured out the tea for her, I did not—it was about six o'clock that we had tea—my mother was ill at dinner time—she had been well enough in the morning to get the dinner ready and make the pudding.</p>

I think, about half full when I first had it—I knew it was poison, and that it was dangerous, and was careful about it—the word "poison" was written on a paper that was on the bottle—I cannot read and write—I cannot read writing—I had a Testament and another book in my drawer—I have read the Testament sometimes—my father did not buy it me, it was my grandfather's, and I had it—I never knew of my mother taking much medicine.</p>

                  </hi> I am a lecturer upon practical chemistry at St. Thomas's Hospital. I have examined these five packages, two of them contain jalap, one contains carbonate of magnesia, another some pills, and another some brown sugar—the pills appear to be composed of common aloes, commonly called bitter aloes—I also examined the bottle—it had no label round it—it had apparently contained some organic matter in a state of decomposition, but it was impossible to state what it was, it was so completely decomposed—this is not the bottle that was taken from the privy—the bottle taken from the privy contained a quantity of night soil and traces of arsenic—there was certainly enough to enable me to say that the bottle had contained white arsenic (<hi rend="italic">the bottle was here produce</hi>)—it has no label on it, nor had it when it was given to me—I was not present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I received the stomach from Dr. Taylor—I submitted it to a chemical test, and found that it contained a considerable quantity of white arsenic—I was afterwards present when the kidneys were taken out—I submitted them to the same analysis, and they also contained arsenic—I succeeded in reproducing arsenic to the extent of about fifteen grains, some portion of which I have here—(<hi rend="italic">producing several small tubes</hi>)—this is arsenic in the metallic condition in which it came from the contents of the stomach, and this is some in the state of white arsenic—at my last experiment I found this white arsenic in a pure state to adhere to one side of this tube—fifteen grains would be quite sufficient to cause death—this other tube contains fifteen grains of arsenic—it is a about the same in bulk as an ordinary pinch of snuff, that might he held between the fingers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you that you extracted the whole that there was in the stomach at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—if anything is allowed for loss it would be but a few hundredths of a grain—the taking of arsenic produce a burning sensation in the throat—that comes on some little time afterwards—in some cases it will take half an hour or more, it is very uncer<lb></lb>tain—the operation of arsenic is extremely uncertain in point of time, vary<lb></lb>ing from half an hour to four or five—the sickness usually begins with pains in the stomach, but that is also uncertain—sickness frequently comes on a very short time afterwards, but sometimes we find cases where sickness does not occur at all—the pain is principally in the stomach and back part of the throat—that would render a person indisposed to eat or drink—sometimes it causes considerable thirst—they feel disposed to take cold liquids, but indis<lb></lb>posed to take their food—very probably a little eaten would bring on retching and sickness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what period of time would the indisposition to eat com<lb></lb>monly arise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be very difficult to say, it would depend so much upon the period at which the person began to eat before taking the arsenic—if it is taken upon a full stomach it does not act so speedily as if it is taken upon an empty stomach—if it was taken about an hour before dinner, probably at dinner time the person would not feel disposed to eat—that is the ordinary consequence of an exhibition of arsenic.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have some powders there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they were brought to me by the beadle as having been found in the house—amongst them there is an aloetic pill—it is what is usually called bitter aloes—it contains bitter aloes—it is an aperient medicine—here is also some jalap—jalap is about as innocent a medicine as anybody can take—it some<lb></lb>times slightly irritates the stomach—it not unfrequently causes a little nausea—it is a mild aperient—there is no direction upon these powders as to the amount to be taken—I could not tell whether was any jalap in the stomach—jalap is a vegetable—I did not apply any test to ascertain the existence of any vegetable matter in the stomach, and am not able to state whether there was any vegetable poison or medicine in the stomach at that time—if she had taken any large quantity of jalap in the course of the day upon which she died, I might possibly have found some traces of it in the stomach, but after so much vomiting it would be unlikely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it be at all unlikely, a person's stomach being deranged, that jalap should cause vomiting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be extremely likely, it is a nauseous medicine—that vomiting, if caused by taking jalap or an aloetic medicine, would indispose the party to eat—a deranged stomach alone would indispose a party to eat—the immediate action of arsenic is by eating into the coats of the stomach—if the stomach is empty the arsenic is more quick in its operation—if it was taken an hour before dinner, upon an empty stomach, and caused nausea and vomiting, I should expect those symptoms to be accompanied by violent heat and pain in the region of the stomach—that would probably precede the vomiting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, suppose a person to have taken jalap, and to have been sick and indisposed to eat at dinner-time, and not to complain of any burning heat or sensation of pain at the stomach, would you think that the fact of the jalap having been taken, would account for that state of things? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, more naturally than if arsenic had been taken in the mean time.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon. I was called to the deceased's home about nine o'clock on Saturday evening, the 22nd of Aug.—I found her up stairs—she complained of great thirst, constant vomiting, violent pain of the bowels, and involuntary diarrhoea—she did not complain of her throat—I felt her pulse, and found that the power of life was rapidly sinking—I asked her what she had taken, and I understood, I think, from Mrs. Bywater that she had taken some jalap—when I arrived at the house the prisoner sent the boy into the next-door neighbour, Mrs. Bywater—she acme in immediately, and went up stairs first, and I followed her—I did not learn from the deceased that she had taken anything—it was Mrs. Bywater, in her presence—I immediately gave her some brandy and water, and also requested some one to go to my house for some medicine, to lose no time; and I gave her some astringent medicine, as the diarrhoea was so severe—I considered from the symptoms, that it was an attack of cholera—I remained there some few minutes—I did not see her again—I was not sent for again—understand she died about one that morning—I saw the prisoner on the Sunday evening—I told him his wife was seriously ill, dangerously ill; and I would do all I possibly could for her—he did not make any reply—he said he would send for the medicine directly, and Mrs. Bywater said she would come for it.</p>

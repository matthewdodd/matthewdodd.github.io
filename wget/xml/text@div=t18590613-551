                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Shadbolt of Brompton. About 1 o'clock in the afternoon of 22d April I got into an omnibus in Shoreditch—I had 2 children with me—when I got in there were several persons there—when we got between the Bank and St. Paul's the prisoner got in—she first took her seat opposite to me—I was sitting at the farther end of the omnibus, close to the back—no one could sit on the other side of me—the prisoner sat opposite me—but in 4 or 5 minutes she came and sat next to me on my left—while I was in the omnibus I put my hand in my pocket to get a biscuit for my little boy, and my purse was quite safe—I had in it somewhere near 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., amongst which were 2 fourpenny pieces, 1 sixpence, 2 or 3 shillings, and 2 half-crowns—it was a dark purse, and it had a key belonging to a tea-caddy in it—when the prisoner sat beside me she seemed to look first on one side, and then the other, as if she wanted to get out—I had the presence of mind to put my hand in my pocket, and my purse was gone—I accused the prisoner of picking my pocket—she was still sitting next to me—from the time I put my hand in my pocket and felt the purse safe till I charged the prisoner with stealing it, she had never left my side—this is it—when I charged her with stealing it, she denied it, and said I must have dropped it, and she offered to hold my baby while I looked for it—I looked and found it close to her feet while she was holding the baby—there were other persons in the omnibus, and other females, but no one sat near me but the prisoner—I called the conductor, and told him I had been robbed, in the prisoners hearing; a policeman was called, and the prisoner was removed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. McDONALD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many persons were in the omnibus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There might be 9 or 10—a woman had not been sitting next to me before the prisoner came—there were other women in the omnibus—I cannot say how many—I know there were 4 children; there might be three women—it was not very cold—the sun came out nice and warm—I noticed that the prisoner was near her confinement, and I felt for her—she did not say when she got up from the place where she first sat down, "I cannot bear the draft"—when I accused her of taking the purse there were 9 or 10 persons in the omnibus, including the children—the policeman picked up this money; I did not—the prisoner did not ask me to search her if I blamed her for taking my purse—I did not speak low to her; I was in too much of a passion—it might be 10 minutes from the time I took the biscuit out of my pocket till I missed my money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the conductor of that omnibus—I remember the prisoner getting in about the Bank—the prosecutrix got in at Shoreditch—the prosecutrix put her head out at the door and said, "A woman inside has robbed me of my purse"—the prisoner could hear what was said—she charged the prisoner with it, and she said, "You had better cull my hus<lb></lb>band, who is outside the <hi rend="italic">buss"</hi>—I called a policeman, and saw him search the bottom of the <hi rend="italic">buss,</hi> and find some money amongst the straw—I did not hear the prisoner make any answer when the prosecutrix said she had stolen her purse.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many passengers were there. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 9 or 10—there were 3 or 4 women, and some children—the prosecutrix sat on the off side, and the prisoner on the near side; and she went on the same side as Mrs. Shadbolt was—she sat nearer to the door; higher up.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman,</hi> 345). I was called to the omnibus in Fleet-street—I found Mrs. Shadbolt near the door, going to get out—she told me she had been robbed, pointed to the prisoner, and said that it was her that robbed her—the prisoner heard it—she made no answer—I told her to come to the door—I told the conductor to hold her whilst I got in—I found 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. amongst the straw—I conveyed the prisoner to the station—she gave an address which was false—when she was at the station she put this piece of paper in her mouth—I put my fingers to her lips, and told her to open her mouth, and took this paper out.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Vauxhall—I am in the employ of Mr. E. T. Smith, the proprietor of Cremorne-gardens, and have been so for four or five years; it is part of my duty to attend to the glass lustres—I employed the prisoner to assist me for one fortnight—his duties were to clean the lustres and to put them in a proper state to put up—they were cleaned in a room on the premises—I can positively speak to these lustres (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) they are Mr. Smith's property—I never authorised the prisoner to take, them away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was a man named Fisher employed there? Yes, he had the temporary management of the workmen at the commencement of the season—he was in a more trusty position than the prisoner—I never left the prisoner there alone, he always left before me—a person so inclined might have opportunity of placing things surreptitiously about their person—these lustres were found at the house occupied jointly by the prisoner and Fisher—I know that Fisher has been given into custody on a charge of a forgery, in consequence of that the policeman went to the lodging to search, and there found the lustres—Fisher had the key of the room; he had, no doubt, an opportunity of taking them—he had the key and had the power of going into the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of Cremorne-gardens, and have been so for several years—I can speak positively to the identity of these lustres—the prisoner was one of the band at Cremorne, and was also employed by Mr. Eaton—he absented himself from the gardens for some days—he returned on the evening of 19th August—I told him I had received information that there was property stolen from Cremorne in his apartment—he replied, "If there is, Fisher must have stolen it"—I said, "If the property is there, have you any objection to letting me see it?"—he hesitated a moment and then said, "No, if you like to go you may go and see it?"—I said, "Well, let us go," and we walked towards his apartments—when we came to the end of the street, he refused to go any further—Manley, a police-officer in plain clothes, was by us, and I said, "If you refuse to go I shall be obliged to compel you;" and after some objection he at last consented, and we went to his lodging, it consisted of two rooms in Blantyre-street, Chelsea—he applied to the land-lady for the key—he said, "Bring me my key"—the rooms were un<lb></lb>furnished—on the sideboard, by the side of the fire-place, I found two parcels rolled up in newspaper—the policeman opened them, and they contained these lustres, which I examined and at once knew were Mr. Smith's property—I said, "Barnes, you must know that these are stolen from Cremorne"—he said, "Well, you cannot charge me with stealing them"—I said, "But I can charge you with the unlawful possession, and I shall give you in charge for that"—which I did—I believe Fisher lived somewhere in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood of the King's-road.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> But he had lived with the prisoner in this lodging, had he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard Fisher say since that he had lived there oc<lb></lb>casionally—Fisher had absconded at this time; we were looking after both Fisher and the prisoner—the prisoner came back on the 19th—I believe some one played for him in the band in his absence, engaged by the band<lb></lb>master—it is very unusual for a man to be away for more than a single night; the prisoner was away nearly two weeks—Fisher was taken two or three days after at Sheffield.</p>

On 5th June, about eight o'clock atnight, I was on duty in North-street, Lock's-fields, and saw the prisoner inwoman's gown and bonnet, saying, "Where is my husband?"—a greatmob assembled, and were shouting at him—it interrupted the thoroughfare—I said, "You bad better go home"—he went home—he lives in Nelson-place, not fifty yards from there—he directly came back, dressed in the sameway, and kept saying to the crowd, "What do you want there?"—he wentin and out three times—he was drunk—I said, if he came out again I wouldtake him in charge—he rushed in, came out again in his own clothes, broughta hatchet, and said he would split my skull open; using bad expressions—his wife was in the house—she took the hatchet from him—he stooped down, seized on a brick, which was used to keep the door open, and pitched it atme—it went over my shoulder, and struck Nathaniel Turner on the forehead, who was about two yards behind me—it knocked him down—he bled pro<lb></lb>fusely—I followed the prisoner into his kitchen, and took him.</p>

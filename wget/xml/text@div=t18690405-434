I lived at 16, Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury, on 7th March—on that afternoon, between 5 and 6, I saw the three prisoners sauntering about Russell Street—it was about 5, when I first saw them—they were walking backwards and forwards for the distance of about three houses—I saw them all three go up to the street door of 109, and they ap<lb></lb>peared to try the door by some means—the house was exactly on the oppo<lb></lb>site side of the way—I was at my sitting room window—Osborne then went to the railings, and looked into the kitchen window—they then joined com<lb></lb>pany, and stood talking within a short distance of the house—after a time they separated, Jackson and Kelly went to the door of the same house again, Osborne went as far as the next house, and then crossed the road in a circuit to the opposite side of the way, and returned opposite the house where the others had gone up—they did that six or seven times, joining and separa<lb></lb>ting again—I concealed myself behind the window curtain—I saw Jackson and Kelly go up to the door of the house, and Osborne took the same circuit</p>

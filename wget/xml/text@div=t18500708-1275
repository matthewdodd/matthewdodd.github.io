                  </hi>. I am servant at the Crooked Billet. On the night of 3rd July I could not sleep—I suddenly felt a breeze, looked up to the ceiling, and saw the prisoner with the skylight open, looking into the room, and stepping sideways to come in—I jumped up, went to the door, and while I was calling master he put the window down very gently, and turned away—the window had been fastened with a string, but it would come open if pulled outside—I am quite sure it was the prisoner—his hand was inside, holding the window up—a constable went out at the window after him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H.</hi> 10) I was on duty, and heard a cry of "Police!"—I went to the Crooked Billet, and through a skylight on the roof, which opens with a spring—a man was described to me—I went over the parapet to the next house, and over several roofs to the rear—I saw a bed<lb></lb>room window with the blind up—I then found somebody inside had pulled it down—I went there, and found the window unfastened—I threw it up, and saw the prisoner in bed, under the window, apparently very sound asleep—he did not wake, when another policeman went over him in the bed to search the room—at last he was aroused, and I asked his name—he refused to give it—I asked where he lived—he said, "12, Princes-street"—I asked how he came to be sleeping there, if he lived so convenient—he said his father went to bed early, and he was locked out—he had one stocking on and his shirt—his clothes were in three different parts of the room—I told the officer to take him to the Crooked Billet; and the girl said, "That is the man"—he said,</p>

               <p>"You are mistaken"—I asked him what time he went to bed—he said, "Eleven o'clock"—the skylight could not be seen from the window where I took him—the tiles about that window were broken before we went upon them—I took up two which were recently broken.</p>

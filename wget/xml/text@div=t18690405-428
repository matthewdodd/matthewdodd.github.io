                  </hi>. I am the chief clerk at Worship Street Police Court—on 20th February the prisoner charged a man named McNamara with an assault—I produce my notes of her evidence: she said, "I live at 7, Acorn Place; on 17th February I was in Magpie Alley, and met the prisoner, and others; he at once came up to me, and hit me two violent blows in the eye with his fist, and knocked me down; I said nothing to him, and gave him no reason; some time ago I was a witness against him, and he came oat of prison on that morning; when he met me he said, 'You b—b—I will pay you;' I was alone; I came from my mother's to the pawn-shop in Magpie Alley; the prisoner was with a mob; it was between 12 and 1 o'clock in the day; I looked for a policeman but could see none."—That is all the evidence.</p>

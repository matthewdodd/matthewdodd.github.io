            . I am a watchman. On the 25th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was at the corner of the street in Hackney-road, and saw the prisoner coming with something on his shoulder; when he came up to me he crossed the road; I ran, and stopped him with these sashes in a rug - I asked what he had got- he said, sashes - that they were his own, and he had brought them from Hackney; he said he got them from his master: my brother watchman said, "I won't stand that;" he then threw them down, and ran away; I pursued, and sprang my rattle; he was stopped, without my losing sight of him. I have seen the sashes fitted in the house by the carpenter.</p>

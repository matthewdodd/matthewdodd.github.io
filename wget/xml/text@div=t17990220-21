             sworn. - I keep the Bell, in Cecil-court: About a quarter before nine, I sent my boy out with a pint of beer; I went to the door, and observed a man in a sailor's dress at my window, who gave a hem to the prisoner at the bar, who was then in Mr. Crisp's shop; I immediately looked in at Mr. Crisp's shop, which is opposite to me, and saw the prisoner slide the bacon off the board down by his side; I heard him say to Mr. Crisp, if I like your bacon, I will call again; he then came out to the door, and this piece of bacon sell from him; I picked it up, and told Mr. Crisp of it; the prisoner then ran away; Crisp and I followed him and took him, about twelve yards from where he dropped the bacon; it is a narrow passage, and there was a great deal of snow upon the ground; he denied taking the bacon, but afterwards told me, if I would forgive him, he would tell me where it laid.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him, it would be better for him to confess? - A. No; I told him he should go to the watch-house; he said, he had a sick father, and went down upon his knees to me, and begged I would set him at liberty; Mr. Crisp and I then took him down to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Crisp.) Had you such bacon as that in your shop? - A. Yes; I missed it immediately upon my neighbour's coming over to me.</p>

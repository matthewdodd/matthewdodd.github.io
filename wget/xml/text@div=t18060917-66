               <p>Q. Did you fasten your house safe. - A. The door was perfectly fastened safe, and the window was shut down; we returned the same day, my wife returned first, I returned about nine o'clock the same evening, I supposed the robbery happened that evening; I saw no difference till the Tuesday following. On the Tuesday following I observed the window curtain on the ground floor was tore, and pinned over as a deception for us not to see it, the curtain was down, and likewise the pulley line of the sash was broken.</p>

             sworn. I went out about four in the afternoon, and came home about seven in the evening; I did not at that time take any notice of the house, I did not perceive any thing amiss till Tuesday, I then perceived the window curtain was very much torn indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that did you look to see if you had lost any thing. - A. Yes, I missed my gown directly out of my drawer in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see that gown in the drawer before you missed it. - A. On the Thursday before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing else. - A. Nothing else then, we missed a cloak and a sheet before in February.</p>
               <p>Q. That we cannot enquire about; this was in July. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your gown again. - A. I saw it on the 8th of July, the same day the prisoner was taken, the office produced it to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner live. - A. The very next door, she kept the house, we had her place searched before she went to the justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same day. - A. Yes, we found a pocket book with a great many duplicates in it, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170046"></xptr>officer has them, I found them myself in the ticking of her bed, in her house amongst the feathers or stocks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the officer with you when she was searched. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived there. - A. Nine months, the prisoner lived at the next door when I came.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a ground floor window, it is not impossible but your neighbour's children might have torn it, children could reach it. - A. They could.</p>

             sworn. Q. Are you the officer who searched the prisoner's house on Tuesday the 8th of July. - A. Me, and my brother officer, Renley, executed a search warrant on the house, the prisoner was present at the time, I told her my business; I searched all but the bed, the prisoner requested I would not search that, because it was not in a situation for a man to see; I requested Mrs. Johnson to search it, Mrs. Johnson immediately called to me and said she had found this book, I was just at the door, I saw her take it from the bed; in that pocket book I found the duplicate of a cloak, which appears to be the property of Mrs. Johnson; the prisoner immediately said if I would let her go she would go and take the gown out, she had pawned it for fifteen shillings, I told her I could not let her go, she must consider herself in custody; she did go, and I followed her, she went into the shop and asked the pawnbroker to bring down that gown she had pawned on Saturday night; the gown was sent down by some one that was in the warehouse; at that moment I said stop this, it is a stolen gown, produce it before the magistrate immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you advise to prosecute for a capital offence. - A. I laid it that way, I thought it was so.</p>

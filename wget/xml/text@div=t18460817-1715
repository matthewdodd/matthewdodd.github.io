                  </hi>. I am a coal-merchant at Phœnix-wharf, Southwark—the prisoner has been in my employ several years—it was his duty to deliver bills and to collect money—he did that in his capacity as my servant—he had to keep a petty cash book—this is it—it was his duty to enter in this book any sums of money he received on my account—he was to pay them over at the end of the day, and balance the gross receipts at the end of the week—the book was the cheque I had ou-him in balancing—I paid him 30. a week—he had no claim for commission—he was in the habit of making a charge for beer and other disbursements—they are in this petty weekly dis<lb></lb>bursement book—at the end of the week I looked at the disbursements, teeing the sums he received, and he accounted to me—I know his hand<lb></lb>writing—I have looked at this bill of 13th Jan. 1846—the receipt is in bis handwriting—here is entered in the petty cash-book—"On 13th Jan. 21. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as received from Watts"—the bill was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in another petty cash-book here is entered, "On 14th April, Watts, Park-street, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the bill is 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he has not accounted for anything in the cash-book on 15th of May—it ap<lb></lb>pears, by the cash book, that there was a settlement at the end of these re<lb></lb>spective weeks—the book is balanced—here is the entry of 13th Jan.—there are disburse<lb></lb>ments that week—they are carried out of the little petty disburse-ment book into the gross amount at the end of the week—that is all settled, according to the entries in the book—the 15th of May is the last time he was in ray employ—he also kept a wharf-book—the clerk could not make out the bill without the price—he would have to inquire of the prisoner the price of the coals if it was not entered—when he put the price it should be the correct price at which they were sold—there is a price in this instance—the entry in Jan. states, two tons at 23<hi rend="italic">A.</hi>—there is the same entry in the petty cash-book—that is not the price at which the bill is made out—the clerk ould make out the bill according to the price in the book—by holding the book up, it plainly appears in the book that he has written one price over the original price, in which the darker ink predominates.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Wright commence business there the very day you took the pri<lb></lb>soner up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot recollect, but as soon as I became acquainted with those facts I went to my solicitor—a great many of my customers have gone to Wright—some of them are now returning—they were hucksters who came to the wharf for their coals—it was his usual business to treat with thent, and receive their money—I know nothing of Watts—he had not been a customer of mine—I very likely saw Mr. Wright at the Coal exchange on the 21ft of May—I do not recollect saying to him, "I see you are going to be a neigh<lb></lb>bour of mine, and take my late clerk into your service"—I will not swear did not—he did not say, "Yes, is there anything against his honesty?"made no reference to character, nor did I say, "Not the slightest"—he mip have said, "Have you anything to say against him?" and I studiously avoided giving any answer.</p>

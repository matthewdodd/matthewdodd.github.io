             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am brother to the last witness: On the 13th of July, a little after seven in the morning, I saw the prisoner Batten take some clover out of the lost, and take it away; I followed him up to Oldridge's, and saw him lay it down at Oldridge's door; he went into Oldridge's house, and stopped about a quarter of an hour, and then drove the team away, leaving the clover against the door; and in about a quarter of an hour, I saw Oldridge take it away himself upon his back; and upon that, I went about my business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you mean to say that this is clover? - A. This year's hay mixed.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to call it hay? - A. It is clover like.</p>
               <p>Q. But we want clover, not clover like; is it here? - A. No; he carried it away to the stable, and it was never found after.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there? - A. Half a truss of clover.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say there was actually half a truss of clover unmixed with hay? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not it tares? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear there was more than a shillingsworth? - A. I don't know the value of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it green or dry? - A. It was dry, but this year's clover.</p>
               <p>Q. As you do not know the value of it, you, perhaps, do not know that it was clover? - A. I know clover from hay.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Oldridge take it upon his back? - A. Yes; he went off with it to the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to stop Oldridge when you saw him with this clover? - A. Because I was ordered not; I was ordered by my brother only to see where it went to.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the Prosecutor.) Q. Did you see the clover at all? - A. No; only from what my brother had told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the stable for the clover? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that the clover was worth more than ten-pence? - A. If it was half a truss it was worth ten-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. But you do not know that it was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Batten's defence. I carried some hay to my work that day to the Gravel pits for my horses; I did not take out any clover that day at all, nor for a great many days after.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oil and colour-man, and live in Upper Dorset-street, Marylebone; Mr. Skeet, of Dorset-street, is a customer of mine. On the 11th of Sept. the prisoner brought me a written order for a stock-brush and a dusting-brush—I said, "This is not from Mr. Skeet"—he said he came from Mr. Skeet—I said, "It is not his writing"—he said, "No; it is from Mrs. Skeet; Mr. Skeet is not in town"—I served him with the two brushes—I have lost that order—he came again on the 16th, without any order at all, said he came from Mrs. Skeet, as usual, for three stock brushes—he said Mr. Skeet was at Tonbridge, he had got a large job there—on the 21st he brought this paper, in consequence of which I served him with the brushes—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Sept. 21, 1843, 6 wash and 1 dusting-brush. <hi rend="smallCaps">J.

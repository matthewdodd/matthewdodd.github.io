               <p>Coming down Tottenham court road, on the 13th of May, about half after ten o'clock, I heard a window break. I looked across the way, and saw the prisoner run. I ran after him, and made a blow at him, at the top of Tavistock-street; he popped his head down, and ran back again down the mews in Tavistock-street, there I knocked him down and secured him, and brought him back to the prosecutor's house; there was nothing found upon him. I saw nobody else run from the window; his finger was off before, the stump was cut with the glass.</p>
               <p>Jones. The lace mentioned in the indictment was lost out of the window. I saw it about half an hour before. There were thirteen yards at half a crown a yard; it was on a card; it was picked up by a gentleman.</p>

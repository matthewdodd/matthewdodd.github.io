                  </hi>. I am a groom to William Henry Storey, of Eden house, Isleworth. On Thursday, the 8th of September, I was in the stable-yard, and saw the prisoner crossing the yard with a bag across his shoulder, going from the house towards the road—as soon as he sail was after him, he threw the bag down and ran away—I called, "Stop thief"—I ordered some persons to pick up the bag—he was stopped—I came up and brought him part of the way back—as I was going along I saw him drop two silver tea-spoons and a pair of sugar-tongs—the perm with the bag waited till I came up, and in it were two snuff-boxes, a pair of boots, a cloak, and a coat—they were all my master's—the prisoner was searched, and several halfpence and another spoon found on him another spoon was found on him at the station—I had seen this coat aid cloak safe two hours before, because I brushed them and put them on a slab in the hall—I had seen these boots on a chair—they belong to my young master—these snuff-boxes are my master's—they were lying on the side-board in the dining-room—I have no recollection of seeing them after Sunday—these things were found in the prisoner's bag.</p>

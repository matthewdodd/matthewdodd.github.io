                  </hi>. I live in Rodney-terrace, Mile-end, with my parents. On the 17th of July, I went with two of my sisters to visit the Cemetry at Kensal-green—we returned by the Harrow road—just before we got to the Windsor Castle, public-house, I saw two persons walking behind us—when we got to the corner of a lane beyond the public-house, I perceived that my bag was cut off my arm—it was dragged out of my hand by Stonehill—I had the string on my arm and was holding the bag in my hand—I observed a knife in his hand at the time he dragged the bag from me—he ran down the lane with his companion—I did not notice him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183708140037"></xptr>
               <p>but I am sure Stonehill is the person that took my bag—it contained a pocket handkerchief, two purses, and seven shillings—I spoke to Taylor and James, and they went in pursuit of the persons—the two prisoners were brought back in a short time, and I knew Stonehill to be the person who took my bag—I never had any doubt of it—he asked what he was taken for—I said, "For taking the bag, "—he said he did not do it—I had no opportunity of seeing his face before he went away with the bag—I speak to him by his dress—he had on a brown jacket then—he is not in that dress now—the man who was brought back had the same dress as the man who took the bag.</p>

I was with my sister on this occasion, it was on a Monday—we were returning from the Cemetry about three o'clock—I looked round, and saw these two boys lying down in the grass—they got up and followed us—we stopped on the road to look at the view and the Cemetry, and the two boys passed us very slowly, so that we passed them again—they kept within two or three yards of us after our passing them—I took sufficient notice of them to be able to say the prisoners are the same boys—when we got to a lane by the public-house, Stonehill stooped down, cut the bag off my sister's arm, and ran down the lane, and the other prisoner with him—they were brought back in custody in about a quarter of an hour, and I knew them to be the same persons who had followed us.</p>

               <p>the two witnesses—they asked me if I had met two men in the lane, and complained of being robbed—I pointed out the two prisoners to them sitting under the hedge in the field, about three hundred yards from the lane—I cannot say to a hundred yards—I went with James to take them—they were then standing under a tree at the end of the lane—they walked a few paces from the tree, and sat themselves down—we went towards them, and when they saw us coming they got up and walked towards us—we told them they must go with us—we took them to the young ladies, and they pointed them out as the boys they wanted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Spring-place, Paddington. On the day the prisoners were taken up, I was at work at a risk in a field adjoining£Edgware-road—I saw the prisoners come from the Edgware-mad into the field, in the afternoon—I cannot tell what time it was—it was after my dinner time, and I had a conversation with them—after they talked to me, they proceeded to the next field, to Bransgrove, who was mowing—I went twice to the police-office to state this, but they would not hear me there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Moor-street, Edgware-road. I was mowing in the next field but one to the Edgware-road on the afternoon of this Monday, and saw the two prisoners come into the field where There was on the rick—they came and asked me to let them sharpen their knives on my stone, to cut willow boughs to make whistles—they stopped with me about ten minutes, then went to the tree and cut some boughs, and sat down making whistles of them—they were there about three quarters of an hour—I then saw three men running across the field from the Harrow-road—they beckoned to me—I ran towards them, and stopped, as I thought they could not want me, but they beckoned again and I went to them, and they asked me to help them take those two young lads—I heard them tell the boys they must go with them—they said, "What for?"—they said never mind, they. must go, and it was no use to run—the boys said they did not want to run—when I got into the Harrow-road and heard what they were taken for, 1 expressed my surprise—I am quite sure they were in the field for three quarters of an hour before the men came—I went to the police-office the same night. <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did they appear to be in earnest at work making this</p>

               <p>tles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they staid with me ten minutes talking about the day before—they had come down the day before and helped me to cut the grass, and went home with me, and they talked to me about that—I cannot say how many whistles they made—they left the boughs behind—I saw some whistles under the tree—they were only cutting them for amusement—they did not go away at all till the men came up and said they must go with them—I have known the prisoners some time—Stonehill said he had been to take some china for his father, who lives in Edgware-road—they came about three o'clock I think to cut the whistles—it was half-past two o'clock when I came through the gate, and they came to me about half an hour after—it takes a long time to scrape the willow—I told the men they must be mistaken in charging them with stealing the reticule, as they had been with me in the field—I told James so.</p>

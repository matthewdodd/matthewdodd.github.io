The prisoner Hardy was my clerk four or five months—on 23d March I signed this cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I left it on my desk—I wrote the original 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in figures—I did not fill up the middle or any other part—I only put the figures "10," and signed it—in the course of busi<lb></lb>ness, Hardy would have to get it changed at the bankers—I have seen him write several times—I believe the body of the cheque, the filling up to be his writing—I did not authorise it being filled up for 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his brother was also in my service.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the Exeter police. On Tuesday, 3d April, about half-past two o'clock, I saw the prisoners at the Red Cow coffee-house, at Exeter—I was not in search of Hardy, but he answered the description of a person I was looking for—there was a chest in the room—I asked them if they were brothers—Mansell said, "Yes"—I asked if that was their chest—Mansell said, "Yes"—I asked if he would allow me to look at it; he consented, but asked if I would allow them to take it up stairs—I did so, and they took it up together into a bed-room—they put down the box-Mansell took a pistol from his side, put it to his mouth, and Said, "Good-bye, Harry,"—I grasped him, and threw him on the bed, and he dropped another pistol—I examined the pistol he put into his mouth; it was loaded with powder and ball, but there was no cap on it; the other was in the same state—I searched Mansell, and found in his trowsers-pocket a canvass bag containing 114 sovereigns, and in one waisteoat-pocket, one sove<lb></lb>reign, and in the other, 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, a knife, and some percussion caps, loose—on Hardy I found 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a knife; I took the prisoners to the station.</p>

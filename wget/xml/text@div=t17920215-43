               <p>Did this covering seem accidental? - It seemed intentional; he had his handkerchief in his hand when he came into the shop: I went to call Mr. Goldfinch round the end of the counter; I had got the cotton stockings down, and laid them on the counter, but had not opened them; they laid immediately behind me: he was going out of the door; I ran to him, laid hold of him by the collar, and brought him back again; a little scuffle ensued, during which he had laid the stockings down on the counter unperceived by me: when I had taken the cotton stockings down, I saw him concealing the silk stockings into his pocket, in the handkerchief; I did not see the stockings, but the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Can you say whether he took up the handkerchief and the stockings together? - Where he had taken the handkerchief up, the counter was quite clear; I am certain of that; the stockings were laid nearly on the same part, but quite in a confused state. I desired him to empty his pockets; but when a constable was sent for, nothing was found upon him but these stockings.</p>
               <p>How could they be put down, and you not see it? - It was near five o'clock, and at that time of the year duskish.</p>
               <p>Jury. If it was duskish, how could you see the counter was clear? - I am certain there was nothing on the counter: the stockings all belonged to my master.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Tell the Jury how much money was found upon the man. - I do not know exactly.</p>
               <p>Had he not considerably more than he had been treating for? - He had certainly.</p>
               <p>How far were you from the counter when you had what you call the scuffle? - Nothing like three yards.</p>
               <p>A man might turn round; the man had not got out of the shop at all? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell even that!</p>

               <p>I searched his pockets, and found nothing; and turning round, I found three pair of silk stockings lying in an unusual manner, as if they had been grasped up; they were white silk stockings, my property; I saw the prisoner had three or four guineas, and some silver, about him.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury; I had an occasion to do some particular business, and also being in want of some stockings, I went into the prosecutor's shop, and asked the shopman to shew me three pair of silk stockings; I asked the price of them; the shopman told me the price was 30 s. I examined the stockings very carefully, and found them rather slight, and not worth that money; I then offered him 27 s. which he refused, alledging he could not take less than 30 s. which was the price: on which he said he would shew me some inferior and lower quality, which I refused, and then stood by the counter, and took my pocket-handkerchief out of my pocket, and afterwards put the handkerchief into my pocket, and then I buttoned up my coat,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179202150044"></xptr>with my stick in my hand, and walked five yards from the counter, and wished the shopman a good day: I was near out of the door, when the shopman called two more out of a room, and charged me with stealing the stockings; on which I was searched by them, but no stockings found on me at all, nor any thing else, saving cash to the amount of five guineas, and some silver; on which the shopman turned round and said, I see the stockings on the counter; all this happened on the 24th of January last, about four o'clock: these circumstances of my case I humbly offer to my Lord and the Jury, and I am entirely innocent of the charge against me.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a very good character.)</p>
               <p>The Jury withdrew for about two hours, and returned with a verdict,</p>

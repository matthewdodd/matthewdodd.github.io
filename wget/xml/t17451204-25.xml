And I said that I did not want any, and I would not buy a Pennyworth.

            . I never saw him before last Monday Night. He brought Worsted to sell to my Mistress; he said it was Irish Worsted, and that it was none of his own; and he said he wanted to say something to my Mistress: And he put his Hand round her Neck and buss'd her; and he said to me, why don't you get withinside of her? I saw him with his Hand round her Neck, and that is all I have to say. I heard her say indeed, that she would not be teaz'd so.</p>
               <p>- Bromley. I have known the Prisoner 10 Years; my Business is a Weaver; he is a Woollcomber; he makes Worsted to fell it.</p>
               <p>- . The Man that told me about this Bracelet, has heard that this Women is a bad Woman in several Shapes: I have heard that she would say unto Men, Lend me your Tougue, and buss me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am inform'd that she has charg'd another Person with this Bracelet.</p>
               <p>Bromley. I will declare the Truth. That Gentlewoman would have sent my Daughter on an Errand, to ask one Bell, whether or no she had not the Necklace. The Girl comes up to me and says, Father, shall I go of the Errand, what Harm is there in it? But I would not let her go, because I had a Reason for it; I am a Papist, and did not care to have any Trouble in my Neighbourhood; I am a Weaver by Trade, and a Worsted-Weaver.</p>

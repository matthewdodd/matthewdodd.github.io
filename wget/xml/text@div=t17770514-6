               <p>How long might this pursuit take up from the time you was robbed, till the time you got to the constable's house? - Not more than half an hour; I lost fight of Lucas turning the corner, but it was a moon-light night.</p>

               <p>How were the prisoners dressed? - The prisoners were not dressed the same at that time as they are now; they are much better dressed now than they were then.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of last April I met with Mr. Hughes in the City-road; he asked me to assist him in taking these two men; I followed them directly: I stopped opposite the coach, seeing them come from it; they ran from the coach by me; I followed Harris into a field; when we got almost to the further side of the field, a little way off Hoxton-square, he turned round with a pistol; I dropped back, he came up to me, and fired the pistol at me.</p>
               <p>Did nobody run after him to try to take him but you? - No, not till I had got him upon the ground; then Thomas Brumsdell came up.</p>
               <p>Did you run or walk when you followed him at the further end of the field? - He ran as hard as he could, and I ran; he ran twenty or thirty yards, and then fell down; he got upon his legs again, and I was got up to him; he had a hanger in his right hand; he throwed the money and his pistols out of his left hand.</p>
               <p>Did you pick it up? - Yes, after we had secured him. He cut me over the fingers with his hanger; I got it out of his hand when I got him upon the ground; this is the hanger (producing it) I picked up 3 s. 6 d. afterwards some other people picked up some more, and gave to Mr. Hughes; this is the pistol (a small pocket pistol) I marked it;

This man has been advised by Justice Wilmot's thief-catchers; when he came into Wilmot's office, he asked if I should be cast for death, whether he would have 40 l. all the court laughed at him; he swore falsely; the thief-catcher took him backwards, and told him, he should have the money if I was cast, and then he said he would swear that I was the person. -</p>

               <p>Last Monday was three weeks, coming from Mr. Whitefield's tabernacle, at half past eight o'clock in the evening, I saw a coach stop at about 40 or 50 yards distance, or hardly so far, either a hackney or a stage coach; the moon shone bright; I said to Mr. Merrit, who was with me, I apprehend some villians have stopped that c oach in order to rob it; he said, No, it may be somebody has rode so far and wants to get out and walk; we walked till we came opposite to the coach, which stood almost<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177705140007"></xptr> opposite the Shepherd and Shepherdess in the City road, in the road to Islington; one of them came away from the coach door, the other seemed to step down from out of the coach; Mr. Hughes looked out and seeing us stand there, asked us whether we would assist in taking them.</p>
               <p>Was he got out of the coach then? - No; he looked out of the coach and asked us to assist him; then he jumped out of the coach and set out after them; one ran towards Shoreditch, the Hoxton way; Merrit and I pursued Harris; when we came to a rise of a hill, Merrit and the prisoner Harris outran me; when I came to the bottom I heard the report of a pistol; when I got up to the top of the hill, I saw Merrit had got Harris down under him, and Merrit was calling out for assistance; I went up to him as fast as I could, and I saw a pistol lie eight or ten yards from him on the ground, and a cutlass about a yard or yard and a half from the side of them where they were tussling together; he asked me to tie the prisoner's hands; I took off my garter in order to bind his hands; he swore he would not have his hands bound; I told him if he made the least objection I would run him through with the hanger; I bound his hands, and we set him upon his feet; Merrit took up the pistol, I kept the cutlass myself; one had hold of one side of his collar and the other of the other; we led him down and gave him into charge of the constable.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that Hughes was not out of the coach when he asked you to pursue the men? - I saw him looking out of the coach; when he asked us to assist him whether he was out or not I cannot justly say, it was such a small distance of time, he was out in a minute.</p>
               <p>When you came up did you perceive either Harris or Merrit wounded? - I perceived Merrit's hand to be all over bloody.</p>
               <p>Which hand? - I believe it to be his left hand.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the pistol whether it was charged or not? - No; I took it up and gave it to Merrit, he carried it to the constable.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing about Lucas? - No, because he took the other road; after we had given the prisoner into custody of the constable, we went back to the place with a lanthorn and candle and picked up two straight half-guineas, which we gave to Mr. Hughes.</p>
               <p>Court to Hughes. Have you those two half-guineas? - No, I spent them long ago.</p>
               <p>HARRIS. The coachman and the gentleman swore before the justice that it was a dark night, now they say that it was a moon-light night.</p>

               <p>How did you know it was the same? - I saw it before and I saw it picked up.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was loaded? - There was something in it; I suppose powder and ball; it was delivered to the constable; we took him to the constable; I took up this sheath of a cutlass (producing it); the ( cutlass fitted the sheath exactly.)</p>

               <p>What sort of a night was it? - Cloudy.</p>

               <p>Could you see so far as that? - I saw them, it might not be quite so much as fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Was it moon-light then, or did the moon rise afterwards? - It was rather a dullish night, the moon had not made its appearance as I saw.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoners? - I can't swear very positively to Harris, but to the best of my belief he is one; I can say nothing to Lucas; I know there were two.</p>
               <p>How did the persons behave that robbed you? - They swore a good deal; Harris said, Give me your money; give me all.</p>
               <p>Had they any arms? - Yes, a pistol; he presented it to me and Mr. Hughes; Harris was much confused; first he waved his pistol all round and then presented it to my breast and with an oath said, Give me your money, all your money.</p>
               <p>Where was the other man? - Behind him.</p>
               <p>In what manner did he attack the coach? - He rapp'd at the coach door; I let down the window and he opened the door.</p>
               <p>What did he take from you? - One guinea.</p>

               <p>What sort of a night was it? - The day was hardly gone.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough to see their persons? - Yes; when he was before the justice he was in another dress, which rather confused me, and made me not positive; as soon as Harris went away, Mr. Hughes said to three people in the pathway, will you give me assistance? and they said, yes.</p>
               <p>Was he in the coach or out of it then? - In the coach.</p>
               <p>Did the coach stand still then? - Yes; Hughes was going out, he called upon the coachman for his assistance; the coachman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177705140009"></xptr> came down immediately and run after them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master printer, carrying on business in Wheat Sheaf-yard, Farringdon-street. I was examined before the Magis<lb></lb>trate at Worship-street—I first saw the prisoner about seven months ago—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183711270100"></xptr>
               <p>applied to me to be taken into my service about that time, under the appearance of very destitute and miserable circumstances—he told me he had been very badly used by his brother, who had deducted his wages, and did not give him what was due to him, and for some months he had not been on speaking terms with his own parents—he had a portion of his apprenticeship to serve, and as I had known his brother I took him into my service as a pressman—he continued with me about six months—almost from the first of his coming to my employ, I began to miss rem<lb></lb>nants of works and papers—I had never missed any before, and have not since he left me—I have other people in my employ, and could not tell who to suspect—on the 13th or 14th of November, I went to No. 23, Gee-street, the prisoner's lodgings, and found two Nautical Magazines and this other property, which I can identify—here are three Sermons on the New Marriage Act, they appeared as waste paper; and here are differ<lb></lb>ent bills which he had to post for me, but he had not posted them, he had kept them for purposes of his own—this is waste paper, here is the Narrative of the melancholy Shipwreck of the ship <hi rend="italic">Charles Eaton</hi>—that was found at Islington—I went there because I knew he had a box there—the policeman got the key from his wife—she was present when we went to the house, and gave us the key in his presence—in the box we found the Narrative of the <hi rend="italic">Charles Eaton,</hi> some waste paper, and three cards, show cards or boards—they are mine—I did not exactly miss any of them, but the moment I saw them I knew they were mine—I had never sold them, or given him any authority to have them—I cannot tell how shortly before I saw them in my place, but I am sure they must have been there—these are August and September Magazines, and must have gone since that time.</p>

               <p>might Miss Bruton produced two magazines—I expected the prisoner would be at home—I do not think I staid two minutes with the ladies be-before he came—I had made no arrangement with Miss Bruton and the mother and the wife that Miss Bruton was to say, "By-the-bye, Mr. Goode, I shall return the two books you lent me"—I had nothing to do with it—I did not expect that she would do it—I saw these magazines first on the morning of the 10th of November, I think—I called on the prisoner to inquire whether he had posted a number of bills advertising the "Nautical Magazine" for me—I was shown into the parlour by Miss Bruton, and the first thing that caught my attention, was the "Nautical Magazine" eleven—I made no remark about it—I called in the evening, and had numbers of the "Nautical Magazine" in my hand, and Miss Bruton and the prisoner were there—I had not been there two minutes before Miss Bruton brought up the books—the sight of these books in my hand might put her in mind of it—I believe it was to Mr. Tillinghurst that she said, By-the-bye, here are the two books you were good enough to lend me"—she did say so—I knew Mr. Goode lodged there—I was not in the habit of frequently visiting there—perhaps the whole number of times may have been a dozen, both in the presence or the absence of her husband—I had no idea that Miss Bruton would produce these books—I did not speak to her about it before Mr. Goode—she did not say that she would go and fetch the books that Goode had lent her to read—the prisoner followed her down stairs, and came up again with the books—he had them in his pocket, I believe—I asked him for them, because he followed Miss Bruton down, and because I had seen them in the parlour that morning—I asked what there was of so much importance in these books that I-might not see them—he said, "They are something of my own"—I said he need not try to hide the truth of the matter, I had seen the books down stairs in the morning—he then said that Cross, the warehouseman, gave them to him—I had not been to the prisoner's lodgings in Islington, the morning of the day I got the two magazines—I do not know that his wife ever lived at Isling<lb></lb>ton—we were never together in any house in Islington—I knew Mr. Parry lived where the prisoner lodged—I was never there but with the policeman—I have seen the wife three or four times since the husband was taken up, at her lodgings—he was taken on Tuesday, and examined on Wednesday, and we wanted some duplicates, and we thought that a young man we wanted might be about Gee-street—I went there with the policeman, and the wife's mother and father were there—I have been with<lb></lb>out the policeman to visit the mother, and saw the wife at her mother's house, but I never saw her alone—on the first night we went to Worship street, I drank tea with his wife—I went several times—three or four times without a policeman, and drank tea at her mother's house—I remember the prisoner's father and brother coming in and finding me at tea there—I do not remember the woman saying she would keep company with whom she liked—I will not swear it was not said.</p>

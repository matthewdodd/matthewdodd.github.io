                  </hi>. I live in Wellington-street, Newington-causeway. On Wednesday last I went to Mitcham to see a friend—it was the day of Dorking-races—I left Mitcham between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, and was the worse for liquor—I went into an inn at Mitcham—I had three sovereigns in my purse when I went into the house—I had received them from my friend—I could not find a coach at the inn—I waited there about a quarter of an hour, and had a glass of brandy-and-water—I changed a sovereign to pay for it, and received 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in change, which consisted of half-crowns and shillings—I put them into the other end of my purse—I also had one shilling in my pocket, and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—not finding a coach, I walked on towards Tooting, and between Mitcham and Tooting I heard a glass coach come by—I then took my purse out of my pocket and put it into my stocking—when the coach came up I asked the man if he could convey me to London—he said yes—it was the prisoner Clarke—he got down and let me inside the coach—there was somebody rather shorter than himself on the box, who I cannot recollect—I found a little girl and boy inside—the little girl was very anxious indeed to get home—after getting a little way the horse would not go on—we got out and walked a little way, as Clarke asked me—I walked a very little way, being very ill and very sick, I was obliged to get in again, and the children got in again soon alter—soon after a man came and took the children away—they said they must have some other conveyance to get them home—I do not know where this was—they left me in the coach, and I went to sleep—I was awoke by Clarke asking me if I was cold—I said, yes, I was very cold—he covered me over with a great coat—I do not think he stopped long inside, but I slept so soundly I do not know—I went to sleep again directly—I cannot say when I awoke again, but I was sick and vomiting, and he opened the coach-door—at Vauxhall-bridge he came to the door, and told me I must get out, which I did, and asked him where I was—he said, "At Vauxhall-bridge"—he wished me good morning—he did not ask me for any money for the ride—I went on</p>

               <p>two or three steps, and saw a policeman—I asked him where I could have a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> or coach to take me home—he said, "At the Horns, or Kennington-cross"—I instantly put my hand down to my pocket, and missed my money, and said, "Oh God, I am robbed"—when I got out of the coach I recollect seeing the other prisoner on the box—I found my stocking either cut or torn—they were new stockings, and were not so when I got into the coach—I am quite sure my purse was in the stocking when I got into the coach—it was my right stocking—I had boots on, and it laid just on the top of the boot—the policeman and I went to a stable at Westminster, and found the two prisoners there, and he took them into custody—I have never found my purse—it was daylight when I was at Vauxhall-bridge—we were four hours coming from Tooting there, as one of the horses would not go—they were obliged to push the vehicle along—they had come from Epsom—the shilling and copper were gone from my pocket, as well as the purse from my stocking.</p>

               <p>on Thursday morning at half-past four o'clock, near the bridge—I saw a glass-coach stop at Vauxhall-gate—both the prisoners were on the box—Clarke got down and let the prosecutrix out—she crossed the road from the gate towards High-street—the coach went over Vauxhall-bridge-about three or four minutes after it was gone, the prosecutrix came and asked if I could tell her where there was a cabstand—she complained of being robbed, and described what she had lost—I went in search of the coach, and traced it to the Ship-yard, Horseferry-road—the prosecutrix followed me—I arrived there first with a brother-constable—I found both the prisoners there and the coach—I took them into custody—when the prosecutrix came up she told Clarke he was the party she suspected had robbed her, that he was the only one who had got into the coach with her—he said he knew nothing at all about it—I took them to the station-house, and on Clarke found one sovereign, a half-crown and two shillings in his breast-pocket, and fivepence halfpenny in copper in his outside coat pocket—I found on Jackson one sovereign and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., all together loose in his right-hand jacket pocket—there are five half-crowns, seven shillings, four sixpences, and a fourpenny-piece, one penny-piece and three halfpence—he said he got it by strapping horses on the Derby-day at Epsom, and he gave silver for the sovereign at a booth at Epsom—I asked him where the booth was—he said he did not know what booth it was, nor where it was—Clarke claimed the money he had—the prosecutrix showed me her stocking—I have it here—it appears to have been either torn or cut just above where her boot would come, on the right leg—she told me before any thing was found, that she had lost two sovereigns and 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in her purse, and fourpence halfpenny and one shilling out of her pocket—I asked Clarke id he knew Jackson—he said he had know him for years by being about the Marsh-gate.</p>

I have been to Epsom and have lost all my money, and lost my friends"—I said, "I can't give you a ride to town, I can't give ourselves one I am going to walk"—I meant I could not get the horses along—I had two children with me, one my master's and one belonging to a person named Bonner—one of the ladies who went down with me was to ride back in a gig, and I was to take the two children back—the prosecutrix at last got into the coach—Jackson was at that time standing about there, and he agreed to help us back—he was not in the coach—I said, "will take the two children and walk, we cannot get them on"—there were two policemen there, also a man who said he was a knacker, and a man in a blue jacket; who</p>

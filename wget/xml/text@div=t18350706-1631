The prisoner was in my employ on the 13th of April—I did not send him to any body to get any scemt bottles that day—I am a glass-cutter, and sell scent bottles—I was called to give evidence on another subject—there were two duplicates for scent bottles produced—I was called upon to say whether they belonged to me—these are them—I know them to be mine—I saw them last time in my shop, some time in April—these twelve were packed in a paper for exportstion—they were not sold—I have not doubt they are mine, but I have no private mark on them—they were wrapped up separately in small papers, and then in dozens, I had had them to make up an order for exportation—upon</p>

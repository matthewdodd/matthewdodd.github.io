            . Nathaniel Jerrom was going by me at half-past twelve o'clock on Saturday night, the 18th of May; I asked him for something to drink, and took him to the Sun - we knocked at the back door in Angel-alley - the prisoner and his brother, who is gone, came up, and turned his pockets out, and said, "Floor him;" the prisoner knocked me down on the step of the Sun publichouse - with that four or five of them came up belonging to the party, and ill-used Mr. Jerrom; I was not able to give any assistance; I did not see them take any money, but Mr. Jerrom said he had lost two half-crowns.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She knew where I lived. Witness. No, I did not know where he lived - I knew his friends.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not come and live in the same court, and say to me, "Graves, you was not one of them that robbed Mr. Jerrom?" A. No, I did not - as a woman I did not; he said he was very sorry, but he hoped I would speak as much in behalf of his brother as I could; I took breakfast with his sister, and they behaved very well.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I met her in Shoreditch five days after: she stopped me, and said, "George, I have very bad news to tell you of your brother; there was a robbery done in Angel-alley;" I said, "Was I in it?" she said, "You was not," and she said she had mentioned every man's name that was in it. Witness. No; I do not know any man that was in it but the prisoner and his brother.</p>
               <p>JURY. The prisoner says you went to reside in the court he did? A. No, I did not; I have seen him frequently; I did meet him, but I do not know that he resided in that court.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell the prosecutor who it was? A. Yes, I did, and he said he should know the two men- they had certainly turned his pockets inside out; I said it was the two Graves. It was dark - there was a lamp; it was rather dark: I can swear the prisoner is the man who wrested me from Mr. Jerrom's left arm the moment the brother said "Floor her;" there was a gas-lamp about four yards off; five or six people came up to him after the robbery - I called out for assistance; they all made their escape after they knocked Jerrom down - there were six or seven in the court before the robbery; there were two females sitting on a step, who I believe were with the party; I do not know whether they knew of it after if had been committed. I saw the pocket turned inside out.</p>
               <p>COURT to NATHANIEL JERROM. Q. Was there a light there? A. Yes, at the bottom of the court; it enabled me to see the persons' features distinctly; he asked me to give him a glass of gin - I said I did not mind, and then he put his hand into my pocket.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 18th of May Jerrom and Mitchell came to me; they were both perfectly sober - they stated the case, how he had been robbed; I said, "It is of no use to go to look after these villins to night, as I know them well;" Mitchell said it was the two Graves; I went to the Black Raven public-house on Sunday night, a little after ten o'clock; I said to Jerrom,"You walk into this house along with me, and if the person is there. point him out" - he did so, and said, "That is the man;" I said, "Are you positive sure of it?" "Yes (said he) that is the man." I have seen the prisoner at the bar several times since, but he has another brother, and I should be sorry to take the wrong man; when I took the prisoner he said, "Brown, be so good as to let me go on my errand," and I said, "1'll be d - d if you do - I have a heavy charge against you."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What was I doing? A. Standing at the corner, doing nothing.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) Your memorialist says that the witness, Sarah Mitchell, has been a drunken and bad character; in the year 1820 she was transported for seven years, and afterwards sent to the Penitentiary; she now has no real place of residence. but prostitution with the prosecutor, as your memorialist has been informed and believes. Your memorialist submits it, and it may be obvious, that on and after the 17th of May last, the witness well knew where to find your memorialist, she having been a witness against your memorialist's brother, and convicted him for the offence last Session. Your memorialist's witness (Mary Ranson) will prove that at the time alledged your memorialist was in bed, as a lodger, and of good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Pike. On Tuesday, the 11th of July. about a quarter before eleven o'clock at night, I was in King William-street, and going along the corner of St. Swithin's-lane the pri soner snatched at my bag—the ribbon of it was twisted round my band two or three times, but he got it from me—I struggled with him for above a minute—there were two persons—when he got it he went down St. Swithin's lane—there was a pocket handkerchief and two or three shillings in it—this is my bag—I saw it again the same night at the station-house—the prisoner was caught directly—there was a light at the corner—I am quite sure he is the man—I saw him very soon after in custody.</p>

On the night of the 11th of July, as I was returning home about eleven o'clock, the prosecutrix came up to me and told me she had been robbed by the two men who were running down the lane, and pointed them out—I ran after them—(hey turned the comer—a watchman took one passing the end of a street, and I followed the prisoner and took him—I saw the bag found on him at the watch-house—I lost sight of him for a few seconds in turning the corner, but there was no one else about.</p>

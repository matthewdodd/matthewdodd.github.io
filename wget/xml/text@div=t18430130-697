                  </hi>. I assist my father, James Edward Watts, a pawnbroker, in Hereford-place, Commercial-road. On the 11th of Jan., about half-past twelve o'clock, I was in the shop—I noticed the two younger prisoners, Hurley and Powell, outside the window—(a day or two before this about four inches had been broken out of the corner of one of the windows, and we had put some paper across to cover the aperture)—I saw one of the younger prisoners, I cannot say which, with his hand in the window, taking three gold snaps out, and a silver piercer—he put his hand through the win<lb></lb>dow from outside—I saw the snaps remove—I had them in my view at the time the hand took the snaps, and then the two younger prisoners went away—Gill was standing about a hundred yards from the house—I had not seen him at all before the snaps were taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not said before that you saw something taken? and have you not given the names of the prisoners, and assigned to each what he did? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only the elder prisoner, Gill—I had not seen Gill at the window that morning, nor on any previous day—the paper was taken off from the outside of the window, and the inside piece of paper was burst.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not before said that you saw one of them (naming him) take something from the window, and that you afterwards discovered that it was the snaps? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my recollection, my Lord—this is my signature to this deposition—it was read over to me—I do not now know which is the prisoner Powell—I know Gill—he is the elder one—I did not give names to the prisoners before the Magistrate—if anybody has put down that I said I saw Powell take the paper away, and put his hand through the glass, and</p>

               <p>take something out, that is not correct—if they state that I said he delivered it to Gill, that is not correct—I did not say he delivered it to him—he went up to him, and came back again—I cannot say which is Hurley—I have not said that Hurley was standing about a hundred yards off—I understood it was Gill—I ran out and took all the three prisoners—I delivered them to the charge of my brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it is not true that you delivered two to your brother, and ran after the third? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I delivered two first; I took them when they came back to the window the second time, and then I ran after the taller prisoner Gill—I understand his name is Gill—I was not asked the name only before the Grand Jury—I did not find any thing on either of the prisoners—the property was found in a hole under a gateway, where I found the elder prisoner—he had been standing a hundred yards off, and he ran round a gateway—I do not remember saying I saw something taken—I allowed them to take them out, and they went away to the prisoner Gill, who was standing about a hundred yards from the shop—the two younger prisoners returned again to the win<lb></lb>dow, and one of them had got his hand in the window again—I cannot say which it was—I immediately went out and took the two younger prisoners, who were at the window—I took them into the shop, and left them in care of my brother—I immediately ran after Gill, the elder prisoner—when I over-took him he was concealed behind a gateway, three turnings down the Com<lb></lb>mercial-road, about a quarter of a mile from the shop—I brought him back to the shop—I then gave the three into custody to the officer—I did not pick up anything behind the gateway—the officer did—this is the property—I did not know either of the prisoners' names—I was not asked their names—they gave their names before the Magistrate, but I did not pay attention to them.</p>

I went to Mr. Watts, and found Hurley and Powell in the shop—I saw Watts's brother—it was not stated what was lost—they did not know what they had lost—I searched Hurley and Powell, and found nothing on them—Watts then brought Gill in, I found a knife on him—I went to a gateway in Richard-street, where the witness said he found Gill, which is about 300 yards from the shop—I there found these three gold snaps—that was the first intimation I had about them—they said they had lost a silver piercer, but did not mention the snaps.</p>

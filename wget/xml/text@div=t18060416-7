               <p>Q. What was the value of this oil. - A. We sell it for five and sixpence a gallon.</p>

Yes, he said a little while after he put the oil down, he hoped his master would forgive him, it was a little for his own use, and he would never do the like again.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

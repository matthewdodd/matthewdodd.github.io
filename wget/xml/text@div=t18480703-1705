I am a son of William Cluff—my grandfather was an Irishman—I have lived at Spitalfields eight or nine years—some bills were circulated on 17th May, after which this pamphlet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was published—the circumstances related in it are supposed to have occurred twenty-four or twenty-five years ago—I bought it on 29th May of the prisoner, about a quarter-past eleven o'clock, in Elm-street—he had a large bundle of them under his arm—he was not making any noise—I supposed he had got a bundle of these books, and said, "What have you got there?"—he said, "A lot of 'A Tale of the Nineteenth Century; or, Paddy Cluff'"—I said, "What is your name?"—he said, "Daniel Rush"—I said, "That is a most wicked and malicious libel on the character of my father; it contains not a; word of truth; I caution you that you will get yourself into trouble"—he said "I don't mind what you say; your name is Cluff, and I know all about what is in the book; I know your father very well, it don't mean him"—he Pointed out that it was "Cluffe"—he passed on—I saw him stop two men at</p>

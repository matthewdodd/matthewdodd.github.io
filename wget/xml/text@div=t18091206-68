On Wednesday the 8th of November, the prisoner came into the shop for a quire of writing paper; it came to sixpence, she gave me a seven shilling piece; I gave a five shilling piece, a shilling, and sixpence: she asked me to give her shillings for the five shilling-piece, as the paper was for a lady that owed her four shillings, and she thought she could get it if she took the change in shillings. I asked the prisoner if half a crown would do it; she said, no, she thought she had enough without changing. I then put the seven shilling piece on the glass case; then she said, she had not enough; then I gave her half a crown, and three shillings; I was looking for a shillings worth of halfpence, to make up the full change. I missed the seven shilling piece from the glass case: I asked the prisoner where it was; she said, she did not know. I rang the bell for assistance, and my sister came down; we sent for a constable. I described the seven shilling piece; he searched her, and found nothing: she went to the fire place in the shop, and then we heard the seven shilling piece fall; the constable picked it up, and found it was the same as I had described.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to Mrs. Woddeson's. I searched the prisoner, and could not find the seven shilling piece. I asked the prisoner where the lady lived that she bought the paper for, she could not tell. I said, it is a stale trick; I will try to choak her; that moment, she went to the fire place, and spit it out of her mouth. I desired them to get me a candle, and I found the seven shilling piece which Miss Woddeson had described to me by a little turn up on the the head.</p>

            . The prisoner came to our house on the 16th of April, between the hours of eight and nine o'clock, she came for a skain of silk; that came to three halfpence; she gave me a bad shilling, I had some suspicion; I gave the shilling to Mr. Dark. I told her it was a bad one; it was returned to her. Mr. Dark sent for an officer, and there were five others found upon her.</p>

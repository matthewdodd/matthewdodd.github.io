               <p>Was you present at any time, and where, at a conversation that passed respecting the service of a notice on the plaintiff Jolly, in the original act in the Court of King's Beach? - Yes, sir, it was in Fleet-street; upon my word I cannot tell the day and month, it was at a public house by Temple-bar, I do not know the sign of it; I believe it was about July, but I cannot take upon me to say; it was this prisoner at the bar; I knew him for some years prior to this; I do not believe I have been at the public house four times in my life.</p>
               <p>How many times? - Once or twice; it is up a passage by Temple Bar, not Bell Yard, nor Shire Lane; I believe it is the Star, I cannot tell who keeps it; I believe it was the latter end of July, or thereabout.</p>
               <p>You are coming to swear to a conversation, when you do not know the month, when you do not know the place, and yet your memory is so very accurate as to recollect the conversation; you shall go on, but it is at your own peril, that is all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. State the substance of this conversation, and the very words as you can state them? - I will; that man came and spoke to me and said, he had a notice to go to serve; the prisoner belonged to the Post Office; some years back he used to carry letters about; I am a shoe-maker; I never bailed three people in my life; I do not believe I bailed four people.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Three Manner Court, Fore Street, No. 1 and 2; I have two houses there; I am landlord of the houses; I have lived there between six and seven years.</p>
               <p>Do you mean the last six or seven years? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you never swear that you lived in Fleet Street, when you made an affidavit in the Court of King's Bench? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Nor in the neighbourhood of Fleet Street? - Never.</p>

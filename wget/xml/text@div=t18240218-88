On Thursday, the 29th of January, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, my attention was called to the propagation house; the front window was about two inches open - a plant called Banksia Grandis, which had been placed within three inches of the window was gone.

            , one Gustavia Augusta, and two Calamus Nigers, from different places in the pits; the persons must have gone all round the pits to take them. I went to the front of the house, and saw footmarks; they could not have been taken out through the window. I informed Mr. Alton, who took me to Bow-street, and I accompanied Ruthven to Mr. Colvill's nursery, at Chelsea. I went first to the prisoner's house, and saw him; Ruthven stepped forward, and said,</p>
               <p>"I am Ruthven, of Bow-street, I want the box you received this morning from Kew-bridge" - he stood about two minutes, appeared struck, and said nothing. Ruthven then told him that he knew all the circumstances of the case, and it was of no use to hesitate, and there was only two ways for him, either to go to the watch-house, or deliver up the box; he said he would go and shew us the box - he took us to Mr. Colvill's house, adjoining the nursery ground. He (Sweet) asked for Colvill, and told him that we were come about the box that came that morning; before Colvill answered, Ruthven stepped forward, and told him his name; Colvill said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"You know nothing about the box, and I know nothing about the box" - Ruthven said it was of no use, for that Sweet had brought him there to receive the box, and he would search all the gardens over, but he would find it, and it was of no use to hesitate. I was sent to fetch a coach to take him to the watch-house, and brought one within twenty yards of Colvill's door - I found the garden door open when I returned, and no person there. I knocked at the house door; Colvill came running down the street opposite, and spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to a house in Colvill's garden - A. Yes; Ruthven and Mr. Sweet were there - the door was locked. Colvill found a key after some difficulty, and let us in. Ruthven then said to Sweet,</p>
               <p>"Now, where is the box?" He looked round the shed, and could not find it. Ruthven then asked where the plants were - the door of the plant-house was opened - we all entered, and went along the passage. Sweet took a plant down, and asked me if that was one - I said No - he then took another, and asked if that was one - I said No; I did not want that at present, but we had lost that plant some time ago. I suspected that it belonged to the gardens. Ruthven said,</p>
               <p>"Come and look here," where Sweet was looking - I did so, and immediately recognized two plants, the Gustavia Augusta, and a Calamus Niger. I said to Sweet,</p>
               <p>"I want a small plant of Banksia Grandis;" he went to an adjoining house, took it off a back shelf, and gave it to me. I knew them all well - all these three were under my care, on Wednesday, the 28th. I then said to Sweet,</p>
               <p>"I want an Eugenia, of the species Mallaccensis;" he said that was in another house - we went to that other house - it was with some difficulty the key was found by Mr. Colvill. Sweet picked the plant out from among other plants. I then said, there was a Jacquinia. Colvill said," We have different species of them." I described it as having<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180048"></xptr>pointed leaves, and Sweet produced it. I then described another plant, with large leaves and glands on the foot-stalk, which I have no name for but Seerah Koah, the native name - it comes from the East Indies. Sweet took us to a house, and found it among other plants, after some difficulty. I said, there was another plant. Sweet said,</p>
               <p>"No: did you not get the two Calamus Nigers?" - I said, No; we had only got one - we went back to the first house, and found it in the same place as the other - I knew them all on seeing them - they were in larger pots than when they were at Kew - they are of great value, and are not to be found in this country, except at Kew. The Calamus Niger, Seerah Koah, and Banksia Grandis, have been previously taken from Kew, and there are now some of them. One

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long have you been employed at Kew - A. Two years. There are a great many work-people there at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not Mr. Aiton the privilege of buying - and does he not part with some of the plants at times, without consulting anybody - A. I do not know; he may allow cuttings to be given to growers - he has given plants away, but by what authority I do not know - he has ordered them to be packed up and sent away. We often receive plants at Kew without any letter intimating from whom they come.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that the constant habit of botanists - A. Yes: we receive boxes which remain for a week before we open them to see what is in them, because we do not know where they come from. The prisoner was in Mr. Colvill's service - he has a most extensive nursery, part in King's-road, and another is called the Grosvenor nursery - we found the plants at the Grosvenor nursery. The prisoner lives five minutes walk from there. I told the prisoner that the box came from Brentford, or Kew-bridge, they were both mentioned. Ruthven said,</p>
               <p>"I have come for the box you received from Kew-bridge, or Brentford," I am not certain which. Colvill strongly denied knowing anything of the box, and then Sweet denied it. Handcuffs were then put on him, and I was sent for a coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned to the prisoner the plants you came in quest of, and he produced some to you of, the same description - A. He produced the plants I wanted - I saw none of the same species with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not claim two plants as stolen from Kew, and afterwards admit that you were in error - A. I said, there was one I suspected had been stolen from Kew, but in that I might be wrong. Sweet took it down and asked if it was one - I said,</p>
               <p>"No; we lost that a fortnight ago." I have said, that I may be mistaken in that one. The plants were not in the same pots, or the same mould, as when at Kew.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not every botanist prepare mould in his own way - A. Yes; when we receive plants we put them into our own mould, but we never open the boxes till we are ordered. The prisoner has published a great deal upon botany.</p>

            . I am principal officer of Bow-street. In consequence of information, I accompanied Mr. Smith to the prisoner's house, Old King's-road, Chelsea. On Thursday evening, the 29th of January, about ten o'clock, he came to the door - I told him who I was - and that I had come to him for a box brought to him that morning, from Brentford - he hesitated for some time. I told him not to deceive himself, for I knew all the circumstances, and that the man brought it to him, about ten, or between ten and eleven o'clock that morning - he hesitated and then said he had received a box. I asked if he would shew it to me - he hesitated, and I told him I must take him to Bow-street; he said he had the box, and would shew it me. I at that time had only asked for the box received from Brentford - he fetched his hat - and walked with me to Mr. Colvill's, which is about one-third of a mile off. As we went along, I told him the box contained plants - that there were five or seven in it - and asked if he had opened it - he said Yes; but he did not know how many it contained. When we came to Mr. Colvill's house, he rang the bell, and asked for Mr. Colvill, who came; he said I had come about the box; and before Colvill answered, I told him my name, and who I was - Colvill said to Sweet</p>
               <p>"You know nothing about the box. - I know nothing about the box" - I said that would not do, and turning round to Sweet, said</p>
               <p>"Are you inclined to say where the box is" - he said</p>
               <p>"No, I do not know" - I said that equivocation would not do for me - for he had brought me there to get it - I took him into the house - handcuffed him, and sent Smith for a coach to convey him away, as he would not tell me - and after some hesitation he said he would shew me - Mr. Colvill said to him again,</p>
               <p>"You know nothing about them, or where they came from - I know nothing about them; we have many things sent us, and we do not know where they come from" - I, Sweet, and Colvill, then left the parlour to go into the grounds - it was then nearly eleven o'clock - when we got outside the door, Colvill separated from us and went out of the grounds, fearing there was something wrong; I took Sweet without a light across the ground to the place where he was going to shew me - he took me to a place called the Sand-house - I asked him for the key; he could not find it - I endeavoured to lift the gate up; he said he could open it; which he did - and about that time Colvill came in a direction from his own house - calling</p>
               <p>"Sweet, Sweet, where are you;" he said</p>
               <p>"Here" - and immediately he came up, he took him by the arm, and said</p>
               <p>"I know nothing about the box - do you know what you are at?" I told Colvill that would not do, that he had brought me there to find the box, and if he did not produce the key, I should find something and break it open. Colvill fetched the key and a light afterwards; we opened the door, went into the sand-house, and there was two boxes; Smith said he did not think it was either of them; we then went into the plant-house - he walked down the paths - I asked him to shew the plants, as it would save a great deal of trouble - he pointed to one and asked if that was one. Smith who had joined us, when Colvill came up, said</p>
               <p>"No," he pointed to another - Smith said</p>
               <p>"That is not what we are looking for, that we lost about a fortnight ago." Sweet went to another end of the path, I asked him again to shew us the plants, as it would save a great deal of trouble; I asked him two or three times over; he made no answer; but seeing his eye directed to a place over the shelves, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180049"></xptr>called to Smith, and said,</p>
               <p>"Take the light, and look there;" he looked, and picked out two pots. Smith asked for another pot; he took us to another house, and and in a corner, nearly at the top, Sweet reached the Banksia Grandis - he asked for another. Sweet took us across the ground to another house, in which was found two more; he asked for a sixth; we went to another house, and found that - Smith then said there was another plant. Sweet said</p>
               <p>"Did you get three;" and I said</p>
               <p>"No; only two." We went back to where we got the first two; and on the same spot found the third; we then went into the seed shop; and saw one Durdon; and Sweet asked him for the box that came to him that morning. Durdon pointed to a box; but we did not think that was it; he said there had been a second box which was sent away. Colvill, Sweet, and Durdon, agreed that this was the box (producing it). I said it was two small to contain them; but they said they came in smaller pots - I asked Sweet where the direction was, which was on the box, or if he knew where it was; he said No. I then began to search him - he then said</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I have got it in my pocket - and produced this from his pocket - (handing it in). Read,</p>
               <p>"Mr. R. Sweet, at Mr. Colvill's nursery, King's-road, Chelsea, to be delivered immediately." He had got one of his hands out of the handcuffs, as he has a small hand - I compared the nail holes in the direction with the box - but there were no nail holes in the box; the direction could not have been on that box. On Saturday morning, between King's-road and the office, I asked him if he knew Hogan, who worked at the King's gardens, at Kew - he said No; he did not recollect - I told him to be careful of his answers, for if he told me what was not true, and I proved to the contrary, it would act against him; and told him I believed there was but one Irishman worked in the Botanical garden - and I meant him, (Philip;) he said Yes; he believed he had seen him, but did not know him - I said if I proved that he had written to him and was acquainted with him, it would be against him; he said then that he did know him very well; and had talked to him at Mr. Colvill's garden, about plants; and that he knew other workmen at Kew gardens.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened on Saturday; had he been at large - A. On Friday night I went to the gardens again, and could not get to the office to appear against him, and he was discharged, and on Saturday I took him again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You found him still at his own house - A. Yes; there was a nursery where he resides. I do not know whether that is Colvills. There was nothing on the direction of the box to inform him that it came from Brentford; he said he had taken out the plants, but did not know whether there were five or seven.</p>

               <p>Q. Why not take the master in whose grounds you found them - A. I received information that he was concerned; and the box was directed to him - the master could not get away, and I could not take both - there was three of us, and the plants to go in the coach - Colvill was examined at Bow-street, and held to bail; bail was offered for the prisoner. After the two first plants were found, he pointed out the rest; the box produced had a cover to it, but I have not brought it. I left it at Mr. Aiton's, and do not know what has become of the cover. I am not aware that this is a prosecution from Bow-street. I have given no evidence on any bill against Colvill. I felt it my duty to ask the prisoner the questions I did - it was to ascertain who was the thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to him</p>
               <p>"you won't do me to-day, though you got the better of me yesterday" - A. I said so to the master, who made a false representation to get him at liberty.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Has the cover of that box any mark or writing on it - A. None; I think it impossible that the plants could have been put into it.</p>

             brought a box - it was directed to Sweet - the direction produced was on it (looking at it.) I believe it to be the same - I read it, and put the box down in the bar, and next morning our hostler took it out of my hand, and gave it to Orkshot, who was with the coach.

            . I am a tallow-chandler. On the morning of the 29th, I received a box from Mrs. North - the direction produced was on it. I put it into the back boot of the coach, and went with it to the White Horse cellar, Picadilly, and rode with it to the Admiral

               <p>"I have a box for Mr. Sweet" - the prisoner then came; he turned the box round - I asked him, if the direction was right - he said, Yes, and asked where I brought it from - I said, from Kew-bridge, and it came to 1 s. 6 d., which he paid me; it was a wider box than that produced, not quite so long, but about the same height.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it like that - A. It was rough, and not made so well - he turned it round, and looked at the direction.</p>

            . I work at Kew-gardens. Hogan gave me this box to take to the Waggon and Horses - he gave it to me opposite the Ferry - he works in the Botanic, and I in the kitchen garden.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that he had lived with Mr. Colvill many years, but never had any interest in his stock; that his duty was, when they arrived, to make the necessary arrangement for their nurture and improvement, but he knew nothing of who they came from, and that Mr. Colvill ran the risk of their purchase. That thousands of plants had come directed to him (the prisoner) unaccompanied by any letter or message, and he has not known for months after who they came from, that they were sent in compliment to him, being a publisher, and that these came like many others, and were transplanted into Mr. Colvill's mould, that he would have produced the direction to the officer, but he said there was guilt in the transaction, and he did not wish to implicate his master.</p>
               <p>A JUROR to MR. SMITH. Q. Mr. Sweet is an author, and is not Mr. Aiton one also - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not Mr. Sweet criticised Mr. Aiton's work, and said he was a dunce, and had palmed a publication of others on the world - A. I have read a publication calling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180050"></xptr>Mr. Aiton a dunce, but do not know who is the author - it was in the Botanical Register - Sweet is not the editor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that the box was to have been sent from Kew before it went - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know that it was a trap or plan for Mr. Sweet - A. No; on my solemn oath, I have not the least idea of any thing of the sort; I had suspicions.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What do you mean by the expression, had suspicions - were your suspicions, that there was a trap - A. No, suspicions where the plants went to.</p>

            . I have been clerk to Mr. Colvill for twenty years - the prisoner lived five years with him as cultivator - he is author of the Botanic Register. Plants have been frequently sent to Mr. Colvill, and we not know who they came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not the courtesy of the profession, when there is anything rare, to send it without any communication to another cultivator for improvement - A. Yes; when plants come, we move them into our composition mould - the prisoner lives at the other nursery - these plants were put in a public place - a number of people constantly come there.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you mean, that you often receive plants or cuttings - A. Plants, cuttings, and seeds; we transplant them the same day, if they are perishable; the prisoner was employed at the nursery daily.</p>

We have received valuable plants, boxes, and seeds, without any message or letter; I do not know the value of these - they are reckoned valuable. We have received valuable plants from Sir

            , and have had no advice of them. They are frequently addressed to Mr. Colvill, and frequently to the prisoner. We received a small Indian plant on Saturday, without advice, and do not know from whence it came.</p>
               <p>WACEY WHISKIN. I am a gardener in the employ of Mr. Colvill, and have been so about thirteen months. Sweet is managing man - I am under his direction. I have known boxes and packages to come directed to him without any letter - we constantly receive plants without knowing whom they come from. Sweet is the author of botanical works, and plants come to him for experiments - they are placed in the house according to their proper temperature; these were put into different hot-houses, near those of the same species. We have the Gustavia Augusta and Banksia - I think we have plants the same as all of them, but cannot say - I am only there for improvement - Mr. Colvill receives the money the plants are sold for.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. When was your attention called to them - A. I saw them in the course of the afternoon - they were not shewn to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Point out the Jaquina - A. I do not know them in this state - I know these are plants of the same species, but do not know their names. I have heard them say, when unpacking them, that they did not know who they from.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You are only on improvement - A. Yes. I saw the place these plants were moved from, and saw plants of the same species about them.</p>

            . I am curator at the Apothecaries' Company's garden at Chelsea, and understand botany. I have seen plants of the description of all these in this country except one, which, I think, is the Calamus Niger. I have some of all the others. Plants frequently come to me without advice from various views. My friends at times send me plants to puzzle me - the puzzle is to know who they come from. Mr. Sweet is considered the first practical botanist in Europe; and as his talent appeared, I courted his society, which is for the last seven years. I never knew an imputation on his character. I know that Colvill has plants of the description of both these.</p>
               <p>Q. Might a young man know from the look of these plants the species, without knowing their names - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You often receive plants sent to puzzle you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you then put them in a place for sale - A. We have no sale place; they are put into a hot-house for nursing - (Looking at the plants). - Here is a Zamia Spinalis - we are not tied to Kew names. The Banksia is not common, but it is in this country, and has been sold. I have looked over Colvill's collection, and will venture to swear he has Engenia and the Jacquinia; here is one without leaves, which I cannot speak to. Here are only two of them which I would take to Chelsea, which is the Calamas, and one which I do not know the name of. There is no price but as fancy leads - some of them I should think worth 10 s. 6 d., others 5 s. - the value depends on whether they can be propagated.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If plants were sent you. you would put them where they would thrive - A. Certainly.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live in Piccadilly. I have published several botanical works for the prisoner - he has two periodical works going on now. I do not know that he has spoken of Mr. Aiton in them. The Botanical Register is not his publication. I suppose, within the last five years, I have received fifty or sixty parcels for him - they have come containing what is considered rare plants, and sent to him to be figured for the Botanical Register - sent to him without his knowing who they came from - they come in such a state, that the engraver cannot draw them. Mr. Sweet brings them into a state for their beauty to appear.</p>

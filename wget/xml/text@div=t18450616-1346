                  </hi>. I am a plumber, and live in Huntley-street, Torring<lb></lb>ton-square—my wife is a dress-maker. The prisoner has been in my awe<lb></lb>vice three weeks—from information I received I measured some pieces of silk and muslin, which my wife had to make into a dress—last Monday, on measuring it again, I missed three-quarters of a yard of yellow silk half a yard of yellow crape, and two half yards of muslin—about six o'clock in the morning of the 17th I went with an officer into the pri<lb></lb>soner's room—I told her I was going to search her boxes with a policeman—she said nothing—she helped take the things out of her box—I foun</p>

               <p>this yellow silk, crape, and muslin—I compared them with the pieces they were cut from, and found them quite correct—when I found them the pri<lb></lb>soner began to cry, asked for mercy, and said, "Don't give me in charge"—I had no other servant.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I was called, and went with Mr. Enon into the prisoner's bed-room—I asked to tee her box, and if there was anything in it that was not her own—she said "No"—I then proceeded to search the box—it was not locked—I saw her take out this parcel in taking out her frocks—it was folded up in a handkerchief—Mrs. Enon took it out of her hand, and gave it to me—it contained these things—Mrs. Enon said, in the prisoner's hearing, they were the pieces she had lost—I helped to compare them with the larger pieces, and they exactly matched.</p>

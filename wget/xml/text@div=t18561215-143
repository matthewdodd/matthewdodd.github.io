I have got on account; but it is in the lump—this book does not contain any of the cheques; it does not contain an account of the whole expenditure of the society—the small items are in the long book, the steward's book—all payments go into the sick book from the steward's book—there were frequently instances in which he had small amounts of cash for the purposes of the society, without expressing them; but the accounts of cash, for all purposes, are booked—this has been done since the last trial—I expressed no dissatisfaction about the last trial—this has been done behind his back, and no notice was given to his solicitor that he might go through the accounts; you have to rely entirely on my accuracy; nobody was present on his behalf—any explana<lb></lb>tion might have been given—he was out on bail yesterday—Mr. Lewis did not give me directions; the society did—one or two of the directors were present—I went through it, and they checked me as I did so.</p>

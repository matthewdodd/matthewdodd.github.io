             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 17th of January, I met with this young woman in Red Lyon-street, Spitalfields, between twelve and one o'clock in the afternoon, I asked her to go to drink a pint or a pot of purl, at a porter house, as I had worked with her two months; after that, I said my stomach ached being cold weather, and I would have some mutton stakes for dinner, and we had a pound and a half for dinner, and a twopenny loaf, we had another pot of porter, and then another pint of porter, I came out and I said, Peggy, do you know where there is a tin shop, she replied I will find you one, accordingly she said, she would go; I unscrewed my box and took out one shilling; the half-guinea lay at the top, and the silver at the bottom; I screwed the box up again, and took the shilling out to give the prisoner to buy a tin box, and I lost the screw box, money and all in an instant; says I, Peggy, you have got my box.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you sober? - I was not so sober as I am now indeed: I came home, I had not a farthing in the world.</p>
               <p>Court. You see the consequence of drinking so much? - There was nobody in company but her and I; I have had nothing to day but my tea and a pint of beer to my dinner; I lost nineteen shillings in all, but it was put down sixpence lower at the Justice's; I do not know the meaning of a warrant, God knows I do not, I have lost all my good time, I do not mean to hurt a hair of the prisoner's head.</p>

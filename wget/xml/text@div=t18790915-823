"All I can say is that there were five men instead of four, which the last witness can prove. I was 10 yards away from the man when he was assaulted. I never laid my hand on him. I was the worse for drink. I saw the prosecutor lying down, and thinking something had been wrong, I thought of my previous bad character, and I thought it would be best for me to get away, as I might have to suffer for it. The barman at the Seven Stars could say there wen five men there drinking, and the barman at the Half Moon.</p>

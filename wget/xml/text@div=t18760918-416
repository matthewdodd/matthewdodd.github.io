                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer H</hi>). About 1 o'clock on the morning of the 20th August I was passing through the Commercial Road, with Detective Newman, when there was a very heavy thunder storm and it was raining very heavily-as we passed from the south side of the Commercial Road to the north, there was a very vivid flash of lightning—I heard a struggle, and looked round and saw the prisoners struggling—I rushed to where they were and caught hold of Murphy and Curtis—I saw an old man there, and I said to him" What have they done?"-Newman at the same time caught hold of Robinson—he said "They have robbed me, and taken my few half-pence"—they said "All right; Mr. Foster, we have done nothing"-Newman called "Police!" and another constable came up and I handed Curtis over to him—I heard something drop—I had Murphy in custody, and he turned round to the old man, and said "You old be you ought to be pole-axed"—I said "That a nice thing to say; to rob a man, and then say 'you ought to be pole-axed'"—he said "I shall get off with 'six months"-when we got to the station, the prosecutor made the charge, that he had lost 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. In coppers—the handkerchief found on Robinson by Newman, and the papers, he identified as his property before the prisoners, and he charged them and attended at the police-court, and gave evidence there—I have since then made inquiries as to where he is, and have received some information.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was very dark until the flash of lightning-that was the first that attracted my notice—I was about 5 or 6 yards off them we were crossing the road in a slanting direction—they were standing on the pavement close to a doorway—I searched Murphy—I did not see any<lb></lb>thing of the halfpence that the prosecutor was robbed of—I was holding the two, and did not look for anything that dropped—I went back the next morning and looked down the area-two of them were standing over the grating, an iron grating, let into the pavement.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer H</hi>). I was with Foster when the prisoners were taken into custody-a vivid flash of lightning came, we were hurrying home—I saw a tussle among three or four people immediately after the lightning—I saw Murphy and Curtis holding the old gentleman, each one holding an arm, Robinson was rifling his pockets, and I could see the left pocket of the old gentleman turned inside out-Foster caught hold of two and me the third, and we pushed them all three up against the shutters in a row—I said to the old gentleman "We are policemen and they are thieves," and the old gentleman said "You don't mean that, you are companions of theirs"—he appeared doubtful as to whether we were or not, and I repeated it again, and he said "Oh; thank God, I thought they would have killed me "-while holding them up against the shutters, I saw Robinson drop something on the pavement—I picked up these pieces of rag and these papers, and Murphy said "Look here, don't you put anything in my pocket"—I said "If you talk to me in that manner I will put my knee in your belly"—I then called out" Police "-we took the three to the station—I did not hear the prosecutor say what he had lost; I assisted him-we got to the police-station and the charge was made in the presence of the prisoners, of stealing 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers from the old gentleman—I showed him these memorandums and asked him if he could recognise them, and he said "Yes, they ought to be in my pocket"—I told him in the prisoners' presence where I picked them up—I searched Robinson's tail pocket where I found these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which the old gentleman said</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see them until the flash-when the thing dropped from Robinson's hand the old gentleman was standing behind us we had them up against the shutters—I have heard there was another man about the place at the time; a brother of one of them I believe—I don't remember their saying somebody else had shoved the old man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners' Statements before the Magistrate.—Robinson says:</hi> "We were standing up for shelter when three young chaps going by shoved the man.

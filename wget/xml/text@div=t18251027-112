               <p>MR. WILLIAM SUTTABY. I am in partnership with Richard Suttaby and William Fox, of Stationer's-court, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270043"></xptr>have no other partner - I live on Ludgate-hill. On the 1st of July the prisoner came to my place of business, and wanted mill-boards, and other materials for bookbinding; being a stranger, I inquired how he was to pay for them - he tendered me this instrument, and he wished to have goods to the amount of about 8 l. and the rest in money. I desired my servant to look out the goods he wanted - he looked out some, and said he would leave the others till another time, as he did not exactly know all he should want - he had part of the goods that day, and I paid him 16 l. 8 s., in money, taking 12 s., discount. I was acquainted with Mr. Cudden in business, as being a respectable man, and did not object to the bill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You know nothing of him except from the transaction of that day? A. We have had several transactions since, but this is the first. I had some slight knowledge of him as having been apprenticed to a customer of ours.</p>
               <p>The bill was here put in and read (see indictment). It was drawn of Mr. A. Cudden, and accepted in the name of Cuddon.</p>
               <p>MR. SUTTARY. In consequence of some after dealing with him he called on me by appointment, and was taken into custody.</p>

            . I live at No. 53. Frith-street, Soho, and am clerk at Messrs. Wright and Co.'s banking-house, Henrietta-street. I know a person named Ambrose Cuddon - he lives at No. 62, Paternoster-row, and can say that the acceptance to this bill is certainly not his writing. I am in the habit of seeing a good many persons writing, and am well acquainted with Ambrose Cuddon's. If any one presented this bill to me, I should say it was not his writing; it does not appear to me to be like it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What relation are you to him? A. His cousin. I do not know whether he has employed the prisoner on any business myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you visit Ambrose Cuddon at No. 62, Paternoster-row? A. Yes; he is the house-keeper. I believe he has no lodgers - nobody else of his name lives in the house. I know no other Ambrose Cuddon, there or any where else.</p>
               <p>JOHN KRULL. I am in the employ of Ambrose Cuddon, of No. 62, Paternoster-row - (looking at the bill) - this is nothing like master's hand-writing. I have been in his service about a year and a hall. I very often see him write, and am quite certain it is not his writing. The prisoner worked for master - I do not know whether he ever saw master write. I think I should know the prisoner's writing - I think the body of the bill is his writing - I do not know whose writing the acceptance is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever see the prisoner write? A. Not very often - six times at least; the last time was two or three months ago; I saw him write a note to master, and saw what he wrote.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that bills were drawn by him, and accepted by your master, very frequently. A. No; there has been something that master has scolded him about; I know nothing about bills; I am my master's only servant; he is a bookseller.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Is there any lodger in the house named Ambrose Cuddon? A. No; I speak to his hand-writing from having seen him write; I know nothing of his drawing bills on master.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From the 1st of July down to this time has your master had any lodger? A. I am not certain; I sleep in the house, and if he had, I must have known it I think; there have been persons lodging there, but I am not certain whether it is since that time; I heard their names; they were not at all like the sound of Cudden.</p>

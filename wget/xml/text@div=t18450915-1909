                  </hi>. I live in Bermondsey-square, and am a broker; I knew the deceased; he was called <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Curtis, but I understand his name was M'Donald. On the 2nd of Aug. I was at the Lord Monteagle public-house, Walworth—the prisoner and a person named Barker, a grease-buyer, were there—the prisoner was telling Barker that he had some fat to sell, and that his name was Owen Buckley—Curtis interfered, and said his name was not Owen Buckley—the dispute was entirely about the name—the quarrel rose so high that there was a challenge—the deceased said he would have a <hi rend="italic">set-to</hi> with the prisoner—they agreed together to go out and have a <hi rend="italic">set-to</hi>—they both went out and took off their coats—they caught hold of one another in the way of throwing one another—they threw each other twice—both were tipsy—if they had not been tipsy I think it would not have occurred—they stood in the middle of the road arguing, "Do you want anything of me?" and like that—they then took hold of one another sharply, and threw one another down in the mud in the kennel—it was a very awkward place—there is a drain-hole about a foot deep—they fell off the road across the kennel, and the deceased was undermost the first time—they got up again, and were persuaded to go away—the deceased crossed the pavement to the road again, to the prisoner, and they had at it again—they caught hold of each other, and threw one another down on the other side of the road—I stepped up and picked one of them up, I do not know which, but, I believe, the prisoner, and per<lb></lb>suaded him to come away, and not fight any more—several others also per<lb></lb>suaded him, and several persuaded the deceased to do so, and they were separated—they put on their coats, and walked away—Curtis walked with two or three more—I was at the same beer-shop on the Saturday following, and saw Curtis there having a pint of ale—he asked me to drink—I refused at first; at last I took a drink, and he said, "What two fools me and this Buckley must have been to have gone out on Saturday week to roll one another in the mud, for I do not think we hit one another a blow, or hurt one another."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Salisbury-place, Lock's-fields. I was called in on Thursday, the 14th of Aug., to No. 12, William-street, Brandon-street, Walworth, and there saw the dead body of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184509150102"></xptr>
               <p>a man—I made an examination of the body on the 17th—I found a rupture of the peritoneum of about seven inches in extent, with effusion of blood between the folds of the intestines; also serous inflammation of the outer covering of the intestines—I found about a pint and a half of blood in the right cavity of the chest, with congestion of the lungs—under the cuticle of the chest I found an effusion of serum and blood together—I then examined the muscles of the chest, and was satisfied in my own mind that he had been injured in some way or other—the rupture of the peri<lb></lb>toneum was the cause of death—such a rupture might have been caused by the hard pressure of another man's knee on him—if he fell, and a man upon him, that would account for the laceration of the peritoneum—I found no discoloration of the external surface—if it had been from a kick, there would have been discoloration—I cannot form any judgment as to when the injury was received; it would depend entirely on what time in<lb></lb>flammatory action was set up—if the injury had existed for a fortnight be<lb></lb>fore, he must have complained.</p>

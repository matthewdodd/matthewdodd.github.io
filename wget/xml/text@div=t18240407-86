On the 26th of February, about eleven o'clock in the morning, my daughter said this pestal and mortar were stolen, and in the course of the day the prisoner was brought to the shop charged with taking it - he said that he and a young man together took it away, and had left it at a place in Long-alley - I went there, and the person denied having it, but brought it to me in about ten minutes. I find the prisoner bears a very good character.</p>

               <p>EBENEZA HEYNER. I live opposite Mr. Plant. I saw the prisoner go into the shop; another boy waited outside, and attracted the attention of Plant's daughter while the prisoner took the pestal and mortar; put them under his coat, and both went towards Finsbury-market. I ran over - they ran off, and I lost sight of them for about four minutes; then the prisoner returned to the shop, and I followed him to the new market, where he was taken.</p>

            . I live in Duke's-court, Long-alley, and am a tin-plate worker. On the 26th of February, the prisoner and another boy came and asked if they might leave something with me; I refused - they said they should not be above five minutes, and I let them leave this pestal and mortar. Three men came to the shop - I was flurried, and denied having it; but hearing that it was stolen, I sent it to Plant, and went myself.</p>

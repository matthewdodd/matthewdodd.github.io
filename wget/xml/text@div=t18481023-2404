                  </hi>. I am clerk to Martha and Mary Wray, of Downes' Wharf, Lower East Smithfield. The prisoner was carman to a Mr. Hedges—on 12th Oct., I saw him at the wharf—my attention was called to a cask of colour for paint in the first-floor warehouse, which I had seen on the ground floor a fortnight before—the prisoner was on the lower part of the wharf, and 1 asked him if he knew the carman that was in charge of a cart of Mr. Hedges, which was just on the wharf—he said he did, his name was Sadler—I gave the prisoner into custody—I had not seen him do anything—the paint is the property of Martha and Mary Wray.</p>

On 12th Oct., I went to Downes' Wharf, and saw the prisoner there—I saw him roll<lb></lb>ing a cask of paint from the warehouse into a piece of tarpauling, and Sadler, who is not in custody, helped him to put it into the cart, Sadler then drove the cart away.</p>

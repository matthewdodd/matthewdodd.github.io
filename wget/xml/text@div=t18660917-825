                  </hi>. I am a seaman—on the evening of 28th August I was at No. 11, Ship Alley—the prisoner also lived there—when I came in I heard a quarrel between prisoner and the landlady, about some money—I said to him, "If you don't pay her you are no man"—he asked me what I had to do with it—I said, "I am no more in the house than you are, but I like to see things go on in rights"—I used no gesture in using these words—the prisoner then got hold of me and tried to heave me over the table—I said, "Hold on," and pulled my coat off—nothing unfair in the fight occurred till he hit me under the chin—after I got my coat off I hit him back and made his nose bleed—I took a candle and went out in the yard with him because he said he did not want to fight me—I said, "Neither do I you"—I then went into the yard and washed his nose—we shook hands and got friends again—when we got into the house again the mistress said, "All are quiet; if you want to sleep go up in the berth "—he said, no, he did not want to sleep in the house any more—he says to me "I want you to come along with me to the man who told you I was trying to cheat the mistress"—I said, "All right, I'll come along with you"—he went before me, and I was going to follow him, but when I saw him putting his hand</p>

               <p>in his pocket I got rather scared, and drew back, and shut the door—at the same time I told him he had better go to bed now, and to sleep—I spoke in a friendly way to him at that time—he tried to break the door open when he saw me shutting the door—he was quite sober—neither of us had been drinking—I opened the door when he was trying to break it, and as soon as I opened it he struck at me, and hit me here—it is now healed up—there were other cuts about me—as soon as I put my head outside the door I got the cut—he then caught hold of me round my neck and dragged me into the street—I fell down, and then a woman came up and dragged the prisoner from me—I don't know the woman—I was taken to the station-house, and have been under the care of Mr. Phillips since—I was stabbed twice in the head, and once in the shoulder—I did not see him with the instrument in his hand, but I saw his hand in his pocket—this is the same knife—it belongs to the prisoner—it was found on the ground where I was stabbed—I know the knife well.</p>

                  </hi>. I was standing outside No. 6 on the night in question—I saw prisoner and prosecutor come out of No. 11—they appeared to be fighting—the prisoner came out first—he appeared to catch hold of the prosecutor round the neck—that was directly they came to the door—the prisoner ran backwards, dragging the prosecutor with him, and they both fell on the ground—the prosecutor went on the ground first—the prisoner fell on him—the prisoner appeared to be striking him—I said, "Don't strike a man on the ground"—I got the prisoner by the hair of his head, and dragged him from the prosecutor—it was neither light nor dark, dusky—I saw more by the light from the windows—I was present when the knife was found at the prisoner's feet—he said it was not his—there was blood on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the H division of police, and reside at No. 2, Spital Square, Spitalfields—on the morning of 29th August I was called to the Arbour Street station to see the prosecutor—I found an incised wound on his forehead—it appeared to be produced by some sharp instrument—this knife is a likely instrument to have produced it—he had also a wound in his head, and a more serious punctured wound at the back of his shoulder—for the wound on the forehead and the wound on the shoulder some considerable violence must have been used—the one in the head was slighter in its character—there were three distinct blows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>.—I went at eleven o'clock that night to 11, Ship Alley—the mistress of the house said I might go upstairs and go to bed—the prosecutor then said, "Why don't you go up stairs, and not make so much noise. You haven't got any money to pay the money you owe "—I then said to him, " Is that anything to you? Are you the master of the house?"—he then struck me in the face, that my mouth and nose bled—directly afterwards he said, "You want to cheat the mistress, and you don't want to pay her anything"—I then said to him, "Who has told you so?"—he then named another man—I said, "Of course if I want to cheat her I can do so if I like "—he then struck me a second time in the face, and made my mouth and nose bleed—I then went into the yard to wash my face—he went with me—we then made it up together, and I said to him, "Come and show me the man who has told you so"—I then went into the house, and he followed afterwards—I then went outside the street door, thinking he was going to follow me—when he came outside I said, "Come and show me the man"—he then opened the door, and with one step out of the door got hold of me by the hair of my head—I then laid</p>

               <p>hold of him, got my arms round his neck, and both fell to the ground together on the stones—when we were lying on the ground together he said in English, "The b——'s got a knife"—I then said, "I have not got a knife; I won't strike you with a knife "—I had no knife, I never struck him with a knife—the policeman then took me into custody—I had a coat at the house which had a knife, and that knife was stolen from me—I had a knife, but that is not my knife</p>

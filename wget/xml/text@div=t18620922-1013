                  </hi>. I am in the service of Sebastian Garrard, of Colebrook<lb></lb>lodge, in the parish of Wandsworth—on Monday, 25th August, there were forty sheep in a field adjoining Mr. Garrard's premises—I saw them correct at 8 o'clock in the evening—I then locked the gate of the field with a pad<lb></lb>lock, and took away the key in my pocket—there is a lane separating that field from Mr. Garrard's house and grounds, running up from Putney-heath, and joining the main road at the corner of Mr. Garrard's grounds—that main road runs from Kingston, through Wandsworth, in the direction of London—when you get through Wandsworth you turn to the left, and go down to Battersea-bridge; that would be two miles or two and a half—on Tuesday morning I missed eight of the sheep—the padlock had been forced open by an instrument—the sheep were marked with my master's brand; a round black, spot on the left hip—I have since been shown eight skins by Inspector Drake—I identified them—two of them were very plain; they had a portion of the mark left, but six out of the eight were partly gone from decomposi<lb></lb>tion—I spoke positively to the two—the other six had the mark partly left—the mark was in the same place and apparently of the same description—the wool was the same class of wool, the same shearing, the same length, and corresponded in every respect—I believe them to be the skins of the eight sheep that were lost that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 24, Radnor-street, Chelsea, that is within a door of the entrance to Radnor-gardens—on the night of 25th August, I was sitting up for my father, looking out of the parlour window—I saw Heath come out of Radnor-gardens, he went a little down the terrace, and then went back again into the gardens—he whistled, and a few minutes after I saw Sandeford drive the sheep down the terrace into the gardens; Heath followed after him—about ten minutes afterwards I saw all the three prisoners come out of the gardens, and go back again about a quarter-past 12—Heath put his hand into his pocket for something to open the gate with—about half-past 9 next morning, I saw Sandeford come down and go into the gardens, and about an hour, or an hour and a half afterwards, I saw all three come out—I did not see their faces, but I knew it to be them because I knew them by sight before—there is a gas light under our parlour window, and by that light I saw Sandeford drive in the sheep; I could not mistake him, because the light was thrown so on his face; there was no one with him then, but Heath came from somewhere and followed him in.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, B</hi> 39). On Tuesday morning 26th August, about a quarter-past 2, I was on duty at Smith's-terrace, adjoining Radnor-gardens—I heard some talking there, and immediately afterwards saw Heath coming out of the gardens—another person was with him, to the best of my belief, it was Withers—I asked them what they were doing there—Heath said that his father lived there, and that he lived there also—I asked what was the reason that the garden gate was left open—he said his mother was in the habit of coming in late, and that was the reason, but that his father would see to it and get the lock all right—he said they were butchers and they were going near the Red-house to work.</p>

On 10th September, I went to the premises occupied by Heath's father, in Radnor-gardens—I had before that been looking about to discover the parties—in the course of that morning I probed the garden with an auger; in the course of my search I turned up eight sheep skins, they were buried about four feet under the ground—those skins were shown to Pepper, Mr. Garrard's servant—the entrails and offal were also buried there—on two of the skins the marks were visible, it was kind of round mark on the left rump; the others were too far gone to distinguish—on 31st August, I apprehended Sandeford—I told him I should take him into custody on suspicion of stealing eight sheep—I did not say where from—he took an oath, and said, "I was not out of Chelsea during the whole of Monday night"—I had told him when they were stolen—he said he was along with Oliver, the walking man, at Alexander's water<lb></lb>side public-house, till 8 o'clock—on 31st, about half-past 12 o'clock, I apprehended Withers—I told him I should take him into custody on suspicion of stealing eight sheep—he said he had not seen any sheep; that he had bought a pig of Mr. Brewer of Radford-gardens; that Heath was with him, and they bought it between them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector V</hi>). On 31st August, about half-past 2 in the morning, I was examining Radnor-gardens, and during the time I was there Heath came home, he came near to his father's house—he lives there when he is out of employ—I told him I should take him in custody on suspicion of stealing eight sheep from Putney—he said, "I have not been to Putney; I know nothing of the sheep"—at the station he said he had not been out of Chelsea that night—I afterwards searched the premises, on 4th September—I found four knives in a rabbit-hutch, is asked at the rear of the house where his father lives—they are such knives as are used by butchers—there was also a saw, a chopper, a gamble, which they hang pigs</p>

               <p>or sheep up by while they are drawn—I also found a long piece of wood, several hooks such as are used by butchers in drawing sheep or pigs; a steel yard, which in used for weighing meet, and two steels to sharpen knives on—three of the knives appeared to have been recently used—I saw some blood dried on them; one was very rusty—the shed is about thirty yards from the bed of pinks—there is no slaughter-house in Radnor-gardens, or any regular place for killing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

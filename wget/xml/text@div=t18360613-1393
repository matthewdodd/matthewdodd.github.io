                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 153.) I was on duty in Back-lane, Clapton, on Saturday, the 21st of May, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner coming down the lane—it is about ten miles from the prosecutor's—he had a bundle tied up in a horse-cloth—I stopped him, and asked him what he had got there—he said meat—I asked what sort of meat—he said pork, that he had brought it from Walthamstow, that it was his own, and he was going to take it to Shore<lb></lb>ditch—I said, "I suppose you are going to sell it there"—he said he was—I took him to the watch-house—he said, "To tell you the truth, I am going to take it to a friend living at Shoreditch—he is a carpenter"—I asked if he was going to sell it, or use it for his own family—he said, for his own family.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook to Joseph Philby, of Loughton-bridge, Essex. On Saturday morning, the 21st of May, I went to the safe at six o'clock, and found it unfastened—I had fastened it the night before with two buttons—I missed from it a leg of pork, a loin of pork, and two pieces, a brace of pigeons, and a tongue—I have since seen the leg of pork, which was found on the prisoner—I know it, for I had salted it, and the pork I had taken a chop off—the safe adjoins the house.</p>

I bought this horse-cloth about five weeks before the robbery, and have no doubt it is mine, but I do not swear to it—I saw it the might before—it was kept in the stable, which is quite detached from the house, and about forty yards from the safe—they were both missed the same morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Peckham Rye Com<lb></lb>mon. On Monday, the 10th of February, I left my house about a quarter past two o'clock, leaving my daughter and three grandchildren in the house—I returned at about a quarter to nine in the evening, and missed a gold watch, and the other property stated, from a drawer in my bed-room—I had put the watch there about half-past twelve o'clock—it has not been found—I value all the articles stolen at about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

I was left behind with the three children when my mother went out on the 10th of February—there was no one else in the house—a lady called about half-past four, but only staid a few minutes—between six and seven o'clock I found the street-door open, and the front parlour window about a foot and a half up—I had seen it at a quarter to five o'clock—it was shut down then, but not fastened—the door was then bolted and locked—the persons must have got in at the window, and let themselves out at the door—I was below in the kitchen with the children—I did not miss any thing till my mother returned.</p>

On the 10th of February, from seven to half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner running across the Old Kent-road and Mr. Collins after him, hallooing "Stop thief"—I went after him, and when I was about ten yards from him, I saw him throw down some clothes from under his coat—I picked them up—I never lost sight of him till he was taken—as we were taking him to the station-house he went into a watering place, and while there, I saw him drop this pocket-book from his trowsers, which a young man picked up, and gave to the policeman—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Finsbury-circus. On the 9th of Novem<lb></lb>ber, in the afternoon, about three o'clock, I was on Blackfriars'-bridge—I had a handkerchief, and felt some one taking it, as I thought—I put my hand down, and felt it about half-way out—I drew if from my pocket as if to use it, and replaced it—on going about ten yards further, the prisoner came and leaned on my shoulder, and, as I suppose, took it—he was near to me when it was half-way out—I missed it instantly—he went down to the foot of the bridge—I followed, and seized him—I asked him for it—he said he had not got it—I asked him a second time—he said if I would let him go, he would give it to me—I gave him and the handkerchief to the officer—I did not promise him I would let him go—I threatened to beat him—he gave it to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Blackfriars-road. I saw the prose<lb></lb>cutor running, and saw the prisoner—when he got him, I heard him confess having taken it, and say he would make it up with the prosecutor if he would let him off.</p>

I was coming over Black-'-bridge, to go to Paternoster-row, and saw the handkerchief lying between two females' feet—I picked it up, and asked if it was theirs—they said, "No"—I held it out two or three minutes, expecting some one to own it—when I came off the bridge the prosecutor came behind me and said, "You have stolen my handkerchief—I said I had picked it up—I did not say if be would let me go I would give it to him.</p>

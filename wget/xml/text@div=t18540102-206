                  </hi>. I am the wife of Malcolm Ross, and live at Trafalgar-road, Greenwich—he is the master of a vessel, and the prisoner was a sort of ordinary boy on board the ship; he was not an apprentice—he had only been with us three weeks—he was only taken on trial—on 16th Dec., he came to my house to take his meals, the same as the other lads, but he left my house before dinner, between 11 and 12 o'clock; dinner was at 1 o'clock—after he had been gone two or three hours, I missed my husband's watch from the kitchen mantelpiece—I had seen the prisoner standing at the kitchen door, emptying a sack of potatoes—I left the room to wash my hands, and, during my absence, he must have stepped across the kitchen—I took the watch down about 11 o'clock to wind it up, as it had stopped; I twisted the guard round it on the mantelpiece—the prisoner never came back—I gave information to the police, between 4 and 5 o'clock the same evening—this is the watch; there is the knot in the guard which I tied—I know it by the glass, and by the wearing of the plating—my husband has had it eighteen years, and I have always been in the habit of winding it up when it is at home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to John Moore, of Church-hill, Woolwich, a pawnbroker.

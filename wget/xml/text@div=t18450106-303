                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 133.) On the 28th of Dec., at five o'clock in the morning, I was passing in High-street, Kensington, and saw the prisoner Garlick walking up and down in front of Mr. Oak's shop—I lost sight of him for about two minutes, and then saw both the prisoners leave the gateway, two doors from the prosecutor's shop—Garlick had a large bundle tied up in a blue handkerchief—Laws went into the prosecutor's shop, and Garlick turned up Church-street—I stopped him, and asked what he had got—he said meat which he had bought at Newgate-market—I said, "That won't do for me"—he resisted very much, but I took him to the station, and found it contained a leg and a saddle of mutton and two pounds of beef steaks—I then returned to Mr. Oak's shop, and said to Laws, "I want you about that meat"—he said, "I don't know anything about it"—I called up Mr. Oak, who was in bed—he came to the station, and claimed the meat, and compared another leg of mutton, which he brought from the shop, with that leg—there is no communication with the gateway to Mr. Oak's shop the back way—Laws is Mr. Oak'i servant—I saw him open the shop that morning—nobody could get into the shop without his assistance.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a butcher's shop at Kensington, within two doors of this gateway. Laws was my servant—it was his duty to open the shop, and remain there—I can swear this meat was in my shop over<lb></lb>night—I produce a leg of mutton from my shop which matches with the one found on Garlick; they tally, and have come off the same sheep—I recognized the mutton at the station, and said, "I have the fellow leg at home"—I knew the saddle of mutton to be mine—that and the beef steaks are spoiled—I compared the steaks with the piece of beef in my shop, and they were cut from it.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, of Westminster Hospital. The deceased was brought there on Monday evening, the <rs id="t18260914-42-cd244" type="crimeDate">28th of August</rs>

He began to be sensible on Tuesday, on Wednesday became delirious, and died on Thursday; I opened his head, and found a crack on the skull, which had caused his death - it might have happened from a fall - it was certainly not from a blow of the fist - falling himself, or from a blow, would occasion it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was he extremely intoxicated? A. Being insensible I could not tell; whether that arose from the injury or intoxication I cannot say - intoxication would certainly increase the inflammation - he might also have got the wound in the face by falling.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he die from inflammation, caused by intoxication, or from the injury? A. It is impossible to tell; the injury might occasion it, independent of intoxication.</p>

Nicholas said "You are any thing but one name;" Ryder said "What is that?" he said "jorrock;" Ryder said "I always was jorrock to you;" Nicholas directly put himself in a fighting attitude - he could hardly stand; Ryder put his hand out and pushed him down, without any injury; he got up - several people advised Ryder to go away, but Nicholas called him to come back and have some more of it; Ryder told him to go into the middle of the road, and he would give him a good one; Nicholas stumbled into the road as well as he could, with his hands in a fighting posture - Ryder met him and gave him a violent blow in the month, knocked him down, and his head either hit the curb or close by it- he became quite insensible, and was taken to the hospital - Ryder was brought there afterwards and given in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you drank with the deceased? A. I took part of a pot of beer with him at two o'clock, and advised him to go home at seven, he was so drunk then. He did not strike Ryder in the road - he meant to fight him certainly - he did not trip up, but was knocked down.</p>

            . I saw the deceased go to meet Ryder, as if to fight him - Ryder struck him a blow on the mouth, which knocked him down - I was forty yards off but heard his head strike violently against the curb; I went and told Ryder he had done the deed and must answer for it. He wished to go to the hospital to see how he was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see the first of it? A. No - his hands were up ready to strike Ryder - there appeared no ill blood on Ryder's part.</p>

            . I was in York-street, and heard Nicholas say Ryder was anything but jorrock - they put themselves in a fighting attitude; I put my hands between them, and persuaded Ryder to go away, as Nicholas was drunk; Nicholas struck at him twice, across me, and Ryder shoved him down - Ryder went a short way - what was said by Nicholas I do not know, but Ryder turned back, and said "If that is what you mean come into the middle of the road, and I will give you a rum one; Nicholas staggered into the road - Ryder knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the meaning of jorrock? A. No; I believe it is a term of reproach; Nicholas put himself in a fighting attitude both times, and certainly wished to fight, but if Ryder wished to avoid it he could have gone away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not Nicholas in the wrong? A. Certainly; Ryder turned to go away, and he called him back to fight, but he was so intoxicated I do not think he had raised his hand to fight when he was struck.</p>

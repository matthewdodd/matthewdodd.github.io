                  </hi>. I am a wine merchant, living at Xeres in Spain—I have carried on business there for many years dealing in the wines of Spain—at the end of October last year I consigned four hogsheads and eight quarter casks of sherry to Marshall and Co., of 10 and 11, Mincing Lane—the average value would be from 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a hogshead, and the quarter cask about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10a, exclusive of duty, freight, and dock charges—after that parcel was sent off I came to England, and saw the</p>

               <p>prisoner at his place of business, 10 and 11, Mincing Line—he had two rooms there—I saw a man named Houghton on that occasion—he was the first I saw—I negotiated with both of them, and it resulted in this agree<lb></lb>ment—I saw them both sign it, and I signed a duplicate, and left it with them. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 8th November</hi>, 1878, <hi rend="italic">and was an agreement between the witness, Houghton, and the prisoner, the witness to send wine from Spain to the vulue of at least</hi> 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">Marshall and Co. to provide</hi> 2,0002. <hi rend="italic">for carrying on the business in England.</hi>) That agreement was signed at Mr. Foster's office, solicitor, Gracechurch Street—before it was signed I had visited the prisoner at his then residence, 23, Royal Crescent, Notting Hill; it was a good house well furnished—he was living there with his wife—I was his guest there for a few days—he gave me to understand that he was a merchant, in the wine business—I don't recollect exactly the words he made use of—a verbal arrangement was made as to the way in which the capital was to be supplied by him—I was to draw upon him from 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at three months date; that was the first instalment he wanted to make of the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did draw three bills, the first for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated November 26th, and the others for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated December 4th, all at three months, and the firm Marshall and Co. accepted them—I don't know who wrote the acceptances. I was not over here; they were payable at the South Western Bank—the first one would be due on March 1st—I was then in Xeres—it came back protested—I have never received a shilling of it, or a shilling in respect of the capital—after making this partnership agreement I returned to Xeres—I think I left here on November 19th, and got there five days after—the small parcel I had sent in October was included in the general arrangement; it was to be sold on the joint account—I afterwards sent over eight hogsheads and 24 quarter casks of sherry in one shipment to the value of about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the total number I sent was 16 hogsheads and 40 quarter casks, the cost price being about 420<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 440<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I subsequently came over to England again, and went to the bonded warehouses belonging to Mr. Alderman Breffit—I there saw all the casks and counted them—I recognised every one; they were all marked with my own brand—on February 10th, while I was in Spain, I received this letter from my partner. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated February</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi> 1879, <hi rend="italic">from the Prisoner, stating that Houghton had gone to the Cape, leaving things in confusion, and being indebted to the Prisoner; that he did not see his way to meeting the drafts at maturity, and asking the Prosecutor if he could renew for two months.</hi>) I had not had any previous notification of Houghton's departure for the Cape—I left Spain on 6th March and arrived in London on, Sunday the 16th, and on the Monday I went to Mincing Lane—the prisoner was not there—after waiting upwards of two hours I left a card stating that I was going to his private residence—I went there—he was not there—I did not go in—there was a gentleman there taking an inventory of the furniture—I then returned to Mincing Line and found the prisoner at his office—I asked him if the two bills that were still running, the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., had been paid—he said they had not—they had been returned to Spain—I told him I had received the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I had already written to him—I asked him then if the wines were free, meaning if they were unencumbered—to the best of my recollec<lb></lb>tion he said they were free—he said he thought he could get over his diffi<lb></lb>culties and I promised to see him next day—I did see him next day at the same place—I then asked him if he could make up my private account, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187903310074"></xptr>
               <p>said "I wish to give you a cheque for the amount"—he said, "Houghton has left the accounts in such a confused state I am unable to make it out"—I asked if he did not keep a cash book—he said "No"—I saw him again next afternoon, Wednesday, at the same place, and I again asked him for the account—he did not give me any—what I meant by my private account was this, when I was over here I took 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on going back to Spain for my personal expenses, and he had paid two or three small accounts for me—the maximum amount was about 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was perfectly apart from the business; it was for my own private purpose—it was on the Friday that I discovered that the wines were at Mr. Alderman Breffit's when I asked the prisoner for a sample order; he gave me the order, but then stated that the wines were under advance to the extent of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I expressed my surprise—he then told me the wines were at Dowgate Bonded Warehouse; that is Mr. Alderman Breffi t's place, and I went there and saw the Alderman—I don't think I saw the prisoner again—I went to a solicitor that same day, and the prisoner was given into custody on the Monday afterwards; I charged him with embezzling the partnership property—I did not see him before that—when I went to his office on the Friday he was tearing up papers—since he was in custody my clerks at Xeres sent me this letter—I received it the day before yesterday; it is the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "March 12, 1879. My dear Crusoe,—Just a line, for poet time is nearly up. I have a party with large means who will take the management here in place of self or Houghton with your consent, &amp;c.

Moneys received were to be paid to the joint account between myself and A. Marshall and Co.—there was no banking account—the prisoner never sent me any accounts—he never informed me of any pledging with Alderman Breffit—I have never seen any books of account—I accompanied each of my consignments with invoices—there was an invoice of the shipping price of the wine, and in the body of the letter the joint account was debited with the actual cost—I never had any negotiation as to any one else coming into the concern, nor did I ever hear the name of any party.</p>

               <p>not aware that I asked him to guarantee the two unpaid bills"—I was sure of it, and I am certain now—I have not been accustomed to be in a Court of Justice before—I have no recollection of adding, "I won't swear I did not"—I might have been a little confused that day, but I am almost certain I did not ask him; I am certain I did not—I charged the wine to them at cost price—the office rent was to be paid by them, and the incidental expenses—the prisoner's first proposition was to work as an agent—in one or two letters he complained of the bad state of business—there was a person present at the office on the Friday, I don't know who he was—the prisoner made a proposition to me, which I rejected; he wrote it down on a piece of paper, and wanted me to sign it—he produced it to the Magistrate—I don't recollect what I said when I went into the office on the Friday; it was with regard to the accounts, if he had anything to show me, any statement of accounts, and he gave the same answer, that he had not been able to make up any accounts—then, I believe, he showed me the paper he had drawn up, and asked if I would agree to that—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "March 21, 1879. Dear Sir,—In consideration of your delivering to me the wines at present in Dowgate Dock shipped by me to you, I agree to discharge you from all liability between us under our deed of partnership, and to discharge and indemnify you for all acceptances you have given me, amounting to 615<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and further, that this delivery and arrangement shall be considered a settle<lb></lb>ment of all claims between us and put an end to the partnership; and I further agree to discharge on my own account the advances you have received from Messrs. Breffit and Co., and release you from all liability in reference thereto.") That was his proposition, to which I objected—he said something about a fresh partner with capital to come into the business; I think he said he had a person who would come in with capital and take Houghton's place, but I never saw that person, nor did he introduce him to me—I don't recollect that ho mentioned the name of Collins to me—he said he had claims against me for expenses over here; he did not say what those claims were—I think this conversation was on the Wednesday or Friday as he was given into custody on the Monday.</p>

A. Marshall and Co., and is endorsed "A. Marshall and Co." and "A. Marshall"—I have no doubt I saw the prisoner in reference to the advance; I saw him before I signed the cheque, at some part of the negotiation with regard to the removal of the wine—it was cleared by a clerk in the wharf office—the matter came to me for my consent and approval—I made some inquiry of the prisoner as to his power to obtain an advance on this wine, and he offered to produce the deed of partnership; he brought it to the office; at all events he made me acquainted with the contents—he said he wished the wine transferred from the London Docks to our warehouse, but I told him it was a foolish expense to move it from one place to another—on 6th</p>

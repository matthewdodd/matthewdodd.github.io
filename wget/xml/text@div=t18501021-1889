                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, B</hi> 47). On 20th Sept., about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was with Gibbs in the Clapham-road, and met the prisoner going towards town with a basket, which appeared heavy—I asked him what he had got—he said it was his own property—I asked him again—he said it was lead—I was in plain clothes—I looked into the basket, and found it contained this lead (<hi rend="italic">produced,</hi>) and this other piece of sheet-lead was in a handkerchief in his hand—I asked him how he came by it—he said he came from Kingston that morning, and three men on Clapham-common gave him the lead to assist him, being out of work—I took the lead to the New Prison at Wandsworth—the foreman produced this ladle—these four pieces of lead exactly fit it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of George Lock and another, builders; they have the contract for the New Prison. On 20th Sept. the prisoner was in their employ, and had access to the lead which was in the ladles—I have fittedt his lead to the ladles—it fits exactly—the four pieces are worth 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner had no right to take it off the premises—he had been in regular work from 13th Aug., and had been using this ladle.</p>

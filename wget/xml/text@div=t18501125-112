                  </hi>. I am a widow, and lodge on the ground-floor, at 6, Craven-buildings, in the house of Mr. Radford Parkworth, in St. Clement's parish; the prisoner is my step son, I left my room on Thursday evening, 7th Nov., about seven o'clock—I locked the door—the window opens into the street area; that was shut down and wedged—I was out the whole of that night—I came home about half-past eleven in the morning—I then found the window unwedged, but shut down—there was a square of glass which had been broken before, through which a person could get their hand and reach the wedge—I saw a dirty footmark on some publications which were lying on a chair—I looked about and found that my late husband's clothes were gone from a portmanteau under the bed—I also missed a black dress of my own, which had been hanging up in the room the night before, and also the key of the street-door from the mantel-piece; two handkerchiefs, five collars, and a card plate, from the table-drawer, which broken open.</p>

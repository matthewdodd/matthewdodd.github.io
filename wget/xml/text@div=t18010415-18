               <p>Q. How do you know he only pretended to unlock the other? - A. Because I had been the night before to examine, and found it unlocked; as soon as he had opened the shop, and his back turned, I looked in the till, and missed one shilling and sixpence; I went to the officer about ten o'clock, and he found one shilling and sixpence of money that I had marked, upon him; he had other silver about him, and twenty penny worth of copper.</p>
               <p>Cross-exmined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Are you alone in business? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons do you employ in your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150009"></xptr>shop? - A. Two young ladies that make up the millinery.</p>
               <p>Q. This till is left open during the whole business of the day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a mark was this? - A. More like a V than any thing else; but it was not intended to represent any particular letter.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you never saw a letter upon a shilling, or a sixpence, in your life? - A. Yes, I have, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there anything more common? - A. Certainly not; but that is done with a stamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never seen a sixpence, or a shilling, with a scratch of a pin upon it, or any other pointed instrument? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am a beadle,(produces the one shilling and sixpence;) I received it from the prisoner, with some other silver, and about twenty penny worth of halfpence; I asked him for his master's property; he said, he had got none; I told him I must see it; and then he pulled out one shilling and sixpence, of which Mr. Hoare had described the mark.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the same, but the mark is not very easy discerned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. There are several marks about it? - A. I don't wish to know any other marks than my own.</p>
               <p>Q. And that scratch is the only mark by which you are able to swear to it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any money due to this man for wages? - A. There is nothing due, I have paid it to his mother since.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. If you will examine it again, you will observe there are several smaller marks upon that money? - A. It is a mark that you cannot discern but by the shade of the light.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Is that conspicuous cross the mark you mean to swear to? - A. No, that is a mark put upon it by the officer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Will you venture to swear these marks were not upon it when you put it into the till? - A. I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Shepherd. I put a cross upon the opposite side to the prosecutor's mark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You put that mark upon it to know it again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have known it again without that mark? - A. Yes, I should.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am not guilty.</p>
               <p>Barr. This is the same money; I have another of the marked shillings in my pocket. (It is banded to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you intend that the mark upon this should be like the mark upon the other shilling and sixpence? - A. Nearly so.</p>
               <p>Q. This appears to be like a W.? - A. That may have happened from my marking one stroke down and not seeing it; I may have made another.</p>

Mr. Clark, of Ham<lb></lb>mersmith, a lead-merchant, dealt with us—on the 10th of February, the prisoner brought this order—I opened it, and asked him if he brought it from Mr. Clark—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if it was Mr. Clark the lead-merchant where we had our lead work from—he said, yes, it was Mr. Clark that drove the chocolate-coloured van—(he has a chocolate-coloured van)—I delivered him the goods stated, and he gave me a receipt for them, signed, "John Smith"—he came again on the 12th, and presented another order—I took him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the lead-line, and live at Hammersmith. I have a chocolate-coloured van, and have driven it myself at times, but my man usually drives it—I have seen the prisoner—I once employed him for about a day and half, about two years ago—this order is not my writing—I know nothing of it—I never received the goods.</p>

I was never asked where I came from till the second time I went there—then Mr. Pontifex took me into a side-room, and asked if I came from Clark, of Hammersmith—I said, "No"—he said, "How came you to come here?"—I said, "The note was given me"—he said, "Do you know it is forged?"—I said no, and if he would send a policeman with me I would show him the person; but I was detained so long, I dare say the person saw me and went away.</p>

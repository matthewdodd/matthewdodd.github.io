                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, at No. 25, Westmoreland-place, City-road. On 17th Nov. an old man, who seemed nearly blind, came to my house with a boy, and engaged an apartment—the day after he came the old man asked me to write to his agent, Mr. Rickerby, of Stamford-street, for him—the next day the prisoner came, asked for Mr. Ratten, and it was understood he came from Mr. Rickerby, the blind man Mr. Ratten's agent—he was taken up to Mr. Ratten—I was in the room with Mr. Ratten, and when the prisoner came in he said, "Well, young man, what is the reason Mr. Rickerby," or "your master did not come?" I think he said "Mr. Rickerby"—the prisoner said he was very unwell; he had got a bad cold, and he would call upon him in a day or two—the blind man then said, "Tell your master to send all my title deeds"—the prisoner said, "Very well, Sir"—the prisoner came again next day; my daughter took him up to Mr. Ratten, and he asked him if he had brought his title deeds—the prisoner said he had, and delivered five or six to him—I then left the room, and a short time afterwards the prisoner left the house—after the prisoner was gone the old man asked my wife if she had a drawer where she could place the deeds in safety—I saw the deeds that evening, but they were not put into my hands till the next morning, when the old man brought them to me and said, "What is this?"—he showed it me to read, he was apparently blind—there was" C. A. Ratten, Esq., Cherry Orchard, Dorking, "on one parchment deed—I saw several of them, and he called them his title deeds—after I had looked at them, he said, "I hope you are perfectly satisfied, "and said he had sent for them for my satisfaction—(he had represented himself to be a man of house property when he took the apartments)—being a blind man I told him I had no reason to doubt him—a few days after that a letter came for him, which my daughter took to him and read to him in his presence—I saw this promissory note taken from it (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>:" Leatherhead, Dec. 4th, 1852.

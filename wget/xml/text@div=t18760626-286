                  </hi>. I live at 5, Lee Terrace, Deptford—on 6th June, between 7 and 8 p.m., I was passing the prisoner's shop, 6, Church Street, Rotherhithe—he is a barber—I heard a disturbance and saw the prosecutor trying to come out of the shop and the prisoner trying to prevent him, and he struck Duffy in the face—I was close to the door, and went up to close it, and got saturated with blood—only one blow was struck—Duffy said in broken English that he had given <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and that the prisoner demanded another penny.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A man named Sales was by my side, but I did not see him push the door open, it was open when they came out—I did not see anybody push it from outside.</p>

               <p>trying to get away—I came out, the man followed and the prisoner followed him with a pair of scissors in his hand and deliberately struck him in the face with them—I heard him say that the man had had his hair cut and was shaved and he wanted another 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I am sure the blow was struck after I pushed the door open.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I pushed it open no one had hold of it inside—the prisoner had released his hold before Duffy got to the door, and then he thrust out his hand and the blow was struck—the prisoner then went inside and we took the man to a doctor's opposite.</p>

               <p>

                  </hi>. On Whit-Tuesday evening I went to have my hair cut, the prisoner was there, either shaving Duffy or cutting his hair—he was going out and the prisoner went towards the door demanding payment—I told Duffy he had better pay the man, but he struck him two or three times on the fingers to make him let go of the door—I remonstrated, and the prisoner held out something, but I could not see what it was—Duffy then put 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the counter and attempted to go out; the prisoner lifted his hand twice in a threatening attitude with the scissors in it; in the mean time the door came open, and as Duffy went out the prisoner made a blow at him, but whether he struck him or not I cannot say or whether the scissors were in his hand then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw him just throw out his arm—he lifted his hands in the shop to prevent Duffy from going out; there was a bit of a scuffle, and he made a blow at him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—I found a lacerated wound on Duffy's face from 2 to 3 inches long which had bled a great deal—I arrested the hoemorhage, but it broke out again and I believe he lost a great deal of blood—the point of a sharp pair of scissors would make the wound.</p>

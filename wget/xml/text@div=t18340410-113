            . I live in Robin Hood-court, Shoe-lane. I was working at the Robin Hood public-house - the prisoner came and asked me to take care of this rabbit for him - I said, if he would sell it, I would buy it of him- he said, no, it was to be raffled for - I let it run about the public-house for two days, and then took it home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought it in Holborn - Hazle came off the rank, and had a drop of gin with the man I bought it of - Hazle then told me to take it to his place, which I did - he said he would get it raffled for me, as he could get more members than I could.</p>

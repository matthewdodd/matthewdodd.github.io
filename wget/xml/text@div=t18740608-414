                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">Detective L</hi>). At 9 o'clock on the night of the 15th May, I was with Detective Dales at Hercules Buildings, Lambeth—I saw the two Harrisons there, each carrying a brown paper parcel—Harrison the man, at that time was not in the uniform of the Corps of Commissionaires, he had the uniform on but he had a coat over it—I followed them some distance up Hercules Buildings and the female prisoner took her parcel into the prisoner Munn's shop—it is a chandler's shop—I saw her go in—I was opposite—she placed the parcel on the counter and immediately Munns took it off the counter and placed it underneath—she came out—she was not in the shop half a minute—Harrison was sitting on the pave<lb></lb>ment on his parcel when the woman went into the shop—she joined him when she came out and saw us at the same time—I went over and asked Harrison what he had there—he said "Mind your own business, what is that to do with you"—I said "The female has taken something into the shop, come and see what it is"—I went into the shop and in the presence of the two Harrisons asked Munns what the female had brought in—he said "Nothing"—I said "I saw her place a parcel on the counter and you put it underneath," he lifted the parcel up and said "Yes, she brought a parcel and asked me to take care of it for a short time"—this is the parcel that was delivered to Munns and this is the one upon which Harrison sat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they have been opened since—the one upon which Harrison sat contained twenty-four pounds of mustard—the other contained two pounds of tea, fifteen pots of extract of meat and four pots of lobster—I asked Harrison what account he had to give of the goods and where he bought them from—he said he bought them for Munns—Munns made no answer—I told him his answer was not satisfactory and I should take him to the Police Station, which I did, and the two parcels—I went back for Munns afterwards, and when at the station Harrison said he was at the Union Flag public house drinking with Munns and he asked him and his wife to take the parcels over to his shop—Munns said "About eight or nine days previously Harrison came to me and told me he was in difficulties and he had brokers in his house and wanted me to lend him some money, he said he could buy me some goods much cheaper than I could get them myself"—I afterwards went back and searched Munns' house—I found fourteen packets of sperm candles, nine boxes of cigars, three packets of extract of beef, eighteen tins of mustard, twelve tins of swiss milk, and a packet of tea weighing fourteen pounds, done up exactly the same as the one in that parcel—I took those things to" the station and asked Munns if he could account for them in any way, he said he bought the things of people and sometimes he cleared shops, sometimes he had invoices and sometimes he had not—I found no invoices in his shop, nor upon him when I searched him.</p>

               <p>the female prisoner went into Munns; it was not light—it was light inside the shop—I have no doubt about the two prisoners because I knew them before—I saw the parcel lifted off the counter and placed underneath by Munns—it is a small chandler's shop—there are some goods in the window, cheese and bacon, and that kind of thing.</p>

I know the Harrison's well, and had been watching them with Parker—I saw them come out of the Union Flag—I saw the woman go to Munns's shop and put the goods on the counter, and they were put underneath the counter by Munns—I took Munns to the station—he said "Damn the fellow, I wish I had never seen him; I tried to do him a good turn and get myself into trouble"—Harrison came a short time back and told him that he had got the broker's in the house, and he had lent 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had received the goods for it—that was said on the way to the station—when Parker asked him to produce the parcel, at first he said the woman had not brought anything in.</p>

"—I said "I drove you once before; is it there?"—he said "No; it was down below that, on the right, the Union Flag, you will think of that?"—I took the parcel there—it was a little bit bigger than that—I left the parcel there, and was paid from the bar—I received 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the 14th May I was on the rank again between 1 and 1.30—he called me off, and said "Take these to the same place that you did yesterday"—he gave me two parcels and a note—one was rather small—I was to have something to drink and receive the money from behind the bar—I should not know the note again—I did not look at it—I put it under the cushion so as not to lose it—I gave up the parcels at the Union Flag, and was paid in the same way—I could not say who paid me the fare, the young lady or the landlord—I was paid over the bar.</p>

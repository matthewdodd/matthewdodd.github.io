               <p>Court. Did it go in deep? - An inch and an half at least, I was confined sometime; the other man is just upon the point of death, he received a worse wound than me: the men ran over the way, it was a very dark rainy night, I then ran to the constable of the night, he came with me instantly, we went in doors for about half a minute, coming out again this prisoner was standing on the opposite side of the way, it was about five minutes to the time I laid hold of the prisoner, the constable said there is somebody standing on the other side of the way, I could not run so fast as I would, having been bleeding, but another man run and got on the other side of him, and then I came up and laid hold of him, he damned my eyes and asked me if I wanted to rob him, I conveyed him to the watch-house, and when I came there this hanger was laid on the table brought in by another man, when he saw the hanger he attempted to take hold of it, I was nearer it than him and I put it on a bench behind the table, he then began to swear and call bloody thieves, I left him with the constable, and as I was so weak I was obliged to go to the infirmary to get dressed.</p>

               <p>Court. What condition was your husband in? - He was at the infirmary a month, he bled so much, his bowels were wounded, and he beg'd to die at home.</p>
               <p>Court. Is his life in danger? - In all probability he is a dying man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told her, says I, you are very much mistaken, I was not the person; I was taken to her husband, and he did not know me. I beg leave to say, my Lord, if I had done such a thing, I certainly should not have stood just opposite the place; I told him I lived at No. 69 in Holborn, and that I had got the key of the door in my pocket.</p>

               <p>Mitchell. I heard the prisoner say to the man that lay with him, damn that man, whom I suppose to be Hunter, he may think that we are to be bubbled, but I was the man that came out last; that is all I have to say; he said he would be his death if ever he got clear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I hope you will not rely on any thing that man says, he is the arrantest thief in the kingdom, he was committed to Tothill-fields Bridewell for robbing his master.</p>
               <p>The constable. I had a warrant for this man to take him up, he is a Baker by trade, he goes there of mornings to help them to turn over their bread; they have frequently given him a little flour, the master was told by some neighbours that he had been guilty of this breach of trust, it was four pounds and an half of flour, a misdemeanor.</p>

               <p>Jury to Hunter. How come you to recollect the prisoner so much to swear to him so positively? - It is by reason that when he came out the last man I had a lanthorn in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110011"></xptr> my hand, and I held it up in his face, and he had a long shag red waistcoat on when I saw him, and he had it on in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is there any other circumstances in the appearance of the man that enables you to swear to positively to him? - The features of the man, the waistcoat and great coat that he had on him.</p>

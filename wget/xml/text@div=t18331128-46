            . I am a lamp-lighter at Hampstead. I know the prisoners, they live at Hampstead - I remember seeing them last Saturday week, in Heath-street, Hampstead, at a quarter before twelve o'clock at night; they were going towards Hampstead-heath - I was running - I was not running to light the lamps - they were walking - I remember turning Mr. Watson's corner - they were walking one before the other; Willoughby walked first - he had a basket on his head; Shurety walked next - he had a basket on his head or shoulder; Cannon was the last - he had nothing on his head - after passing Cannon I kicked against a lanthorn; I called out to Shurety, "You have dropped your lanthorn, Jack;" he made me no answer - neither of the others spoke; Cannon appeared tipsy; I picked up the lanthorn - I saw an old lady lying down in the road; I picked up the lanthorn, and the old lady said, "Pray do not kick my lanthorn, sir, look how ill they have used me;" I put the lanthorn by the side of the old lady on the pavement - I went on; when I passed the prisoners they were laughing; I believe it was Shurety and Cannon - when I picked up the lanthorn they had turned the corner, and must have been twenty yards from the old lady when I saw her - I did not speak to her at first; she spoke to me when I kicked the lanthorn; the prisoners were about twenty yards off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Which way were you coming, down the hill, or going up? A. Down the hill, in the High-street; it was a dark night; I did not take particular notice - I know Mr. Pilcher's gin-shop, one or two houses there stand back; the road does not turn to the right till after you pass Pilcher's - I was not many steps from Pilcher's when I saw Willoughby, I was very near it - Willoughby was the foremost of the three men- I was close to him - as I turned the corner, he turned the corner; he came close to me; as I turned they turned; I was coming down from the hill and met them - there is a place called Brewhouse-lane - Willoughby lives at the bottom of Brewhouse-lane - the turning he took would lead him to his own house - I had no conversation with him.</p>

I said, "To the station-house;" he said, "Well, let us drink up our beer, and we will go;" they had a full pint of porter between them, and they came out with me and a constable - I took charge of Cannon, and gave Shurety in charge of Ruggles,

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not know Willoughby's person at all when you went to his house? A. No; I asked if his name was Willoughby; he said "Yes" - I had not my uniform on; I had my great coat; he could not tell I was an officer by my appearance, but I have no doubt he knew me - I have been at Hampstead about thirteen months; I have met him coming from the market of a morning; I have no doubt he knew me as an officer - his words were, "Cannon did it," to the best of my belief - those were his words - on our way to the station-house he told me the order in which they walked home, and he said, "Cannon was the last" - there had been a great deal of talk at Hampstead about this; I took him in consequence of information I received that night - I had seen the lamplighter before I apprehended them - I saw him about a quarter after nine o'clock on Wednesday night - he mentioned Cannon's name to me - I believe he lives at Hampstead - he might have talked to anybody else about Cannon before that, about Hampstead - whether what Willoughby said about Cannon was what he had heard I cannot tell.</p>

            . I am a police-officer. On Wednesday night the 20th of November, I went to the Nag's Head, public house, with Aggs, and apprehended Cannon and Shurety; I took charge of Shurety and took him to the watch-house; he asked me going along if I knew what charge I had against them; I told him to wait till he got to the station-house, when the inspector would tell him; he said, "Very well, I admit you have only done your duty - and would have done so had you have taken us in the fact;" he then said, "I know what it is about, it is for Saturday night's spree;" nothing more passed, till he got to the station-house; I then went with Aggs to Willoughby's house, brought him to the station-house, and as soon as he came there, Shurety said, "Willoughby, (Cannon was present) we must admit we saw the old woman knocked down by some man who ran down the hill, but who that man was, we don't know." Willoughby shook his head and said he saw no man passing at the time; Shurety, a short time after at the station-house, made use of some expression, but what it was I don't know; Cannon, in answer to him, said,"Hold your tongue, you fool, you will convict yourself;" Cannon was present the whole time at the station-house, and heard what Shurety said to Willoughby; when Cannon said this to Shurety, he made no reply.</p>

            . Q. How near to Brewhouse-lane were you in Heath-street, when it happened; were you above it, nearer to the heath, or nearer to the town? A. Nearer to the town, below brewhouse-lane, between the corner of the lane, in Mr. Cunningham's the butcher's shop; I am quite sure the first man whom I met, passed without interfering with me.</p>
               <p>Cannon's Defence. I never saw the lady all the while; I was coming home from selling fish about a quarter before twelve o'clock, but I have not the least recollection of seeing the lady at all; I went home with my basket of fish that was left - I went straight home with the other young man.</p>
               <p>Shurety's Defence. I was out that night helping Cannon to sell his fish, which he had left in the day-time, and coming home, I asked Willoughby, "Shall I carry some of your things home;" he went by Mr. Cunningham's, the butcher's; I had got my basket weighing sixty or eighty pounds - I had it on my head - I could hardly see, it was very heavy; and when we came past the fields, I heard a young man run by; I went home - I left my basket at Willoughby's; I went home and went to bed, and the inspector came to the Nag's Head, and took us to the station-house; Mrs. Cutter was fetched, and said she had found her pocket, and a halfpenny was left in it - that she went to a butcher's shop, where she missed her money.</p>
               <p>Willoughby's Defence. As I was returning home on evening, coming from Cunningham's with a basket on my head, these two young men were there with things, and I asked this man to give me a lift on the head with my basket. Shurety said, "Shall I carry one of your baskets, Tom?" I said, "No; I would much rather you would not, leave it alone;" and I went up Heath-street, and saw Mrs. Cutter, and said, "Here is poor old Mrs. Cutter;" I passed on; Cannon was behind; I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280044"></xptr>home, and came back to Cunningham's again, and had another basket left there; I bought a bit of meat there, and I took it home on my head, and never saw any more of Cannon or Shurety, not till Monday, when I saw Shurety standing at the corner of Flask-walk - I never spoke to him.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Cunningham, a butcher, at Hampstead; I have been there many years; in front of our shop on a Saturday night, there is a sort of market held, as late as half-past eleven or twelve o'clock; I remember the night the old lady was knocked down - I remember seeing Willoughby standing at the front of our door, in the sale way - he had two baskets; I saw him leave - I helped his baskets on his head - he crossed the road up Heath-street; I helped him up with two baskets - he took both baskets on his head; I saw nobody with him; sometimes Shurety and Cannon stand there to sell vegetables; half-past twelve o'clock is about the time this little market breaks up; I did not see Willoughby again that night; I sold him some meat that night; he took it with him in his basket - he took it the second time - I don't know at what time he went the first time; I suppose he might be gone about ten minutes; he bargained with me for the meat and then went away; I have known him ever since he was a boy - he has maintained the character of a very honest man.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are we to understand you helped him up with a second load of baskets? A. The two last baskets I helped him with; I did not help him with the first - the meat was in the last basket.</p>

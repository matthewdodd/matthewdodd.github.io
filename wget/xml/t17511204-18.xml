The next morning my wife and I got up between three and four. The prisoner was just after us, which was what he never used to do. These things mentioned were in a cupboard below; about six we found the door of it open, and the ring and money gone, he then said he had six pence to spend. I had a suspicion of him. I had him taken up. We took him to the Horseshoe and Magpye at the New-Bridge Foot, the justice not being at home; there he confessed, (after I said don't let it be lost, I would have it be of service to somebody) it was not lost, and put his hand into his breeches and pulled them out, wrap'd up in a dirty cloth. The ring had M B B. dated 1728; one of the half guineas was a pale one with a crack in it, produc'd in court and deposed to. He said he opened the lock with a case knife and took the things out.</p>

               <p>I am watchman in the market; about a quarter after nine last Friday week, I came into the market, and found it all in darkness; I see two of Mr. Hand's sheep hanging, and I put up the gates of the market for sefety, and went away till about ten o'clock, when I returned I found one of Mr. Hand's sheep were gone; I cannot tell who took it. The next morning I went down to Mr. Hunt's shop, to look at some mutton, and I have every reason to believe it was the same sheep, by the colour of it, and being so remarkably sat. I cannot swear it was, because the back of the sheep was all cut off, and a deal of the sat.</p>

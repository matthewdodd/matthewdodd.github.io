                  </hi>. I am a china and glass dealer, of Tottenham-court-road; the prisoner was my carman. I went to his lodging, 2, Mitford-place, with the policeman, and found all these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); they are mine.</p>

And 5 lbs., and I would give him the difference—if any were broken I should not stop it from his wages—I never did it twice in my life from the prisoner—his wages were 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—we do not open till eight o'clock in the morning, and we close at ten at night—he only came temporarily, as my carman was taken bad.</p>

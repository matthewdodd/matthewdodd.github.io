                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 660). On Saturday, 15th December, I was in New Broad-street with McLeod, another officer, about a quarter to 6 o'clock, and met the prisoner carrying a hamper—I asked where he was going to take it—he said, "To Whitechapel Church"—I asked where he brought it from—he said, "From the White Horse, Cripplegate"—I asked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101070011"></xptr>
               <p>who gave it to him—he said a man gave it to him to carry—I said, "Where is the man?"—he said, "I don't know where he is now, but I have seen him before, and he told me to take it to Whitechapel Church, and that he would meet me there"—not feeling satisfied, I took him to the station—I there examined the hamper, and found in it a jar containing about two gallons of spirits of wine, and a bottle of potash, which I produce—on Tuesday, the 18th, I was present when McLeod further searched the hamper, and found in it two pieces of paper—the prisoner gave his address at the station as 14, Bridge water-square, I believe—I went there, and in a corner of the first-floor front room I found about eleven pints of olive oil in a jar, and these three bottles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I was with Watkins when the prisoner was appre<lb></lb>hended—we examined the hamper, took the bottles out, and replaced them—we did not examine further—the hamper was put in the cell and locked up—I examined it again on the Tuesday—I then carefully examined the straw, and found amongst it these two pieces of paper; one with the name of "Warner and Barclay" written on it, and the other, "55, Fore-street, Finsbury"—that is where Messrs. Warner live—I communicated with the prosecutors immediately afterwards and then went to the prisoner's address.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Barelay, as chemists, at 55, Fore-street—the prisoner was occasionally employed by us as a bottle-washer, seldom exceeding two days at a time—he was last employed on Thursday and Friday, 6th and 7th December—he was introduced to us by a man of the name of Childers, who was then in our service, but whom we have since discharged—this potash is the same sort as we have in our stock—it is iodine of potassium—the bottle in which it is, is the same sort of bottle that we have—here is one from the warehouse—they are called pottle-quarts—we purchase this potassium from Atkinson and Co.—this label is the same as ours—we last took stock on 30th June—I was present, assisting, at the time—we then had eleven of these bottles in stock, and they were full—after this matter was brought to our notice we took stock again, and went through our books—we find that we are losers of this article to a considerable extent—we found six full bottles and four empty ones, and one missing—I have examined the books with a view to find out whether any bottle has been sold, and I am able to say positively that no bottle of this size has gone out, so that one of the eleven bottles is unaccounted for—that would not contain all the potassium that we have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101070012"></xptr>
               <p>lost—these two pieces of paper contain our name and address—they form portions of one of our labels—I produce one similar—this is the bottom part of the label—it may have been cut off and thrown down on the floor and been trodden on, and probably one of the men, wanting a blank piece of paper, might have put it on a bottle with the blank side upwards—this spirits of wine is the same sort as we have, and the same strength that we use—I had it tested—it is now 55 1/2 degrees, which would have been origin<lb></lb>nally 56, but by pouring it from one vessel into another it would naturally lose strength—54 is the strength generally used—these bottles containing the olive oil are similar to those we use in our retail trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> And all the bottles, I suppose, are similar to those used in the retail trade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in all retail trades—there are no doubt thousands of such bottles as these in chemists' shops—this piece of the label has the appearance of having been damped; it may, probably, have been thrown down and trodden on; and if any of our people wished to have a blank label, they would cut off the top and bottom containing the name and address—that is constantly done—I know this to be iodine of potassium, by looking at it—a clerk of ours examined the stock—we had no suspicion of anybody robbing us until the policeman drew our attention to these pieces of paper found in the hamper—I am not able to say when the potassium was taken, or in what quantities—we only examine our stock once a year—I can tell, by looking at our books, how much we have sold—a clerk in the counting-house keeps the books, and sells—his name is Banks—he is here—I have never said that I would not prosecute because I could not identify any of the things.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you say anything about the hamper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it to be one that came from the country some little time since, and I desired our men to put it aside to be returned at Christmas, and when I inquired for it, it was not to be found—I believe this to be that hamper—it was away, probably, three weeks before this took place.</p>

               <p>I have been out of place about a fortnight; I went into a public house in Russell-street to have a pint of beer, and I saw the prisoner Shergold; I never saw him before in my life, and he said, Jack, how do you do, and he asked me to lend him a shilling, but I told him I had only eighteen-pence, and he put his hand on the outside of my pocket, and said, here is money, and I told him I would tell him the truth, I had three shillings, and in half-pence I had about three shillings and six-pence then; I lent him a shilling, as he asked me; and in a little time he came to me, and said, I wish you would lend me another shilling, and I lent him another shilling, and in about ten minutes after that he came up to me, and told me he was going to take a room at three shillings a week; and that I should not want for a lodging, or any thing else, and that he was going to receive five thousand pounds in a little time, and I should not want, if I would lend him another shilling; when he had the three shillings, and had drank the beer that he had, he asked me if I would come to Mr. Lewis's with a boy's father and mother that were there, and he said, we could have a pot of beer; I went with him, and we had a pot of beer; when that was drank the prisoner went away, and came again, and his acquaintance that was with him; soon after they came in again, and I staid a little while then; I went away, and on Saturday I saw them again, and staid a little while with them; then I went away, and saw no more of them till Sunday; then I met the prisoner Shergold, and he asked me to go to Mr. Lewis's, and we went into the Long Fields; I saw him again about seven, and the other prisoner was with him then, and I told them I lived with Mr. Combes, Bishop's Court, Lincoln's Inn, and we went that way, and he took me to the back of Lincoln's Inn Gardens, and he bid me go to my master's public house, and order a pot of beer, and change for half a crown, and meet the boy, and send him for another pot; then he asked me if I could take up any money or bacon, or beef, in my master's name; then, says he, could not you steal any thing of a gold watch, or any thing of that kind, I said I would not; then the prisoner Preston said, you bloody b - r, if you will not, you shall strip, or I will cut your bloody melt out; then Shergold laid hold on me, and he could not well manage me, then Preston pulled me, but I was so frightened, I let them pull it off without any more; while I was pulling my jacket off, another that was with the prisoners snatched my hat off; I snatched it back, and they all three made off; I then went to Bow-street to give information.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I was errand boy to Mr. Combes; I lived there about half a year; I left my place because I could not wait at table well enough; I am about fiftteen; I never saw Shergold before that time at the public house.</p>
               <p>How came you to lend him money? - Because he told me he would pay me again, and he had five thousand coming to him, though he was in distress.</p>
               <p>Did you think there was any likelihood that such a fellow as him should have five thousand pounds? - I did not know what there was; I did not know he was a thief.</p>
               <p>Where is this Lewis's house that they took you to? - In Red-lion-court, in Russel-court.</p>
               <p>What is this Mr. Lewis? - I believe he is a very honest man; he blacks shoes; I only knew the name of one of the prisoners at that time, that was Shergold, I never saw the other before that Sunday night, but I am sure he is the same person; I knew him by sight as well as I know Shergold; I am quite sure of both of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Is not the shirt he has on mine? - This is not it, for I took off the shirt that he lent me, and it is now washing; he had one of my shirts, which cost<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190027"></xptr> me six shillings, and he pawned it for three shillings, but I never had a farthing of the money; he lent me his shirt to put on as I had no other.</p>

               <p>I had this jacket of the prisoner Preston; on Sunday about nine o'clock, he asked me to lend him a little money upon it, as he was distressed, and could not pay his lodgings, I said to him, I do not lend any such thing, nor buy on Sunday nights, I said you have stole it, he said, no, it is my own property, but I would not lend him anything upon it, and away he went, and in two or three minutes after he came back and I told him I would give him eighteen-pence for it, and he took the eighteen-pence, and went away.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the person? - I really believe, to the best of my knowledge, he was the person that brought it; I never saw him before, but he is the same man that came the next day.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt that it is him? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Was anybody with him when he produced the jacket? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I keep a chandler's shop, and a pawnbroker's, I did do, but I have laid that by; I buy and sell old clothes in Bambridge-street, Saint Giles's.</p>
               <p>What would you sell that jacket for? - I offered to sell it the next day for two shillings, and I was bid one shilling; it is worth to the wearer two shillings or half a crown.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Mayo, a labourer, of 40, Lower Wood-street, Woolwich—on Monday, 17th October, the prisoner took a furnished room at my house—on the Thursday following, between 11 and 12 in the morning, I saw my husband's watch and guard safe in my bed<lb></lb>room in a piece of paper—on the following morning, between 7 and 8, I missed it—just before I missed it I saw the prisoner drop the piece of paper in which the watch had been, from her lap—I then went upstairs to see if the watch was safe, and found it gone—the prisoner followed me up, and asked me what made me look so ill—I told her that my husband's watch was gone—she said, "Perhaps your husband has got it"—I had the paper in my hand, and I told her it was the piece the watch was in, and I had seen it fall from her lap—she said she must have picked it up with the towels in the kitchen—the watch and chain are worth about six guineas.</p>

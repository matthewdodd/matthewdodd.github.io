On the 21st of July, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I missed a 5l. note out of my cash-box in the bedroom - I had put it there the evening before, when I went to bed. I got up at seven o'clock next morning; I had left my wife in the room - She came down about eight o'clock. I sent for an officer, without saying any thing to the prisoner - nobody else had access to my bed-room. The constable came, I called the prisoner down to the kitchen, told her I missed a 5l. note, and I suspeeted her - She denied it. The constable searched her box; while he was searching the prisoner went to some small drawers, where some other things were kept, took something out, and endeavoured to put it in her pocket! I caught her hand, found a very small box in it, and the 5l. note in the box; I knew it to be the same, by four figures at the back of it, which I had particularly noticed the night before - They were 1797. I had a particular reason for noticing what I put into my box. I found my box locked as I had left it. There are two keys to it, my wife keeps one, and I keep the other; my wife had lost her key for two or three days; we found it in the prisoner's box after she was taken to the office-it was not there when the constable searched the first time; we had left the prisoner in the kitchen for half an hour, to pack up her things, While the officer went to Bow-street on the business, she had an opportunity of putting the key there (looking at the note), this is it, I know it by the figures.</p>

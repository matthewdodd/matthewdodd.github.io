               <p>JOHN HERRIDGE. had a male ass which I turned out in Mr. William Hammond's meadow - it was taken from there the latter end of November, or the beginning of December - I never saw it again till May, when I saw it tied to some palings at the prisoner's place, in Fulhamfields - I said it was mine, and asked him for it - he said it was not mine; I went and got a constable - I allowed the prisoner to keep it that Saturday, and then he was to give it up.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HAMMOND. The donkey was in my field - I cannot say when it was missed; the prisoner lived in our neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>CHARLOTTE HAMMOND, I know the ass by its being into our meadow, and by its colour.</p>

            . I saw the ass at Hamersmith, in November last, with its ears fresh cut, in the possession of John Harris, between seven and nine o'clock in the evening - it was offered for sale at 25s.</p>
               <p>JOHN HERRIDGE. Its ears were cut after it was stolen from me - the prisoner lives at Hillingdon - he said he bought it.</p>

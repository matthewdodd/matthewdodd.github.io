                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. M'Cormack, a seedsman, at New Cross. On 31st May, Browning came about 7 o'clock in the evening for half-a-pint of French beans; he gave a half-crown—I had not change, and went to the Railway Tavern to get it—I gave the half-crown to Mr. Wright, he bent it, and gave it me back—I came back, told Browning it was bad—he said he did not know it—the policeman came in, and I gave him the half-crown—he went after Burns—some omnibus men in the shop took charge of Browning till the policeman brought Burns in.</p>

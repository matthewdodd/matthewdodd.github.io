            . I am clerk to Mr. Woodward, Great St. Thomas Apostle. On the 21st of February, about ten minutes before six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in St. Paul's Church-yard, carrying the box, on the east side of the road; he was making great haste, and carrying it in an awkward way; I suspected it was stolen; I followed him into Foster-lane; he then put it off his shoulder into a narrow passage; I enquired for an officer, but could not find one-as I returned towards the court, the prisoner ran away, leaving the box in the passage; he turned down George-street, which being no thoroughfare, he returned and I took him. I am sure he is the man; he said, two men gave it to him to carry; he was not far from the waggon.</p>

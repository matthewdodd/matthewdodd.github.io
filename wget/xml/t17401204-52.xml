             the 14th of November, about eleven at Night, I was walking by Temple-Bar, and a Woman pick'd me up, and carry'd me to the <placeName id="t17401204-52-crimeloc252">Coach and Horses Alehouse</placeName>

I chang'd a Guinea in the House to pay for the Beer, and I had not had my Change a Minute, but another Woman came in; I reprimanded her for coming into my Company, and in a short Time, the Prisoner came in, and pick'd my pocket. I had my Money all but one Guinea, return'd by the People of the House. The Prisoner was secur'd that Night in the Watch-House, and the next Morning,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174012040017"></xptr> before we went to the Justice, she gave me 21 s. in the Room of the Guinea which was wanting.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How near was I to you?</p>
               <p>Buck. Close to me, she was not in the Room a Minute before she pick'd my Pocket - I have two other Witnesses, but one is run away, and the other will not come.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was so near him as to offer any such Thing; he told me he would hang the best Neck I had, if I would not give him a Guinea .</p>
               <p>The Justice. This Woman being brought before me, I bound the Prosecutor over; afterwards he told me, that he had agreed with her for a Guinea , not to Prosecute, and that he had receiv'd it in Silver.</p>

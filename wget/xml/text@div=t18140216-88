On the 14th of February, I was coming out of place; I took another woman to assist me in carrying my box. We went into the Three Crowns to get some refreshment. We came out of the Three Crowns, and came to a place called North-street, Whitechapel-road. I sat down the box to rest myself upon; the prisoner came up, and said he would carry it for me. I sent the woman home; I told him I was a stranger in London, and knew nobody. I gave him the box.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer and plaister; I live in Gossip's-buildings, Whitechapel-road. My son came in; he said, father, there are two men fighting at the bottom of the court; I went out, and said, what is the matter; why, said one of the men, this man has robbed the woman of her box, I want him to go with me, he will not go. I said, he must go. The other man had got hold of the prisoner by the collar; he asked me to take the box; I did. We took the prisoner to the Three Crowns, to enquire if he had been drinking with a girl. We found he had been there with a girl. We could not find the girl. The man that had hold of the prisoner by his collar went away; a constable came, and took the prisoner to the office, and I took the box. This is the box that laid down by the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was drinking at the Three Crowns with the prosecutrix and the other woman; the prosecutrix said if I would carry her box for her she would pay me, and I might sleep with her all night.

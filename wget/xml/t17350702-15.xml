            . Between two and three in the Afternoon, in St. Paul's Church-Yard, a Man stoop'd down and pick'd up a Shilling, and told me, I should be welcome to drink it out with him. Accordingly we went to the <placeName id="t17350702-15-crimeloc63">Black-Spread Eagle in Paternoster Row</placeName>

I told them I'd go six Pence with them. I presently lost 3 s. 6 d. which was all the Money I had. The Prisoner said he would give four Guineas for my Watch. I took it out and laid it on the Table; but instead of offering me Money, he said he would play for it, at two Guineas, a Cut. I Cut once and lost two Guineas, and then I said I would Cut no more. The other Man swore if I would not, he would, for his Money was at stake as well as my Watch. So as he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173507020004"></xptr> going to Cut, the Prisoner catch'd up my Watch and run away with it, and the other after him. All this was done in less than half an Hour. I cry'd and stamp'd and was ready to tear my Hair off for Vexation.</p>

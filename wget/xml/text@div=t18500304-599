                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at Cold bath-lane, Hackney—the deceased, James Merritt, was a fellow-workman of mine for a fortnight before his death—he was a turncock to the East London Water-works Com<lb></lb>pany. On Wednesday, 23rd Jan., I parted with him in the street at a quarter-past nine o'clock at night—he was then in his usual health, excepting a slight cold—he had been at his work that day—next morning, Thursday, the 24th, I called on him at his own house about eight—I saw the prisoner—she told me her husband was sick in the yard—he came into the room in a minute or two—he said, in the prisoner's presence, that he had been eating a bason of broth, and had taken a cup of hot tea upon that, and he expected it had turned on his stomach, and made him sick—the prisoner could hear that, but said nothing—I then left the house with Merritt to go to work, about a mile off—when we got to Clapton-square, half a mile from Merritt's house, he said he felt very thirsty—we went into a public-house, and he had two-pennyworth of rum and a little warm water and sugar—we then went to work separate ways—I saw him next in Clapton-square, about ten that morning, and left him there—there was nothing the matter with him then that I observed—I went to his house about a quarter after eleven—he had asked me at ten o'clock to come there—I saw the prisoner—the deceased was eating some gruel out of a bason—he did not eat it all, but handed the bason, with some in it, to the prisoner—she took it from him, and said she would keep it hot on the hob for him—he said, "I don't care what you do with it"—di<lb></lb>rectly afterwards we left the house together, and at twelve o'clock he left me—I saw him again from one to a quarter-past—he told me he felt very sick and very <hi rend="italic">queer</hi>, and he should not be able to do his work, and wished me to do it for him—he then left me to go towards home—between five and six in the evening I went to his house, to leave his tools—the prisoner let me in, and told me to go up-stairs to <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi>, as he was very ill, and wanted to see me—I went up, and she followed me—he was in bed, and said he was very sick in his stomach, and had cramp in his feet—he said, "I don't wonder at it; the work we have had to do, and the weather we have had, it is enough to kill a horse"—the prisoner was standing at his bed-side—she said nothing—that was the last time I saw him alive.</p>

I was a turnkcock of the East London Waterworks in Jan. last—I knew James Merritt—I went to his house, in Pear-tree Place, Clapton, on Thursday, 24th Jan., about twenty minutes to eleven o'clock—I saw the prisoner—I asked where her husband was—she said he was in the back-yard, and she would call him—she did so—he came out of the back-yard—he looked very <hi rend="italic">queer</hi>, as if suffering from a severe bilious attack—he told me he felt very queer—there was some hot beef and potatoes cooked on the table, and by their invitation I partook of it—I think it was the prisoner asked me—the deceased said he could not eat it—I sat down by the table, and did eat it, with my back to the door—he could not eat the lunch prepared for him, and preferred a bason of gruel—he did not ask for it, Mrs. Merritt said he might prefer it—I sat down to eat, and did not notice what was going on, but I don't think Mrs. Merritt went out of the room—I next saw her doing something at the table, as if she was mixing up the bason of gruel—I cannot say what she had in her hand—I saw a bason on the table, but what she was doing particularly I did not notice; I cannot account for what it was; I was rather short of time, and wished to get away—in the act of coming away, I saw Mrs. Merritt pouring out some<lb></lb>thing into a bason, which I supposed to be gruel by the look of it—I did not see what was done with it—the deceased took none of it then—Merritt and me were both together, coming out of doors—at the end of Pear-tree Place I left him, and came back to my work, and 1 saw no more of him alive—I did not so much as look back after him.</p>

               <p>suffering a great deal in her mind—on the morning of the 28th, before the lnquest sat the first time, I went in to Mrs. Merritt's, and she said, "You know, Mrs. Gillett, that Annie and me (meaning her little girl) ate the remains of the gruel"—I said, "Don't say so, Mrs. Merritt, for I never saw any of you eat it"—she then said, "If you did not, Ashby did, and he can clear me; and Ashby ought to be the first witness before the Jury"—she said Ashby and Andrews (the summoning-officer) had mixed it up between them, and that Ashby was not wanted; that he ought to have been the first witness—that conversation took place on different occasions—what she said about Ashby being the first witness, was before the Inquest; it was between eleven and twelve, and the Inquest sat at 12—on the 31st, after the Inquest was adjourned, she came to my house, and asked me if I had heard that poison was found in Merritt's stomach—I said I had—she said, "I am innocent; he was a dear, good husband, and it was not likely I should do such a thing"—she then said, "Dear creature! if that is the case, he has done it by his own hand"—I said it was not very likely, as he had purchased a new pair of boots the night previous to his death—during the conversation Andrews came, and Mrs. Merritt said, "Mr. Andrews, Mrs. Gillett knows I ate the remains of the gruel"—I said, "I saw none of you eat it"—that was all that passed—I was there on Wednesday evening, 30th Jan., when she said, "Do you think, if I had any hand in his death, I should not have let him live until after the day when I should have received the full benefit?"</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bachelor of medicine and professor of chemistry, at the London Hospital. On 29th Jan. I received from Mr. Long a glass bottle and earthen jar—I entered on an analysis of their contents</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185003040065"></xptr>
               <p>—I experimented on the contents of the bottle first, and detected eight grains and a half of white arsenic—by one course of experiments I reproduced the arsenic in a metallic form—it is in this tube (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the earthen jar contained part of a human stomach—I noticed a peculiar appearance in it, which I have noticed in cases of poisoning by arsenic—there was a very small portion of a whitish powder adhering to the inner lining of the stomach, too small a quantity to ascertain what it consisted of—I then examined the intestines that were in the jar—I subjected them to a chemical analysis—the result was the detection of a very small quantity of arsenic—there was also in the jar part of a human liver—I subjected about a quarter of a pound of it to experiment—(I say that, that you may form a judgment of the quantity in the entire liver,) and obtained a quantity of metallic arsenic (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was too minute a quantity to weigh—that in the stomach was the only quantity I weighed—that would be quite sufficient to produce death—I had an oppor<lb></lb>tunity of witnessing a case where two grains and a half killed—the general quantity would be eight grains—I look upon that as an average dose—it would generally be fatal—vomiting is almost invariably the consequence of arsenic introduced into the stomach—a person attacked in that way would be likely to throw up a portion of the arsenic—looking at the quantity I found, and the parts I found it in, in my judgment, the arsenic I found had been taken not more than two or three hours before death, but that is a mat<lb></lb>ter of opinion; a dose might have been given before—it would depend on many circumstances how soon it would find its way to the liver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> About five grains of arsenic you say would cause death; do you mean taken together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, or less; 2 1/2 grains have done so—I know nothing of this transaction, but from the examination—I found a very small portion in the liver; perhaps about 1—10th of a grain in a quarter of a pound of liver—a liver weighs about 5lbs. on an average—supposing it was equally diffused, there would be twenty times that quantity; that would be two grains—my observation in reference to the time it had been taken, has reference both to the stomach and liver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the data at all safe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I will tell yon why; I found in the sto<lb></lb>mach 8 1/2; grains of arsenic, and there was not much in the intestines; I con<lb></lb>clude, therefore, that there had not been time for it to have been passed into the intestines which would have been the case if it had been taken a long time before death; but there was only a trace in the intestines, so I conclude it was a very short time before death—that furnishes a data to me to form a judgment on the subject of hours—food remains in the stomach five hours before it passes into the intestines—I am able to say, that the contents of the stomach pass into the intestines within four, eight, or ten hours—from experiments which have been performed on living subjects, I have not the least doubt—I saw the intestines; they were in the jar; they did not appear to be influenced by arsenic; they were slightly red, and there were traces of arsenic; I have reduced something that was in the intestines into a metallic state—I experimented upon it, and found it was arsenic—it was destroyed in the experiment—I was obliged to submit it to experiment to prove it was arsenic—it is not likely I should find arsenic in the liver, without some being m the intestines—the time would not depend on the constitution of the person—digestion depends on the constitution, but I am speaking of the average—digestion is more or less rapid, according to the constitution of the person who has received the subject matter—I have heard of cases in which matters which would not digest have remained three or four days, but those were solid matters—I think liquids pass into the stomach under all circumstances within five hours, as they are imbibed—there is a valve, which prevents solid</p>

               <p>matters from passing into the stomach till they are digested—the arsenic was in a liquid state; all except a little white powder on the side of the stomach—I am obliged to have recourse to an average to form an opinion as to how long it would take—we have no means of dealing with an independent case, but by the average.</p>

On Friday, 25th Jan., I went to the deceased's house, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning—Mrs. Gillett was there and the prisoner—Mrs. Gillett said to the prisoner, "From what has passed between me and Mr. Andrews, he thinks there will be a Coroner's Jury"—the prisoner said, "I don't think there is any necessity for a Coroner's Jury, as my poor dear husband died a natural death"—I asked the prisoner whether she thought anything had been given to her husband, or whether she thought he had taken anything to destroy himself—she said, "God knows, sir; he told me he had something to drink at Stamford-hill; but whether anything was put in his drink up there I can't tell"—I saw her again that night, but the conversation purporting to have taken place that night is a mistake; it was on Monday, the 28th, an hour before the Inquest—she then stated that a piece of meat was cooking at the fire for her husband's lunch (alluding to the 24th); that he could not eat it, but had some gruel, while Ash by eat the meat; and that Ashby saw her make the gruel, I think she stated on Friday morning, the 25th—I asked her a great number of questions, and there was no answer—she said he had nothings to drink the first thing in the morning but the liquor of some Irish-stew made over night, and he shortly afterwards took a cup of tea; then he was very sick, but she thought nothing of his sickness, as he was so almost every morning—I think those were almost her precise words—I saw her on Monday, the day the Inquest was held, before the Inquest—I recollect Mr. Toulmin's assistant, and another medical gentleman coming to make the</p>

I loved him too well to wrong him or to injure him," or "to injure him or wrong him," I am not sure which—a day or two after this I saw the prisoner at Mrs. Gillett's—it was on the night of the 31st, the day I gave the prisoner the order for the burial of the body—when I gave it her Mrs. Gillett was standing near her, and she stated that the gruel her husband had left in the morning, she and her child Anne had eaten, and Mrs. Gillett could prove it, or "Mrs. Gillett knows it," turning to Mrs. Gillett for confirmation—Mrs. Gillett said, "I know nothing of it; I have no recollection of it; or, "I did not see that"</p>

                  </hi>. I am gaoler of the police-court, Worship-street. I had the prisoner in custody, after her second examination before the Magistrate on Friday, 8th Feb.—when I took her to her place of confinement, as we went to the cell, she said she wished to see her sister; I said she could do so in the presence of Inspector Coward—I was about to leave the cell, and she said, as she had no one to speak for her, she wished the Magistrate to know something of the case; she then stated that Mrs. Gillett, the witness, was the</p>

               <p>first instigator of her opening the boxes and pledging the property—she said she wished the Magistrate to know she had spoken the truth all through, except what she had stated to Inspector Coward, respecting the purchasing the poison—she stated she did purchase the poison; she placed it in a cupboard where her husband kept his acid powders, which he was in the habit of taking of a morning; that she emptied the powder out of the paper with the word "Poison" on it, and destroyed that paper; she screwed the poison up in another piece of paper, and left it in the cupboard; and if he had taken the poison, he must have taken it in a mistake; that she afterwards destroyed the whole of the powders that were in the cupboard, put them in the fire; the said she bought it in a pet, and she intended to take it herself if her husband had gone on in the way he was going on.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read, as follows</hi>—"I have nothing to say, but that I never intended him to take it—when I bought it I did intend it for myself if he came home as he had done for several nights past, for I could not live with him as I had done; he came home very comfortable, and I thought no more of it, till the Sunday following, when I burnt it, as it came into my mind that he might take it instead of the sods; as for my giving him anything, it never entered my head. What I said about hanging, was, if I should be hung that minute, I should be hung innocently of giving him anything to do him any harm."</p>

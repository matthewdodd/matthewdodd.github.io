I recollect my uncle being married on the 4th of July, 1836, to the prisoner, whose name was then Elizabeth Webb, at St. Pancras church—my uncle is now alive—they lived together about nine weeks—he did not leave her—she left him, I believe.</p>

I became acquainted with the prisoner three months before Christmas—I knew he by the name of Elizabeth Twitchell—she was living at Hertford-place, is Watford—I went through the ceremony of marriage with her, at Little Stanmore—we were married by banns—she was married in the name of Elizabeth Twitchell—I have the certificate here—I have not examined it with the register, it is what I had the day I was married—I heard the night before we were married, some rumour that she was married, and I asked her three or four times if she was married—she said she was not—she represented herself as single—I did not discover she was married till the policeman took her, four months afterwards—we had lived together is the mean time in Red Lion-yard, Watford.</p>

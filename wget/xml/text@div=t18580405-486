                  </hi>. I am a brush manufacturer, of 3, St. Ann's Street, Borough. On 23d Feb., a little before 7 o'clock in the evening, the pri<lb></lb>soner came for a hearth brush, I sold her one at 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a florin; I told her I did not like its appearance, it was too smooth—she said I might depend upon it it was good silver; she wished she had 100 of them—and said, "Have you another to conpare them?"—I took another florin out of the till, which I had taken of a female five or ten minutes previous, compared them, sounded them, and found them exactly alike, but I had omitted to mark the one she gave me; so I laid the two florins in the till among the halfpence, gave her change, and she left the shop—I afterwards found that they were both bad—I took them to the station and gave them to Browning—I saw the prisoner next morning when she was locked up, and have no doubt she is the same person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am mate of the Leven Lass, which is lying at Poplar; Edward Wright is the captain. On the 17th of Auga 1 received a trunk on board—I left the vessel at half-past five o'clock in the evening of the 25th of Aug., O'Neil was on board—I came back, and was on board—the dog barked in the night—I came on deck, and found Fitzgerald there—he is a seaman, and O'Neil was an apprentice—I have missed these boots—they are part of the cargo, and were in this trunk—they were picked up alongside the vessel.</p>

I went on board, and informed the captain that a trunk of shoes had been picked up afloat in the dock—he called O'Neil, and asked him some questions, and O'Neil, said he knew all about it—I went down stairs with him—O'Neil gave me the key of his box—I unlocked it, and took twenty-six pair of these boots—there were eight dozen pair of boots in the box that was floating about—Fitzgerald was in bed—O'Neil said in his pre<lb></lb>sence that he had given them him to put into his box—Fitzgerald denied it, and said before the Magistrate that he knew O'Neil had put them into his box, but he did not give them to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Courtney. We live in Gillingham-street, Westminster—the prisoner came to do the servant's work—she did not live in the house—she left on Sunday, the 27th of April—she had been working at my house about a month—on the evening she left I found a Joaf wrapped in her cloak—I then looked about and missed two shirts and a petticoat, aad next day I missed two or three sheets, some pillow-cases, and a towel—I afterwards missed other things named in the indictment—on the Thursday night following she came to my house, and I asked her for what she could have the impudence to come—she said to see if I did not think there was something due to her—I then gave her in charge—I went with the policeman to her lodging—she said at the station that it was her lodging—I there found a sheet, a pillow-case, and a quantity of calico, which I had not missed, but knowing that I had some, I suspected it was mine—I also found a flat-iron, an iron-hanger, two tea-spoons, the kitchen-towel, a little handkerchief, and two old pairs of stockings, which I knew all to be mine—these are the articles—she had no right to take these things to her lodging—I have brought the rest of the calico here to identify this piece.</p>

Y. and three marked the other way—I have not any of my spoons here—I know these stockings by mending them in the heels, and in two or three other places—this is a kitchen towel, and here is a cut in it, which I did in rolling some pre<lb></lb>crust—it was used for washing tea things—it has no mark upon it but the cut—I know from looking over my kitchen towels that the one I cut was missing—my kitchen towels are not marked—I hemmed this, but it is not a thing that I do very particularly—when I found these things the prisoner was in the station—I did not take her to her lodging—the inspector told me to go to her lodging and take anything that I considered mine, and I took all that I knew to be mine—there was a woman at the lodging, who said she was not her sister, but before the Magistrate she said she was.</p>

I am the prisoner's sister—I occupy the room with her—I was there when Mrs. Courtney came—some of these things belong to me—this iron I have had five years—this six yards and a half of calico I bought in Leicester-square—I have the bill now of where I bought it—I bought ten yards—I made a shirt out of it whiob my husband was buried in—this three-quarters of a yard of linen I made a bosom out of and this is what was left of it—I tore this calico to make two aprons, and this small bit I tore off to make a band for an apron—it had never been out of my place till Mrs. Courtney took it away—I have had these spoons a year and five months—I bought them in Dec.—I had four of them, but I lost two—I have a person here who knows I had them on Tuesday night—directly the prosecutrix came, she came to my bed and said my sheet was hers—I said it was mine, and then she turned and said there was a letter picked from it—I gave her the duplicate of the fellow-sheet to go and match it, and then she did not take that—she asked me if the bottom sheet was mine—I said, "No," and she took that bottom sheet, which belonged to the prisoner—she brought it there when she came to me on Easter Saturday—when the prosecutrix first came, she said to me, "I presume you are her sister"—I said I was not—I was not obliged to tell her what I was, but when I was before the Magistrate I told him I was her sister—the first time the prosecutrix came she only took the sheet, the pillow-case, and the small handkerchief—then she came again and took my calico, the flat-iron and hanger, and the small bit of linen—I have had this iron-hanger two years—I gave 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it at the corner of Strutton-ground, at a broker's</p>

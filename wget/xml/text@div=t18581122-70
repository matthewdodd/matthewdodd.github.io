                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the <hi rend="italic">R</hi> division of police, and am attached to Woolwich Dockyard—the prisoner was, before 1854, em<lb></lb>ployed as an armourer in the dockyard—he was an old soldier belonging to the sappers and miners—I believe he had, in 1854, a pension from Chelsea Hospital—we understood him to be a pensioner from the sappers and miners—in 1854 there was a charge of felony against him, for stealing something in the dockyard—I apprehended him on that charge—I did not search the different workmen as they left the dockyard, at that time—I had previously done so, but in this case I called one of the constables to do it, and he searched the prisoner, and did not find anything—he was tried upon a charge of stealing copper from the dockyard—I was a witness in the case—he was tried in this court—he has not been employed in the dockyard since that—he was in prison four months after the conviction—after the expiration of his sentence, I used occasionally to see him in the street—he never passed me without my seeing his lips moving, muttering something, and on one occasion I heard him say "Villain" as he passed me—he made an applica<lb></lb>tion against me at the police-court, after his conviction—I know he did so on one occasion—on 6th October, I left the dockyard soon after 4 in the afternoon—I went to a Mr. Butler's shop to get some change—while in the shop, I saw the prisoner pass outside—I endeavoured to ascertain whether he had seen me in the shop, but I could not detect that he had seen me—I went from that shop to another—when I left the second shop, I was return<lb></lb>ing to the dockyard, having got what I wanted—that was the next shop but one, I think, to Coleman-street—I was crossing the end of Coleman-street, and I saw him coming down—he was about twenty yards from me, and he hastened his distance and made it about five—I proceeded towards the dockyard, apprehensive of some violence from him, and I kept looking into the shops on my left hand, but my object was to see him, to see that he did not shorten the distance between us—he was about four or five paces from me, till we came to a shop where there was a waggon—I crossed the road, taking the wall of the dockyard, and I then lost sight of him—I thought he went into the Black Eagle—the waggon was between him and me—I then hurried on to the dockyard-gate—just before I got to the gate I heard a footstep; I turned my face and saw the prisoner coming up behind me—he was close to me, when I turned to my left—he had a pistol in his hand, and it touched my nose—I drew about three or four inches back from him, and he fired, and the ball lodged in my cheek—I could hardly see how he was holding the pistol before he fired, but I rather think it was in his left hand, I am not positive—I do not recollect that he said anything before</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185811220117"></xptr>
               <p>he fired—the ball lodged in my cheek—it did not go through my face—I did not fall—I was dropping down, but the thought occurred to me that he would get away—he was running away—I called after him and pursued him—a person came up to my assistance, and secured him—I believe a man named Flint picked up the pistol—I saw him stoop and pick up something; and he said, "Here it is, he has thrown it away"—a surgeon came at once and extracted the ball.</p>

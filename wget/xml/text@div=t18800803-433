                  </hi>. I live at 451, Bethnal Green Road—I am in the service of Messrs. Samuels &amp; Co., and have been for seven years, as a packer—lately I have been foreman—it was my duty to go to 7, East Smithfield in the morning to open the premises—I was also there last at night, and shut up the premises—I took away the key with me—Holland was also in Messrs. Samuels' employment before I went there, as a cleaner of shells—about 12 months ago Holland spoke to me about some shells—he said he knew where to sell some goods, and we could get a few shillings if I liked—the goods were to be taken early in the morning, and he would take them—I agreed to it—he had two cases of clams—that was the first transaction—the time of opening was 8 o'clock—Holland met me there and took the clams away—I took them from the ground floor—I got 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them from Holland—the next transaction took place in about a month or six weeks—I made the acquaintance of Solomon about eight or ten months ago at Holland's place in Settle Street, Com<lb></lb>mercial Road, one evening after my work was done—there was a conver<lb></lb>sation about shells—I do not exactly recollect it—the goods were to come from Samuels'—I stayed about an hour—only Solomon, Holland, and myself were present—I do not think any money passed—Solomons wanted more shells—I sometimes got 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and sometimes 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I used to see Solo<lb></lb>mon occasionally after that, sometimes at his house and sometimes at the Red Cross public-house, close to my employers', in the evenings—I did not go to his house very often, about once in, perhaps, two or three</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030085"></xptr>
               <p>months—I went to see if he wanted anything—he used to tell us what he wanted; we used to agree on the price, and we used to send the goods round when the money was paid—Holland generally took them—I never did—Solomon only paid me on one Saturday afternoon when he came for the goods—Holland divided the money with me—I used to send him clams, spiders, white murix, rose murix, bull nose, melons, snails (the snails were cleaned), and merospikes, cleaned white ears, cleaned red ears, cleaned green ears, and cleaned black ears, also nautiluses and mitres—the shells in a case were sent in a truck—when they were cleaned they were carried round—they were not packed, but loose in a basket, accord<lb></lb>ing to what they wanted—I made no alteration in the case when it went away, I sent it out just as I took it from the stock—on one occasion some large snails went—I was paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for those—my master sold them for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I also remember some bulls' months going, also some bulls' mouths, clams, and spiders—that was about the beginning of May—on that occasion Mr. Marcus Samuels came into the warehouse and asked me a question—when Holland came back he asked him where he had been—Holland said for the sugar baskets—one Saturday afternoon after that I was on Tower Hill about 4.45. Holland was with me—we close at four on Saturdays—Tower Hill is seven or eight doors from my masters' place—we had just come out of the Red Cross public-house—we met Solomon coming to<lb></lb>wards Mr. Samuels' shop—he asked us if we would let him have some goods out, and we agreed—he said he wanted some clams, melons, and spiders—he said if we liked he would go and get the cart and get them away that afternoon—we agreed, and he went away to get the cart—when he had gone, Holland and I went back to the warehouse and got the things out—we had shut the warehouse, and we went and re-opened it—we got two cases of clams, a case of spiders, and a case of melons—we took the cases just as they were, without doing anything to them—the van came and backed up the gateway to the warehouse—Solomon was not there, but there was a carman driver—the cases were loaded on the van and taken away—that must have been from 5.15 to 5.45—after we had shut the warehouse up and got away, Solomon gave me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was divided with Holland—the value of these stores are from 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one day in June I called on Solomon; he was not at home—I went in the evening and saw him—he told me he wanted some small white ears, some rose murex, and some turbos—he offered me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the six dozen turbos and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen for the rose murex—the turbos are worth 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen, and the rose murex are worth from 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen if cleaned, but they were in the rough—the turbos were cleaned, and were worth 46<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—Solomon asked me if I knew anything about the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> at the shop; some one had been selling shells under cost price. He knew it was not him, because he heard it was somebody that did not know the trade—I told him I did not know—I was spoken to by Mr. Samuels and a detective—I made a statement to them—I got instruc<lb></lb>tions from them—Holland came next on the 23rd—I gave him six dozen rose murex, six dozen white ears, six dozen turbos, and 10 or 12 large red ears—they were put in a hamper—he took them away—that hamper was afterwards shewn me—I also saw some cases at the station like those taken.</p>

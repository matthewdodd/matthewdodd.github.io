                  </hi>. I live at Kentish-town; Bickers was my ap<lb></lb>prentice. On 24th Jan. I went to Church, leaving her at home—I came back about eight o'clock in the evening, and she was not there—I missed the articles stated—I had had the scarf safe within a week, and had spoken to Bickers about it—I said, "How is it that there is no one but you in the house, and this is the second scarf that is missing"—she said she knew nothing about it, where could she take it to—on 29th March I went with a policeman to 9, Tottenham-place, and found her lodging—there; and in a box, which I knew to be hers, I found these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she acknowledged it—Moore was not there.</p>

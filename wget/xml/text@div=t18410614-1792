                  </hi>. I am a coal and potato merchant, and live in Bi-shopsgate-street Without. On the 20th of May I had fourteen sacks of potatoes in ray cart, which I left in Tooley-street for about three minutes, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon—it was a very steady old horse which would stand for eight hours and not move, if a person did not move him—when I returned, my horse, cart, and potatoes were gone—I immediately proceeded over the hill towards London<lb></lb>bridge, expecting somebody might have moved it—I made inquiries, and found the cart in Maze-pond, and the prisoners unloading the potatoes from my cart into another cart—Connolly was in ray cart, and Driscoll in the other—they had backed their cart to the tail of mine, so that they could get the potatoes from one cart to the other without getting down—I asked what they were doing with my load of potatoes—they both said they were hired to move the potatoes in consequence of my cart being broken down—my cart was not broken—I desired them to move them back into my cart again—they began to do so immediately, and when they had done it they both endea<lb></lb>oured to escape with their horse and cart—I would not let them go, but sent for the police—there was none near at hand—I was holding the Corse's head, and having no means of detaining both, Driscoll ran away</p>

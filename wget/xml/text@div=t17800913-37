               <p>Where did you leave these things before you found them in her box? - In different rooms in the house.</p>
               <p>Had she any thing to do with them? - Yes, to wash and to put them by. When I found them in her box I took them out; I asked her what she had to say for herself? She told me nothing.

She said she had not. I desired her to open her boxes; there were four, I think; in them I found these things which the lady has sworn to.</p>

               <p>Court. Upon the melancholy event of your mother's death, did you give her any thing, or was she to have any thing? - A few trifling things; I gave her none of these things.</p>

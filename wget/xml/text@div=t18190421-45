               <p>Q. What was he in the office - A. A sorter. He opened the bag that morning, and then sorted them. Letters put into the York bag on the 5th of December, would arrive in due course on the 7th.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning would the prisoner finish his duty - A. About ten o'clock; he would then leave the office. It was his duty to sort the York letters.

            . I have known the prisoner two years and a half - I have not known what he was above a year. My husband is a Frenchman, and is not in any trade here, I was servant in a family in Wood-street before I married him. I went abroad with them, and there became acquainted with him.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the prisoner tell you he was - A. A clerk in the Post-office.</p>
               <p>Q. In December, did you purchase a pelisse of Mr. Swift, in Houndsditch - A. Yes, on Monday, the 7th of December; I paid a 20 l. bank note for it, which I received of the prisoner at Mr. Baverstock's, who keeps the Angel and Crown, public-house, opposite Whitechapel church; I met him there by appointment, about one o'clock that day. He gave me the note, and told me to buy myself a pelisse.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner is deaf; when you met him at Baver-stock's, did you converse with him, or did he write - A. He wrote on a piece of paper, that I was to buy myself a pelisse, not to exceed 3 l., and to give the name of Mrs. Gray, No. 24, White Lion-street, Pentonville. I was to meet him again at Longman's, the Grapes, public-house, in Aldgate Church-passage - he wrote all this down. I then left him, went to Swift's, bought a pelisse, and paid the same 20 l. note he gave me - (looks at D. C. Swift) - that is the person I paid it to. The pelisse came to 2 l. 15 s., I received 17 l. 5 s. in change. They asked me my name, and I gave the name and address as he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Swift get you the 17 l. 5 s. - A. I waited while the man went for change. I then went to Longman's, met the prisoner there, and gave him the same notes and money I received from Swift - I think they were all 1 l. notes, but I am sure some were. I wrote the name on the note - (looks at it) - this is it; it has,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Gray, No. 24, White Lion-street, Pentonville," on it, in my own handwriting. I was acquainted with the prisoner until he was taken up, and had no difference with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasioned you to come forward - A. My own<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210023"></xptr>safety. I found there was a hand-bill out respecting a person answering my description - I came forward voluntarily, and gave this account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You live with your husband - A. I do; he is not a man of property. I have a great deal of work, and support him in a great part. He is ill, and incapable of working. He used to have supplies from his father in France. We live in Upper Thames-street with my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. You lived with Mrs. Johnston - A. Yes, before we went to Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Johnston tell you she would not keep you any longer - A. No; we left in consequence of her leaving town.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you came forward to save yourself - there is also a reward - A. Yes, I think it is 50 l. I do not know how long the prisoner was in custody before I came forward. I attended two examinations. I do not know Levy's.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never lived at Levy's, in Devonshire-court - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray were you ever at any other public-office but Bow-street - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You was never at the Mansion-house - A. I may have been there - I was never in prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Take care. Do you mean to swear you never was confined on any charge yourself - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the oath you have taken were you not a prisoner in the House of Correction - A. For one month; it was for pledging things from a ready-furnished lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say you was never in prison - A. I did not recollect it. I was sent there from Lambeth-street.</p>
               <p>A. Then you was at a police-office, besides Bow-street and the Mansion-house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the pelisse - A. I pledged it. It was discovered by the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner a married man - A. I did not know it when I first became acquainted with him - I learnt it about twelve months after.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Was any discovery made respecting the pelisse until you came forward and mentioned it - A. No. I communicated it to Mr. Parkin, the solicitor to the Post-office.</p>
               <p>(MR. GURNEY here exhibited the hand-bill, offering the witness a reward to come forward and prove who she received the note of. The reward was not upon the prisoner's conviction.)</p>

I first desired the woman to write on the note, which I saw her do, and put my initials to it - (looks at it) - there are my initials on it - it has been through my hands. I delivered it to Dalton, with the writing on it, to take it to the Bank; he returned with the change, and I gave the woman 17 l. 5 s. with the same notes Dalton brought me, with 5 s. - I think they were all 1 l. notes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker in St. Martin's-lane, (produces a pair of salts and spoons): On the 18th of June I stopped them upon the prisoner; he offered them to pledge; I asked him how he came by them, (having previous notice that they were stolen); he made no answer; I(moving towards the door to keep him in as long as I could) went to weigh them, and as soon as I had got out of the front shop he turned gently out of the box; I, hearing the door go, looked at the box to see if he was there; upon finding him gone, I jumped over the counter and pursued him; I saw him running down Taylor's-buildings, and I had him secured.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say the value of them? - A. It is impossible to ascertain exactly what they are worth without taking the lead from the bottoms, which is put in to keep them steady.</p>

               <p>Winter. These are the salts and spoons that I lost; I do not know the value of them, but they cost me three guineas and a half; this skirt of a lady's riding-habit is mine, it laid in the back parlour, tied up in a silk handkerchief; the salts were in the front parlour; there is a door opens from one to the other; this coat is mine, that was in the front parlour; the breeches and overalls were in the same place; the overalls I cannot speak particularly to; I lost a pair of that sort, but I cannot swear to them; the other things have particular marks.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the skirt? - A. The value of the cloth is two pounds at least, the value of the coat is about two guineas and a half, they would stand me in that; the breeches stand me in about twenty shillings.</p>

            . (Police-constable, E 80.) I was called between twelve and one o'clock on the night of the 7th of January - the prosecutor said he had been robbed- I went into the room - I saw James in bed - he said that was the girl he had sent for some rum, but the other had gone down stairs for water - I turned my light off and waited about ten minutes - Kelly then came up into the room - I turned the light on, and asked the prosecutor if that was the girl - he said she was - I took her, and the next day the magistrate desired me to take James - she told me the duplicate of the handkerchief was in a glass, on the mantel-shelf, and that if I had looked in the bed, when I first went, I should have found it - she said Kelly told her it was her intention to rob the prosecutor, and she was sorry she had had anything to do with it - I had searched the bed when I first went, but found no handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you sober? A. Yes; and so was the prosecutor - he said he had wrapped his watch in his handkerchief, and placed it in his breast pocket.</p>

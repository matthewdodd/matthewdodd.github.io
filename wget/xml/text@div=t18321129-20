On the 15th of November the prisoner came and asked for a trunk which he had left there - it was up stairs - I fetched it for him, leaving him below - there was a bundle in the room; I brought that also down to the prisoner, thinking it belonged to him; I saw a pair of shoes in the bundle, and I bought them of him for 1s. 6d.; I did not ask him if they were his, but he said the bundle was his, and he took it away; the next morning he came for the trunk, which he did not take the first day; I then asked him if the shoes were his, and whether they had not belonged to his master's brother? he said No; they were Captain George Mildmay's, and that he gave them to him.</p>

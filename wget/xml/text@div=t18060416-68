On the 8th of April, between the hours of four and five in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar came to my shop and offered to pledge a plane, he being intoxicated in liquor, I refused to lend him any money; he left the shop. Between eight and nine of the evening of the same day, Mr. Page sent his young man to my shop to enquire if I had lost a waistcoat, that he had in his hand; I told him the waistcoat was mine, it was hanging in the shop about four o'clock for sale.</p>

             sworn. On the 8th of this month the prisoner came to my house between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, and offered a waistcoat to pledge; I observed at the corner a pin which is here now, and a little part of what I supposed it had been pinned to hanging to the pin, that gave me reason to suppose that it had been torn off from somewhere, I sent my young man round the neighbourhood to see if he could find out where it was stole from, he went to Mr. Lowther's. I took no notice to the prisoner, he had some suspicion that my young man was gone out, he went to the door, and said, Jane, why do not you come in, why do you stand in the cold; he took the opportunity of going off, I did not go after him, I knew he was well known at Hatton Garden, and therefore they knew where to find him; I am sure he is the man, his wife comes to our shop sometimes, her name is Jane. (The waistcoat produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>- STANTON sworn. I am an officer, I knew where to find the prisoner, I apprehended him, I believe he is a cabinet maker.</p>

               <p>Q. (to Mr. Page). Did he appear to have been drinking. - A. Yes, but he knew how to run away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was the man that I had in company with me at the door that gave me this waistcoat to pledge; I went to Mr. Page's, Mr. Page went out of the door to look at the waistcoat, I says, James come in yourself, no, says he, I will not, he wished me good night, and said I had better go home; I know no more of the waistcoat than a child unborn, I can get a waistcoat without stealing one; I can earn two guineas a week.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, but have lived with the prisoner for four years, and have had a child by him, which was three years old last Jan.—I left him about nine weeks ago because he had no employment, and took my child with me—on Monday night, 6th April, about six weeks after I had left him, I met him in the street, and told him to come and fetch his things away next morning, as I did not wish to have anything more to say to him—he came on the 7th, about half past 9 o'clock in the morning, when I was in bed—he came into my room, and sat down by the side of the bed, on a chair—some conversation ensued, and in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour he shaved himself with a razor which he had left there—after that I got up, and told him to go away, for I did not wish to have anything more to say to him—he asked me if I meant it; I said, "Yes"—he asked me to fasten the door, but I would not—he asked me to</p>

               <p>sit on the sofa by his side—I declined, and sat myself in the front of the window—I was looking out into the street, and he asked me to shut the window; I told him I would not, and all at once I felt something pushing in my side; I thought it was his knuckles, but I found that it was a table knife—I got up, and had a struggle with him, and took the knife from him, and laid it on the table—he got hold of me, laid me on the bed, opened his razor, and inflicted a wound on my face—I had had a few words with him, saying that I did not wish to have anything to say to him, but that was all—Dr. Smith, of Blackfriars Road, attended me for three weeks—after inflicting a wound on my neck, the prisoner went down stairs into the passage, and was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of No. 114, Blackfriars Road. On—7th April I was called to No. 3, Union Street, Borough, and on going through the passage I saw the prisoner—on entering the bed room, I found the prosecutrix bleeding profusely from a wound on the neck and face three inches long, extending from the back of the ear underneath towards the face, passing over the carotid artery and the jugular vein—I considered it a dangerous wound; if it had been half an inch lower, it would, have been fatal—this razor (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would produce such a wound—I attended her for about three weeks.</p>

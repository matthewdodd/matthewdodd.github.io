On Monday night, the 8th of September, I heard a quarrel near my door; a lodger of mine was coming across the road - the prisoner and several others had been walking about the street, with pipes in their mouths, but at that time they were at the corner; some altercation took place between them and my lodger, but I was not at the door to see it: my lodger's coat and hat were thrown into my passage - he was out in the street, but I did not see him at that time; I took them up and put them on a chair and went out to see the meaning of the quarrel - I saw my lodger on the ground on his back; I went and persuaded him to come in and dress himself, and not to fight: some people brought him in, and he was washed from the blood - I bolted my door, because the mob was so great; my lodger<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110129"></xptr>was in the house half an hour or twenty minutes, and when we thought it was all quiet, he wished to have something to eat; he took some halfpence, and went out to get something, and was knocked down again; I did not see him knocked down, but I saw him on the ground - I heard the words "Now, Bill," and I saw a man kicking him on the left side - I went up and took him by the left arm, but I could not raise him; the man who had kicked him, when he saw me take hold of his arm, struck me, and knocked me down, full length on the ground - that was

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you taken your tea that night? A. Yes, at five o'clock, but I am a person who never takes liquors for months together, when I do take it, it is as a remedy for the spasms in the stomach - I did not take notice whether Harris was sober; I had some conversation with him, to tell him who it was that struck me - if I were to tell the sincere truth of my mind, I do not think he was sober; I did say I did not take notice whether he was sober, but it was because I did not wish to injure the matter - I know I was treated by the prisoner as I have stated, and that is all I have to say; I do not altogether take upon me to say whether Harris was sober or drunk - in my own opinion I do not think he was sober; if I did say I did not take notice, it was because you were bothering of me, or because I did not wish to injure the matter, which way you please to take it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to GEORGE HARRIS. Q. Is there the least pretence for saying you had the slightest appearance of intoxication about you? A. Not the slightest, I was as sober as I am now.</p>

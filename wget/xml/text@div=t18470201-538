In consequence of in<lb></lb>structions I received, I watched the movements of the prisoner Mitchell on the evening of the 25th Jan.—I knew before then that he lodged at the White Swan, in Upper Thames-street—I saw him on that evening, about a quarter before seven o'clock, at the door of the White Swan—he went from there to Knight's coffee-house in Budge-row—about five minutes after he went in, the prisoner Moore went in—I followed her in—(I was in plain clothes)—she sat down in the same box where Mitchell was—they had some conversation together—when they had been there about ten minutes, they got up to go out, and, as they passed the box where I was sitting, Mitchell said to Moore, "You can have these things, and I will let you have the account to-morrow"—Moore said "Yes"—they then went down Dowgate-hill in company as far Chequer-yard, they stood talking for about a minute, and Mitchell went in the direction of the White Swan, leaving Moore at the corner of the yard—in about five minutes Mitchell returned with a parcel on his arm—it appeared to be weighty, and was done up in handkerchief—(he had had no parcel before)—the prisoners then went together up Dowgate-hill to Walbrook, and went into a butcher's shop on the right-hand side—Mitchell there placed his parcel on the bench, untied it, and took out two parcels wrapped up in brown paper—he placed them in different handkerchief, which Moore spread out upon the bench—he tied it up, and they walked away together to the Bay Tree public-house in St. Swithin's lane—went in and sat down, and remained for about half an hour—they had a pint of warm beer—at the expiration of that time they went away together—they crossed Cornhill and other streets, and went up Artillery-lane, Bishopsgate-street—that is more than half a mile from Thames-street—when they got to the corner of Gun-street, Mitchell gave the parcel which he had carried to there to Moore—he stooped down, and appeared to kiss her—they then separated, Mitchell went towards Bishopsgate-street, and Moore towards Spitalfields church—I followed her, and when she had got about twenty yards, I said, "I am a constable, allow me to ask what you have got there?"—she was then fumbling and adjusting the parcel under her cloak—she said, "Yes—it is copper'—I said, "Where did you get it from?" she said, "I bought it of a Mr. Mitchell, a copper-merchant in Thames-street, but he has apartments at the White Swan—I have just left him—if we walk fast I dare say we shall overtake him"—we walked fast, but did not overtake him—these are the two bundles, wrapped in brown paper, and tied in this handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been employed at the prosecutors' warehouse at Dowgate about 6 years—during all that time Mitchell has been foreman there—I know Moore by her coming to the warehouse to purchase copper—she came openly to the knowledge of every body there—the last time I saw her was on the 6th or 7th of January—she was in the habit of buying extra slight plates, 4 feet long by 2 feet wide—it was quite different to this copper—she never bought so much as this at a time, of the extra slight copper—I was present at the transaction on the 6th or 7th of January—Mitchell entered that transaction in a book which I have here—here is the entry, "Moore, extra slight, 7lbs. 4 oz., not paid—I weighed it, and delivered it to her.</p>

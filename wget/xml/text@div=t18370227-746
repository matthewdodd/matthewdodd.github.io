                  </hi>. I am a constable. On Sunday morning, the 19th of February, between two and three o'clock, I saw the two prisoners standing about, opposite the prosecutor's shop, in Goldsmith's-row, Hackney-road, for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—they saw me and walked on a few yards, up the row—they then turned back again and passed me—I knew them both by sight before—I saw them by the gas light, and am certain they are the men—they passed me three times—I then met French, another policeman, and drew his attention to them—I followed then to No. 1, Hay-street, which is about twenty yards from Barnes's shop—they went in there, and I saw no more of them that night—I afterwards received information of this robbery, and gave French information of it, and about twelve o'clock the next night I saw Goddard come out of a public-house in Goldsinith's-row, and go to No. 1, Hay-street—I saw French go in after him—I heard a rattle spring from the house, and went there—I found French in the room below stairs with Goddard—on my going in, French went up stairs, and I staid below with Goddard—I saw French bring down some mutton and beef from an upper room—there was some raw meat lying on the table in the room I was in, before Goddard came down—the mutton and beef was raw, and part of the pork—the rest of the pork was cooked—Bromley came down soon after, and we took them both into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a butcher's shop in Goldsmith's-place, Hackney-road. On Saturday night, the 18th of February, I shut up my shop about a quarter or twenty minutes before one o'clock—it is part of my dwelling-house—there is a door out of the shop into the house—the shop window will not open at all—I cannot swear that I fastened the shop door when I went to bed—it has a lock, a bolt, and a latch to it—the latch will open from the outside when it is shut, with a key, but not without—I went into the shop next morning about eight o'clock, and found the door a little open, just shut to the post, but neither locked nor latched—I looked round and missed a quantity of meat and pork sausages—I was the first person down</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183702270081"></xptr>
               <p>—I was sent for by the police at a quarter past twelve o'clock on Sunday night, and went to No. 1, Hay-street—I found the two prisoners and the policeman there—I found two fore-quarters of mutton, two shoulders, and part of another shoulder baked, a loin, a spring, and a hind-leg of pork, and part of a rump of beef—I am certain it was part of the meat I lost—the loin and spring of pork had marks on it by which I knew it, and all the meat was my own cutting up—I knew it also by that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You cannot say you fastened the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot swear either one way or another—it is an ordinary latch, attached to the lock—the door might not have caught when I shut it to—the police-sergeant shut the door when he came to examine it, and the latch did not catch then, but the spring of the lock did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Sunday, the 19th of February, I was on duty between two and three o'clock in the morning, and saw Goddard in Dove-row with a man who I cannot swear to—fifty or sixty yards from Mr. Barnes's shop—Dove-row comes up right opposite his shop—they passed me and went down Dove-row—I took particular notice of them, and can swear to Goddard—I saw Prior directly after, and he went down Dove-row after them—I saw no more of them that night—I had not Men them nearer to Barnes's shop than fifty yards—I had passed the door several times that night, and tried it three or four times as I passed it—I put my hand in the middle of the door, and pushed it, and found it fast—I did it to ascertain that it was fast—I try all the doors—I am certain 1 pushed it sufficiently to force it open, if it had not been locked or latched—I received information of the robbery on Sunday evening, and at twelve o'clock, or a little after, I saw Goddard come out of a public-house next Door to Mr. Barnes's—I and Prior were standing together at the time—I followed him to No. 1, Hay-street—he knocked at the door, which was opened by a boy—I followed him in, and turned my light on—I opened the cupboard, and found the mutton and pork in it—I went to the door and sprang my rattle, and Prior came to my assistance—I then went up stairs and found some more mutton, beef, and sausages in a box—the prisoner Bromley was lying on the bed with his clothes on, in the same room—I found a bunch of eighteen keys in the cupboard, up stairs—they ace all common keys, of different sizes, and some are broken—I asked Bromley where he got the meat—he said, "That has got to be tried"—I took it down stairs, and then went up and brought Bromley down—Mr. Barnes came and took the meat to the station-house, and we took the prisoners there—I cannot swear Bromley is one of the men that I saw—it was a person dressed like him, but I could not see his face.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the prisoners resist being taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all—there was nothing particular to attract ray attention to Barnes's house more than others—I try all the doors as I go along—there was some mud on one of the pieces of meat.</p>

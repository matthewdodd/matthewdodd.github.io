               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. Yes; as sober as ever I was in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the take from you? - A. Six shillings and half-a-crown, in a canvass bag; I immediately called the watch, and told her I should take her to the watch-house; she said, if I took her to the watch-house, she was done; and I told her, if she would return me half the money, I would not take her to the watch-house; the patrol took the other woman. After she had been in the watch-house, she owned that she had given it to Sparkes, but I cannot swear that she was the other woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Urin is the woman? - A. I am very sure she is the woman; I never parted from her till I got her to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>- MIDDLETON sworn. - The prosecutor brought this woman to the watch-house, and gave me charge of her.</p>

               <p>- CHALICE sworn. - The prosecutor brought Mrs. Urin to the door of the watch-house, about one o'clock in the morning, and gave me charge of her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Urin's defence. I was going down Bridge-street, and saw the prosecutor with this woman and two others, and he came up and said he wanted to speak to me; I went up to him, and thought he was going to give me something, and he said he had lost his money; he caught hold of my hand, and said I had got it; I am a cripple in this hand, and have been ever since I was born; I never saw a farthing of his money.</p>

On 28th November, about 12.40, I was outside the prosecutor's house, on duty in South Grove, when a man came to the corner, apparently coming down the Grove—as soon as he saw me he ran away—I followed him, and he ran down the Mile End Road—that was about twenty or thirty yards from the prosecutor's house—I saw him kneeling down behind Mr. Chambers' house, under an arch—I followed down after him, and I got under the arch—I found—a</p>

               <p>towel on the ground, and saw the door of Mr. Ch timber she I open, lead<lb></lb>ing into the back part of his house—it comes out into that archway—I then went down into the bottom of the yard, and in an open shed I founds sheet and a dead goose, a flannel petticoat, and in a shed close by I found the prisoner lying down—I can't swear that he was the man that I had seen before, because I only caught a glimpse of him as he went under the arch—the gardens go into the Grove—the railings are about five or six feet high—I should think about eight minutes elapsed between my seeing a man run<lb></lb>ning and going into the yard—I ran about twenty yards when I first saw the man running—when I got into the yard I did not see anyone running—I turned into the shed, and saw the prisoner—the things were lying near him, just outside—I found 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 2/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a bad shilling, which W.

I have been lying where I could for the last fourteen weeks; and I happened to be in this shed at the time. I went there to sleep.

Since that time I have lodged anywhere. I had done a day's work on this day, for the first time, at the docks. I paid some money away, and I had a shilling left. I stopped at a house that night, and when I left I had six-pence in my pocket. I bought half-an-once of tobacco, and that left me 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I came along Bow Common Lane, and I went to some new buildings that were being made. The policeman found me there, and said, "You must not go there, or I will lock you up." I came to Mr. Chambers' yard, and saw some buildings down there that I could get into. I got into the shed, and laid down. I had been there some little time, when I heard some one come down the yard; and then someone clambered over the wooden</p>

He came to the shed, and then came in, and turned to the left<lb></lb>hand, where I was, opposite the door; and I could have easily escaped then and been clear, if I had done anything wrong. He distinctly stated at the station, that he saw three men running. Mr. Chambers said he did not know how I could pass the dog, and one of his men was in custody at the same time; it must have been someone well acquainted with the place.</p>

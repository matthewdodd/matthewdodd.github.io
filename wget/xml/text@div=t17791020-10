            .</p>
               <p>How many had you bought for Mr. Bulkeley? - Thirty-three in the whole; there were eleven missing at that time; I knew them by their being of the sort that I bought. I picked them out; they were marked with a single B, but their mark was grown out; I knew them more by the sort and their being bald-faced than by the mark.</p>
               <p>Can you from those circumstances take upon you to say that these seven bullocks were part of those lost from Mr. Bulkeley's? - I am certain of it. After I had found them, I went to Mr. Wooden's and found a pair there with Mr. Bulkeley's mark, R. B. on the horn; he had had that pair in his possession for four years.</p>
               <p>They were not among the thirty three you bought for him? - No; I bought them for him at a different time.</p>
               <p>Are you sure those two were past of those which were lost? - I am sure of it; I went to the justice and swore to them and came home again; I did nothing else.</p>
               <p>When was the last time the bullocks were in Mr. Bulkeley's possession? - About the 3d or 4th of last month.</p>
               <p>When was it you saw them at Horsham? - About the 19th of the same month, I am not quite certain as to the time.</p>

               <p>Can you take upon you then to say that the prisoner is the man? - Yes I can; I bought them in the open fair; they are now in my grounds.</p>

               <p>I live at Horsham; I bought two bullocks of the prisoner at Crawley-fair on the 9th of September. Davis came to me about three weeks ago to look at the bullocks to see if they belonged to a gentleman who had lost some. I showed him them; I had no others; they were both marked in the horn, but I never discerned the mark sufficiently to take notice of it.</p>
               <p>To Davis. Where were the bullocks lost from? - Enfield Chace, from the new enclosure. I had not seen them for two months before they were missed. I saw them at Horsham; I was ill at the time they were missing and could not go out.</p>

               <p>My Master, Mr. Bulkeley, gave me the bullocks to look after and to sell them for him if I could; I took them to the fair and sold them; I got rather in liquor and had my pocket picked of the money, and durst not face my master till I got some more money to pay him; when I heard he had sent somebody after me to take me, I surrendered myself up to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Cecil-street, Strand. The prisoner was my por<lb></lb>ter or errand-boy for about six years—in consequence of one of my customer, Mr. Bone, of York-street, Covent-garden, calling on me, I desired the pri<lb></lb>soner to walk into the counting-house—Mr. Bone charged him with robbery—I had been employed to fold and stitch catalogues for Mr. Bone—the pri<lb></lb>soner gave me some information.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chandler, and live in Bedfordbury.

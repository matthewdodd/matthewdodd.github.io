               <p>I am a peruke-maker and hair-dresser; I have known the prisoner about three years; he is an honest man. On the 30th of August I went to his apartment in Webb-square, a front-room, one pair of stairs; I went to shave him, and in the middle of shaving him, a woman came into the room, and said, Mr. Britt, I have a few things to dispose of. Says he, good woman, let me see them. She had a sort of box on her arm, with a string upon it; she asked two shillings; and he said, I will speak to you when the barber has done; and I saw him give her silver and some half-pence; there was a sort of wooden thing that I have seen, some article in the weaving branch; it was like this, but I will not say it is the same. I do not know the name of the woman; I never saw her before or since.</p>

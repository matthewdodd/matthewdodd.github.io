On the evening of the 13th of May, I was looking out of our front room window, and saw the prisoner with another boy; he turned to Harriet Sulman, unsnapped her beads, rolled them up in his hand, and ran to the top of the street - I am sure he is the person; I got a fair look at him- he turned to see if any body was looking at him, but he did not see me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROWE. Q. What hour was this? A.

             - I am nearly ten years of age. I was playing with Harriet Sulman, in Crown-street; the prisoner came and turned her round, unsnaped the beads from her neck, and gave them to a bigger boy, who was with him, and the prisoner ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before? A. No, I was next door; I could see what he did - I am quite sure he gave them to another boy when he got to the top of the street; I saw a gentleman ran after him; I did not make any noise - I told the gentleman, and he came out when he heard the child cry; my father came home from chapel, and I went in with him, but I saw the prisoner give the heads to the other boy before I went in.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SIMPSON. I live in Crown-street. This witness called my attention to the prisoner; I pursued, and caught him running through Hoxton-square - I took him, and asked what he had done with the beads which he took from the child's neck - he said he knew nothing about them; I brought him back; he was identified by both the witnesses, and I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far do you live from the spot? A. Not above seven yards - I ran out as soon as I heard the child scream; it was about eight o'clock in the evening; there were a few boys in the square, but not running - there is a short turn from the street which I live in to the square; the beads were taken about thirty yards from the square - I saw the prisoner when he was about twenty yards from me; I did not lose sight of him.</p>

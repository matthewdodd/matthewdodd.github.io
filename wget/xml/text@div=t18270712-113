               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. Do you swear that? A. Yes; it was about twenty minutes past one o'clock in the morning; I had left home with a friend at ten o'clock at night; I was not talking to any women, and had not seen the prisoner before; I went into a public-house - he came in after us - they refused to draw me liquor, because it was an improper hour, not because I was drunk; I never said I had dropped my money; I gave an alarm directly; he said my waistcoat was unbuttoned, and he would button it; I said, "No, I thank you;" he took hold of the bottom of my waistcoat, and took the money - only two buttons were undone; a female was near me, who asked a question, which I did not hear - and while I turned my head, he put his hand into my pocket; I seized him - he returned me the money, and ran away; the watchman came up and took him.</p>

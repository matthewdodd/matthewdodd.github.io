I forgot, it is not looked," and he partly untied the cord and lifted the lid a little, and said "You can see it is only clothes"—we untied the string and lifted the sack at the top and saw this plate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) underneath—this is the box—I said "We can see it is not clothes"—he made no reply—Samuel Tarrington said to Atkins "I wish your—neck was broken before you brought it in"—Atkins said nothing—I took him in custody for stealing the plate.</p>

Shortly after 5 p.m. on Saturday, June 28th, I saw Atkins and Samuel Tarrington in custody at Kenning<lb></lb>ton Road Station, for having this box and plate in their possession—Atkins told me that Francis Tarrington, his stepfather, at 19, New Compton Street, Soho, gave him the box to carry to Sam's—I went there</p>

               <p>and saw Francis Tarrington and asked him if he had a son-in-law, Henry Atkins, in his employ—he said, "He works for me on and off; he is out of employment"—I said, "Has he been working for you to-day?" and he said, "No, he was at my shop about 10.30 this morning" I said, "He is in custody for having a box of plate in his possession, and has made a statement implicating you, and you must come with me and hear what he has to say about it"—he said, "I know nothing about it," and went with me—on the way to the station he said, "I suppose some one must have asked him to carry a box, and he has been foolish enough to do so; that is a thing I would not do for any person"—I made no reply—at the Kennington Road Station I repeated in his presence the state-<lb></lb>ment Atkins had made to me, and Atkins said, "That is right"—Francis said, "It is false, I know nothing about it!" and afterwards called me and said, "I remember now, a man came to my place this morning and asked if I had a young man who could carry a box for him over the water; I said, 'Yes;' I suppose this must be the box; but it was not brought in my presence, and I have not seen it"—they were all three then charged with unlawful possession of the silver—we afterwards ascertained that it had been stolen from Major Barron, and on ex<lb></lb>amining the premises, I found the area door leading to the scullery had been forced open and the barrel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of the bolt broken off, and the door leading from the scullery to the kitchen had been forced open with a jemmy; the thieves had then gone through the kitchen, up the staircase into the second-floor front bedroom; I saw there a wardrobe which had contained the plate had been opened by force, and another wardrobe from another room from which the linen had been taken—I afterwards searched Francis Tarrington's premises—he is a coal-dealer, and has a forge under the shop—I took several chisels and screwdrivers to compare the marks on the door, but I found Major Burron had caused the house to be put in repair.</p>

On the 23rd July, with the Magistrate's permission, I saw Francis Tarrington in a cell—he said, "I wish to tell you the truth about this affair, and then that young woman who gave evidence this morning will be the first one you will take. There were four other men in the job; one of them is her young man, and Scotty is another man; Tom Green is another; I do not know the name of the other young man—the servant's young man I mean. The servant's young man put up the job, and let them in or kept her away, I don't know which, till they got in; they took the stuff to a house in Queen Street, Soho Square, first, but there they would have nothing to do with it; they were back to my house a little after ten the same night, and took it down into my cellar. I saw it was silver or silver plate; it was wrapped up in a sheet, or something of that kind. They wanted me to buy it, but I could not, I had not got the money. They went out saying they would get a buyer, and soon after came back with Tommy Farmer; he bid them 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per ounce for it, but they would not take that, and as Farmer went out of my house he said to me, 'They want all for themselves.' They then brought a man named Stone, a barber, who keeps a shop in Drury Lane, and he gave them 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per ounce for it; he (Stone) brought the scales and weighed it in my cellar, and it fetched 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd. I went down again after they had weighed it, and said, 'Ain't you gone yet? Are you going to stop here all night?' <hi rend="italic">Scotty</hi> then said, 'There will be an outcry about this soon, as they won't pay the young fellow who got them.' Stone then hired George to carry the things to his house. They all four came to my house on Friday night. I know <hi rend="italic">Scotty</hi> and Tom Green, but I had never seen the other two before. The servant's young man is a tall smart young fellow with a dark moustache. The plated stuff that you have got was to be taken to the York Hotel, York Road, and I think it was Tom Green who was going to meet it there at 6 o'clock that evening. I do not know where it was to go from there. My brother (Samuel) does not know anything about it, he is as innocent as a baby"—I took the words down at the time.</p>

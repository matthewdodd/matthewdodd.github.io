            Your husband keeps the house where this transaction happened? - Yes. On the 6th of August, Mr. Oram came twice to my house for pots; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170127"></xptr>could not get any from that part that he went to, he went all over the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lived in your house, in the one pair of stairs? - Ann Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose lodging was it where these people were? - Frances Price. I went up stairs to every place that was let, and asked of all the lodgers that were in the house, from the top to bottom, and I could get no pots; when I went into this room, there were three men at breakfast, and one of these two men that stands there, he laughs at me, and bids me look under the bed, I did not then, I went down to Mr. Oram, and told him there were no pots, and he was not satisfied, he said, if you please I will go up with you, and we went up again, and I went to the closer, and I found a quart pot, and I went to the window, and I found a penny pot, I turned down the coverlid of the bed, and I found another quart por, and I took off the bolster, and next the bed there were two pint pots and a quart pot; I gave them to Mr. Oram, they were tied up in a man's shirt, and a handkercheif, and when the man found that I was in search of these three pots in the handkerchief, they made their escape, and Mr. Oram followed them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Ward. When you came to enquire for these pots, we were at breakfast; do you know who came in about half after eight? - You and that young man came in, and then you went out again, and a little after that you brought in a two-penny loaf, and something in a glass tumbler.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the expression that I made when you came to enquire for the pots? - Why you sell a laughing, and said, look under the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. The other man, the third man, was a strange man, who was in the room? - No, you had all come in together, for two or three days running.</p>
               <p>Court. What time was it you found these things in the bed? - About half after ten, or a quarter before eleven, the clock had not gone eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the handkerchief that you found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark on them? - No, there is none; they said before the justice's that it was none of theirs.</p>

Do you remember any beer coming in a pot with a spout to it? - Yes, I had it the 5th of August, in the evening, I kept it in the room till next morning between nine and ten o'clock, when I put four on the landing place adjoining my room; I then did what I had to do, and I went out to market to get some mutton chops for my dinner; I put out a plain pint, a plain half pint, a plain quart, and a spouted quart; as I was coming from market, going by the window of the two chairmen, Mr. Oram's, we see the two men at the bar, a young woman came with me from market, and we asked them to give us something to drink; they did; I thanked them, and the young woman and I went out at the back door; this was between nine and ten; I then went strait home.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get home? - I cannot tell exactly. In a few minutes Mr. Oram came in and asked for the four pots; I told him to go and take them, for there were plenty; I said this in a joke.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Ward. At the time you met with us, drinking at the public house, had you put the pots out then? - Yes, I had.</p>

               <p>Stirrup. They came first at half past eight, and they went out again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they in, one hour? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Three? - I cannot say; it cannot be so much as that, because they were taken before eleven; it was not an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When they returned with that tumbler, what time was that? - Between nine and ten; and they stayed till we went up to look for the pots.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Ward to Oram. Do you know on what day we came to your house? - The 6th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose hands were these pots lodged? - In my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. I have a witness that they were lodged in the Old-bailey last night? - They were, but not left.</p>

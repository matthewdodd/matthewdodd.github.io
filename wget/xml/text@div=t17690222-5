               <p>Curvan. It is worth 6 s. a pound; there was in the whole 389 lb. in the, cask at first. On the 4th of February Mr. Scofield, the broker who bought it for me, took me to the house of one

            , in the Borough, where we found 107 lb. weight of it. I asked Mr. Green where he had it; he would not let me know. It is a particular sort of indico. I really believe it to be mine which was missing out of that cask; it has a particular coat upon it, a white coat. It is French indico; there is no such indico in London to be had as that is I believe. I had been looking for more, but could not meet with any.</p>

            . I am a broker. I bought some indico for Mr. Curvan, for exportation, the latter end of January last. I sold it to him on the 24th. I had a sample shewed me by Mr. Green, at the coffee-house in change time, on the 3 d of February, and told there was about 400 lb. weight of it. I told Mr. Green immediately, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176902220006"></xptr> knew that indico, and that I had sold it at the beginning of the week to Mr. Curvan. It is a most particular kind of indico. At that time I did not know the indico had been lost. I told him I suspected it to have been stolen, and bid him take care what he was about. He desired me not to take notice to any body what he was going to tell me (but perhaps that is immaterial to the matter). I went with Mr. Curvan to Mrs. Jones's, and there saw the indico, and knew it to be the same I sold him. There were about 108 lb. weight of it. I question whether there is any such in London besides. I sold it to Mr. Curvan for 6 s. a pound. ( Some of the indico produced-in court.) There are very few casks of indico come into the kingdom, but what I see.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear positively this was the same indico you bought for Mr. Curvan?</p>
               <p>Scofield. I do. I have it now in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. How is indico manufactured?</p>
               <p>Scofield. It is made of a weed; by fermenting it with lime they bring it into a stone.</p>

            . Mr. Scofield sent some indico to me for Mr. Curvan; I have seen the remainder in the cask, and that found in the Borough, which certainly is the same. I had it from Lime-street. I was shewed a great quantity of indico, but there was no other like this one cask, which was the occasion I did not chuse to have it myself. I swear positively this is of the same indico. I never saw such indico in England before.</p>

            . I am a seafaring man, and live at Wapping. On the 1st of February, about two in the afternoon, two young men came to me; one was named Hunter; they brought some indico; one of them took two or three pieces out of his pocket, and asked me if I knew what it was. I said I did not know. He said it was indico, and that it was very dear. He told me he wanted to sell it, and he would satisfy any body for their trouble, if they would get any body to buy it. I went to Mr. Lockhart's house, but he was not at home; he came to me between five and six the same day to the house of Mr. Gordon, the Watermens Arms and Black Boy. He asked what I wanted with him. I shewed him a piece of indico.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>Sharp. I cannot tell. I have known him to buy coffee of a captain and other things. He said he had bought as good for fifteen or sixteen pence a pound, and if I could buy it for eighteen, he would give me two shillings a pound for it. He asked me if I knew the man that brought it; I said I did not, but I heard he was a mate of a ship; then he said there was no danger, if the man had that appearance, in buying it; he said, Buy it by all means. I told him I had no money; he said, he would help me to money. After that Hunter and the other man came to me at Gordon's house; the man delivered 23 lb. of indico to me, and I told him I could get him 18 d. a pound for it. They carried it themselves to Lockhart's door, and I carried it in; they told me they must have the money, but Mr. Lockhart was not at home; I inquired where he was, and went to him, and he gave me two guineas, and I delivered it to them; he said, if that would not do, he would change a 10 l. note. This was about seven at night, and at nine, or a little after, the said two men and Baynam came to my house, and brought a bag; Baynam brought it; there were 82 lb. of it; they laid it down and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Baynam before?</p>
               <p>Sharp. I did, he is a <rs id="t17690222-5-deflabel30" type="occupation">waterman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17690222-5-defend71 t17690222-5-deflabel30"></join>. I sold that to Lockhart, and carried three guineas to the other two men, and gave it them. I did not pay a farthing to Baynam. I saw Baynam and one of the other men, on the second, being Thursday morning, about eight o'clock: the other man asked me for the remainder of the money. My wife went and borrowed two half guineas, and I had 2 s. of my own, which I gave to Baynam. In all, they had four guineas for that parcel.</p>
               <p>Wm Strange. I am the keeper of the House of correction in the Borough. On the 8th of February Baynam was brought in, and Sharp was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176902220007"></xptr> brought in the day before; at that time Sharp was charged as a principal in the robbery. I said to Baynam, Sharp has been charging you with stealing this indico, do you know any thing of the matter? it is on his account you are taken up. Baynam said he was a poor fellow, a waterman, he was employed to carry them from the Middlesex side to the Surry side. The lighter lay on the Surry side, near Rotherhithe church, as I understood; and they went alongside the lighter, and ordered him to stay; they then put something into his boat in a bag, and he rowed them to the Middlesex side again, and they went on shore with it to Sharp's house.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you live with Mrs. Carlton? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing that happened in the house which she let to a family? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What? - A. The family left it on Friday the 7th of January, and I slept in it the Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights following.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened on the 10th? - A. On the Monday I went into the house, about half past ten; when I went up stairs to my bed-room, I was much surprised at seeing the sheets taken off my bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What else? - A. And the blanket and quilt were thrown on the floor; I went into the next room, and the cloaths of that bed were likewise all turned up; I then went down to the next floor, and on going into the back-room, I saw the bed and blanket tied up as though ready for carrying away.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me whether you had seen the bed and blanket in their proper places before? - A. Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q.How long before? - A. About three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they removed from the bed? - A. No, they were all tied up upon the bedstead.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the sheets missing entirely off your bed? - A. Yes, off my bed entirely.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them? - A. In the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nobody in the house with you, was there? - A. Yes, a child eight years old; I then thought there was somebody in the house, and I went to Mrs. Carlton's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is her house? - A. Three doors lower down; she sent over to the public-house opposite, and we got two soldiers and the landlord to go with us to search the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany them? - A. Yes; there was no person in the house; but on going into the drawing-room, we found the window curtains were taken down, and the sofa cover taken off, and taken away.</p>
               <p>Q.Were they linen or what? - A.Printed calico.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the curtains up before? - A. In the afternoon; we went up to the second floor, and in the front bed-room the furniture of the four-post bedstead was taken down, except the tester, and taken away, and the counterpane; in the back bed-room the furniture of a tent bed and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120050"></xptr>quilt were taken away; that was the room where the bed was tied up and the three blankets; Mrs. Carlton then employed the guards to set up in the house to watch.</p>
               <p>Q. They did so, did they? - A. Yes, but I was not there, and know nothing of what passed afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been at home the greater part, or the whole of the day; how long had you been out? - A. I went out in the morning; Mrs. Carlton was in the house at three o'clock to see all safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you or her in the house all the day? - A. No; I left it between eight and nine in the morning, and did not go into it again till half past ten at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it immediately upon your going in that you missed the things? - A. I went into my bedroom, and found my sheets gone.</p>
               <p>Q. That led you to examine the other rooms? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between eight and nine, and half past ten at night, you don't know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you had seen the things safe at three o'clock? - A. No, Mrs. Carlton had.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Carlton.) What time of day did you go into the house on the 10th? - A. At three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay? - A. I only went over the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go through all the bed-rooms in the house? - A. No; I went up to the second floor to look at the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the front room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was the bed? - A. Every thing was safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the other rooms? - A. No, I did not; I went up stairs for a piece of green baize that I wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from three o'clock till ten nobody was in the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the house was searched? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What state did you find the things in? - A. We went into the parlour first, but found no person; nothing was disturbed there; we went then to the first floor, and found the window-curtains were taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Those you had not observed at three o'clock? - A. No, I had not, and the sofa cover was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me the room you had observed? - A. The front room forward; there the curtains were taken away, and the white counterpane off the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What steps did you take on finding the furniture had been removed? - A. We went to the public-house, and got two of the life guards, and the man at the public-house, to search; we all went over the house, but found nobody in it; then a patrol came up, to whom we gave the alarm, and he likewise went over the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he find any body? - A. No; then I left these two life guards men in the house all night, and about half past five o'clock they saw the door was open; that is a 11 know.</p>

               <p>Hunter, senior. I believe it was about three weeks ago; I suspected them, and watched them as narrowly as I could, but did not miss any thing. They came again, but I was not at home when the watch was taken.</p>

             I am an apprentice to the prosecutor; the two boys came into the shop on Saturday last; one of them produced two shillings, and said he wanted to buy a pair of buttons. I turned my head round to look at them, and my young master came and seized him, and said he had taken something.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take any thing?</p>
               <p>Collings. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>I took the watch up in my hand to look at it; I thought if it would suit me, I would buy it. The gentleman came and took hold of me directly; I had no intention to steal it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hunter, junior. Are you sure he put the watch into his pocket?</p>
               <p>Hunter, junior. I am sure he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Which pocket did he put it into?</p>
               <p>Hunter, junior. To the best of my knowledge he put it into his right-hand waistcoat-pocket; I believe it was the green waistcoat he now has on.</p>

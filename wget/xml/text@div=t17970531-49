             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. - I am foreman to Mr. White, timber-merchant; he has got a timber-yard at Millbank, and another at Whitehall; his timber generally lies at Millbank, when it is imported.</p>
               <p>Q. Previous to this transaction, had you any quantity of Dantzick timber at your yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the nature of Dantzick timber? - A. It is larger than Memel or Riga timber. On Wednesday, the 1st of March, in the evening, I secured all the timber at Mill-bank, and the piece that was stole, particularly, because being broke loose by grounding upon the bank, I had the piece particularly to make fast the night before: On the 2d of March, a little after six in the morning, I was informed it was gone; I examined the place, and found the rope that had fastened it, cut, and the headfast likewise, this satisfied me that it must have been taken away with intention of stealing it; about two yards of the headfast was taken along with it, I have the remains of it, (produces it): it is cut, I searched, but could not find it any where in the river; we then had it advertised, and on Saturday morning, the 4th of March, I made search again, and I came to Lowndes and West's coal-wharf, by White-friars dock, and in consequence of information I got from the coal porters, I was directed to Mr. Wheeler's premises; when I came there, I found a piece of timber, which I had every reason to believe was the one I was looking after; I enquired of the sawyers where it came from.</p>

               <p>Q. What are the defendants? - A. Master carpenters, I understand.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabout upon their premises did you find it? - A. In the saw-pit, one part of it was cutting.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are their premises? - A. In <placeName id="t17970531-49-crimeloc281">Hancock-yard, White-frairs</placeName>

               <p>Q. Does the water come up there? - A. Very near it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Does the tide flow up there? - A. Within a very little distance of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310064"></xptr>Mr. Raine. Q. That is in London? - A. Yes; the tide flows up by Mrs. Sargeant's premises, where there is a dock for landing goods, and these premises are not above fifty or sixty yards from it.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe this timber? - A. It was cross-cut in two pieces; one piece was cutting, and the other was lying by the side of it, in the house where the saw-pit is.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it marked before it was stolen? - A. Yes; C.W. near the contents, and C.W. at the end of it, and a P. which is the mark put on by the measures, to distinguish the ship it came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe these marks when you saw them at Wheeler's? - A. No; they were cut out with an adze or axe, or something of that sort, and the places where the marks had been, were daubed over with mud, so that it might not be discovered that there had been marks upon it; when I came to look at it, there was a part of the letter C still remaining.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that this adze or axe had been applied to these parts of the timber where the letters had been? - A. It did evidently.</p>
               <p>Q. And that the letter part of the timber had been daubed with mud? - A. Yes; it appeared wet as if it was just done.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the mud fresh mud? - A. Yes; and the ends where it was cross-cut, was mudded over, that it might not appear to be fresh cross-cut.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed the timber particularly, at Wheeler's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that was the timber stole from your master's premises? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the defendant? - A. No particular conversation; Mr. Maton had.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was the length of this timber? - A. Fifty feet three inches.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Is Mr. White the only importer of Dantzick timber? - A. No, I believe not; but Mr. White was the only person that had timber above Westminster-bridge at that time; one piece as thirty feet two inches, and the other is twenty feet one inch.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are there no timber merchants above Westminster bridge, that deal in Dantzick timber? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Do you happen to know for what particular purpose this timber was imported, by Mr. White? - A. Yes; for the East-India Company's warehouses.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Any person that had large buildings to erect, would require large timber as well as the East-India Company? - A. Yes; but very few buildings would require such large timber.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are you quite sure this is Mr. White's timber? - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the mark is remaining? - A. There is a part of the C.</p>
               <p>Q. Now might not that be a part of an O? - A. I do not think it could have been an O.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, is that part of the C as you call it, that is now remaining, such as may not have constituted a part of an O? - A. That I leave to the Gentleman of the Jury.</p>
               <p>Q. But you can tell us? - A. I believe not. (Produces a piece of timber with a similar mark upon it).</p>
               <p>Q. Now will you tell me, from that very letter, that any one part of it may not constitute a part of an O? - (Hesitates).</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Do you mean to say you always mark it in the precise way you have marked it here? - A. Nearly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Then tell the Gentlemen of the Jury, whether there is any part of that that might not have constituted part of an O? - A. I do not think it could.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that upon your oath? - A. There is nothing that has any connection with any other letter, and it has not been chopped above the top of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what part of the timber is it that this part of the C remains? - A. At the end where the rope was made fast.</p>
               <p>Q. These premises of Mr. Wheeler's, are carpenter's premises, I believe? - A. I believe they are.</p>
               <p>Q. I see with what complexion you come, have you any doubt that they are? - A. No; I have not a doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this remaining open to inspection? - A. Yes; because the men could not work without light.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not stowed away into any warehouse? - A. There was not time for it, it might have been consumed in another day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that it might not have been slowed away between the Thursday and the Saturday? - A. No; there was an opportunity of shutting the doors, but the men could not work without light; there is the country mark remaining upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. That is common to all Dantzick timber? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it the W which is chipped away? - A. Yes, and the under part of the C.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is the W chopped away from the C? - A. I have not exactly measured.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any space between this which you suppose to be a C, and the W, which remains unchopped? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabout is it marked? - A. Near the contents.</p>
               <p>Q. When it comes into the river, it is given to the person who tows it, and he puts his mark to it,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310065"></xptr>and the mark of the ship, which was P. the contents are marked ten or fifteen see: from the end.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this mark near the contents to be seen that it is cut out? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the contents of the timber? - A. It was one hundred and ten feet, that is cut out likewise.</p>

               <p>(Mr. John Humpbries proved the executors' names.) Q. (To Mason.) Had you any Dantzick timber on your whars on the 1st of March? - A. We had in the river, fastened to some trees.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the particular dimensions of that timber? - A. Yes; I have measured it since I found it: the dimensions are fifty feet three inches, eighteen and a quarter by seventeen three eights.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What is the scantling? - A. Eighteen and a quarter by seventeen three eights, but the odd inches are never taken in; I found the contents one hundred and ten feet, two inches, nine twelfths, which corresponded with the piece lost, and the piece that was advertised on the 2d of March.</p>

            , Esq.</p>
               <p>Q. Those warehouses require large timber? - A. Yes; it will not do less than from sixteen to eighteen inches square; it was designed for girders.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of the 2d of March, had you seen this timber fastened in the way that has been described? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The next day, in consequence of any information you received from Garnswaithe, did you go any where? - A. Yes, to Mr. Wheeler's saw-pit, in Hancock-yard, White-friars, that was on the Saturday in the forenoon; I saw one Diamond, a sawyer, there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand who Diamond was? - A. Yes; I took his address, and his name, from himself, because I believed him to be the thief; he was a sawyer employed by the Wheelers, and has been generally employed by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the timber there, according to your judgement, that you had lost? - A. I think it necessary to describe the saw-pit: it has the appearance of being originally a coach-house, inclosed by a wall on each side, and the front by doors, so that the doors were obliged to be open that the sawyers might see to cut it; I examined the timber very particularly, and I found the marks had been chopped out almost entirely, and that they had very carefully daubed it over with mud; and I am sure of it for this reason, that I washed one part of it off, and then it appeared to have been done very lately; where it had been crossed by the saw it was very carefully robbed over with mud, but not so very carefully but I could distinguish the glimpse of the fresh cross cut; I then proceeded to Mr. Wheeler's, in consequence of information I had received from Diamond, and I found Mr. Joseph Wheeler; I told him that I came up in consequence of a piece of timber being in his saw-pit, and I insisted upon seeing a bill of parcels where he got it from; he said, he did not know he had such a piece of timber; I told him it was very extraordinary he should have so large a piece of timber upon his premises and not know it; and, moreover, when the men who were cutting it said, it was by his order that they were cutting it for arris-rails, for fencing, which was very improper to cut such a piece of Dantzick timber for arris-railing; he made answer, upon recollection, that he had been speaking to a Mr. Smithwaite about some timber, and he said, perhaps it might become from him, who, by-the-by, had been a timber-merchant of a few months; nothing more passed between Mr. Wheeler and I, but knowing Mr. Smithwaite, I went to him within a few hours.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they cutting it when you saw them? - A. They were cutting it into planks for arris-railing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this timber a proper thing for that sort of railing? - A. No; in the first place, it costs a great deal more money; and in the next place, there is more sawing in it, which greatly adds to the expence.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other conversation with

               <p>Q. When did you ever see the other Wheeler? - A. Not till he was taken up to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that that was the timber that belonged to Mr. White, that was fastened to the trees? - A. The greatest reason that strikes me is, that there is the appearance of a C. which C. I believe, I made with my own hands, and for a very particular reason.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Is Dantzick timber fastened to the pales by a staple, or by the timber itself, like Memel? - A. With a staple.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Had you a bill of parcels with this timber? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you examined your account of the dimensions with the bill of parcels? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it correspond? - A. It does, within two inches and nine twelfths; I made that mark myself,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310066"></xptr> for a particular reason; it did not correspond with the sample that we intended, and being frosty weather I did not mark it near the contents as usual, but near the end as a private mark, in case it should go adrift, that I should be able to identify it, which is a very unusual thing to do, I marked it within a foot.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Whenever you measure your timber you mark the contents? - A. It is always marked by the measurer employed by Government.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the end does he mark it? - A. From ten to twenty feet; there is no exact rule for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you, from the spot where the contents were placed, judge what was the size of the timber from the mark of the name? - A. I cannot.</p>

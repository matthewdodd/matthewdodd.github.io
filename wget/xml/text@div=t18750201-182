                  </hi>. I live at 44, Barclay Road, Walham Green, and am of no occupation—I first knew Beardsell in the beginning of October, 1873—I was negotiating with him as a partner, and there was a verbal agreement, which was never carried out, because he became bankrupt and I lost my money—he introduced me to McCorkell in October, 1873, who said that he was a gentleman from Jamaica and had got a Government concession for raising Port Royal—he showed me a document, and I drew out this other document with him—I negotiated with him with reference to bringing out a company for the raising of Port Royal, which is submerged—at the end of March, 1874, I took four unfurnished rooms on the second floor at 8, Queen Victoria Street—I supplied the furniture, and the name of McCorkell &amp; Co. was painted up about the end of the first week in April—I had nothing to do with anybody but McCorkell—he was to pay half the rent, which was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and his half of the furniture, which cost about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got credit for the furniture, and when it was brought in I applied to McCorkell for his portion but could get no money—I asked him in the beginning of April for security for the rent and furniture and' he eventually agreed to give me over some chocolate which he had bought—I have never been in New South Wales—I did not hear Beardsell say that I was their client from New South Wales—I was aware how the chocolate had been obtained—it was my manager who introduced him to the firm—Beard<lb></lb>sell mentioned Williamson Brothers as a reference—they were friends of mine—he did not refer to them with my permission, but I had previously introduced him to Mr. Williamson, and he knew him as a friend coming to my office—the chocolate was transferred to me as security for the rent, and it was arranged that instead of paying for half of the furniture they should pay 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a quarter for the hire of the furniture and that they should go out at Midsummer—they owed me 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for furniture, and I got about 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the chocolate—it went to the Docks by my directions—I have never received the balance—they left the office at Quarter Day and went up to the third floor.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SEBJEANT SLEIGH</hi>. I was introduced to McCorkell by Beardsell—I had no office at that time, I was in negotiations for a partnership with Beardsell, and my introduction to McCorkell was not in reference to the concession—my business was as a mercantile man, an agent in procuring capital, and financing things, and so forth—my introduction to McCorkell was not in reference to the Port Royal matter or to the Hun<lb></lb>garian mines, it was merely as a friend; I had known him all my life, he had been at school with my brother and I frequently heard of him—I undertook to endeavour to procure capital for working the Hungarian mines for McCorkell—he brought Mr. McEwen there specially to see me, and represented that the mines were McEwen's, and that capital was necessary to carry on the operations—I was spoken to to assist in carrying the project out—Bearilsell's office was at 7, Ironmonger Lane—that was not the office on which "McCorkell &amp; Co." was painted, it was six months later, at Lady Day, that that office was taken—I went to the landlord of the rooms is Victoria Street about taking them and a lease was granted to me—I do not know that it was at my request that McCorkell's name was painted up, but I told him that I could not have my own name painted up; I was not going to trade—I do not call these mercantile matters, I call them</p>

               <p>financial matters—I did not want to have anything to do <hi rend="italic">with</hi> buying and selling goods—the Lead Mining Company was one of those which I was endea<lb></lb>vouring to finance—I promised to assist McCorkell in getting up a company for raising Port Royal, and taking out the valuables and treasures—McEwen was represented to me as a gentlenman having large property in Hungary, and I made enquiries and found that it was so—I have no doubt about it—it is worth a considerable amount—I assisted in drawing up this prospectus it was a speculation, but it was very likely to be successful—this order to deliver the chocolate to Pewtress &amp; Co. is signed by me—it was handed to me by McCorkell and Beardsell, both together, it is Beardsell's writing—Scalski's name was painted up immediately McCorked's name was painted out—that was done at the June quarter, but it was painted on the. Third floor in September—I do not remember that McCorkell expressed himself in very strong and indignant terms about Beardsell obtaining the chocolate, or that he said that he would not allow his name to remain on the doorpost any longer, but I will not undertake to swear that he did not—I do not remember anything of the kind, but to the best of my belief it did not occur—I believe Mr. Scalski was present at the interview, and I wish I knew where to find him—my furniture was seized eventually for Scalski's rent—I transferred it to him when I left the place, and he did not pay me—he was accepted as tenant in my place by the Insurance Company—I sold the chocolate as soon as I could, two or three days after I became, possessed of it.</p>

               <p>St. Helen's—on 5th May I received this memorandum from Mr. Fell giving me an order from McCorkell &amp; Co. for 1,000 sacks, in consequence of which I sent them to Pewtress and sent this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to McCorkell's office as requested—the terms were fourteen days after delivery and the amount was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I afterwards called at Queen Victoria Street and offered to take the goods back as I could not get my money—I have never received anything. (<hi rend="italic">An order from the witness to Pewtress &amp; Co. to hold the sacks was here put in, also a letter dated</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th June from McCorkell &amp; Co. to Harkness &amp; Co., which stated "The party to whom we have sold the bags complains of them not being equal to sample, and claims of the sum of</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for re<lb></lb>moval, the bags have been in frequent use before and are many of them totally unserviceable.

                  </hi>. I live at 43, Commercial Road, Peckham, and am ship<lb></lb>ping agent for Elliott, Hinchliffe, &amp; Sons, of Leeds—in June and July last I also represented another firm at Brampton Mills—I have known Beardsell several years—I saw him in May last and he said "I am buyer to McCorkell &amp; <hi rend="italic">Co.</hi>" and that that firm was established to do shipping business, especially to Hungary, that Mr. McEwen was a large land owner in Hungary, that his property consisted of mines of chrome ore, lying on the surface, which had been surveyed at a cost of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and were estimated to be worth 110,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and that he would pay 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the concern, but he could not do so till the 1st of October, as it would be realised on the chrome ore, which had to be brought to England for sale—I asked him who McEwen was—he said that he lately had an office in Lombard Street, and said "You know, that financial man"—I said "I don't know him"—he said "The fact is the Hungary business is only a snail slice of what his means are," and he gave me references—those statements cover three or four interviews, and McCorkell was present at one of them—Beardsell told me at one interview that McCorkell had been a Justice of the Peace at Jamaica and had a concession from the. Govern<lb></lb>ment there with reference to digging up Port Royal—he gave me this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187502010033"></xptr>
               <p>prospectus about it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said that McCorkell was a partner in the firm for the purposes of the concession, but McCorkell was not present—I mentioned the firm of Elliott., Hinchliffe &amp; Co., of Leeds, and Beardsell said that if I could get him a couple of sets of patterns he would send them to his agent at Pesth, in Hungary, but he would not order until he had the patterns—that was in May, I think—I gave him some samples about 5 in. by 3 in., which could easily be sent to Hungary by post—he said that McEwen was very well known at Pesth, which would very much influence the business—an order was sent to Leeds by letter, and on the 18th of August I saw Beardsell and McEwen together at their office, which was then moved up to the third floor—I went to them on purpose to get McEwen's responsibility with regard to payment, and I said that we could not execute the order till we had made McEwen personally responsible—this memorandum was drawn out at my suggestion, and I saw McEwen sign it—the substance of it is Beardsell's writing—I was constantly there deciding whether the references were satisfactory—McCorkell was the head of the firm—a partnership agreement was completed—it was not shown to me, but they spoke of it and said that 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was mentioned in it—on the 8th of September I wrote to my principals, and I know that one parcel of goods was delivered at Turner's, the packers in Barge Yard—this is the invoice. (<hi rend="italic">This referred to nine, pieces of cloth, amounting to</hi> 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) Beardsell instructed me in September to forward other parcels from the same samples—Mr. Corkell was present—they said nothing about the partnership being cancelled on 1st September, I never knew it till. 15th November after they were in custody—a third parcel of goods was sent about 18th September, and this is the invoice. (<hi rend="italic">This was for</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">for three pieces of cloth.</hi>) I received the order from Beardsell, in McCorkell's presence—I do not think we received any other orders—I called several times in October and saw Beardsell—he said that he was not ready to pay me, and in fact it was not due till November, because the goods were de<lb></lb>livered late—I reminded him that we had a special arrangement for payment in October and I could not make' any alteration in it, he must write direct to the firm. (<hi rend="italic">A letter from Beardsell to Hincheliffe &amp; Sons was here put in, stating that the amount would not be due till November, as explained to Mr. Page.</hi>) From the middle to the end of October I called constantly at the office, till one day at the end of October I found it closed, and on another day I went and the name of McCorkell was taken out and Alexander McEwen put up—I found no one there connected with the firm—I afterwards met Beardsell in the street and requested him to come to my office with McEwen, which he did—I wanted a settlement of the account and to know what arrangement they were going to make—Beardsell said that it should be settled in a few days, that McEwen's money would be realised shortly and we need not have any fear-two days after that I discovered that the goods had been pawned—they both called again at my office on 5th or 6th November, and Beardsell told Mr. Crier and myself, that McEwen would be prepared to meet the amount in a few days, and that Hinchcliffe &amp; Smith, of Manchester, had agreed to accept a first charge, upon the matter coming into a solicitor's hands, for payment of their account—I told him that that would not suit, and that we had discovered that the goods had been pawned—Beardsell said "I am astonished, you have sprung a mine-upon me, I sold the goods in the ordinary course of business and if you saw our books you would find them invoiced to Crevey &amp; Co., of Friday Street"—I did not name any particular parcel of goods that had been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187502010036"></xptr>
               <p>pawned—Bcardsell said "They were sold very much against my wish to Crevey &amp; Co. by McCorkell, I am afraid we shall never get our money and McEwen will be the loser; if you wait you will get your money, but it is not possible to get blood out of a stone. Mr. McEwen's papers are in the hands of Morgan &amp; Alsop, of Cannon Street, and they would not detain them for four or five months unless there was something in them. Mr. McEwen is so much vexed with the delay that he has withdrawn them and put them into somebody else's hands"—that was on 3rd November—on 11th November I met Beardsell in Gutter Lane and told him that warrants would be applied for if we found out any more about the goods—he said that no manufacturer with any sense in his head would go to the expense of prose<lb></lb>cuting a man after having lost 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to the solicitors several times to see the agreement, and asked to see Mr. Godfrey, but never saw him—Beardsell took me there, but he did not show me any agreement—Beardsell asked if there was an agreement, and they said that there was, and told me the terms of it, and about the 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had not on 3rd November ascertained as a fact where the goods were, but at the end of the same week I ascertained that they were at Attenborough's, after which I applied for warrants at the Mansion House—I never held out to any of the prisoners that proceedings would not be taken, on the contrary, they were told distinctly before I knew that the goods were at Attenborough's that if once the warrants were applied for nothing could stop it—neither Mr. Crier, or I suggested that they should pay any money—the Mansion House was first mentioned on 1st November by Mr. Crier—previous to November 2nd I met Beardsell in Walbrook and asked him how it occurred that McCorkell's name was taken down and McEwen's put up—he said that McCorkell's name was very little use to him, that it had been a drag upon him was his expression—this is the statement of our firm—it contains all the three deliveries. (<hi rend="italic">The total of the three was</hi> 168<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) I saw McEwen sign this letter, "Elliott Hinchcliffie &amp; Co. Gentlemen,—I beg to confirm any transactions you may enter into with Messrs. McCorkell &amp; Co., of which firm I am a partner—I should have written to this effect before, but have been absent on the Continent, Alexander McEwen"—this pencil memorandum is one of those which were left in my office by Beardsell about November 5th. (<hi rend="italic">This stated "I have seen Mr. McCorkell who will bring C. &amp; Co. to anchor</hi>") I did not then know of my own knowledge where the goods were pawned—at the end of July or the beginning of August I borrowed 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Beardsell—I don't suppose the others know anything about it—I gave six references for McCorkell &amp; Co., but the only goods supplied on my reference were to Hinchcliffe &amp; Smith of Manchester—some were sent to Robinson &amp; Clay, but not in my reference—I asked for patterns to send to Hungary, I did not see them again—there is nothing unusual about that—the Bampton Company did not supply any goods.</p>

The order for Hungary was sent to Hinchcliffe's, but part of it was not executed—I have known Beardsell a very long time, but not twenty years—during all that time he has borne an exceedingly good character, and I still say that of him—he was in business before as Naldre, Beardsell &amp; Jackson, and failed—I knew that at the time I was dealing with him—his bankruptcy was five years before—I did not know that he had taken upon himself the obligations of his partners, nor do I know it now, I have no means of knowing it—he bore a high commercial character as to knowledge of business—I made enquiries about McEwen and McCorkell</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187502010037"></xptr>
               <p>and went with Beardsell to Mr. Godfrey's office and saw a clerk about McEwen bringing 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the firm—that representation was confirmed as far as was possible but nothing was shown to me—I could not get to see any docu<lb></lb>ment—I have not since seen the agreement and the documents about McEwen's property—I not only supplied goods but gave references to other people, and I should not have done that unless I believed the representations thoroughly—the last time I saw any of the prisoners was on 11th November, when I saw Beardsell, and on the 12th he was taken in custody—I had been with the attorney's clerk on the 2nd or 3rd to the Mansion House to apply for a warrant—and I subsequently went again and obtained it—I did not tell Beardsell I had applied for a warrant—he had told me a week or ten days previously that no Magistrate would grant a warrant, and when I met him in the street I said that we had applied for the warrant and it appeared to me that it would be granted—it had been granted at that time, but it is not likely that I was going to tell him that—he only missed the second appoint<lb></lb>ment, he came on the 3rd and again on the 4th, and McEwen with him—I think I saw him again on the 10th—he came to me twice with McEwen about settling the matter—Mr. Crier was with me on two occasions, but it was not in my office, it was in the street, it was on the 3rd and 4th—after I had been to the Mansion House on the 3rd, I asked him on the 6th to settle the account, but I did not ask him to do so after the warrant was granted—I cannot say whether if he had settled it on the 4th nothing more would have been heard of this, but my impression is that we should not have pressed the matter further, and if he had paid the money he could have done what he liked with the goods—Beardsell told me that he could not pay till October 1st, because the money was coming in then or shortly afterwards—he told me after that and up to the middle of October that the money had not come in yet, but that they were expecting it every day—before the first parcel of goods was sent he said that they were not ready in time and he would cancel the order—the value of that parcel was about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he might have had them if he had not cancelled it, in a week or ten days—it was that which made the impression on my mind as to the respectability of the firm—I was a fortnight before I obtained an actual order for the goods—I asked for an order before that, I did not know how long it would take for the order to come from Hungary—Beardsell said that the order would be over directly and that they should then go on with orders every week—he did not say that he did not wish to give me an order till October, had he received the goods in May I should have allowed the payment to be made in October, provided my principals were willing—if he had given the order a fortnight before, I should have executed it, subject to my principals—I had sent an order to the North in August from McCorkell &amp; Co. which was not executed—I asked for the order two or three days before I got it—he gave me a reference to the Mexican Consul.</p>

About five days I think elapsed between my going in the first instance to the Mansion House, and my sub<lb></lb>sequently going and obtaining the warrants—I had seen Beardsell three times in the mean time, or it may have been only two—I was not in a position to take the money if it had been forthcoming—Mr. Crier was not with me at all the interviews, he did not go with me to the Mansion House—I saw him after I had been to the Mansion House on the first occasion, and twice after<lb></lb>wards before I obtained the warrant, and Beardsell three times—my inter<lb></lb>views with Beardsell were not to tell him that I had been to the Mansion House, but to get the money.</p>

I was not aware of that"—he said that he had sold the goods to Crevey &amp; Co. in the ordinary way of business, and if Creveys had done anything wrong he should bring them to book—on the 11th of November I obtained a warrant at the Mansion House, and after McCorkell and McEwen had been taken in custody, Martyn who had been only summoned, called at the office half an hour before the hearing—he said that he was quite innocent, that he had been employed by McCorkell and others, and he wished to get himself cleared, as he wanted to make a statement—he did so, and I took it down. <hi rend="italic">By</hi>

He told me it was only a temporary loan they wanted, and the goods would be got out again in a few days. I thought them highly respectable people and did it without any risk. Mr. McCorkell said this McEwen was worth property abroad to several thousands and a very rich man. I said ho had better do it himself. He said he would feel obliged if I would do it, and he would pay me for my trouble 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent. on the amount advanced. I said if the goods were his own and it was all straightforward I would do it. I assented. He went with me to the packers in Barge Yard. He asked Mr. Turner to give the goods over to this gentleman. I fetched the cart from Maggs on Dowgate Hill. I went back alone with the cart and the goods were put into the cart. McCorkell told me to pawn them at Attenborough's. I told the boy to drive to Temple Bar. I met him there. I told him to drive to Catherine Street, Strand. I asked the pawnbroker, Sayers, to make a loan on them. They would not take them in. I then told the boy to drive to Attenborough's, in Charlotte Street. The goods were taken out of the cart-; about nine pieces. The pawnbroker advanced 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on two tickets for three months. He gave me the 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and tickets, which I took to McCorkell.

                  </hi>. I am agent for Hinchliffe &amp; Smith, of Manchester, manufacturers—my office was at 3, Carey Lane—in the first week in August I met Beardsell, whom I had known for some time, in Cheapside—he asked me what business I was in—I said that I represented one or two manufac<lb></lb>turers—he asked me what class of goods, I told him and he said that he thought he could do business with me—he said I am buying for a very, re<lb></lb>spectable house in the city, William McCorkell &amp; Co.—he afterwards gave me a call and asked my terms, I told him, and he said "One of our firm, Mr. McEwen, is a very wealthy man, and in October he will be placing 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the firm, but till then they have not much means at command, but I will give you satisfactory references"—he spoke of mines in Hungary worth some<lb></lb>thing like 80,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which was shortly to he realised—he gave me a verbal order for some patterns, and on the next day Mr. Hinchliffe happening to be in London he went with me to see the references—we went first, I think, to Mr. Page, who told us that his foreman had made enquiries about them, and we were both satisfied—this is the first order given to us (<hi rend="italic">dated September</hi> ll<hi rend="italic">th</hi>) it amounts to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I forwarded those goods to Turner, the packer, to the order of McCorkell &amp; Co.—they gave me a second order which amounted to 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. one portion was sent from my place and the other portion from Manchester, and the two formed the one order for 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but my goods went to Swan's the packers, not to Turner's—as the money coming into the firm was not to arrive till October, the terms arranged were for payment to be made, I think, somewhere about 14th October—the next order was for 115 pieces of drill, value 127<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the invoice, it is dated September 11th—they were sent to Swann also—I also had other dealings with the defendants and was a purchaser of goods from them—I purchased three pieces of Melton from them on 23rd September and four pieces of deerskin on 6th September, which came to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., this is the invoice—I also bought of them 115 pieces of drill on 18th September, which came to 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., of which this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the invoice—that last parcel were the goods of my principals, Hinchliffe &amp; Smith—the patterns were submitted to me and I said that I had a customer who I thought would buy them—I submitted them to him and he bought them—his name is Judd—he was then in-business and I knew nothing against his character then—the goods arrived on the 12th and I purchased them on the 18th—he agreed to buy them on a certain con<lb></lb>dition which I accepted—when Beardsell offered me the first parcel of goods he said "I want to go down to Manchester and I shall want you to lend me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" I agreed to do so, that was part and parcel of my contract—those were not the goods of my principals—Beardsell represented that the drills were for shipping and that McCorkell was going to take them to Jamaica with him, in fact they were not fit for the home trade—I paid for the goods with these cheques. (<hi rend="italic">One of these was for</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l., another for</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l., two for</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and there was an I O U to Beardsell for</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)

               <p>bought them, but he did not ask me to get my principals to take them back; he said "Can't you take them yourself and find a customer," and he may have said "or I shall have to send them back"—I bought them at a profit of 2 1/2 per cent. and in selling them I made a profit on them—I sold the greater part of them to Emdell subsequently; originally I sold them to Judd, but he did not carry out the arrangement—I only took one parcel of goods that came from Hinchliffe &amp; Smith's, about 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I was to pay him 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or more—I owe them about 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now—I am charging these men criminally with obtaining these goods and owing them in respect of these very goods—I saw the agreement at Mr. Godfrey's office and satisfied myself that it was genuine—I believe that that property is in existence belonging to McEwen, I have made inquiries since and have no doubt of it—I have seen the documents—I also went to Mr. Boddington—I have had very little conversation with McEwen.</p>

Cole, of Essex, Street, but I know nothing of them—I do not know Mr. Brown, of Finsbury Place, I have not made inquiries about him or about Bell &amp; Crowder—the prisoners sold the goods to me at a profit beyond what they were to pay to my principals and I sold them again at a profit to myself—I am not now agent to Messrs. Hinchliffe, I was so at the time of the last trial—I received a letter last week by which I was dismissed—I have known Beardsell many years, but never heard anything against him—I knew that he had had the misfortune to fail, but I do not know that it was in consequence of taking upon himself the liabilities of his former firm.</p>

I am a partner in the firm of Hinchliffe &amp; Smith, of Manchester, manufacturers of cotton goods—in August last Mr. Lyde was our agent in London—I had to come to town and I went to his office in Carey Lane and saw Beardsell there—Lyde introduced him to me as the buyer for McCorkell and McEwen, who had established themselves in Queen Victoria Street as shippers—Beardsell said that McEwen was a man of large means, and had properly in Hungary, estates consisting of mines, and that he had thousands of tons of chrome ore ready for shipment; that McCorkell was a gentleman who had recently returned from Jamaica, and held a high position there as a Justice of the Peace, and that McEwen had engaged to bring into the business 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on October 1st—I asked him for references, he referred me to the solicitor who had drawn up the deed of partnership, Mr. Godfrey, and to Mr. Boddington, of the Lombard, and Mr. Page, the agent for Elliot Hinchliffe—I asked him if they could not pay cash, or what terms—he said that they would not be able to pay cash in this case, as they would have no working capital till after October 1st, and a different arrangement was made, but the undertaking was that it was to fall due in the ordinary course—they gave me no order on that occasion—I went to Mr. Boddington, at the Lombard Exchange, and afterwards to Mr. Godfrey, and saw, I believe, one of the clerks, who told me that a deed had been executed—I then went to Mr. Page, who said that it was all right, he had known Mr. Beardsell some time—on the following morning Page told' me that he had sent an order and he believed it would be executed, and I told our agent to let them have what goods they wanted out of the stock—after the parcel had gone I wrote this letter to McCorkell &amp; Co. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 8th September</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">stating that thirty pieces of serge had been for<lb></lb>warded to Turner &amp; Co. to their order, and that if goods were sent in future to Messrs.

I knew Beardsell slightly about three years ago—I met him in June last in Broad Street—I was out of a situation, and he said "McCorkell &amp; Co. want a clerk; you may as well come down to Queen Victoria Street—I called there and saw McCorkell and Beardsell on the 2nd floor—they asked me to write a letter, which I did—I got a post<lb></lb>card shortly afterwards and went to 8, Queen Victoria Street, where I found that the name had been removed from the second to the third floor they engaged me as clerk at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and I went there about the 13th of July—this copy letter-book was in use when I went there, but no other books—in about two months a ledger, journal, stock-book, and cash-book were procured—this is the day-book—it contains the entries of the daily transactions—they are all to be found on two pages and a little more—the the first two entries are in Beardsell's writing and the last one mine—the first two entries refer to Mr. Alexander, of 41, Houndsditch—I know him by sight—he sometimes came twice a week, and sometimes not at all—this entry purports to be a sale of goods to him, but I know nothing of the transaction—I never saw any money pass between Alexander and the firm—the next entry refers to Lyde &amp; Co., and the next to Underwood, who came there several times—Beardsell posted Alexander's entries; Lyde's and Underwood's are in my writing—those three are the only entries in the ledger—here are eight entries in the stock-book, the first of which refers to H. McGill &amp; Co., of Leeds, three to Hinchliffie &amp; Son, of Leeds, three to Hinchlifife, of Manchester, and one to Robinson &amp; Clay—the stock-book is the entry of goods brought into the firm; the first entry in it is Beardsell's and the rest mine—I copied the entries from the invoices—I saw Martyn there on an average three times a week—I heard McEwen tell McCorkell to tell Beardsell that he would have nothing to do with the cloth business as it was not his business—that was about a week before the close of the office—in the beginning of October, the last week I was there, I lent Beardsell some money—I asked McEwen if I should lend it to Beardsell, and he said that I might trust him up to 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Beardsell sent me to Turner, the packer, to ask if any goods had come from Manchester or Leeds—I came back and told him that there was a sale of goods, but he did not know whether it was for him or not, and he went out shortly after<lb></lb>wards—McCorkell was there nearly every day—the office was closed nearly two weeks before I left, during which time I saw the defendants at Deacon's public-house, in the smoking-room—I told Beardsell I did not like to see them there it was hardly respectable—he did nothing there but smoke that I could see—he said that the office would no doubt be open by that time, would I go up and see; and that a distress was put in—I went and</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant.</hi>) On 11th November, I received three warrants upon which I took Beardsell and McEwen in custody on the 12th about noon, at the corner of the Old Jewry and Cheapside—I took them to the station, and found on McEwen a halfpenny, I think, this diary of 1874, these three prospectuses of three mining companies, and this report of the Ewenthal Mining Company—on Beardsell I found a letter from George Fenwick, of Gateshead, two contracts for cloth from Mr. Attenborough, and some memoranda, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money—I afterwards went to McEwen's, lodging at 3, Circus Place, Minories—it is a lodging-house—McCorkell called there at 5.30, and I took him there—I went to McCorkell's lodging, 3, Harleyford Street, Kennington, where he occupied one room on the first floor back—they are small houses—I produce a draft agreement of partner<lb></lb>ship which I found at McEwen's lodging—I afterwards went to the third floor at Queen 8, Victoria Street, and secured some letters and papers from the housekeeper's wife which have been given up, and which include the books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and the letter-book, also this copy of a writ issued by Mr. Collins in an action against Powell—this letter dated May 15, addressed to Beard-sell and a letter of 17th July from Portsmouth. (<hi rend="italic">The prospectus of</hi> "<hi rend="italic">the Hungarian Chrome and Iron Company" was put in, to which a map was attached; also the draft agreement dated 12th June</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">which was endorsed cancelled this day by mutual consent 1st September</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">and signed by McCorkell and McEwen, also a copy of a writ at the suit of W.

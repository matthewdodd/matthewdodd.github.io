On the 24th of Jan., about eleven o'clock at night, I met the prisoner in Bishopsgate-street, and, in consequence of what I had heard, I took her in charge—I told her it was for stealing a shawl, a pair of stays, and a gown—she said she had not been living with Mr. Garcia—I said she go to the station—on the way there she said she had taken the grown, that the scarf was given to her, and that she knew nothing of the stays.</p>

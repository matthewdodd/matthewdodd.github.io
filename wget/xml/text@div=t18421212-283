                  </hi>. I am a starch-manufacturer and live in Holborn.

Q.</hi> Have you your books here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not know that I have made more mistakes in my accounts than other people are liable to—there was a sum paid by a Mr. Law, which I imagined had not been paid to me, but on reference to my books I found it—I said at first I had received none of it, but my books were correct—the prisoner left me in the middle of Nov.—he was in the service of myself and one Saunders up to the 26th of July, when we dissolved partnership—I think this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is Mr. Saunders's handwriting—the prisoner did not leave me on the 26th of Oct.—I was in constant communication with him when he was at my counting-house.</p>

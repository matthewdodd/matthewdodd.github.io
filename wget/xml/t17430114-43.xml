            . There was a Copper-Boiler stole out of the Ship, called The Ann, which I was Mate of at Deptford , the 1st of October; it was an uncommon Copper, it is near an Inch thick, it was a Copper Teach which they boil their last Sugar in, in the West-Indies; we brought it over upon Freight; the Prisoners worked on board the Ship three Days, but they did not work on board when the Copper was stole.</p>

            . I live in East-Smithfield. On the 13th of December, I saw Conwon coming along with a large Piece of Copper upon his Back, Friend, said I, did you come honestly by it? he made use of a great many aggravating Words, and said, He was going with it to Mr Whitlock's, in Houndsditch ; then I thought he might be that Person's Servant , and let him go; I thought it was but a little Way to Houndsditch and intended to go and watch them, there was another Man had another Piece; I watched them, and the Prisoners pitch'd upon Justice Dennet's Bulk and call'd Coach, and agreed, for two Shillings and a full Pot of Beer, to go to the Seven Dials, then I thought I was right in my Suspicion, and acquainted Justice Dennet with it; he sent for a Constable, we carried them both into his House and he examined, them seperately; Bragg said, It was handed over a Ship's Side to them, and Conwon said, He found it in a Street near Shadwell-Market; the two Pieces of Copper appeared<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174301140037"></xptr> to be lately cut - they are now in the Possession of Justice Dennet - Conwon told me first, that he bought them, and afterwards, that he found them.</p>

I had two guineas in a small canvas bag, and some silver in another canvas bag, I was not above four yards from the woman when I missed my money; I went to the woman, and searched her, I could not find it, and the watchman was coming by, calling twelve, and the watchman came and said, let me see if I cannot find it on her; he searched her, and found the two guineas and the bag upon her; I was present at the time; the watchman took out the money into his hand, and took her to the watch-house; I told him, before he shewed the money to the night constable, that if there was any more than two guineas it was not my property; the constable has the money.</p>
               <p>You are sure you did not make her a present of this bag and money? - No, my Lord, I did not.</p>

               <p>Did you examine the contents of the bag? - No, not till I gave it to the officer of the night, the prosecutor told me if there was any more than two guineas in the bag, it was not his property: when the bag was opened, there was the two guineas and nothing else.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. I swore a man so, with the book before him, and I stated it afterwards to all the Judges, I remember perfectly well there were a set of thieves coming through Scotland, and they made a general sweep, and then came into a place called Long Town, which is the first parish in England, the Scotchmen found these people at a public house, and they were committed to Carlisle gaol, and they were tried before me at the assizes, the prosecutor objected to being sworn, and I sent to Mr. Lockhart, and he told me that there was a particular sect in Scotland, that would not take the oath by touching the book or kissing: he took his oath by holding up the hand, and I afterwards stated it to the Judges, and their opinion was with me.</p>

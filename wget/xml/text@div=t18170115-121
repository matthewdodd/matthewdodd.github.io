The prisoner came to our shop on Saturday evening about six o'clock, I served him with some jelly and gave him a silver spoon to eat it with, when he had done eating it, he sat the glass down with a pewter spoon in it, the silver spoon was gone, we have no pewter spoons in the house, he put sixpence on the counter for the jelly, I run round the counter, I had observed the spoon was changed, I took him by the collar and would not let him go out; I held him till the constable, who was passing, came in, I saw him drop the silver spoon in the window at the time the constable took him.</p>

I was coming by at the time, I heard a noise and saw Hannon collar the prisoner, he was just under the door, I went in and said that I was an officer, she took the spoon out of the pastry, it might easily be dropped there, and said he had stolen it, I took him into the back room, and saw him move his left hand, and I picked this pewter spoon(producing it), off the fire; I found 5s. 6d. on him.</p>

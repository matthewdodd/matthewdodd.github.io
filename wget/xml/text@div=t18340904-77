             - the prisoner came into our employ on the Monday previous to the 16th of August, and on that day we sent him with a pair of iron chases to Mr. Hopkinson - I gave him 12s. 6d. in money to give change for a sovereign - he did not return - I met him afterward - he said he did not know what he had done with the chases - he had no money - I went with him to one place, but could not find them - he was not drunk when he left me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you not sent him to Mr. Cope's in Cumberland-street? A. Yes; and he brought me back 14s. 2d. for a pair of chases: but this pair Mr. Cope would not have - he returned between eleven and twelve o'clock - I went to a public-house with the prisoner, and had bread and cheese and two or three pots of beer - I believe I was only in one public-house - I do not know the sign - I was sober - I do not know what I paid - I will not swear I was not in another public house or two - when I found the prisoner next day he was in Shoreditch, but my partner found him in bed.</p>

            . I live in Cumberland-street. On the evening of the 16th of August I heard a noise with my wife, my lodger, and the prisoner - I went out, and the prisoner was gone - he had left this printing chase against the wall, and I took them to Mr. Cope's.</p>

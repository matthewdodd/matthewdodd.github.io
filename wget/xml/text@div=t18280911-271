On the 17th of August, about two o'clock, he was leaving my shop with some dirty linen; I searched his bundle, and found a pair of child's double soled boots; I asked him how he came to put them there - he said he had an order for them on the Sunday before, from a neighbour, I think he said, next door to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had he not before that sold two pairs of boots and shoes to a gentleman? A. He never took but one pair from me, by coming and saying he wanted a pair for a gentleman. I did not want to get his indentures cancelled - it was not because he was an apprentice from a school, and the consent of the Trustees was wanting, that I did not have it done; I do not know Mr. Hudson; the prisoner said he had a pair of boots ordered from him, and he was taking them to him.</p>

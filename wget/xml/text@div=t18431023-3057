                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live in Lyall-row, Red Lion Market. About half-past nine o'clock at night, on the 14th of Oct., I saw the prisoner and a girl about seventeen or eighteen years old, standing out<lb></lb>side Mr. Morgan's window—the girl spoke to the prisoner, and he went into the shop—she remained outside—she tapped at the window, and gave some sign to the prisoner, and then she went in—I went to the window, and saw Mr. Morgan showing the girl a blue shawl—I saw the prisoner come out—he had got hold of the side of his coat—he laughed coming out, ran into the road, and ran as fast as he could—I ran after him—when I got near him he turned the first turning from Old-street, and saw there was some one pur<lb></lb>suing—he threw this cotton between my legs—I took it up, and called, "Stop thief"—I took him and brought him back to the shop—I gave the piece of print to Mrs. Morgan.</p>

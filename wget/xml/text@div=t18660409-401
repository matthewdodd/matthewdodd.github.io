                  </hi>. I am a publisher and newspaper agent, of 135, Salisbury-square—<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi> has been <hi rend="italic">my</hi> clerk about three years—1 had among other customers two gentlemen named Pritchard, of Birmingham, and Atkins, of Brightlingsea, Sussex—the prisoner has never paid over to me two sums <hi rend="italic">of</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">each from Mr. Pritchard, or a sum of</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">received from</hi> Mr. Atkins on 3d February—he has not accounted to me for any of these sums—when I was first before <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Magistrate I was in possession of my cash-book, and I produced it—I missed it on the evening preceding the day <hi rend="italic">to</hi> which the case was adjourned—1 have searched for it in every likely and unlikely place—there were no entries in <hi rend="italic">it of any receipts of these</hi> moneys—assuming the prisoner received them, it was his duty to make entries in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> cash-book, or to have handed the amounts to Mr. Wise—that is the usual course—these two sums to Mr. Pritchard's credit are m the prisoner's writing—they were not entered in the cash-book, and were toot received—there is no date at which he credits Mr. Pritchard with receiving these sums,—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a book</hi>) all these entries of credit are the prisoner's writing, and credit would be made out from the ledger in the usual course of pro<lb></lb>ceeding—in Mr. Pritchard's account there is an interlineation of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. under the date of January 29th—there is another entry of the other 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. dated February 29th—I have got Mr. Atkin's account here (<hi rend="italic">looking at the ledger</hi>) <hi rend="italic">—I have got a credit note here in the prisoner's</hi> writing, and it also appears in the statement.</p>

               <p>statements they are taken from the cash-book—the posting of the cash would not necessarily be his—sometimes he does the posting from the cash-book into the ledger, and sometimes my son, sixteen or seventeen years of ago, or another young man named Absolem—Mr. Wise may if he chooses—the ledger is kept in the counting-house, which is under Mr. Wise's control—he is the general manager—the posting from the cash-book into the ledger is done in the ordinary way—sometimes two do it in that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose Mr. Wise was posting the cash-book and that one of the young men in your employ calls out, "Atkins, Birmingham, February 3d, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Mr. Wise would write it down in the ledger? A. Yes—the folios in the ledger are entered in the cash-book—he would repeat the folio when he was calling over the cash-book—Atkins, Birmingham, might be an entire interlineation—if the prisoner arrived before Mr. Wise in the morn<lb></lb>ing he allowed him to enter it in the cash-book and to hand over the money to him—the credits of cash are given in the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRICHARD</hi>. I am a newspaper agent at Birmingham—I paid these two sums of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I sent up two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes which is a credit to me of the sums having been received in London—this is my account which I have received from Mr. Harrison, showing that I have paid the two sums of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATKINS</hi>. I am a bookseller at Brightlingsea, Sussex—I paid Mr. Harrison and received this credit note afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WISE</hi>. I am manager to Mr. Harrison—this is a memorandum of accounts—it is taken from the ledger—I did not receive the two sums of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on January 29th I received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner did not pay me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 8th February.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you keep the cash-book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do—the greater part of the entries were made in the cash-book by myself; nearly all—it was my duty to make all—Mr. Harrison was aware that somebody else made entries in the cash-book before this case—it was kept in the counting-house, on the desk—it cannot be found—I saw it last on 28th February in the counting-house—I think that was a week after the case was remanded—the prisoner was in custody then, and had been for some time—at that time almost every one in the place had access to the counting-house—a man named Absolem had access to it—I saw it about 10 o'clock in the morning—Mr. Harrison received the amount from me at that time—I am quite sure Mr. Absolem did not take it out of the house after that—it was not taken to my house by anybody—I never saw it in my house—when the entries were made in the ledger, I did not call over the cash-book—I have, not done so for the last two years—sometimes it was called over, and some<lb></lb>times it was not—when it was called over, Absolem called it over, and the prisoner entered it in the ledger—the cash would generally be entered with<lb></lb>out being called over at all—it is simply taken from the cash-book, and entered in the ledger—a customer who sends money from the country has it entered in the cash-book—such large sums as 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be entered in it—I could have no independent knowledge that it was paid—if a person sent a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in a letter, the letter would be thrown away in a waste basket—this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be laid in the desk, and entered in the cash-book before Mr. Harrison came to business, before 10 o'clock—there might be a great number of notes during that time—they are all laid on the desk—if a letter came from Mr. Atkins, simply saying, "I enclose 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," I should be there to open it—if I was not there, the prisoner would do it—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would lay aside till I came—if I was a little late, the prisoner would remain in charge</p>

               <p>of the money in the counting-house—if I went out for a month, the other clerks would come in—if letters came from Prichard and Atkins, they would remain together—the name is put on the corner—if Mr. Harrison was going out for the day, I should be there a little earlier—I swear I entered the money at the time—the cash-book was taken nowhere to my knowledge—I do not know what became of it—the prisoner gave information against a person named Rooper, of his robbing Mr. Harrison—I think that was about two years ago—he is my father-in-law—I think the charge was stealing about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he was discharged—I will not be sure whether I saw him at the police court or not—very likely I did—he did not go with me—I am not certain whether I went away with him—I am not certain whether I met him there—when the prisoner was first brought up, I was told that he had broken a blood-vessel—he was apparently ill.</p>

                  </hi> I am a waiter, of 25, Walbrook Street, Hoxton—on Thursday night, 6th June, at 10.30, I heard screams of "Police! "—I ran up stairs, looked out of the staircase window, and saw the prisoner drop down from the wall of the coffee-room into the street—I opened the private door and ran after him—he was stopped at the bottom of the street—I went and held him, and said, "I know you again"—he said, "I will cripple you if you do not loose me"—I held him till a policeman came up—he said that he should know me again, if it was years to come—I went back to the house and found that a bedroom had been entered and several things taken—the prisoner said that he knew nothing about it.</p>

"and "Police! "and my master came—I told my mistress, and she missed two shawls, a gown, a petticoat, and a waist<lb></lb>coat, which were found on the leads—my window had been open six or seven inches that evening, but when the prisoner was there it was wide open, and the room in confusion.</p>

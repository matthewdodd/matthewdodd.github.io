             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Adcock: On the 29th of December, between the hours of seven and eight, the prisoner, Ogle Williamson, came to me under pretence of changing a small paper bag for a large one, which I exchanged with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. I had seen him frequently before, I knew him by sight; he said he wanted some arrow-root, but he thought ours was not very good, but he might call again if we had not shut up shop when he came back; with that he went out of the shop, and I went up stairs to get some candles for the shop; when I brought the candles into the shop, I saw his face appear through the glass-door; I said to my fellow-servant, that I thought Williamson was the person that took the two glass bottles we had lost three days before.</p>
               <p>Q. He was outside was he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his name? - A. Yes; I knew his name before.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you only knew him by sight? - A. I did not know any more of him; with that, I told my partner we had better put out the lights in the accompting-house, and one of us go on each side of the door, which we did; and in the course of five minutes he opened the door, and came into the shop, and made towards the window; a gentleman came into the shop for some pill-boxes, and he then ran out of the shop directly; as soon as I served the gentleman I went into the accompting-house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090031"></xptr>again, the clock struck eight; I said to my partner, we had better shut up the shop windows; he said, no, stop a few minutes; with that, he came in again directly, and made towards the window, and took the bottle out of the window; we followed him to the door, he held the door on the outside, and we pulled on the inside, till he let go; and as soon as we got out of the door we cried out stop thief; he turned round the corner of Bevis-Marks, and as he ran, he threw the bottle down, and broke it; I then got hold of him, and took him to the shop; I saw him take the bottle.</p>
               <p>Q. When the gentleman went out, did you see him shut the door? - A. The door was shut, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your master any partners? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had a great many pepper-mint bottles besides that? - A. We had only four, they stood in the window together; I cannot say they were all full up to the neck.</p>

             sworn. - On the evening of the 29th of December, the witness, Bird, came to me in the accompting-house, and told me that the prisoner, Ogle Williamson, came to him in the shop to change a bag, and he informed me that he was standing at the glass-door; he told me we had better wait in the accompting-house, and put the lights out, to see whether the prisoner came in again, as we had lost two bottles of pepper-mint before; after waiting a few minutes in the accompting-house, the prisoner came in; a surgeon's young man came in for some pill-boxes, the prisoner ran out again; when I had served the young man, I returned to the accompting-house, at that time the clock struck eight; the witness told me we had better shut the shop up; I told him we had better wait a little longer, and while we were peeping we heard the prisoner open the door, and we saw him come into the shop and take the bottle; as he was taking the bottle, it hit against the other bottle that stood by it, and made a noise, and the witness, Bird, exclaimed, he has got the bottle; we pursued him to the door, he held the door against us on the outside, and when we got the door open the prisoner ran across the street; we pursued him, and called out stop thief; he threw down the bottle in Bevis-Marks, and we both immediately seized him; we then took him to the shop.</p>

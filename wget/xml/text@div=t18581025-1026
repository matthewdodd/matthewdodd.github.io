                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Warren Stormes Hale, and another—they carry on business at Orange-street, Southwark; that is where their manufactory is. On Saturday, 18th September, the old lead which lines the cisterns was being stripped off, for the purpose of new being substituted—the prisoner Tilley was then in the employ of Messrs. Hale &amp; Co., and was at work on the premises—in consequence of something which occurred, I watched Tilley on that day, and another person who was also at work there, named Haines—I saw Haines cut up a piece of lead—I watched Tilley pick up this lead and secrete it within his clothes—I saw him secrete two large pieces—having done so he left the premises, and I followed him to a plumber's shop in Union-street—I saw him go in—while outside the shop, I could see the other prisoner Hagan within—Tilley stopped in the front shop—I saw him take the lead from underneath his frock and deliver it to Hagan, who put it into a recess on the right hand side of the shop—I saw him pass something to Tilley but I could not see whether it was money; whatever it was I saw Tilley put it in his pocket—I was standing close to the door inside—I do not think they saw me previously to this—they then turned round and saw me—Tilley wanted to make his way out, but I would not let him go—I said, "Was not that lead which you took from Mr. Hale's premises?"—he said, "I have taken no lead"—I said, "You have"—I would not let him leave the shop—I then said to Hagan, "I want that lead that this man fetched into your shop"—he said, "You are under a mistake, there was no lead fetched in"—I had my hand on Tilley at that time—I said I would lose my life before I would allow him to escape—Hagan then went and produced the two pieces of lead from a recess in the shop, the place where I had seen him throw them—he said that was all the lead they had in the place—I still had hold of Tilley, and said I would hold him till a policeman came, to give him in charge to—Hagan said I might let him go in the passage as we need not make a row about the door, he could not get through the back way; I then left my hold of him—Hagan took him to the back of the shop—I saw him beckon him towards the left hand side of the shop where there was a step-ladder and he made his escape—a policeman came and Hagan was given into his custody—I assisted to search the premises after that, and found a quantity of lead weighing 7cwt. 1qr. 7lbs.—the two pieces which he threw into the recess, weighed, I should say, 26lbs. or 28lbs., but I do not know.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, A</hi> 474). On Saturday, 18th September, I was called into a shop at 135, Union-street—I there saw Hagan, and took him into custody—the last witness said in Hagan's presence, that a man had come from Mr. Hale's premises with some lead, and he had allowed him to go to the back of the shop, and I was to go and see if he had left the premises, as Hagan said he had not—I searched the shop, and went up the step-ladder to the loft—I could see no one there but Hagan—I further searched the premises, and found some lead.</p>

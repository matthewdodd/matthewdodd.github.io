            . I am a constable. I went in pursuit of the men; when I had got about two hundred yards, I saw the prisoner and another person talking together, by some posts, at the corner of Johnson's-street; I asked my brother watchman if he had seen two men run that way - he said No, and these two immediately started, as hard as they could - they must have heard me ask the question. The other man ran, and the prisoner walked fast away - I immediately collared him, and gave him in charge to the watchman. He said he had been to Kentish-town, looking for work; but at the watch-house he said he met the other two at Camden-town, and joined them as they were crossing the fields, not knowing what they were going about; and that he lived in Kennedy-court, Newton-street, Holborn.</p>

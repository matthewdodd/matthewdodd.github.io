            . I lost a gold ring. I missed it from some part of my house up stairs. I found it again at a pawnbroker's some time ago. I went over accidentally, and saw it in the window. I found it very lately.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner? - Yes; she used to come occasionally when any of the family were ill, and she used to go to my drawers. I thought well of her.</p>
               <p>- MENIZ sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker in petty France, Westminster. I took that ring of the prisoner at the bar the second of February, 1777. I lent her half a guinea on it. Fourteen months after that she came again. I then bought it of her for sixteen shillings in March 1778. Since that time it has been in my window, but I could not meet with a customer for it.</p>
               <p>Did she give any particular account of it when she brought it? - She said it was her own; that it was given her; she has brought very good things sometimes for other people.</p>
               <p>PRISONER'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I found the ring about half a yard from the door, and there was another ring with it of base metal.</p>

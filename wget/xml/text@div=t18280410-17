            . I live at Turnham-green. I was going by Parson's-green with my husband about half-past eight o'clock on Sunday morning, the 2d of March; I observed something in a ditch - there was very deep water in the ditch; I thought at first there was a dog in the water, but as I was waiting for my husband, who stopped behind for a necessary purpose, I perceived that it was the body of a child; it was entirely covered with water; I went back and called my husband - he came and looked, and thought it was a child: we went up into the road, and saw a man - we got him to look, and he said it was a child.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this was out of the road? A. Yes, a little way from the road, in a field; we had gone out of the road, towards <placeName id="t18280410-17-crimeloc119">Parson's-green</placeName>

               <p>Q. Then when you say you went back to the road, you mean the carriage-road? A. We went forward to the carriage-road, and there met a man who is a glass-cutter - he is not here; he went and called a constable: I saw Levick, the constable take the child out of the water; we went with it to his house, and gave our names - it was taken from there to the White Horse public-house, but I did not go there - Levick himself took it out of the water with a rake- I saw him bring it out of his house to take it to the White Horse, but did not go with him. When I saw it on the Monday, before the Coroner I thought it about six weeks old. I have had ten children myself.</p>

            . I am constable of Fulham parish; I took the child out of the water; it was naked; I took it to my own house, to take down the two witnesses' names I afterwards took the same child to the White Horse, public-house: Mr. Holmes, the surgeon, saw it there - I cannot say whether he saw it the same day, but I was present when he saw it on the Monday, and am certain he saw the child which I had taken out of the water; I knew it by the neck being washed; there was dirt about the head - the Jury met on the Monday.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Fulham; I saw this child in the presence of Levick on Monday; I had seen the same child on Sunday; I suppose it was from a month to six weeks old. On the left temple there was a contused wound, not a cut but what is commonly called a bruise - the skin was taken off; I should judge it to be occasioned either by a blow before it was thrown into the water, or by its falling on some stone or hard substance in the water - the injury on the temple was not sufficient, in my judgment, to cause death; the eyes were a good deal suffused with blood, as if they had been very forcibly pressed; in fact the eye-balls were both destroyed in a great measure - I should say they were almost entirely destroyed; I cannot imagine how that could be done unless by the pressure of the hand or fingers - there were no other marks of violence about the child.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no marks of violence about the neck, as if it had been strangled by squeezing? A. None that I could observe; it might have been killed by strangling, but there was no appearance of it externally; squeezing the neck might have caused the appearance in the eye - it might cause the eye-balls to be disturbed, if not entirely destroyed; the child might have been strangled by pressure about the throat, without leaving any external marks. particularly if it had a blow on the head as well. I opened the body after the inquisition; the internal parts were perfectly healthy, except the vessels of the brain and lungs, being overloaded with blood.</p>
               <p>Q. In your opinion, in what way was the life of that child taken? A. I should imagine it to have been strangled by pressure with the hand - it had evidently been strangled before it was thrown into the water, or there would have been a small quantity of water on the lungs, and there was none; I should conceive the child was nearly dead before it was thrown into the water; I am confident it must have been done by pressure about the throat; the contused wound was certainly given before the child died; I saw the child about two o'clock on Sunday for the first time; I had seen the prisoner at the workhouse at Fulham before I saw the child; the first thing I asked her was, if she had been suckling a child lately; she said she had not for two months; I asked her then to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100019"></xptr>let me look at her breasts; she showed me her breasts - I pressed on both her breasts and milk spirted out of both of them; I asked her then if she had not been suckling a child a shorter time than two months, and if she had had a nurse child; she said, No; that she kept her milk a month after her child died, by drawing her breasts, in hopes that she might get a situation as wet-nurse; I then asked her when her child died - she said two months ago, and that it was about a fortnight old; I asked her where it was buried - she said in Mary-le-bone - that it was born on Saffron-hill, but she did not know the name of the people she lodged with, nor did she know the number of the house: she said he child had been baptized at the Spanish chapel, Spanish-place. I asked her who took it to be buried - she said the woman with whom she lodged; she at first said she took it herself to be buried, and some time after, I said, "What, did you take it to be buried a fortnight after you was confined, yourself;" she said, "No, the woman I lodged with took it;" I asked who made the coffin, who was the undertaker - she said an Irishman who lodged in the same house had nailed some pieces of board together, and made a coffin; I asked if she could find the man who did it; she said No, she did not know his name, nor where he lived. I believe this was the principal of the conversation; I do not recollect anything more. She said she had come to that neighbourhood to seek for work; I should think from the appearance of the child that it had been a very short time in the water; it might have been twelve or twenty-four hours, not longer: putrescense had not at all taken place; it was a male child.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I tell you I took the child to be buried? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not say it was born in Chick-lane, Saffron-hill? A. You said Saffron-hill.</p>

             re-examined. I have a bundle of clothes- I received part of them at the White Horse; part from the prisoner and part from the man who found the child's clothes - here are what I received from the prisoner at the White Horse; there is a gown among it which was on her back when I took her - it was changed afterwards; there is only one gown in the bundle - there are no child's clothes in the bundle I which received from her; I received a part of the bundle from the hands of one of the Jury - William Cook was present at the time; Catherine Bartley lives at what is called Parson's-green- it is about a quarter of a mile from where I found the child. After I had taken the child to the White Horse, I went home towards my own house, which is nearly opposite to where I found the child; I did not see the prisoner then - I saw her about a quarter or half-past nine o'clock - it was some little time after I had been home; I saw her walking by the side of the ditch from which the child had been taken, and nearly at the spot from where I had taken it, she appeared to be looking very minutely into the water; after she had been looking into the water, she came on towards the King's road - I then went up to her and asked if she had lost anything, that she was so minutely examining the ditch, she said No; I said I had found something, and I had every reason to believe it belonged to her; she asked what had I found - I said I had found a child, and asked what she had done with the child that she had been seen with last evening; she said "Me a child, I had no child;" and then went on to say that she had a good character - that she had worked at Mrs. Fitch's and at Mr. Parry's the summer before; and that she was going to work at Mrs. Fitch's on the morrow - this was on Sunday; I know there is a Mrs. Fitch at Parson's-green.</p>
               <p>Q. This conversation passed in the road? A. We stood still all the while; she said if I wanted her, I should find her at Mrs. Fitch's to-morrow morning - Mrs. Fitch is a market gardener; she went on - I let her go a little way; the neighbours, being anxious about what had occurred, said I should not do my duty unless I took her into custody; she did not hear that - I then hastened towards her, she was then making her way towards what is called the London road up Parson's-green-lane; I overtook her, and put my hand on her shoulder, she looked round and said what did I want with her; I told her I only wanted her to go back to where she told me she had lodged the night before - she said she would go back, for she had no child; her child was buried - I asked her where it was buried; if she could prove where it was buried - she said it was buried at Mary-le-bone; I asked if it was registered, she said it was, in the name of Johnny Welch, that it had been buried about two months she thought, but she could not say exactly; I asked her where she was delivered - she said at a house on Saffron-hill, but she did not know the number; I asked the name of the people of the house - she said they were gone away, and she did not know the name; I asked her the name of the person who buried the child - she at first said she took it herself to be buried, but she afterwards prevaricated so much I did not ask her further - this was on our way to the workhouse; before we went to the workhouse - I took her to Catherine Bartley's where she said she had lodged the night before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him my child had been buried two months, and had lived a fortnight - that I was brought to bed in Chick-lane.</p>

             re-examined. I saw a woman near that place on Saturday evening, about six o'clock - it was the day before I heard of the child being found; I met the woman when I was in the field, and spoke to her - I said it was rather muddy walking there: she said, "Yes, my dear, it is;" she was close to the ditch, and had passed the place where I was told the child was found: she had on the gown which has been produced; I know it again - she had a large cloak on, which covered all the gown except a bit at the bottom; she had her cloak wrapped entirely round her, and seemed as if she had a child or something under it - I did not see any child, nor hear the voice of one. I left her - she went on first, over the plank - I drove my ducks on after her: she was going away from the ditch, and went up towards Sandyend; it was nearly dark then - it was dusk. I am sure the prisoner is the same woman; I saw her again when the Inquest was sitting - she is the woman I saw by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100020"></xptr>Kneel-brook, which is the name of the place - it is near the ditch.

            . I live opposite to where the child was taken out of the ditch; I sat in my own house in King's-road, and saw it taken out on Sunday morning. I am a bricklayer. On the afternoon of the day before that, the prisoner passed me three times - I am certain she is the woman; I was coming home from work - I first passed her on the road - I then stopped, and she passed me; when I got home I stopped opposite my gate, and she passed me, returning towards London; she was going from London the first and second time - she had a large cloak on, and had something under it, which appeared to me to be a child.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it appear to be a child? A. She nursed it like a child - she carried it in her arms, as a person carries a child, and the second time I think she was suckling it; she appeared to be holding it up to her left breast; after I had seen her the second time I went to my own house, and saw her coming back - I was standing outside, in the King's road, near my own door; she was returning towards London, and looking very auxiously along the ditch, as if she had lost something.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her the third time, had she the same bundle, or whatever it was, under her cloak? A. Yes - I took no more notice, but went into my own house, and did not see her again till the Inquest was held on Monday: the last time I saw her was, I think, a quarter past six o'clock, as near as can be. I had finished my day's work before I saw her the first time; when I saw her at the Inquest she had the same cloak and bonnet on, but not the same gown; I noticed the gown below her cloak on the Saturday evening - it was the same colour as the one produced; I believe that to be the same.</p>

I heard of the child being found on the Sunday; I went to work a little after six o'clock the next morning, at the same place where I had left off work on the Saturday - I had been nailing trees to the wall, inside the garden, and about two yards from the spot where I left off work on the Saturday evening, I found two little petticoats and a child's frock - they were rolled up, and pinned up; I gave them to the beadle of the parish- those are the things which have been produced; they were not there on the Saturday night: I found them exactly in the place where I left off nailing the trees.</p>

            . I live at Parson's-green. The prisoner came to my house about seven o'clock on the Saturday night - she said she had come looking for work- I had seen her before, and given her work last summer: she asked if I had any girls lodging with me - I said I had three or four: I mentioned their names, and asked if she knew them - she said she knew one, for she worked with her last summer; she slept at my house that night - she had the gown on which has been produced, and had some other things wrapped up in a blue gown - it was a small bundle; she wore the same gown in the morning as when she came - she went out about eight o'clock on Sunday morning, as I suppose, by the light, but I have no clock; she was absent about half an hour - the constable came back with her; she fetched her little bundle from the press-bedstead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had nothing but a gown and two caps when I went there. I laid in on Saffron-hill, in Chick-lane; my child was a week old when I got him christened, at Spanish-place - he was a fortnight old when he died; I got him buried at Mary-le-bone church; I was ill for a week after that, and was never out of doors. I told the gentleman I had nobody to look after the woman who took the child to be buried; she moved, and nobody knew where she was gone. My child was buried in High-street, Mary-le-bone, in the old burying-ground- the woman, whose house I laid in at, took it with her son, to be buried; her husband worked out in the country, and she said he only came to his lodgings on Saturday nights. I worked at Mrs. Fitch's last year, till about six weeks before Christmas; I knew a young woman who worked in the garden with me - I inquired of a woman in the road where I could get a lodging - she told me I could at this woman's: I never went into that road on the Saturday. I am as innocent as a baby unborn, and leave it to the gentleman of the Court to look into my case, for I have not a person in the world to do anything for me. I told the gentleman every thing the moment he took me.</p>

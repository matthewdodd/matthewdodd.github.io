                  <hi rend="italic">Eastcourt's Defence.</hi> About 11 o'clock in the morning, on 17th May, I was at home at work, Mr. Campbell came and told me Mr. Platt was taken into custody on a charge of robbery; my being always at home, I knew Mr. Platt had been at home on Monday; Mrs. Platt wished me to go to state that Mr. Platt was at work; I was rather busy, but I said I did not mind going if I could do the man any good; I went, and was standing out<lb></lb>side for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; the prosecutor and others were there; I did not know who they were till Mr. Campbell pointed them out to me; after that Mrs. Platt was sitting in the police court, and I was talking to her; the officers came to me and said, "You are one of them; just come here, I will put you on the shelf;" and with that he took me into custody; I could swear that I never spoke to this man above once since I have known him; one night, in the Easter week, we had very warm weather, and Mr. and Mrs. Platt had chairs outside and were sitting, and me and my wife had been out; we came home, and I said, "I shall go to bed, good night;" though I have been six or seven months in the house, I believe no one can say that I went in either of the other rooms; the public houses</p>

               <p>I never use; I drink no beer, not above once or twice in a month; I worked five years for Mr. Sharran, in Hackney-road, and no one can say but that I was always attentive to my work; I left that gentleman, and took work for a warehouse; on that day I made five pairs of water tight uppers, and every one knows that that is a very tight day's work, in fact few can do so much; there was a person in my room four or five times that afternoon; Mr. Campbell was there, and a woman in the house was there.</p>

I am a boot maker of No. 34, Austin-street; there are lodgers in all the apartments in the house—I know the prisoner Platt—he is married—I recollect 15th May; I was at work that day at my own house—I saw him—I know him to be at home at his own place from 2 o'clock till 8 in the evening—he sent for me in his room—I walked in between 3 and 4, and there was Platt hard at work—his brother was there, and his wife and children; he told me to sit down, and I did for a time—I had occasion to leave the room between 5 and 6 o'clock, and as I was return<lb></lb>ing I saw the prisoner Eastcourt in his room—I think I went back about half past 5—I remained there till within 10 minutes to 8; as near 8 as possible—his brother was in the room all the time that I was there—I saw Eastcourt in his room, standing by the side of the fireplace, in his shirt sleeves, when I was returning up the second time to Plato's room.</p>

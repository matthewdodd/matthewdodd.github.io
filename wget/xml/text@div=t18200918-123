               <p>Q. And now you charge her with a capital felony - A. Yes. When she wanted money she had it - she laid out money for the house. I am a journeyman carpenter. When I left her at one o'clock all this property was safely locked up, and I had the keys. I returned about seven,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180064"></xptr>found the apartments locked, and she was gone. Next morning I found her at the Fox, in Charter-house-lane. The officer took her, and she produced the duplicates. I did not give her my clothes to sell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. AMDREWS. Q. Where do you come from - A. Falmouth, in Cornwall. I work for Mr. Rolph, the City Carpenter. I became acquainted with her by working at her father's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you seduce her away - A. I did not seduce her, I did not promise to marry her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not, at your invitation, leave her home - A. It was her wish as much as mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not impose this unhappy girl on Mrs. Ball as your wife - A. No. Mr. Rolph does not know of my living with her. I earn 30 s. a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other clothes than what you now wear - A. That is nothing to anybody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the Compter to her - A. Yes, she sent for me, and I went to her, as I thought she would give me information of my property - that was my only object.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not tell her that if she would not trouble you further you would not appear at the trial - A. No. I think I went three times to her in the Compter once in Newgate. I did not force her to dress fine.</p>

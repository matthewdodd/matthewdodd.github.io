On 23rd Jan., about nine o'clock at night, I was going home across the Haggerstone-fields, towards Dalston—there are lights at the extremity of the fields—the prisoner came near me—I am sure of him by his voice and his height—I could not see his features, it was too dark—he said it was a dark night; I said it was—I saw no other person—I said I had missed the footpath; he said, "Oh never mind, I am used to the place"—I said the lights at the further corner of the field were sufficient direction for me; he went a little way</p>

               <p>to the right, and I saw some other persons; I could not say how many, it was so dark—the prisoner crossed from the right to the left, and came to a place where one part of the ground was higher than the other, a sort of embankment—he said, "Here is the path, sir; give me your hand, and I will assist you"—I gave him my hand, and another man came behind me, and pulled me by the feet—I called for assistance, but he got me down—the men over me did not allow me to call long—while lying there the prisoner cut my trowsers at the right-hand side, and took out the pocket, containing my purse, twelve sovereigns, half-a-crown, two shillings, and a check for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they then got hold of my watch-guard; the swivel broke, and left my watch in my pocket—they got the chain; it was a metal one—the prisoner said to the men, "Hold him down"—he had a short shooting-jacket, and a cap—my hat and watch-key were brought to me next morning—I gave my trowsers to the police—on the Saturday week afterwards Morrell took me to the station at Hoxton—the prisoner was brought down-stairs with two other persons; Morrell spoke to him, and I knew him directly by his voice—I have not the least doubt about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the last witness; he is sixty-eight yean old. On Thursday, 23rd Jan., I was with him in Mr. Mitchell's beershop—he came in while I was there—the prisoner is my step<lb></lb>brother—he came in about ten minutes or a quarter past eight—Shoreditch bells were ringing—his brother came in a very little before him, and they both came into the house together—I was in his company till a quarter to ten, when I left him there—Mr. Fry and his son were there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Then you did not leave with your father. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I left before him—I recollect the evening, because I was rather short of money, and wanted to see Mr. Mitchell to borrow 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have not been told that it was necessary to give some good reason to account for the date—I have borrowed 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of him before—my attention was first called to this about a month ago—I was in the tap-room, and Pluckrose came to me—he did not mention the date then; he did a few days afterwards—I only recollect it by borrowing the money—the prisoner did not come there often—we were on the left-hand side of the room—the prisoner was sitting alongside me when I left—Pluckrose was on the opposite side—I am a rope and twine-spinner.</p>

                  </hi>. I know the prisoner well. On Thursday, 23rd Jan., I was at Mr. Mitchell's at eight o'clock in the evening—the prisoner and his brother came in from eight to a quarter-past—Shoreditch bells were going—I remained there till half-past eleven—he left before me with a man I do not know—my son was there—he left about a quarter to nine—he is not here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who left first of your party? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My son; if anybody has said that Cole and his son left first, that is not true—I remember the day, because a horse had bitten my arm—I did not work—it had only been bad that day—I saw this matter in the paper on the Tuesday week after he was taken, and was quite surprised.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop, in Barnet-grove. On 23rd Jan. I had been out for some grocery, and returned about half-past nine o'clock—in about five minutes I went into the tap-room, and saw the prisoner there—I went in at intervals, and saw him there from half-past nine till eleven.</p>

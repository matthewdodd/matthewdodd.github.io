I am the wife of James Joseph Syer, a surveyor—I had been staying at Lewisham, and on Saturday afternoon, 17th January, I came up to London—I went to the General post-office to purchase a postage stamp for Melbourne, and went from there to Newgate-street—to the best of my belief, this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the stamp I purchased—two police-officers, in plain clothes, came up to me in Newgate-street, and, from what they said, I found I had lost my purse—when I last saw it safe there was in it a half-sovereign, a shilling, a sixpence, a postage stamp, a penny, a halfpenny, and two farthings; a return railway ticket, and four other tickets, and a key.</p>

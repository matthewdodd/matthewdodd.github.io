The prisoner and another man, run with such violence against me and the females to separate me from the females; and at that instant I missed my handkerchief. I seized the prisoner before he got three yards from me. I could not judge which of the two men took the handkerchief; it was taken from my right hand coat pocket, and the coat was torn completely down. The prisoner was taken to the watch-house, and there searched, but the handkerchief was not found upon him.</p>

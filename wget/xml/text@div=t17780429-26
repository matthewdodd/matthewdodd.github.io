               <p>I am servant to Mr. Hockley; the spoons were lost out of the scullery; they are usually kept in a cupboard in this scullery. I saw the door bolted the night before, and the window shut at ten in the evening. I saw the spoons in the cupboard, there were seventeen spoons in all, three large soup spoons, nine desert spoons, and five table spoons. I know nothing of the situation in which it was found the next morning, for the maid opened it, and she is not here. I did not see it till nine in the morning; I then saw some marks of some mortar which had fell down where somebody had climbed over the wall and got into the scullery window; they must have got over four or five walls, for it is an enclosure backwards; the garden walls must be climbed over; it must have been committed by some person pretty well acquainted with the situation of the house, and they must have got in at the window.</p>

On the 3d of February, between three and four in the morning, all the prisoners, and Griffiths who is the evidence, came in and laid down upon the bed in their clothes. Hosier had the property wrapped up in a blue apron. I heard there was something of value there; it gingled as he laid it down in the chair by the bedside; I wondered what it was; I did not enquire that night, but the next morning at seven, when the prisoners got up, I asked them what the bundle contained, Hosier and Griffiths said that they were spoons that they had got the night before.

Griffiths, in the presence of all the rest of the prisoners, desired me to go down to Mrs. Keeling, and desire her to send up half a guinea upon them, for they wanted half a guinea; I found Mrs. Keeling there with this plate, she had got some leaden weights and weighed the spoons; she said she had no money of her own, that she could send them up, but she would go to Whitechapel and sell the spoons, and bring the money there: if I would go along with her, she would treat me with a coach; we took a coach from St. Giles's to Whitechapel; there we sold the spoons for 5 l. 12 s. when we came back again, Mrs. Keeling gave the prisoner three guineas; I don't recollect whether she said that was the whole she got for them, or whether she endeavoured to cheat them out of part of it. I was by when she gave them the three guineas; there were three very large spoons; and the remainder seemed to be table spoons. I had nothing for my trouble.</p>

The night of the 3d of February we went to a place called the New Ale-house, in Buckingham street, St. Giles's, about nine or ten in the evening. The reason of pitching upon this particular house was from my knowing that the plate was usually kept in that cupboard. We went along, and came to Parson's Green about one o'clock, but

When we came to Parson's Green, we got over three or four walls by my directions; at last we got to the top of Mr. Hockley's wall; there are pales fixed upon the wall which have tender hooks in them; I attempted to get over, and I tore my leg in two places with these tenter hooks; I was the only person that got over, because I knew the house better than the rest; and also because of the dog which was very large and fierce; Knight was at top of the pales with me, but did not dare to get down. When I got down the dog knew me perfectly well and fondled upon me; I had never seen the dog since I left the service of Mr. Hockley; I chained him up; the dog readily submitted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290025"></xptr> to it; Knight still stood at the top of the pales; and Hosier stood in the garden behind, in order to help us two up; when I got to the scullery I lifted up the sash window and put in my hand, and I found I could reach the cupboard without getting into the scullery; so I never was in the scullery, but put in my hand and took the plate out, and handed it up to Knight, who stood upon the pales; I remember particularly I took a soup ladle and two wooden spoons, which are used for the young gentlemen who are scholars there, and about fifteen others; if there were any more, they concealed them from me; I handed them up to them, they put them into a blue apron; Knight was upon the wall, and Hosier below; when this was done, I unchained the dog, and turned him loose; and then got over the wall back again; then we all set forward for London; and at Little Chelsea we called upon Major again, who was got something more sober than he was, and came home along with us; then we all went to Mrs. Keeling's house, and laid down upon the bed in our clothes.

               <p>KNIGHT's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>What this man has said is quite false. I am innocent of what has been sworn against me.</p>

               <p>HOSIER's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>Griffiths came into the Crown alehouse, St. Giles's, and asked me to walk with him to Parson's green, to a gentleman, where he thought he could get a good deal of plate; he kept me in the yard; he said the dog would tear me to pieces; after we had got it, he gave me a guinea. He said I will give you this money for nothing; and if you have a mind, you may give me something out of it; I gave him a shilling and he was contented.</p>

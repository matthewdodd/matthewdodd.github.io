               <p>Q. When did you lose this money of yours - A. Upon the 1st of October I was plying with my coach at the stand in Aldgate High-street, he came and spoke to the waterman and said that he wanted a coach and a pair of horses to go to Camberwell and back to take a midwife; the waterman came to me and said that he wanted me, and said, go speak to that man, he wants a coach to go to Camberwell to take a midwife; I went to him, and he knew me and I knew him; he said, aye, is that you; he said he wanted a coach to go to Camberwell to take a midwife, they were good people they would pay any thing to make haste, I might take my time in coming back again. I went with him; he got upon the box with me; he said I was to take up in Fenchurch-street; he said he had got a better situation than he had; he took me to the corner of <placeName id="t18120219-86-crimeloc506">Church-row, Fenchurch-street</placeName>

I went to the lady and there was no man had gone for a coach; I never saw him after till he was in custody at Bond-street watchhouse a month afterwards. I am sure he is the man.</p>

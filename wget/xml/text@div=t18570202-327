                  </hi>. I am porter to the Edmonton Union. The prisoners were admitted there on 2nd Nov., and left together on 2nd Dec.—I examined them when they left—they delivered the house clothing to me, and I was present when they put their own clothes on—Cutler had a smock frock, a pair of fustian trowsers, an old waistcoat, a white or striped shirt, and Blucher shoes, the right one cut up the instep—the left was a workhouse shoe—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can swear that this is the shoe I gave him on Friday morning—I also swear to these trowsers—I found this shoe and these trowsers on the morning of 30th Dec., about half-past 7 o'clock, in a field about thirty yards from the store room, which was all in confusion—it had all been in order the night before—some one had got in by removing a pane of glass, putting their arm in, and undoing the window—on 1st Jan. Cutler was admitted into the workhouse again, and I asked him if he had seen Charlton—he said that he had on Thursday morning—he was then given into custody for being concerned with Charlton in breaking into the place—he made no answer—there is a long range of buildings; the next ward is the infirm ward; then the bad leg ward; then the dead house, and next to that the store room which was broken into—they are all one group of buildings, fifty yards long, and enclosed by a wall.</p>

On the night be-fore the robbery I saw the store room quite safe about half past 9 o'clock; and next morning before 6 o'clock I found this piece of wood lying on the earth, broken in two pieces, and a knife on the window sill—these trowsers and boots are Alfred Cutler's—I could swear to these articles taken from Charlton—they were taken from the store room, and I saw them safe on the night of the 29th.</p>

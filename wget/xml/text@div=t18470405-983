                  </hi> I am a tanner, and live in Pancras-street, Tottenham Court-road. On Sunday, the 28th of Feb., at twelve o'clock at night, I was standing at the corner of Museum-street, Holborn; my brother, Samuel Sneed, was standing with me, a few paces from me—I had a silver watch, worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, in my left waistcoat-pocket, attached by a steel guard-chain—as I was standing there, the prisoner Ragan ran and caught hold of me tight round the neck, threw his head over my left shoulder, and whispered something in my ear, which I could not rightly understand—while I was listening to him I felt some one else behind me, rather on my left side, where my watch was—they were there perhaps about half a minute—I could not see what they were doing—I felt some one touching me by the side of my back; they then left</p>

               <p>me, and ran off in different directions—I can swear to Ragan positively, but not to Mara—he is much about the height of the other person—I had not a chance to see his face—when they had gone, my brother spoke to me—I looked at my watch-guard, and found it hanging down on my right breast, and my watch was gone—I am clearly confident it was in my pocket at the time Ragan took hold of me round the neck, and when he let loose his arms, it was gone—I and my brother, and somebody else, followed a little way, but my brother was not the nearest one to Ragan—the watch has not been found.</p>

                  </hi> I am the brother of the last witness, and live with him in Pancras-street—I am working as a smith, at Watford. On Sunday evening, 28th Feb., about twelve o'clock, I was standing with my brother at the corner of Museum-street, in Holborn—we were talking together about our own matter, and the two prisoners came up, along with another one—Ragan threw his arms round my brother's neck, and held him fast, and Mara put his arms round them both, and pushed up against them against a door—I took hold of Ragan by the shoulders, and told him not to kick up a <hi rend="italic">raw</hi> there—in a few seconds he let go, and they all three stood about two or three yards apart from us—I looked at my brother, and noticed his guard hanging out of his pocket, and said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Tom,</hi> your watch is gone"—I have no doubt the prisoners could hear that—the guard was hanging out of one the button-holes—hecarried his watch in his waistcoat-pocket—I noticed that the watch was gone at the time I said so—the moment I said so, they all ran away, each a separate way—I am quite sure Ragan is the man who did what I have said, and I am positive Mara was the man I them saw—we had been in a public-house about an hour and a half before, and Mara was there—I am sure I saw him there—I should not have noticed him so much when this occurred, ex<lb></lb>cept that I had seen him before—I made a remark to my brother—it was in consequence of seeing him before, that I am quite certain he is the man—we ran after them down Drury-lane, and John Williams stopped Ragan—Mara was not taken till the next Saturday night, and I did not see him till about ten days after, because I was out of town—I then walked into the waiting-room at Bow-street station-house, and picked him out of, I should say, twenty or twenty-five people—I recognized him the moment I saw him.</p>

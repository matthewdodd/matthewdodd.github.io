I am in the service of Mr. John Gadsden—he is in ill health, and does not attend to his business—I have the superintendence of it—the prisoner was in his employ, and it was his duty to collect accounts, and to account for them when he returned from the customers he had to serve—it was his duty to account to me or to another witness, who is here—the whole of the receipts on these three bills are in the prisoner's handwriting—some part of these bills is printed—they are my master's bills—the whole of the writing in this book, produced by Mr. Perry, is the prisoner's—I here find an acknow<lb></lb>ledgment for these bills in the prisoner's writing—these sums have not been accounted for—here is a book which we keep, which is the prisoner's hand<lb></lb>writing, and they are not in it—all amounts which he received must appear in this book—he has never accounted to me for any one of these amounts—I told him several times that there was a sum due from Mr. Perry, and asked what was the reason of Mr. Perry's account being so large—he said Mr. Perry was out of town—I gave him three distinct bills in an envelope to Mr. Perry.</p>

W. S.," is Mr. Sams'—this" C. J." is my signature—this "G. C." is George Cutbush, who came after the prisoner left—I am positive Mr. Gadsden never received money himself—I do not profess to be in the counting-house—I superintend the warehouse—I cannot exactly say the day the prisoner left—he was in our service till he was apprehended—I will not swear that Cutbush was not in our service before the prisoner left—I did not take notice of it—I have not exhibited any ill-feeling to the prisoner—I charged him with dishonesty two years ago—he has not since then desired to leave—I never asked him to stay—I have had the management of the busi<lb></lb>ness for twelve months—I was in Mr. Gadsden service for ten years before—I have not had occasion to apply for the benefit of the Insolvent Act—I have never been in any pecuniary difficulties.</p>

            . A servant in the house fell lame, and the prisoner did her business for a little time. I missed a flower'd silk gown, it was in pieces, and a piece of flower'd linnen; I suspected the prisoner had taken them, we found part of the things at her lodgings. She told us where the gown was, we went and found it at a Dyer's in Knave's-acre. The Dyer told us he had orders from her to dye it of a dark brown.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they taken from?</p>
               <p>Spooner. From out of a box. I live in Mr. Moore's house.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them last?</p>
               <p>Spooner. I saw them the Sunday before she came into the house, I cannot say I saw them while she was in the house. The shift and petticoat were found upon her back, the black silk apron was found in her pocket.</p>

            . I am the constable. I went with the warrant, we found in the prisoner lodging the piece of linnen. The prisoner said, she would confess to me in another room; she told me she had the two shifts on, she pulled them off, and delivered them; I saw the black silk apron taken out of her pocket. She went with us to Mr. Hill, the Dyer, where was the gown. (The things found produced in court.)</p>

            . I live in Swallow-street. The prisoner lived servant two years with me, she always behaved well, and bore the character of a very honest person in the neighbourhood. I heard Mrs. Moore say, she gave her the things, and looked upon it that she intended to be favourable to her, and she seemed very sorry for her.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Moore. Did you say you gave her the things?</p>
               <p>Moore. No, I did not. I said, I was sorry to see the things in such a condition.</p>
               <p>Howse. I am very certain Mrs. Moore did say, that she gave them to her, and would have had her acquitted.</p>

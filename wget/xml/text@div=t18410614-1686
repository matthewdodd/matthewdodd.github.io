                  </hi>. I am a hosier, and live in Burlington<lb></lb>arcade. About ten o'clock in the morning of the 29th of May, on my coming into the shop, I found the prisoner and another person looking at some hand<lb></lb>kerchief's which my wife was showing them—she left them, and I served them—after looking at three handkerchiefs, they said they would not have either of them, and wished to look at some others—I told them to look at those hanging about the shop—they fixed on one at the top of the window, arid desired me to get it down, the prisoner saying he would have it—I went to the other end of the shop to get the steps, and I missed a handker<lb></lb>chief off the counter—I made no observation, but got the handkerchief, and showed it to the prisoner—he said he would have it, and I must give him change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. country bank-note—I said I would do so—he put his hand into a side-pocket in the flap of his coat, and seemed to have a good deal of trouble in getting something out—in doing so he rose the flap of his coat—I saw a handkerchief similar to this, quite new, hanging out</p>

               <p>of his pocket—I took the note, went to the door, beckoned the constable, and charged the prisoner with stealing the handkerchief—he had his hand in his coat-pocket at the time, and we proceeded to search him—the next minute I saw the handkerchief on the floor.</p>

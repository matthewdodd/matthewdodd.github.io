            . I am the wife of Isaac Isaacs - the prisoner entered my service on the 29th of January - I missed, on the 2d of February, a shawl from the shop - we deal in women's apparel - I afterwards missed some coral beads - when I missed the shawl, I told the prisoner of it, and said, I did not suspect her - she said, when a <rs id="t18340220-163-deflabel947" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Why was she not present when her box was opened? A. The officer took her into custody - my husband has no other name.</p>

             (City policeman No. 53). I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody - I used no threat to her- she said to her master in my presence, in the way to the Compter, that she hoped he would be as lenient as he possibly could towards her, and she would tell where the beads were; and, as she went up the steps of the Compter, she said they were in the bed between the ticking and flock - I found them there - she said the bed was in the room where the children slept, where her boxes were - I got a key from her at the station-house, with which I opened her box, and found these things in it, which I produce.</p>

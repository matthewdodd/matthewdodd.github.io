I am a leather merchant in Bermondsey-street, Surrey—I have a warehouse there; I don't live there—on the evening of 27th January I was the last person there; it was secure when I left—I had a considerable quantity of leather on the premises—when I got there in the morning the first thing that attracted my attention was one of the books being covered with red ink, which had evidently been spilt over it—John Smith, a man in my service, was there before me—I missed property to the extent of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I lost eighty-seven dozen <hi rend="italic">grafs</hi>, they are fronts of boots; about thirty or thirty-five dozen of calf kid, two dozen of patent calf some Memel goat and enamelled soles; I don't know exactly how many, but about two dozen I should think—it was clear the premises had been broken into—On about the 10th of the following month I received a communication from Northampton which led me to put the police in motion—a policeman after<lb></lb>wards produced to me some skins; they are here—my foreman went with the policeman—eleven of those skins are mine—George was given into cud<lb></lb>tody—we went before a Magistrate in Surrey; he was then remanded for a week, brought up again and dismissed, and the case was then taken to Guildhall—there were two hearings there, and then the Alderman who</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, George Lawrence, at 12, Marlborough Road, Lee—on 11th February, about eight in the even<lb></lb>ing, my sister went out of the dining-room, and said, "Herbert, there is a man in the house"—I ran through the hall and out at the front door—I found it shut, and on opening it saw two men in the garden running from the back of the house—the side entrance is protected by a green gate to the back garden, and there are steps up to a door leading to the hall—by that door you have access to the hall as well as by the front door—I ran after the men, calling, "Stop thief!"—they ran along the road some distance, and one of them turned back—that was the prisoner—he ran 200 or 300 yards, and a policeman caught him—I believe he is one of the two men I saw running away—I lost sight of him for one moment at a corner, and when I got round I saw him running across the road—I went with him to the station, where I noticed that he had no boots or shoes on—when the men were running out of the garden I did not notice any difference in their running, or in the sound they made—after the prisoner was taken to the station I found two sets of footmarks on the grass in front of the house, one appearing to be made with a boot and the other without—nothing was dis<lb></lb>turbed—no boots were found.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the dining-room with my brother when my sister made an alarm—I went out at the front door after my brother, and saw two men in the road running; I ran after them, and saw one of them run into a knot of men who were standing at a corner, and then saw a man run out of the knot, but cannot say whether he was the same man—I saw him stopped by the policeman—he complained of the policeman handling him roughly, and afterwards escaped—the policeman caught him again, and he struggled and tried to bite the policeman—I examined the garden with a lamp, and feund two sets of footmarks leading from the side gate to the front gate, one as if made by a man with, and the other without boots—I did not notice when he was taken that he had no boots, but I noticed it at the station.</p>

I am the sister of the former witnesses—I went into the passage about eight o'clock on the evening of 11th February, and saw a man walking on tip-toe in the hall—he made no noise, but I could not see whether he had boots or shoes on—I called my brothers, and the man ran out at the side door—I should not know him again—I am near<lb></lb>sighted.</p>

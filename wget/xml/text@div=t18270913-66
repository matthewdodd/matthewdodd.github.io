I got to the Royal Exchange about three o'clock; he set me down there; I paid him, and discharged him; he had stopped and spoken to a man near Islington, in the middle of the street. I do not know what he said to him. I went to my lodgings about eight o'clock that night, and my trunk was gone - it contained a Spanish cloak; two coats, three jackets, about a dozen shirts, half a dozen pairs of trousers, some handkerchiefs, and other things - they were worth 15l. at least, beside my papers - I have found none of them since.</p>

            ; we live at No. 18, Ann-street, Pentonville, in the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell; the prosecutor engaged our lodgings - he came to our house on Monday, the 10th of September, in a hackney-coach, and brought his trunk and two pairs of boots - the prisoner drove the coach. I am certain he is the man; it was No. 117; I had never seen him before - he came between two and three o'clock; the prosecutor and prisoner lifted the trunk into the passage - I heard the prisoner say it was very heavy, and ask if it was doubloons; the prosecutor smiled, and said Yes; the prosecutor went away in the coach, and in about three-quarters of an hour, the prisoner came with the same coach, and demanded the trunk; he said the gentleman was very sorry, and it was wrong altogether; that it was to have gone to Leicester-fields; and said, the gentleman had given him half of a pound to satisfy me for the lodging; he offered me half-asovereign - my demand was 5s. I could not give him change, and he gave me 5s. in silver. I walked into my room and left my little boy there, while he took the trunk out - it was in the passage when he came; I did not see him take it away - I saw nobody with the prisoner, and cannot say whether any body was with him or not; the prosecutor came at eight o'clock to take possession of his lodging, but went away in five minutes.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on Wednesday, the 12th of September; his master sent for him to me - I told him what I took him for; he said he took the gentleman to Pentonville with the trunk, and left it at No. 18, Ann-street; then took the gentleman to the Exchange, and as he turned into Cheapside rank, after setting the gentleman down, he was hailed by two men, who told him to drive to Pentonville - that they stopped him on the hill, and one who was an Englishman, got out, leaving the other in the coach - that he returned in about twenty minutes, and told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130071"></xptr>him to go to No. 18, Ann-street, and take the trunk from there to Leicester-fields, and gave him half-a-sovereign to pay the demand - the man who was left in the coach was a foreigner; that he paid the woman of the house 5s., and drove to Leicester-fields, with the trunk and the foreigner in the coach - that the other man hailed the coach then, and told him to stop - he had been waiting some time; that he came back, and said to the other man in the coach, that it was all right, and they took the trunk away - he saw no more of them. On the Friday following, the Magistrate asked him where he lodged; he said he could not tell the number, but it was nearly opposite a court in Archer-street. I found the house, No. 42, by his description - he said it was a front room, on the first floor. I went there with Colton - I found no part of the property; but there were sixteen common keys, and a dark lantern, which I brought away - I told him afterwards we had been there, and he admitted they were his lodgings.</p>

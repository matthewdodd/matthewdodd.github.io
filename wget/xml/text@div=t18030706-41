               <p>WILLIAM DEAN sworn. - On Friday, the 1st of July, I took the prisoner, who was by the mare; I asked who owned it; it had been pointed out by the prosecutor; the prisoner said it was his, for he bought it that morning; the prosecutor came up, and I took the prisoner into custody.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went down the road after some money, and met a man with the mare, who offered to sell her; I gave him eight pounds for her, and brought her to Smithfield, thinking to make a trifle by her; I stood by her side, and offered her for sale for ten pounds; after that came the officers, and asked me if I was owner of the mare; I said, yes; they said they would own the mare and me too, and took me into custody.</p>

I am a draper, of 133, High Street, Camden Town—on 31st May I went to bed about 1 o'clock, having seen the house securely, fastened—on 1st June I was awoke about 7 o'clock, went downstairs, and found the inner shop iron door leading to the house, broken open—some goods were pulled out behind the counter, and spread over with tallow candle—I missed a piece of silk, a piece of satin, several pairs of stockings, and several silk scarves, and from the drawing-room, two silver cups and an opera glass; a desk was broken open, eight doors were broken open from the inside, all the doors but one, which is the one leading to the back stairs—the policeman called my attention to the skylight—this satin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is precisely the same as what I missed, in quality—I cannot tell the quantity because it was in cut lengths—these two scarves and these stockings are mine—Miss Holli<lb></lb>day is in my employ, and lived in the house.</p>

I live with my mother, at 148, Copenhagen Street—I know the three prisoners—Morris kept company with me in May and June—on 1st June I visited Esther Lacy, Minnie Collins, and the three prisoners at 3, Cromer Street—Lacy and Lowther lived together, Powell was keeping company with Collins—I slept with, Esther Lacy, and saw the three prisoners come in between 5 and 6 a.m. on 1st June—they had a piece of satin, and several pairs of stockings and neckties, two silver cups and an opera-glass; Powell took the satin out to give to his mother, the other articles were taken out by the prisoners, and I did not see them again, these are them produced—I identify this satin—a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> was kept between the bed and the mattress on which I slept, but I did not know it then; that was in Lacy and Lowther's room, the room in which I saw the three prisoners—this <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi> produced is very much like it.</p>

She had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with Morris soon after, and came and took all her clean ties away and her under-linen. The silk tie found at my lodging was left there with her dirty clothes.

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of John, Charles, and Richard Wade, drapers, at Deptford. On the 2nd of September, between five and six o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop and asked me to show him some silk handkerchiefs—I did so, and soon after I missed one pattern which I had shewn him—I called a young man and asked him if he had taken one—he said he had not—I said it was very strange where it could be—the pri<lb></lb>soner said I must have put it in the drawer—to convince him I pulled out the drawer again, and then I saw him draw one handkerchief out—I pulled the drawer back, and then I observed him draw these two hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs out of his trowsers—I am certain of that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> He said he missed them, and I said he must have put them in the drawer; he looked, and said they were not there; he then brought the drawer on the counter, and found the handkerchiefs on the counter amongst the others.</p>

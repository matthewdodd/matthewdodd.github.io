                  </hi>. I live in University-street. On the night of the 4th of May I was going home about half-past eleven o'clock at night—I got to the end of Oxford-street and Tottenham-court-road—they are making a new street there—I paused at the end, and I said to a genteel young man, "Is that my way to Tottenham-court-road?"—he said, "Where are you going?"—I said, "To University-street"—he said he was going that way, and he would show me—I said it was not necessary, but he walked on with me—I said, "I am very thirsty, do you know a place where I can get a glass of bitter ale?"—he said, "Yes, here is one at the corner of Bedford-street, Tottenham-court-road"—we went into the parlour, and had a pint of ale—we might be there half-an-hour or a little more—I left the house about half-past twelve, and the young man left with me, and just as we got outside the door, he put his left arm round my shoulder, to draw my attention—he said, "This is your way"—he put his other hand round me, and pulled the</p>

                  </hi>. I am pot-boy at the Bedford Head, the corner of Bedford-street, Tottenham-court-road. I remember the night the prosecutor came there—the prisoner came there with him—I am quite sure it was the prisoner—they went into the parlour—the prisoner called for a pint of old ale—I took it—I was asking the prisoner for the money, but the prosecutor paid—they were in the room about an hour—when they went out the prisoner put his hand on the prosecutor's back, and told him to go home—I did not see or hear any more till the Tuesday morning—the prosecutor appeared the worse for liquor—he appeared giddy—I did not notice any pin in his shirt.</p>

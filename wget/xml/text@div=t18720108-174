                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, of 151, Cowes Street, Hamp<lb></lb>stead—on 24th December I was in a public-house, in Deptford—the pri<lb></lb>soner was there, but I had no conversation with her—I only answered "Yes"when she asked me something, and said "What do you want?"—she left the house first, and when I went out she said she was very cold—she pulled my coat, and I felt her hand near my pocket where my watch was—I had in the same pocket my railway ticket, and some pawn tickets, and a knife—I said "You have robbed me"—she immediately went back about six steps—I cried for a policeman, and she ran—I followed her into some yard, and caught her, but did not touch her—a man came up, who said ho would go for a policeman, but ho never came back—I gave her in charge, and showed the policeman the place where she stopped me—he looked, and found my tickets, but not my watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went into the public-house about 11 o'clock—I had been from Deptford to Greenwich at 6.30, and came back to Deptford at 8 o'clock—I had been into three public-houses on the road, and had a glass of beer in each—there were about five persons in the public-house, includ<lb></lb>ing women, but I am short-sighted; I had my spectacles on, but they are not much use—the prisoner was there when I went in—she had no baby then—I did not understand what she said, and I said "What do you want?"—she made no reply, but went out—I do not remember that any<lb></lb>one else went out—some soldiers spoke to me, but no other woman—I spoke to no other woman—I went out five minutes after her, and saw her outside—I think she was waiting for me—I saw no one else there—she said "Where are you going t" and put her hand to my coat—I said nothing, but looked her in the face, and she said "Come along," or something like that, and I found her hand in my pocket—she ran away four or five yards, and then stopped and went into a yard—she did not ask me to follow her, she went in there as quickly as she could, after I said "You have robbed me," and tried to get away—the yard is near the public-house—she did not put her hand round my waist when she put her hand in my pocket—I put up my hands with my stick to prevent her getting out of the yard, and called "Police."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was not near the other persons in the public-house—I went out quite alone—I can see a face four or five steps off—the prisoner lit me on the forehead in the yard, and knocked my spectacles off—she also caught hold of my whiskers.</p>

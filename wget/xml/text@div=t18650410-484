                  </hi>. I am an engine-driver, in the employment of the South Eastern Railway Company—on Friday, 16th December, I was the driver of a ballast-train from Dartford, consisting of an engine and tender, twenty-two trucks, filled with gravel, and two break-carriages, one in front of the train and the other in the rear—it started about five minutes past 3 in the after<lb></lb>noon—it was an ordinary engine—I had no exact time to keep at the stations down the line, but had to work in between the other trains, and, if necessary, at some of the stations to go on to the sidings, so as to get out of the way of the other trains—eight of the trucks were unloaded at Abbey-wood—we took nine fresh trucks on between Dartford and Erith, before talking the others off—we got to Charlton Station about 4 o'clock, and were stopped there by a signal, and detained about a quarter of an hour—the ballast guard and the signal man at the station gave me the signal to start—a man named Lancaster was the guard of the train; I recieved my orders from him, and he received the order from the signal man—I started and went into the tunnel—at that time I had twenty-three loaded trucks—seven or eight plate-layers were riding in the break-carriage at the end of the train—John Currie was one of them—the tunnel is nearly a mile long; and is on an incline—we went about three parts of the way through—the wheels slipped pretty well all through the tunnel—the greasy state of the rails was the only cause of that—I signalled to have the breaks put on, to prevent the train from slipping back—we had put some sand on the rails to try to get along, but notwithstanding that the train stopped quite still, and we were not able to get along, though the engine was powerful enough—Lancaster then got down, but he had no time to get to the rear of the train before I felt a shock—we were then on the curve—I knew that something had come into us behind, but could not tell what it was—after that some one divided the train, and we went on with twelve of the trucks to Black heath for assist<lb></lb>ance</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186504100194"></xptr>
               <p>to return with the engine and bring the remainder out—I returned with the engine with Assistance into the tunnel, and found that a passenger train had run into us behind, smashing up several trucks at the end of the train, and killing five of the men on the spot—we were in the tunnel, I sup<lb></lb>pose, from five to seven minutes before the collision—it was about thirteen minutes from the time of leaving Charlton Station till the collision—the train had just come to a stand-still before the collision—I have stuck in the tunnel once before that, when I have been in charge of a smaller ballast train, and reported that to the authorities—I was not in the habit of un<lb></lb>uncoupling the train in the tunnel and bringing part out—I cannot say whether the tail lights were on when I entered the tunnel as I did not go behind to see.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is there an express train which ought to leave Dart<lb></lb>ford at 3.15? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not know what time it leaves—the train left Maidstone about half-past 2, or twenty minutes to 3—when I got to Charlton I should have gone straight through without stopping, but for the signal against me—the weight of the train might be 250 tons, I do not know—I heard MR. Card well, the engineer, give his evidence—when so heavy a train as that stopped it is difficult to start afresh—there is an incline and a curve in the middle of the tunnel—I had quite power enough to drive the train; if there had been half the number of carriages the wheels might have slipped all the same—the engine would be more likely to have gone through with half the number of trucks—it would carry ten trucks through; in fact, I divided the train, and then found myself able to go through—when we had got 200 yards or so into the tunnel the slipping commenced, and the guard got down—we were then going almost at a walking pace, it was just previous to stopping still—my fireman got down also—I did not see him kick ballast on the line to make it less slippery—I felt the jar on the engine as if another engine had come into us in front—when one engine backer to another there is sometimes a bit of a jerk—it was not at all a violent shock; the guard asked me what I came back for; I said I had not come back—there was a great deal of steam and noise in the tunnel—when I came out of the tunnel with half the train, Jones, the signalman, was at the end of the platform by the door of his box—the mouth of the tunnel is not very far from the Black<lb></lb>heath Station; I afterwards saw Mr. Chapman, the station-master—the signal-man was about 200 yards from the mouth of the tunnel, I do not know exactly—when I got to the Blackheath Station I passed along to a siding, and then went back with the engine, having left half the ballast train in the tunnel—I held my arm up to the signal-man, and told him to hold hard—I do not know whether he understood it—Lancaster was in charge of the train; we have no fixed time to run the ballast trains—they are not in the time service at all; it has occurred before in my own case, that ballast<lb></lb>trains have had to divide, but I cannot speak of others; I have since heard of one or two trains sticking in the same place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the slipping in consequence of frost or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the greasy state of the rails the engine-wheels do not adhere, as it is a very wet tunnel, and such a great quantity of steam goes through which falls on the rails, and there is always a greasiness; if it had not been for the greasy state of the rails the engine was abundantly powerful to draw the train, and more than that, we are more liable to stopping in the winter season.</p>

                  </hi>. I am station-master at Blackheath—I have been nearly eighteen years in the company's employ, and am perfectly acquainted with the working of the line—it is a rule that when a train is started a message should be sent from the starting station—in starting from Dart ford the station-master would send a message along the line which would be immediately conveyed to the signalman, and that train would be added to their list of expected trains, which was not done in this instance, and the ballast train became entirely dependant on signals from station to station—the prisoner had been porter for two years and four months—he had been working the signals altogether for about eight or nine days—he had been well taught before he was put into the signal box—every person in the com<lb></lb>pany's employ is required to make himself acquainted with the rules—he had taken the duty of assistant signalman to help the day man when he went to dinner, and from 6 to 8 in the evening on several occasions when I had given one of the staff a holiday—he was my reserve man, and was par<lb></lb>ticularly steady and sober, and one of the best men I ever had under my charge—his hours were from 7 in the morning to 6 in the evening with one hour for dinner—he had no other duties but signaling—this message which was sent from Charlton station by the porter was decidedly irregular; it should have been copied in writing and sent to the signalman so as to impress it more on his mind—they are not justified in attending to merely verbal messages, and if the prisoner had attended to this message he would have done wrong—the regulations are strict you must have a written message to act upon—I cannot understand how the man made a mistake—orders to the signalman may be given verbally by me but by no one else except the head porter when he is acting as my deputy—trains have been stopped in the tunnel and divided before—that arises from the wet dripping through and making the rails greasy and very often from atmospheric causes—it is often not so bad as at other times—it has happened many times since I have been at Blackheath—it has always been reported, and all precautions are supposed to be taken and rules are laid down which were considered sufficient—not taking so many trucks would decidedly be the remedy for it.</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there two passenger trains which passed just at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they were signaled in the ordinary way—I have not got the prisoner's book—the law department have had the charge of it since the accident—I went to the prisoner's box about the time of the col<lb></lb>lision, as I understood he wanted to speak to me—he said, "I understand the ballast train has divided in the tunnel"—I saw he was agitated, and he said, "I am afraid I have given the clear signal"—I immediately telegraphed to Charlton station, but at that time the collision had taken place.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How old is the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twenty-four—I have given him a very good character, and I believe him to be anxiously careful to do his duty—he had not received signal-man's wages, as his first week had not elapsed—he would be entitled to them—his wages as a porter were 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he has married since he has been at Blackheath-station—his wages as a signal-man would be one guinea—I treat this entirely as a mistake; I cannot account for it—the signal-man in charge has four columns to make entries in for each train between its being received and having passed the station—I do not know whether he would have to make 150 entries in three<lb></lb>quarters of an hour—in addition to the four entries to each signal, he has to hold out a flag for each train that passes, and to put up the semaphore arms—there were trains at 3.30 and 3.50 from Charing-cross; 4.5 and 4.20—the 4.30 would not arrive till after the collision—only one empty train went previous to the coal train.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a time-keeper in the service of the South<lb></lb>eastern Company—I knew John Cumming, who was injured in the accident—he died in the Royal Marine hospital at Woolwich from the injuries he received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoners statement before the Magistrate:</hi>—"I entered the company's service two years last August as porter, which situation I held up to a week previous to the accident, when I was placed in the signal-box to do duty for the signal-man who was ill. I don't believe I had done more than twenty duties in the signal-box, that is to say, when there was any signalling to do, before I took charge of it, so that my previous experience was but little. However, when I took the duty I hoped I should have been able to have performed it satisfactorily. My duties were to attend in the signal-box from 7 in the morning until 6 in the evening, with the exception of the hour allowed for dinner. After coming out of the box at 6, I had to wait the arrival and to attend the 6.17 down train. Whilst in the box I had to receive and give telegraphic signals to and from Lewisham-station, and to and from Angerstein-junction. I had beside to enter signals in five different places for each train in the signal-book in addition. I had for each train or engine to attend to the semaphore and distinct signal, and upon each train passing to show my flag or hand-signal that all was right. I will now state briefly the circumstances connected with the lamentable acci<lb></lb>dent so far as I am able, and the traffic that passed through the station within three-quarters of an hour of it. The following trains passed through the Blackheath-station:—Down from London 3.30, 3.50 (expressed), 4.5, 420 (expressed). Due at Blackheath, 3 51, 4.7, 4.25, 431. The next down train, the 4.30, due at 4.47, was fortunately stopped at Blackheath. Up from Woolwich, 3 30. Due at Blackheath 3.44. Angerstein coal-train, 4.5. Blackheath empties'-train, 4.10. Ballast-train, signalled up at 413.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186504100199"></xptr>
               <p>I believe I had in addition the block-signal, prior to the coal-train from An<lb></lb>gerstein-junction, but this I am not quite sure without seeing the train-service<lb></lb>book. I had been in the practice, prior to the day, to send the coal<lb></lb>train off first from our Blackheath-station, but I was ordered by the head<lb></lb>porter to keep the coal-train, and send the empties off first, which was the cause of the train being kept at Charlton. During this time the traffic was very great, and I felt it was as much as I could do to attend to it properly. After the coal-train was gone, and I had given the 'line clear' to Anger<lb></lb>stein-junction, I had the 4.5 express-signal down, and after passing that on to Angeratein-junction, and receiving 'line clear,' I had the 420 express-signal down. Somebody at this time came running out of the Telegraph-office telling me there was a train waiting at Charlton; this message, together with the heavy traffic then taking place, caused me to get confused, and I gave the signal 'line clear.' I was so confused that I did not know what I was about; so much so that I was very much surprised to find it was the outside porter who had brought me the telegraph message out—I could have sworn it was one of the telegraph boys. After the 4.20 down express had passed our station, I thought I had done something wrong as regards the signalling. I immediately sent for Mr. Chapman, the station-master, to tell him of what I had done. I did not at that moment know of the accident He came down on the platform from his house, after half of the ballast-train had passed the station; he came to me, and I think I told him what had taken place as to my signalling. All would have gone well if I had been left alone, and not have received the telegraph message, which seemed wholly to confuse me. I took my eyes off the signals for a moment, and believed at the time I gave the signal 'line clear' that it was the right thing for me to do."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Mays, and live at Sands-end, Fulham. On Saturday evening, the 21st of July, I left my house, and went to a neighbour's—I returned at a quarter-past seven o'clock, and found the door locked as I had left it—I found the bread and bacon, and a girl's frock, gone from the front-room, and a shawl, a handkerchief, and boots from the back room—I know the prisoner—they call him Peter in the neighbourhood—after missing the things, I went to him and asked if he had been down to my house—he said no—I said, "Tell the truth, or I will charge a policeman with you"—he said I might if I liked, and on Sunday morning I gave him in charge—I have not found the things—I knew nothing of him before.</p>

             sworn. I am an apprentice to Mr. Fell. On the 15th of April the prisoner came into the shop to buy some leather, I saw him come in, I was at tea, I went to the back of the shop and called Mr. Fell's brother, I came in the shop as soon as I had my tea, he looked out some leather and I weighed it for him, it came to four shillings and eight pence, he paid me for them, he was then going away, when

             stopped him and told him he had got something under his coat that he had not paid for, I immediately went up to him and Mr. Fell pulled his coat of one side, and I pulled four aitch pieces of crop leather out of his pocket, the other crop aitch pieces was then in his hand which he had paid for, he then brought them back, put them on the counter, and demanded his money, which I gave him; I went for a constable, and he was secured.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was entrusted to work for the company I belonged to, I work in the same street under a window in a stall, my stall had been been broken open twice; ever since my shoes and leather I have carried home of a night, I had my leather in my pocket when I went into this shop, I was stooping down to pick out of this box what I wanted, my own leather in my pocket rather come forward, I put my hand to prevent it from falling out, they saw it, and charged me with taking it.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Renney) Do you know any thing of him. - A. I have always seen him at work at the stall, he bears a good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

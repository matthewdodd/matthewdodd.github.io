            . I apprehended the prisoner at Hoxton. I had been looking for him for a month - I asked if he had pawned any cloth; he said he had; but declined saying where. I asked him where Hargrave was. He would not say whether he was at his house or not. I said I was going to his house - he took me there. Hargrave was not there, he asked what I would advise him to do. I said truth went the furthest; he said if he told the truth, he should have a great deal to say.</p>

                  </hi>. On the evening of the 25th of January, I was going along the Commercial-road with my wife, between seven and eight o'clock, and just by Plumber's-row the prisoner met me in the breast—I felt two or three more surround us behind—I could feel them behind me pressing us close together—the prisoner was in front of me—there was a gas-light just over our heads—the prisoner's face was close to mine, and his body against mine—I could distinguish his countenance well, and I am certain he is the man—I told him to go on, or let me pass—with that I felt my watch com<lb></lb>ing up my fob—the prisoner had not touched me before that, only put his breast against mine—the persons behind were still touching me—I said, "You are after my watch, are you?"—I put my hand down to my watch first, and then said so—he made a sudden pull, and my chain parted from my watch, and he was gone in a moment down Plumber's-row—I had no seal—he got no thing but the chain and key—he ran off—the policeman came up directly, and went after him, and brought him back—he was not out of my sight at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 25th of January, I came up to the prosecutor, and saw the prisoner in front of him—there were two gas-lights right over his head—I had seen him about the street several times—I saw him snatch the chain from the prosecutor's fob—there were some persons behind him, but I could not distinguish them—I was in front of Brooks—I saw the prisoner snatch the chain, and run up Plumber's-row, and I after him—I never lost sight of him—I caught him about fifty yards from the row—I am quite sore of him.</p>

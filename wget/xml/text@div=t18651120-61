                  </hi>. I am ten years old next April—I live at Fountain-gardens, Lambeth-walk—on Wednesday, a few minutes before 2 o'clock, I saw the prisoner—he said that if I would get him a pennyworth of bread at Mr. Carless' shop, he would wait for me at the top of the street, and give me a halfpenny—he gave me a shilling, which I gave to Mrs. Carless—her son went out with me, and we saw the prisoner at the top of the street—he called to me, and when he saw there was somebody after me he ran round the corner and turned back again—MR. Carless' son ran after him and caught him, and he was given in custody.</p>

I am the wife of Robert Carless, a baker, of 96, Lambeth-walk—last Wednesday fortnight Lichfield came in for a penny-worth of bread, and gave me a bad shilling—I told my son to go out with him, and he got hold of the prisoner—I followed, and found my son holding him—I said, "What did you send this boy with a bad shilling for," he said; "It was not me"—I gave him in custody with the shilling.</p>

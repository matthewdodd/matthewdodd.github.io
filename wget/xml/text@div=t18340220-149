            . I am a farmer, and live in George-street, Sloane-square - I have a farm at Notting-hill - the prisoner has been about fifteen months in my employ as carter - I attend the market myself and sell my hay - he never sold hay for me with my consent, nor on my account- he was merely to drive it to market - I heard of this circumstance on the 3d of January, not before - the hay-cutter and another man told me of it - the prisoner had been turned away on the Saturday before; that is, he went away - he never paid me the two guineas, nor ever told me he had sold the hay - he was not authorized to sell it on my account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you brought your book here? A. No: when the hay is sold on credit I put it down - I took him up on Tuesday, the 3d of January, and he was tried in the other court.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he summoned you? A. No: he had been taken up two days before I had the summons - the hearing on the summons was on the Thursday in the same week - I knew nothing of the summons when I took him up - he summoned me for his wages - I have not paid the wages - he summoned me for 14s. 3d. - I owe him that, but I consider he has robbed me quite enough - I did not make that a debt - if he was sent with any hay, and the people paid him, he should pay me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. If he did not receive the money, did not he say he had sold the hay, and who to? A. Never.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If he took a load of hay to town, and sold in the neighbourhood, that would have been put down in the book, if he told you of it? A. Yes; there was two loads put down that day, but not this half-load.</p>

            . I am hay-cutter to the prosecutor - I remember, about the 3rd of October, cutting half a load of hay, by desire of the prisoner - it was put into my master's cart - I cannot tell where it went to - he told me he would give me a pot of beer to get up early in the morning to cut it - we drank the beer between us - I was paid for cutting the load.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who paid you? A. My master, on Saturday night - the hay went away at eight o'clock - it was broad daylight - my master's name was on the cart - I cut hay for the prisoner whenever he desired me.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody, on the 1st of January, at ten o'clock at night - he asked what he was taken for - I asked if he knew anything about selling half a load of hay for two guineas, and not giving an account of it - he said he had taken half a load of hay, and sold it for two guineas, but he paid his master for it in Hungerford market, when he took two more loads.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>). I wag with the last witness on 7th February—after Blackmore had been taken in custody, and when he was with me, he made a statement to me—we were walking along to Bethnal-green to get a cab—Mr. Foulger and the two Mr. Myers' were in front; we were talking about the silk, and Blackmore said that Mr. Myers knew it was wrong as well as he did—he said, "Did he tell you how much he gave me a pound for it?"—I said, "Yes, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said, "That's right"—he said, "How much is it worth?"—I said, "From 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a pound"—I asked him where he got it from—he said, "From a man in the Lane, as Myers would not buy it, only through another person"—on 9th February, I went to Herbert-street, Cambridge-road, Hackney, and there saw a person named Freaks—I had some conversation with Freaks, took him into custody, and took him to the prosecutor's premises in Newgate-street, in company with Foulger—Haddon was brought into the private office by Foulger, in the presence of Freaks, myself and another gentleman—Black-more was in custody, but was not there—as soon as Foulger came into the office with Haddon, he said to Freaks, "Is this the man who brought out the silk to you?"—he said, "Yes"—Foulger said, "Are you certain?"—he said, "I am certain"—Haddon said, "Silk! me! I know nothing at all about any silk"—we then took him into custody—I took Freaks to the station-house, and then we went to Haddon's lodgings with him, at 20, King-street, Clerkenwell—we searched the room, and found a bundle of things which were not identified—when we were about leaving the place, Haddon asked for one of us to go out first—he said it might be noticed by the neighbours, all three of us going out together—Foulger went out first with the bundle—Haddon then turned to his wife who was sitting in the chair, and was about to whisper to her—I said I could not allow that; what he said, I must hear—she said, "What is the meaning of all this, George?"—he said, "Say nothing, and know nothing"—I then took him to the station, where he was searched—nothing was found on him relative to this charge—he was then charged—on the second examination of Blackmore I went down into the cell, and he called me to him—he said, "I received the silk from Freaks, but I did not like to say anything about it, because he was my father-in-law"—I got this blue bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from 16, Luke-street, the residence of Freaks, who occupied a cellar there—he had got a few bundles of twigs or osiers there, to make baskets of; he seemed in a very poor state.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Willow-walk, Bermondsey, and am a ware houseman in the prosecutors' employ—Haddon was in their service as packer—he had been in their employment between five and six years—as packer, he had to attend to the packing-room—he had, among other things, to sweep out the silk department—he commenced sweeping about twenty minutes past 8 in the morning—he would ordinarily finish about twenty-five minutes to 9—in that silk-room there was a large quantity of silk in drawers, which were unlocked—nobody would be in that room at that time—during that time he would have access to those drawers in which the silk was—the silk kept in that room is similar, in every respect, to that which I saw at the police-court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid to Mr. Beeton, at the Nottingham Castle public-house, Angel-street, near Newgate-street—I knew Freaks—he had been a customer for the last 6 months—I knew Haddon—he had been a customer at the house the same time—they both came together—they generally came together, about 20 minutes or a quarter to 9 in the morning, and sometimes alone—I never noticed Freaks bring anything in his hand—he would sometimes, after he had been in the house, take an empty blue bag, like this, out of his pocket, folded up squarely—when they came together, they went sometimes in the tap-room, if there was nobody there; at other times they would stand at the back door—there is a side entrance which leads into a court; they used to stand on the steps—our tap-room is never full so early in the morning—there might be 2 or 3 in there—I recollect seeing Freaks in the tap-room with the bag open—Had<lb></lb>don and he were standing face to face—Haddon was holding the bag open—I cannot fix any time—I do not know how long it was ago—it might have been about 6 weeks before I first went up to Guildhall—Freaks was holding a bag open—Haddon was taking a parcel from his pocket and putting it in—they were whispering together—I was not near enough to see what it was that was being put into the bag—I did not take any notice; it was a square parcel, something like that book, only more round, and folded in whitish paper—I have often, at other times, seen that bag in Freaks' hand, after Haddon has come into the place—when they were going away, I have seen Freaks twist the bag round and put it under his arm—it was not full then, but it appeared to have something in it more than when it was first produced.</p>

I am a cap-maker of Craven-street, City-road—I knew Freaks for about two years—he was in the habit of bringing me silk, and beads, and braid—it commenced about ten months ago—the last time was in September—he brought some in a box, and some in a blue bag similar to this—he brought eight or nine lots, of sewing silk, of this description, three or four of braid, and two of beads, as near as I can recollect—I sold the beads to Mr. Cox, of Old-street, at, I think, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound; and the braid and the silk to Mr. Myers, of Old-street-road, at 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound—I sold one small parcel of beads to Mr. Rotherham—I received 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound from Mr. Myers—all those things I received from Freaks, and sold them on his account, on com<lb></lb>mission—he allowed me 5 per cent for selling them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the silk department for Messrs. Faudell and Phillips—I had the care of the silk which was kept on the first floor in drawers—I recognise these various articles which have been produced, as having been the property of Messrs. Faudell and Phillips—they have the name twisted through the silk—I have ascertained that there is over 100 lbs. of silk missing from the silk floor, the value of which is from 51<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to 73<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound wholesale price—there were three of us in the establishment, who were entirely employed in the silk department, myself a young man aged 20, and a lad—either of those might be left there alone—it might happen so in the ordinary course of things; it would be so, I have no doubt—it is very likely that more than once in every day the department might be left under charge of one person for a very short time; a few minutes—possibly the others might go out or might be called away to some other part of the house, from some cause or other—there was no employment of any kind by which one person would remain there alone—it might happen that one would be left there alone—the silk was kept in drawers—all the articles of this description were in that room, and kept in drawers—the braid would be kept in boxes—this is the kind of box we keep some of the braid in—all the same kinds of braid have the same kind of boxes—all the boxes are square, but they would not be all the same size.</p>

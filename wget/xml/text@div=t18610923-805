                  </hi>. I am a printer's compositor, in the service of Messrs Skipper and East, who are printers and stationers, carrying on business at St Dunstan's-hill, in the City—I was an apprentice there—I knew the prisoner's father—he was in the employ of Messrs. Skipper and East in the position of what is called overseer—he had the control of the printing department—the prisoner was in the employment of Messrs. Skipper and East, as assistant overseer in the letter-press printing department—he had been there all the time I had, which is about nine or ten years—I was twenty-three last June—I have not been under the prisoner during all the time I have been at work there;—I have been under him about four years—I remember in January last receiving an anonymous letter at my house, 35 Green-street, Stepney—I was in bed, ill, when the letter came—I had not been to work that day—I read the letter, and in consequence of its contests I dressed myself and went to the private house of the prisoner, at princes street, Barbican, with the letter—I showed it to him, and told him I had received it—he read it, not aloud, and then said it was all nonsense, and I was not to take any notice of it on any account whatever, it was all stuff and nonsense,—he also said, "Oh, let it be till the morning," and he would see about it, not to take any more notice of it, as it was of no conse<lb></lb>quence—I then went away—I believe Mr. Dredge had the letter—I left it with him—this was from 10 to 11 at night, I cannot say exactly—I did not go to business on the following morning—I cannot remember whether I saw the prisoner or not—he sent down for me, but I was out—I believe saw him a day or two afterwards, I cannot say the exact day, I did not keep a memorandum;—I believe it was a day or two afterwards—he said it was all settled; he had been to Mr. Skipper, and it was all set right—he said he should like to find out who it was, and he would offer a reward for it but Mr. Skipper advised him not to do so—he said he told Mr. Skipper he about return what things he had borrowed, that he was going to sell his business and Mr. Skipper had offered to purchase it of him—when I showed the letter to Mr. Dredge he said I need not take any notice of it, because in less than three months the scoundrel would be found out, or something to that effect—Dredge's father's name was mentioned in conversation—about a few days or a week after this I received another anonymous letter—it was sent to me at Mr. Smee's, in the Commercial-road—I saw the prisoner, and gave it to him—I do not think he read it—I think he tore it up directly he got it he looked at it—to the best of my belief he did not read it—he took it from me—I told him when I gave it to him that it had come to me, and he tore it up, and threw it into the fire—he said it was all nonsense, some malicious vagabond had written the letter—I sent for him to Aldgate to give him this second letter—he came to me as I was unwell—I do not live there—I lived</p>

               <p>then at 35, Green-street, Stepney—he came to me in Aldgate, at a coffee-house there—after that he sent for me to go to his house to see Mr. Brad<lb></lb>stock to satisfy me that there was nothing whatever in it.</p>

Skipper and East's premises; near where the prisoner sat—I afterwards saw that parcel at the police-court, produced by the officer—the value of it was from 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a day or two afterwards the prisoner gave me directions to get a fount of Bourgeois Roman type—I did so, packed it up, and wrote on it the same as I did on the other, "Must not be opened," by Mr. Dredge's directions—I packed up from fifty to eighty pounds in weight of that type, which was from 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in value—I carried some of that Bourgeois Roman to the prisoner's premises, at 36, Crutched-friars—they are at the back of Palmer and Button's, printers and stationers—Mr. Dredge's name was not up at all—it had Palmer and "Sutton Printing-Office" up over the door, but Mr. Dredge carried his business on there—a few days after this the prisoner gave me directions to go to Messrs. Caslons,' who are letter-founders in Chiswell-street—I have seen some of the packages of Bourgeois Roman type produced at the police-court by the officer—I identified those that I packed up, the Bourgeois Italic and the Bourgeois Roman—a day or two afterwards the prisoner gave me this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave it to him first and he made an addition to it—he told me to write out what sorts were wanted to com<lb></lb>plete the fount at Messrs. Skipper's, and also to complete the fount they were getting up for him—I wrote upon that card some description of type, to complete the fount—I filled in the letters and the prisoner filled in the quan<lb></lb>tities on the card—he told me to take it on to Messrs. Caslons' and to bring enough type to complete the fount that he wanted—I then took this card on to Messrs. Caslons' and got from them a small package of type—that was on Skipper and East's responsibility—Mr. Dredge sent me for it on their account—I got an invoice with the type—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a small quantity coming to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and it is made out to Skipper and East—I took it to their premises direct from Messrs. Caslons'—I saw the prisoner at Skipper and East's, opened the packet, and he told me to take it round to his premises—I took it round some time afterwards—when I went with the officer, when the prisoner's premises were taken possession of, I found this identical package there—I kept possession of the invoice for my own satis<lb></lb>faction—the date of it is 7th May.</p>

               <p>served my time there—I am still in the employment—I think it is fact that I bear a very high character there—I think that type of Caslons' is here or at the police-station—Messrs Skipper and East have not got it—is has never been used at all—I found it in the very identical state in which it was when I brought it from Messrs. Caslons'—Mr. Dredge's father was in the employment of Messrs. Skipper and East, I have heard, for fifty-four years—I believe young Mr. Skipper's father is alive—I have not seen him this last week or two—I do not think he is dead—he is about sixty years of age, I think—I cannot say whether it was two or three months ago when I last saw him—I did not see him at the Mansion house—I will swear that—I have not seen him at Mr. Humphrey's the solicitor's—I do not know whether it was in the street or in the shop that I last saw him—he looked very well—I have not spoken to him since the day I was apprenticed in 1854—I do not think he attends to the business, I have not seen him—the young gentleman is 23—I know that because he swore it at the Mansion-house—I have spoken to him since my apprenticeship, but I never saw him for two or three years after; I last saw him, last night at the place of business—the Bourgeois Italic, and the Bour<lb></lb>geois Roman type that I wrote on "Must not be opened," was never opened or used—Dredge told me he wanted to use them for a certain job when it came in—he had to chance getting the job, he hoped to get it—I think I am on friendly terms with him—I have not spoken to him since his apprenchen<lb></lb>sion—before that we were on friendly terms—I had no unfriendly feeling towards him; I am sure of that—I had not a friendly feeling towards him; I had no feeling—I have no enmity towards him whatever—I treat him as I do anybody else—I know that directly after the fire at Skipper and East's, in March, 1860, Mr. Dredge did a few jobs for them, not before to my knowledge—he had a middling stock of type for the use of his office it was a very small office; he employed an apprentice and an errand boy—he did not employ two or three men—I have worked there myself, for Mr. Dredge, but I was in Messrs. Skippers' employ—I did not work for them, not after the fire—I do not know that Mr. Dredge lent the whole of his type to them after the fire—I am sure he did not, he did his own work—I will swear that he did not—I do not know whether old Mr. Skipper is here, he may be; I don't know that he has purposely abstained from being here—all Skipper and East's type was destroyed by the fire, except one or two forms—Mr. Dredge printed the work they had to do after the fire—I know that, I am sure of it, at his office, and with his type—I did not work there myself, I believe one or two of Skipper and East's men were send down—there were a great many orders on hand at the time of the fire—the prisoner's father has left since this affair—I really do not know whether young Mr. Skipper is here himself—I have seen him this morning, within the last hour or hour and half—I cannot swear that he is here now—I know of a printing job for a Mr. Strawmeyer, a label for some cement barrels a portion of that job was printed at his office—I swear I do not know that Keeling's price current was printed from Mr. Dredge's type, it might have been; to the best of my belief it was not printed on Skipper and East prem<lb></lb>ises—I know that Ellis' broadside was printed by Mr. Dredge for skipper and East at his place—there is a person named Smith, a store-keeper, in their employ—I did not see him at the Mansion-house, he has gone now, he was there two or three days after the prisoner's committal—I have not heard that Mr. Humphreys has examined Smith three or four times—I should have heard it if it were so—printing was going on at Mr. Dredge's for one</p>

Skippers'—type deteriorates in Take by being used, it wastes; none of the Bourgeois Roman and Italic has been used, the panels hare never been opened—I do not know that the type that has been used by Mr. Dredge has been returned to Skipper and East's, I have been told that it has, I can't swear that it has—there was a young man named Tutt, an apprentice of Mr. Dredge's, he was examined at the Man<lb></lb>sion-house—old Mr. Skipper has never been examined to my knowledge—I do not know that a certain printing, called royal-broadside, for a Mr. Bate, was done at Dredge's, or that some was done for a Mr. Stamp—I believe some for Drake was done there, I cannot say—I know that some broadside for Ellis and Son was done—the prisoner was not supplied by Mr. Dredge—I know that he printed some royal headings for the Bank of Austria, at his own place, for Messrs. Skipper and East—I do not known any<lb></lb>thing of a copper-plate press that was destroyed in the fire, and which he his never been paid for—I have heard that old Mr. Dredge used to carry on the business before his son did—I do not know that he was in the con<lb></lb>stant habit of sending type to Skipper and East—I occasionally worked on type belonging to Skipper and East, or Dredge, on Dredge's premises.</p>

I manage the business of Skipper and East—it is my father's business entirely—he does not take an active part in the manage<lb></lb>ment of it—I have managed, going on for four years—my father is very infirm and unwell—he is not in a fit state to come here to be examined—the prisoner's father was in the employment of our firm, and had been for a great number of years—the prisoner was also in our employment, as assistant-overseer in the letter-press printing department, at a salary of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, paid weekly—I was aware of the fact that he carried on a small printing business himself—he had no authority from us at any time to remove any type from our premises at all—I recollect the period of the fire which destroyed the greater part of our type—during that period we were obliged to send out our work to be done elsewhere, and employed seventeen or eight<lb></lb>teen different printers—among others so employed was the prisoner—I had nothing to do with the order, the order was given by his father; I had nothing to do with that department in any way—I know as a fact that he did it—I know that an account was sent in for what he did; I have seen these accounts—they are not in his handwriting, they are in the writing of Donkinson, who was in our employment—the receipt is in the prisoner's handwriting—I cannot be certain whether these papers contain the whole of the work that he did, because I do not know what orders were given—as for at I know he was paid for all the work he did, and as far as I know there are no other accounts than these—I rather fancy that there was another account, I cannot say to what amount—to the best of my belief all the accounts have been paid—no claim whatever has been made—we got our premises to rights again about the beginning of this year—we have always carried on the printing business there—it has been done at No. 2 instead of No. 1, St Dunstan's-hill—we ceased to send out work to be done elsewhere soon after the fire—I think there was some printing done at Dredge's premises in June, after the fire; not later than that to my knowledge—he had no authority, after that time, to take type to his premises from ours, or at any time—I recollect hearing of an anonymous letter having been sent to Sills; the prisoner spoke to me about it—I did not ask him what the nature of it was, he informed me—that was in June last year—he told me that one of the apprentices had received an anonymous communication, accusing him of acting very dishonestly towards us, and he told me that in the emergency of the fire he had to borrow certain type of us, which he undertook should be returned—I told him that I would consider the matter, which I did; I gave him no answer at first—the following morning I spoke to his father—I did not tell the prisoner what passed between me and his father—I may have spoken to the prisoner again about it, but I do</p>

               <p>not recollect—I received these two letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) almost directly after the communication was made to me, and after I had seen the prisoner's fetter—the letters were sent down by hand, I suppose—they came in separate envelopes—this is the letter purporting to come from George Dredge—(<hi rend="italic">This was addressed to the witness, enclosing the anonymous letter, thanking him for the interpretation put upon the unpleasant matter, and stating that he had made arrangement with the storekeeper</hi>)—I received the letters both together; they may have been sent together—I do not know whether or not after that some type was returned—I never made any inquiry—up to the time of the anonymous letter I was not acquainted with the fact that any type had been taken.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You know, do you not, from your father, that the prisoner's father was fifty-four years in the employment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was thirty-five years there—I do not know whether that was at the commencement of the firm—there is not a gentleman named East in the firm—there was once—I have managed the business going on for four years—I managed it soon after I was twenty—it is more than three years—I never knew Mr. Dredge, sen. to manage the business—Mr. East did so before me, and my father managed the business up to the time that Mr. East took the management—that was about twenty years ago—my father has not managed the detail of the business since then—he has not come regularly—I last saw my father this morning—he is not at all well—he is not bedridden—he is able to walk out—he does not go out every day—he did not take any part in the proceedings at the Mansion House—he was not in court there—he was at the Mansion House one day for about a quarter of an hour—he has not been examined by Mr. Humphreys—I am certain of that—he has not seen him at all—instructions were given by my father to me, and from me to Mr. Humphreys—my father was last at business about a month ago—that is since the prisoner's apprehension—he has sot more than a general counting-house there—Mr. Dredge, sen. received a salary of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year for managing the letter department of the business, and my father used to make him presents from time to time—he made him a present of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. last year—that was my father's doing—my father and I consulted together—my father very seldom comes to business—he has not been here at all during this trial—I have not been advised by Mr. Humphreys to keep him away—Mr. Humphreys was very anxious for him to come—we have a person named Smith in our employment as store keeper—I do not keep the books—I interfere with the active management of the business—the prisoner's father was deputed to order the types—I was not aware the prisoner had done so frequently, till these proceedings—I believe he has been twenty-eight years in our service—he gave us notice to leave three years ago, but not unless we raised his salary—he had 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week then, and his salary was raised to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-week—before that time I had nothing to do with the salary he was receiving—it came from his father—he was receiving journeymans' wages—he worked very hard after the fire—I shook hands with him—I don't remember saying I would never forget him—I thought that he had worked very hard—he was there several Sundays—I was there too—I do not know of this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) being printed at our place—we have never been paid for the printing of it to my knowledge—Smith, the store-keeper, was examined by Mr. Humphreys—I don't know whether he went to his office on two or three occasions—he was not called as a witness—he was dismissed, to the best of my recollection, four or five weeks after the apprehension of Mr. Dredge—a person named May dismissed him with our</p>

               <p>sanction—my father did not dismiss him—he knew of hit dismissal—he was not consulted about it—it was by the advice of Mr. Humphreys that we dismissed him—I believe the prisoner undertook that everything that had been taken should be returned, and that if any had been damaged we should have new in their place; something of that sort—everything was satisfactorily arranged—I have heard since that there was a copper-plate press belonging to the prisoner on our premises at the time of the fine—I was not aware of it at the time—if it was there it was destroyed—no chains was mode to me about it in any way.</p>

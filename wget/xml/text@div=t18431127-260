                  </hi>. I am a Greenwich pensoiner. On the 23rd of Nov. I saw the prisoner and Jolliffe opposite the brew office—I heard the prisoner fall, and on turning round saw him lying with his head towards the deceased's feet—I saw the deceased stoop and <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> the prisoner's head several times against the ground—he got up and struck the deceased, who struck him again—they entered into an angry parley, as far as I could see—I was on the opposite side of the way—the prisoner stood with his hand back in a threatening attitude, and after a few seconds he struck the deceased under the left ear—he stood a few seconds, and then fell on the side he received the blow—they endeavoured to raise him up, but he appeared to have no life in him, and died within a few seconds—the prisoner was handed over in custody to the guard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant-surgeon at Greenwich-hos<lb></lb>pital. On the 24th of Nov. I saw the deceased's body, and examined the head—I found a very slight mark on the left temple—on opening the head, I found nothing worthy of remark under that mark—the lungs were con<lb></lb>gested in the highest degree, which I believe to be the cause of death, conse<lb></lb>quent on organic disease of the heart—the slightest exertion would be sufficient to produce it—I believe the blow he received might produce that excitement, which would cause the congestion—there was a diseased heart originally, and the blow coming upon that caused the death—the excitement threw an increased quantity of blood to the heart—he might have died with<lb></lb>out the blow—I am not able to say that the blow killed him—there must have been some excitement—passion might have occasioned his death, exclu<lb></lb>sive of the blow.</p>

The prisoner had been in my service nearly three months; the money was taken out of a private drawer; the officer found a sovereign on her - I never had suspicion of her before, but I had lost money. On the night in question I heard the keys of my private drawer rattle - I was in the bar, and looked back; I saw her hand in the drawer, which was half open; in this drawer I keep my purse and brewer's books; I drew her away, and asked what business she had there - she then put her hand into her bosom, and pulled up her gown. I said to my wife, "She has robbed me, and put something into her bosom;" the prisoner said she would not be searched except by an officer; the officer did search her afterwards, and a sovereign dropped from her clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you see the sovereign drop from her person? A. No - the room is carpeted where she was searched; it was possible for the sovereign to drop without being heard or seen. I never said I saw it drop; she said she had only half a crown, which her sister gave her. When the sovereign fell she said, "There it is;" the bar in size is four yards by six yards; no person was in the bar but the prisoner and me; she was about six feet from me when she rattled the keys.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. My husband has spoken the truth about the sovereign; the prisoner refused to go up stairs at first, but said she would follow me; I took her to my room - when I said, "For God's sake, let me see what you have got in your bosom, and tell me the truth, and you shall not be hurt;" she said she would not be searched by a woman, but if an officer would come she would strip naked; when he did come she stripped very indecently; she was not left a moment after the robbery, before the officer came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not your husband very passionate at the time? A. Yes - I never quitted her; during the time we were in the room she had a nap - she had taken a little liquor, and was dosey; she had been out to buy butter that day, which is kept in a safe on the stairs, and not in the bar; it was a silk purse, with a snap, from which she took the money; the drawer was locked, but the keys were in it.</p>

            . I went to the prosecutor's, and found the prisoner there; I searched her, and stripped her of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250061"></xptr>part of her clothes; she told me she had only half a crown when I went - I saw the sovereign drop down on the carpet - Mrs. Edwards picked it up; the prisoner then said it was her own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was no other person in the room besides Mr. and Mrs. Edwards? A. No; I did not observe the prisoner act indecently; I helped her to pull her gown off, and she pulled off her petticoat herself.</p>

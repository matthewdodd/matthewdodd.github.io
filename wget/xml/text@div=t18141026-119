            . I am a soldier in the third regiment of guards. The prisoner informed me he was discharged from the marines on the 10th of October. I left my overalls in my room about one o'clock; the jacket did not belong to me, it was taken from the barrack room where I sleep in the Tower. My overalls were taken out my box under my own bed. I put them in my box on the 10th, about one o'clock in the afternoon; on the following morning I went to put them on to go on parade, they were gone. In the morning when I complained I had lost my overalls, a man complained he had lost his jacket. The prisoner was taken in custody on the evening of the 19th, I saw him in the guard-room; I asked him where my overalls were, and the jacket, when he informed me they were in a house in Westminster, he had left them there, and I might have them if I would call for them at a house the right-hand side in Tothill-street, where they sold old clothes. I went to the house and enquired for a pair of overalls and a regimental jacket; the jacket has been found since. I was stopped thirteen shillings and sixpence out of my pay for them. I had them, I know, the day before.</p>

I left the barrack-room at six o'clock in the evening; I returned to the barrack-room at nine o'clock; my jacket was gone. William Street bought the jacket. I have seen the jacket since; this; is the jacket; I went into the barrack-room where William Street slept; I saw the jacket, and claimed it immediately. Street is a soldier in the same regiment of guards.</p>

            . I keep a clothes-shop, 31, Tothill-street. I bought the jacket and a pair of overalls of a dark man. I cannot swear it was the prisoner; I cannot tell the day of the month I bought it. I bought it about a fortnight before I sold it to the soldier. The prisoner is like the man I bought the jacket and overalls of; he said they were not his own, they were his father's. I put them out of doors the next morning; I sold the overalls to an old clothes man; I gave three shillings for the jacket and overalls.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of Cannon-street and Nicholas-lane; one shop leads into the other; the Nicholas-lane shop is a pork butcher's. The prisoner was my shopman four or five months before 4th Jan.; his duty was to serve customers—if an article was sold to a customer where we had an account, the prisoner's duty was to call out the weight, and if the person was going to pay, to call out the weight and the price it was sold for, and the party purchasing would pay for it at the counter—the prisoner had decided instructions not to receive money, he had directions to send the customer to the counting-house—I believe it never happened during the hours of business that there was nobody in the counting-house—on the evening of 3rd Jan., I made a communication to the inspector at the Bow-lane station, and handed him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of my own money—there were two half-crowns and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was at my business on 4th Jan., and saw persons in my counting-house attending to my business—my wife, my son-in-law, and a lad named Davis, serve in the counting-house, which overlooks both shops—I know that my son-in-law and Davis were there on that afternoon, between 3 and 4 o'clock—I was upstairs at the time—a communication was made to me; I went to the station-house and saw some sausages, they were worth 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

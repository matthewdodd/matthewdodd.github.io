On the 3d of March, she came to me, and produced a letter, purporting to come from her uncle, inviting her to come to Manchester to live with him, and he would support her. I observed that it had no postmark on it - she said her cousin brought it. Next day I gave her two petticoats, a pair of shoes and stockings, and a shawl - she said she should want 20 s. to pay her expences on the road; I told her I must see her cousin. She brought a countryman, and introduced him to me as her cousin - I then gave her 1 l. She came to me again on the 20th in a most wretched state. I took her before the Lord Mayor, and found the clothes that I gave her at the pawnbrokers in town.</p>

            . I am a pauper in the workhouse. I know the man that the prisoner produced as her cousin - he is not so. He persuaded her to write the letter; she did not go to Manchester, but she went to Crayford in Kent, with me, the other man and his wife - she then returned to the workhouse.</p>

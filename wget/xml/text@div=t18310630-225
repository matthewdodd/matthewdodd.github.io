            . I was at the Camden Head at seven o'clock that morning - I saw the prisoner in the taproom, sitting alongside the prosecutor; the prisoner said,"There is a man had known me from infancy - will you drink?" I said, "No, Bill, I will not;" I had known the prisoner; I did not see him take any sovereign, but I saw his head on the table - he went out, and I followed him; he crossed to go to Camden-street - I went to my breakfast; I went to the Camben Head again at eleven o'clock and the prosecutor was there then - he told me of this; I sent Glibbery, who took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>SUMUEL MARTIN. I am a weaver. I went into the Camden Head about seven o'clock; the prosecutor and prisoner were there - the prisoner said the prosecutor had some money, and was spending it foolishly - he said he had a sovereign in his coat pocket; the prisoner went out, came in again, and sat down on the left-hand side of the prosecutor - I then went away.</p>

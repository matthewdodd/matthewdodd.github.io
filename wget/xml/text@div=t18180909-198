On the 16th of August, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went to work, and left the prisoner Whitty, and Shoales, in my room; I had taken Whitty in the night before to sleep with me, out of compassion, I returned about eleven and the waistcoat was then gone; next morning I saw the waistcoat in the prisoner, Hibbard's window - She keeps a clothes shop in Turk's-row. I went in, told her it was mine, and that it had been stolen the morning before. She told me to go about my business, for I should not have it; she said she had bought it on Saturday, for sixpence-it was not stolen until Sunday. I offered her sixpence to return it - She refused. About half an hour after I saw the prisoner Whitty, and gave him in charge. I asked him where he sold it? he took me to Hibbard's. I again claimed it, but she would not return it. It is worth 2s.</p>

I live at 28, Cambridge Road—I am a tailor—on the evening of 2nd June, about 5 o'clock, I was in Orange Street, Bethnal Green—three persons came behind me, and roughly brushed me over the left shoulder—I looked round at them; one made a blow at my breast—they snatched my chain—the chain broke, and they took my watch—the prisoner was the man who seized my watch—he ran away—I turned to run after him, and the other two men put their legs out and threw me on the stones—I sprang up and ran after him to the bottom of Orange Street—he turned round to see if I was following, and I saw him again—he turned round two or three times—I followed him to Virginia Row, and he got away—I did not follow him further—my watch was worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on Monday, the 7th, a policeman came to me, and I went to the station—I saw the prisoner there—I picked him out of seven or eight others.</p>

I keep the Royal Oak public house, Turville-street, Bethnal-green—on Sunday, 14th Jan., there were no customers whatever in my house in the forenoon between 10 and 1 o'clock—my attention was called to the day, in consequence of my receiving a summons on the 17th—at a quarter past 11 o'clock, there was nobody in the house but my own family—there was my wife, my daughter, my wife's mother, and a man named Morgan, who was at work, repairing the engine—he is a gas fitter, and brass finisher—lodgers slept there, but they were not there at that time; I think they left somewhere about 11 o'clock—the beer engine was all to pieces—Morgan came somewhere about 10 o'clock, purposely to repair the engine; I had engaged with him the night before—he had finished repairing it, between 12 and 1 o'clock—before he had finished it, it was not in a state in which beer could be drawn from it; the last thing he did was to connect the pipes—the defendant came somewhere about 11 o'clock—I let him in—the engine was taken to pieces at that time—I did not draw a glass of ale while I was there, I could not—I saw him leave, I held the door open all the time he was in—I am sure no one shut the door in his face, nor did I—nobody could have done so, without my seeing them—when the defendant came, Morgan was in the cellar—the defendant was dressed as a policeman—there was not a girl at my door, letting people in and out—the only girl in the house was my daughter, she is here—it is not true, that in a quarter of an hour twenty-three persons came out; I do not think the door was opened after the policeman went out—I do not think the two lodgers were in the house when the policeman came in—I do not know what time they left—one of them is here, his name is Bryant—I do not know where the other is; I have endeavoured to find him, but he has left his situation and gone, I do not know where—there is only one engine—I had not a servant girl in the house on that day, I had discharged her on the Sunday previous—I saw the policeman some distance off, when I was out for about five minutes—I had seen him before, he has been to my house pretty well every Sunday.</p>

I was at home on Sunday, 14th Jan.—my mother, my husband, my daughter, and my little children, were in the house—there were two lodgers, but they went out in the course of the morning, about 10 o'clock, or half-past—I was up stairs most of the time, between 10 and 1 o'clock—we dined about half-past 1 o'clock—I came down several times, once while my husband was standing, with the door in his hand, to let the policeman out—I asked what was the matter, and he said that the policeman had just gone into the taproom—Morgan was in the cellar, doing something to the pipes—no beer was drawn after 10 o'clock that morning—twenty-three people could not have been in the house without my knowing it—during the whole morning I saw nobody but my own family and the policeman—we had no servant there; she left on the Tuesday before—I let nobody in or out.</p>

               <p>Church-street, Bethnal Green, just opposite the Royal Oak beer shop—I was in Mr. Knight's service up to 16th Jan., as servant of all work—on Sunday, 14th Jan., after 10 o'clock, I was standing at the side door (the front door faces the top of Turville-street)—it is a corner house—I was standing there to let people in and out, and I did so—I remained standing there till about 11 o'clock—I cannot exactly tell how many people I let in, but about twenty—they were strangers; customers—I let some out—at 11 o'clock I was sent with Mr. Knight's child to its aunt's, a few doors off—while I left, the daughter, Lucy Knight, took charge of the side door—I was going back, and saw the policeman on the other side of the way; they call him Mr. Hall—he was in uniform—I did not go back, because the door was shut when the policeman was in the street—I knew that that was to be so—before I went out with the child, I had seen the policeman through the crack of the front door, for, as near as I can guess, above five minutes, and he moved away from the corner, and went round Nicholl-street, which would take him into Charlotte-court—he could still see the side door there—when I came back, after leaving the child, he was still against Charlotte-court—he had a view of the side door—I went up to my mother's, but before that I saw the daughter go in and shut the door—I looked through my mother's window, and saw the policeman knocking at the side door—I still kept looking, and Mr. Knight came up to the door, knocked at the door, and they let him in, and the policeman went in at the same time—I had seen Mr. Knight before that, he was in the street—he went into the street to watch for the police—he always used to go out on Sunday mornings to watch for the police—he had told me that morning to mind the door, to watch and see that I did not let any police in—I am certain that I saw Mr. Knight go up to the door, and that he was let in; it was not Mr. Knight who let the policeman in—I had seen the beer engine before I went out with the child; it was all right, as far as I know, and not taken to pieces—I know Morgan by sight as a customer—I did not see him there that morning, nor in the cellar; there could not be any one there; it was all in darkness—there is gas in the cellar, but it was not lighted that morning—the entrance is just by the side door, and I must have moved away, to let anybody go down by the flaps into the cellar—I could see from there if the gas was alight, because it would shine through the boards—at the time I went out to take the child, there were about twenty people in the house, as far as I could tell—they had been drinking there—I did not let any of them out before I went—I do not know where they put them to, when the policeman went up to the door—supposing people are put into the cellar, they can get through the cellar to the next door—I have seen that done—there was once a mode of getting through from the attic also—I mean it was done once—it is not true, that I was dismissed for stealing from my master: if he has said so, it is not true; nor was it for dishonesty—he made no charge of any kind against me, at the time I left—I went there at a moment's notice, and left at a few hours' notice—I went to my mother's, and went to work for Mr. Barrington four weeks afterwards—Mr. Knight knew I was there—he asked me last night if I was coming up here, he said, "Ann, are you going up to-morrow?"—I said, "Going up to-morrow, Mr. Knight? no"—he said that he had heard I was, and if I could not agree with the daughter, what did I want to injure him and Mrs. Knight for—I had not quarrelled with the daughter, but she did not seem to like me while I was there—he said, "If you do go up, it will be the worse for</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master carpenter, and live at No. 39, Turville-street, Bethnal-green, next door to the Royal Oak; I have lived there pretty well two years. I recollect Sunday, 14th Jan., quite well—I remember looking out at my window, about 11 o'clock, and saw the prisoner standing at the corner right opposite, in uniform, very attentively watching the beer shop—he remained there I dare say twenty minutes, as near as I can tell—he then went round Nicholl-street, and round to the back out of Charlotte-court—he could see the side door from there—while he was there, about twenty people came out of the side door of the public house—I did not count them—they came out one at a time, as if somebody was standing at the door passing them; and then there would be a pause, and then three or four more would come, and sometimes five or six at a time—I saw the con<lb></lb>stable at that time looking down from the court, and I said, "The constable can see them"—my attention was afterwards drawn to a paragraph in a newspaper by one of my workmen, and I thought of the day in question directly, because I thought I would notice whether the policeman sum<lb></lb>moned the man for it; I went to the Leman-street station to make it known, because I knew that the policeman was innocent—I was taken to an attorney's clerk, who took down my statement—I do not suppose I have spoken half a dozen words to Mr. Knight in my life—I have seen people go out of the attics—I saw them on the tiles, getting from one roof to another, when I came out of the water closet one day—I have seen people going from his house to the next house—I have no interest in this matter; I went up voluntarily—I never had a quarrel with Mr. Knight.</p>

               <p>prisoner was committed, I went to the station—I do not suppose I have seen the prisoner six times in my life, only by coming in and out—I live next door to Mr. Knight—I do not very often get my beer there, we do sometimes; we do not drink a great deal, we send sometimes to M'Cann's, and sometimes to Knight's—my window was open, and I was leaning out—I do not suppose Mr. Knight's house was above twenty-four feet from the policeman; he was standing at the corner nearly twenty minutes, or a little more, one way or the other—I do not know whether it was exactly 11 o'clock when I went to the window—I may have seen the servant girl Humm, but not to know her much—I did not notice her come out—I noticed nobody come out with a child; I was looking at the opposite corner to see if the policeman <hi rend="italic">bobbed</hi> back again—I did not leave the window till I had seen about twenty people come out; I remained there a little better than twenty minutes—when the prisoner was gone, as I thought, they let the people out, but he was not two minutes before he was round again—I said that I saw him at the corner twenty minutes, as near as I could tell—the policeman was not at the corner when the people were coming out—when he went away from the corner, nut two minutes elapsed, I was surprised to see him round so quick—I did not see any people go in, only coming out—a soli<lb></lb>citor, I think they termed him, took my evidence down in writing; I was directed to him by a policeman from the station—I went to the solicitor on Tuesday, yesterday week, that was the first time I saw him; it was not last Friday that the prisoner was committed, it was in last Monday week's paper, which I was referred to—the solicitor said that he would put down what I could say, if I had no objection—I had no money, not a farthing, I went voluntarily—I have not been promised any—I am in work, but am not able to follow it up because my hand has got poisoned, or got a splinter in it—I know the girl Harriett Humm, but have never hardly spoken to her, only. just to nod and pass the compliments of the day—I have spoken to her since this case has been on, but hardly ever before—I did so one day last week, I think it was Friday—she said, "It is a bad job about this police<lb></lb>man"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "I should like to go, and make known. what I know of the case;" I said, "I have done it myself," and she said that she should like to go and state what she knew—I said, "I will take you to where I went," and I did take her—I did not go to her, she was talking to my mistress at the door, and they together brought up the case—I think it was last Thursday—I do not know whether my mistress called her or not, but they were talking at the door—I know that this was on Sun<lb></lb>day the 14th, because I looked particularly, to see whether the policeman would summons him for that day—my attention was drawn to it after I heard that the summons was dismissed—that is four or five weeks ago.</p>

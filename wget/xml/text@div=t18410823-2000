                  </hi>. I am inspector of the D division of police. On Saturday, the 17th of July, about nine o'clock in the evening I went to No. 9, Plumtree-court, Shoe-lane, with Fink, Farrow, and Humphries, police-constables—the street-door was open—I went to the front room, second floor—the room-door was fastened by a small table being against it—I forced it open, went in, and the prisoners were there—Beckwith was sitting on a chair in front of a clear fire, with nothing on but his trow<lb></lb>sers—he had no shirt on—he had what appeared to be a white mould in his left hand, made of plaster of Paris—immediately that I went in he threw it on the floor, jumped on it, and broke it into several pieces, then laid hold of an iron spoon which was between the bars of the fire, the bowl of which was red hot and full of white metal in a fluid state, he threw the contents all about the floor, and at the same time, with the other hand, swept a quantity of counterfeit sixpences off the table—part of the metal which was thrown from the spoon was picked up—I took up nine sixpences myself, two of them quite hot—I picked up several pieces of the plaster of Paris which he threw down, but they had no impression on them—the prisoner Foot was standing up, with her gown off, washing at the table—she cried out, "You b—r, <hi rend="italic">Jack,</hi> you b—y b—, you have sold us, but we will tell, you b—, where you make"—she said this to several prostitutes, who were at the door, which was open—there was no man there—<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> is a man they know among themselves—Beckwith made use of similar language several times, saying, "It is that b—y b—r, <hi rend="italic">Jack,</hi> that has sold us."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Beckwith</hi>. I was standing up when you came in, did you find the spoon in the fire? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, you pulled it out.</p>

I went with Penny—I entered the room at the same time as him, and saw Beckwith sitting in a chair in front of a very clear fire, about three feet from it—he had something white in his left hand, which he threw down, jumped on it, and broke it into se<lb></lb>veral pieces—I laid hold of him—at the same time he took from between the bars of the grate an iron spoon with metal in a fluid state, and threw it up, the contents of which I took off the floor, and at the same time he swept off the table a quantity of counterfeit sixpences with his hand—he was sitting between the table and fire-place—I afterwards picked up some of the fragments of what he threw down—two of them have letters on them—I produce a counterfeit sixpence, and part of a <hi rend="italic">get,</hi> separated from a sixpence, I have a sixpence which it fits—I took up the sixpence myself—it was quite hot, and so was the <hi rend="italic">get</hi>—I picked up some of the white metal which he threw from the spoon, and produce it—I searched him, and found a knife in his trowsers' pocket—it has some white spots on it similar to plaster-of-Paris—when I entered the room, Foot was standing at a small table, washing—it was the same table as the sixpences were on—the tub was at one end, and the sixpences at the other—Foot said it was that <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> had sold them, and she would sell him, for she knew where he made them—Beckwith used similar expressions—they were both taken into custody.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Prisoner's Council. You made the exchange with him? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What may you be? - I am a butcher, I thought this horse would do for me, for he would draw; he said he had it from a butcher.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have been in Court all the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you know of this horse that your brother bought? - The prisoner went by the name of Jones in our country, and he called upon me one morning, he had a horse that would suit, I went with him, but he wanted to sell the horse, this farmer wanted to try him, and he put him into a cart and drew him, but they did not deal, and I believe the very same day was fair day, and the next day my brother appointed to meet with him, and Jones recommended my brother to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. So he did this as publicly as any man could do, for he took you for a witness.</p>
               <p>Mr. LANGHORN sworn.</p>
               <p>We know you are a very considerable dealer in horses? - My father keeps a repository.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - We have sold for him within these two years a great number of horses, and likewise he has bought several in the fair way of dealing.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long have you known the prisoner? - About six or eight months.</p>
               <p>When did he deal with you last? - I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>What name did he go by? - Lloyd.</p>
               <p>Court. Is Aldridge here? - No, it is his selling day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask Mr. Horam whether he bought the horse by day or night? - By day, the 26th day on the road.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I sold him the horse on the 25th, at the Five Bells, at Shaftsbury, where I always use to quarter.</p>
               <p>Horam. I was not in the house that day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, we did apply to put of this trial till the next Sessions.</p>
               <p>(The Jury desired to withdraw.)</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. I think Gentlemen you ought to take it into your consideration when you go out, that it is too much for us here to ask him how he came by the horse, we cannot put such a question to the prisoner, we ought not to do it; at the same time he has made affidavit that there is a person he bought it of, and he has requested<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140147"></xptr> that he might have time to bring that person here, but the Court in my absence refused to put off the trial.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The man made affidavit with a subpoenae annexed to it, for a Mr. Grassman by name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton. The reason why the Court would not put off the trial was, he swore that he was advised, he was material witness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Advised and believes; he was advised by me that such a witness would be a very material one, therefore he believed it to be true.</p>
               <p>The Jury withdrew some time, and returned with a verdict</p>

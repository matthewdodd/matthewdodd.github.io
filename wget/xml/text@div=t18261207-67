On Wednesday, the 29th of November, the prisoner came alone into the shop, about half-past one o'clock, and asked to look at some cambric muslin - I was serving three distinct customers at the time - there was a shopman there - nothing was shown to her; I desired her to walk lower down the shop and I would attend upon her - I suspected her, and watched her as minutely as I could - I saw her reach over the counter, just opposite a pile of Irish linen; I shortly saw her lay hold of something, but could not see what it was - she put it under her left arm, and walked down the shop, concealing it under her shawl - I could just see the end of it; she attempted to walk out, and when she came opposite me, I asked if she had been served - she said, No - I said, "I will serve you directly;" she said, "No, I will call again;" but I reached a chair for her to sit down, so that her left-side should be towards me: but she turned her back to me; I then laid hold of her, and found she had a piece of Irish linen, which cost us exactly 2l. 16s. - I said, "You old wretch, what have you got under your shawl;" she stammered, and said,"I have nothing but this bundle;" producing one from under her right-arm, at the same time she dropped the Irish linen - I sent for an officer, who took her - the house is the dwelling-house of myself and father - we both reside there, and the rent is paid out of the partnership funds.</p>

               <p>MR. LIMBERT. This is the Irish linen; my initials are on it - it cost us 2l. 16s. each piece, purchasing a box at a time; I have never measured it: but it is marked twenty-eight yards with the register stamp.</p>

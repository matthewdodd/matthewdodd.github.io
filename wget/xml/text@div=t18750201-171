                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father as whole<lb></lb>sale stationers, at 3, Short Street, Tabernacle Square—the prisoner entered our employment in October last as a commission traveller—I did not give him any authority to collect money or to sign my name—shortly after<lb></lb>wards we had an account with Mr. Hammond for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I wrote for it and Mr. Hammond returned the letter with something written on it—the endorsement on this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not mine or my father's—I believe it is the prisoner's writing—he has never accounted to me for that sum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know his handwriting—the arrangement between us had been going on a little over a-month—he has brought us perhaps about a dozen customers, or not quite so many—there was no commission owing to him at the time he was taken into custody—many of his customers turned out to be bad debts, and the commission was returnable—a part of this receipt is torn—I don't know how it became torn—it had on it "per favour of Mr. Tugwood"—I believe I may have torn it in folding it up—it was not done intentionally—I never gave the prisoner authority to endorse a cheque.</p>

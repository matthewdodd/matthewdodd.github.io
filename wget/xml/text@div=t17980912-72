            , the prisoner, I met with him on the 19th of July, I asked him home to tea and supper, I knew him before; he went with me between four and five o'clock, and staid till past eleven, and then I asked him if he was not going home; he told me he would not go out of the house that night; he said, if I would not go up stairs, he would carry me up; I went up stairs, and laid down on the bed and went to sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go up along with you? - A. Yes; I waked about three o'clock, or a little before, and he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you went to sleep? - A. I do not know; I might go to sleep directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you undress and go to bed? - A. No, I did not undress.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of your property? - A. No, nothing but a ticket that I lost out of my pocket; as soon as I waked I missed the property; I went down stairs, and found the parlour door fastened inside, to prevent my getting in, I had locked it the night before, and left the key in; I had fastened all the doors when I went up; I went through a large room that I forgot there was a door in, and I was going to jump out at window; the parlour door going into the walk was left open, there are two doors to the parlour, one going into the walk, and the other into the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the door going into the walk was fastened? - A. Yes, I barred it and locked it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore must have been opened by somebody from the inside? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in the house besides you and the prisoner? - A. Not on that side of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the people on the other side of the house have access to it? - A. Yes, they might.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the property before? - A. The same day, the 19th of July, I saw them all when he went into the house with me.</p>
               <p>Q. And you missed it as soon as you went down stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have found none since? - A. No, only the ticket that I have in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that ticket? - A. I was necessitated for a little money, and I had made use of something.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the ticket again? - A. It was sent home to my mistress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This duplicate, which we have heard talked of, and you do not know from whom it came, was a duplicate of some property belonging to your mistress? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That you had pawned before that time? - A. Yes; my mistress told me if I had pawned any of her property she would forgive me; I meant to replace it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never pawned before any articles? - A. Not belonging to my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in the habit of pawning your own things before? - A. Only once during an illness.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. About two months.</p>
               <p>Q. He never before came in at your invitation to take a cup of tea and eat a bit of supper, and go up stairs together? - A. He was in the house once before for five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not give him the trouble of taking you up stairs, did you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And he staid with you in your room from eleven at night till three in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The man, I dare say, did not go to bed? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other persons in this house, who might, if they had been so disposed, have got at these things? - A. There were more gentlefolks.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not had other persons in the house, that you have invited exactly in the same way? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many, pray? - A. Not more than one.</p>
               <p>Q. Only one at a time - Why, you are with child now, are you not? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not true then? - A. I do not know that it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath do not you believe yourself with child now? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you been before a Justice to swear? - A. I have got a child now.</p>
               <p>Q. By another man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he one of the gentlemen that you introduced to your mistress's house in her absence? - A. No; I did not live there then.</p>

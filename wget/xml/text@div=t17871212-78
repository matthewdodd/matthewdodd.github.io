               <p>I know the prisoner some time; in the month of July, I cannot say the day, on Sunday morning the prisoner came to me, and brought me a waistcoat, together with a pepper castor, two or three table spoons, and a saucepan, and as much plate as weighed eleven ounces; there was a white handkerchief and some other things, for which I paid him three pounds seventeen shillings; the plate I had sold with some other plate, to Mr. Blank the refiner in Long-acre; that is the same account I gave to Sir Sampson.</p>
               <p>Who was that waistcoat delivered to? -</p>
               <p>I sold that waistcoat to one John Vanderberg in Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you make any mark on the waistcoat before you sold it to Vanderberg? - I made a remark, but no mark.</p>
               <p>Do you keep any book of your receiving stolen goods? - No I did not, I have no memorandum of the time, I know it was the latter end of July, for the first house I took, I did not like, as it was very inconvenient, because I thought of settling in another way of business; I am a single man, and I thought of marrying.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is very unlucky for the family you meant to honor with your alliance; you are the same Mr. Fleming that has been a receiver of stolen goods for six months? - I am the same Fleming that was examined before you on a similar occasion; I have no more to do this sessions.</p>
               <p>Are you the same man that said this, that there are certain persons who know you to be a common receiver of stolen goods? - I signed that, that is my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Now my honest, worthy friend, Mr. Fleming, how happened it that you kept this a secret all the summer months, from July down to December? - I did not mean to disclose it, unless I had been compelled to it.</p>
               <p>Unless you had been compelled to it by the danger of the gallows; I dare to say you was charged with nothing when you made this disclosure? - To my knowledge I was not; I know the situation I am in.</p>
               <p>Hear the question and answer it; do you mean to swear, that at the time you disclosed this robbery, you was charged with no offence? - No; I certainly, Mr. Garrow, am well acquainted with the consequence; not that I know; that I swear.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear now, that you was not charged with any offence at the time you made this disclosure? - I must take time to recollect that; I made some disclosures on the Sunday, and some on the monday; I cannot recollect which it was; I was first taken in custody on the Sunday morning.</p>

               <p>Court. You was charged with somewhat then; was not you? - But I did not know it.</p>
               <p>You might not know what it was for; but you was charged with some offence; upon your oath did you make this disclosure till you was charged with some offence? Not till I was in custody; I was in custody with the officers in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Now did not you know, at that time, that you were in custody for having goods in your possession, which, if you did not shift off from your possession, you was liable to be taken into custody, and hanged for? - You must excuse me; you speak too quick for me.</p>
               <p>Did not you do this to save your own neck; did not you make the disclosure to save your own life? - I know my motive for making the disclosure; I suppose I must answer, Mr. Garrow, in the affirmative, for I know no better; I certainly made this disclosure to save myself.</p>
               <p>One question more, and remember what you said last night; Do not you know, that unless you fix on some person every particular article of stolen goods found in your possession, that you are still in danger? - Be so kind as to repeat it; I know,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120095"></xptr>Mr. Garrow, that I must fix on the right person; I apprehend, Mr. Garrow, I am still in the same danger if I do not fix on the right person.</p>
               <p>Then you are now swearing, in order to fix this danger on somebody else to save yourself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You say you did not mark the waistcoat, but you remarked it? - I will tell you, on one side there is a darn very near the pocket.</p>

               <p>Who gave you that waistcoat? - His wife.</p>
               <p>Townsend. I believe I found it on the 3d or 4th of December.</p>
               <p>- MITCHELL sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an Attorney at Isleworth; on the 27th day of July last, in going to Oxford assises, I left this waistcoat, with several articles, with Mr. Wheeler, in a bundle; I am perfectly persuaded, from the darn that is here, this is the waistcoat, I left with him; it was made too long for me, therefore I desired the tailor might cut some off it, which reduced the pockets, and they are now exceedingly shallow, and the darn, I believe Mrs Mitchell made; I have not the least doubt in the world but it is mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It was out of your custody from July to December? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Fleming. Look at that waistcoat? - Here is the darn; when I bought the waistcoat, the strings to the back were not there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mitchell. There were no strings in it when I lost it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How many scores of pounds may you have turned in stolen goods during the time you have been in business? -</p>
               <p>Court. You are not bound to answer that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How much money have you turned in the course of your trade? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. He is not bound to answer that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How many waistcoats have you bought in the course of your trade? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Can you tell whether you have bought a dozen? - I cannot tell; I have a number of white ones that I bought in the summer time; it is impossible for me to say; if I was to say any particular number, I am sure I have bought half a dozen.</p>
               <p>A dozen? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Can you tell the particular description of all the waistcoats you have bought, and all the marks you have had to them? - That would be impossible; I kept this waistcoat two days in my house; I was courting a young lady before that.</p>
               <p>They coveted the alliance no doubt? - That does not advert to the business, therefore I must address his Lordship; I sold it the ensuing week after I had it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel; there has been a great many very infamous paragraphs inserted in the papers, I hope that will have no weight on you, my Lord, and the gentlemen of the Jury.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Barbican. On the 18th of May the prisoner came to me with a written order, which I produce—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>, "Please to deliver to bearer one yard of green cloth, for Aaron Richold")—I knew the prisoner had been in his service, and I gave him a yard of green cloth, worth 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had never seen Mr. Richold's handwriting.</p>

            . I am a watch-house-keeper. Smith and Campbell were brought to the watch-house with this bundle - Smith was very much alarmed, and said, "Do forgive me, and I will tell you all about it;" I sent the watchman to find where they took them from, and while he was gone, Smith said she took them from a sailor in Bluegate-fields; the witnesses then came, and I opened the lock-up place for them to see the prisoners - I saw this bundle lay by the side of Smith; I said, "What is that? I thought I searched you;" she said, "Yes; but I had these on;" it was these trousers.</p>

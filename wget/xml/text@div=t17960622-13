I refreshed myself and my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220036"></xptr>horses, and was coming away at twelve, and never was out of the Crown yard till I came away; the landlord came up, and desired me to stop; he got into my chaise, and the ostler upon the bar, and desired me to take him to the Red-lion at Hillingdon, and I should have a pint of beer; he said, he had lost a silver mug; and then he desired me to carry him to Hayes, and drive pretty quick over the common, he said, the man could not be got much farther; he gave me two sixpences to drink, and described the man to me, and told me, if I would take him and the pint mug, he would give me five guineas; I came about a mile and a half farther, and the prisoner called to me, and asked if I was going to town; and I said, yes; he jumped upon the bar, and, in about four miles, he said he was cold, and he would get inside; and I said, so would I; and then I saw the pint, there was a handkerchief lapped over it; and as he laid it down, the handkerchief dropped from it, and he fell back in the chaise and went to sleep; when we got into St. Giles's, I stopped, and let him out, and asked him for the money for driving him, and he gave it me; and when I let him out, I catched him by the collar, and said, Sir, I believe I must stop you, for a robbery that was done at Uxbridge lak night; he says, do you think I am a thief? I said, I have not the least doubt but you are the thief; and in scuffling, his hat fell off, and there was a silver pint in the lining of his hat; says he, you don't know me, nor I you; and he offered me a silver watch, which he said cost him five guineas, and a gold seal to it, to let him go; and I said, I would not have any bribery, and he shoved it into my breast; I said I would not have his watch, and holloaed out watch three or four times, and a watchman did not come for some time; and when he saw the watchman, he threw the pint behind him, and I told him to pick it up again, which he did; and I desired a watchman to look after my horses while I gave charge of him to the watchman, which I did, and sent express off to the landlord that I had taken the man; the prisoner laid it upon the bench before the constable of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the mug again? - A. Yes, particularly well; the watchman bid me mark it, and I marked it with the snuffers with a cross upon the bottom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You know the mug again by the mark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the hat again by the mark? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Justice desire the hat to be marked, because it was impossible it should hold such a mug? - A. No; he did not say any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear the pot was in the lining of the hat? - A. Yes. (The prisoner produces his hat).</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was not the man's hat marked before the Justice? - A. No; not before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Where then? - A. I never saw the hat marked.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear the hat was not marked before the Justice? - A. I did not see it marked.</p>

               <p>Q. What charge was given of him? - A. Upon suspicion of stealing this pint pot from a house at Uxbridge; the prisoner denied it, the post-boy put a mark of a cross upon it, I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did the Magistrate desire the prisoner's hat to be marked? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went from London upon business to Oxford; when I got into Uxbridge it was late; I had some beer and bespoke a bed; at half past ten I heard of a returned chaise for London; accordingly I made an enquiry for this postboy, which might be five minutes before eleven; I enquired for him in the Crown-yard, which is next door to Mr. Brown's; I asked him what I should give him to take me to London, and he said 1s. and a pint; I told him he should have it; I asked him to go with me to Mr. Brown's, and he would not, because he had got his horses to rub down, and I went and fetched the mug out to him to drink, and he told me if I would walk on he would overtake me in ten minutes; that he durst not take me up there because his master William was up; he rode outside, and a soldier on the bar; when I got to Ealing I moved the saddle, and there I saw the pot, and I called to him and asked him how he came not to return the pot; I charged him with the watch in Plumb-tree-street, St. Giles's, and he collared me; he threw the pint down, he would not pick it up, and when the watchman came he gave charge of me; I gave the pint pot to the post-boy between Mr. Brown's and the Crown-yard; if Mr. Brown gave him a caution about my taking the pot, why did not he stop me going through the turnpike? or why did not he take me with me the soldier? two of them were enough to take me.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Ailadine.) Was there any soldier upon the bar? - A. No; I never saw any soldier.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what he has said is false? - A. Yes.(The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe-maker, and live in High-street, Woolwich. On the 21st of October, about half-past seven o'clock, the prisoners came to my shop—Brown asked for a pair of shoes—I attended to him with them, and while I was doing so, I saw a woman's stout shoe drop from behind Brennan, as he stood aganist the counter—I told my daughter to pick it up, which she did, and laid it on the counter again—while I was attending on Browne, Brennan walked out, with the pair of shoes under his left arm—It was the pair which had been on the counter—I saw them—I followed him into the street, and said, "You have got my shoes under your arm; there they are—I will swear to them"—he up with his right hand, knocked me down, and made his escape with the shoes—Browne had then got into the street—I laid hold of him, and gave him into custody—he said he did not know the other man—they went out of the shop nearly together—Browne had not dealt with me—he asked for a pair of shoes, which were 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—he offered me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for</p>

About the 10th of October last three of my workmen informed me that I was robbed. They laid some silver in order to detect the man on the benches, and on the 17th one of the men saw him take them away. In consequence of that, on the 17th, in the morning, I went with one of the constables to his lodging; I challenged the prisoner with robbing me he denied it. There was nothing but one silver spoon tea spoon found at that time in his apartment, which had my mark upon it. I gave him into the custody of the constable, and afterwards some of my workmen went with another constable. The prisoner was one of my journeymen.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BOND. I am a journeyman to Mr. Adams. On the 16th of September, in the evening, after all the men had done work, me and two more of Mr. Adams' men made a hole in the cieling, where we could see over the work benches; Mr. Adams requested some of us to come down, two of us did; we left one in the loft and the others went to work. The prisoner came into the shop about a quarter before eight, I bid him good morning; I went down stairs and the other man followed, we staid down some time, the other went up; Arnold, the witness, told him he had seen him take the silver, he came down and informed me of it; I saw they were informing Mr. Adams. I went up stairs and at breakfast time I went out, leaving the prisoner and the witness in the shop. I met the prisoner and the other two witnesses in Noble-street; I procured an officer. When Hawkins the officer found the silver I immediately said that was the silver that we had marked.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Adams. I was upon the watch. The silver was put on the benches; the prisoner was the man who took it, I am confident of it; I informed Mr. Adams of it, he desired me to go for an officer, which I did; we followed him home; when we came into the apartment where the prisoner was, he said you will recollect gentlemen this is not my apartment, it is my daughter's. Mr. Adams asked him if he was willing to be searched, he said he was. The apartment was searched, nothing was found but a spoon which Mr. Adams believed to be his property. We afterwards went to his own apartment in the attic, the daughter's was the two pair, we found nothing there. Mr. Adams gave charge of the prisoner for that spoon; we left the apartment and came away. On our return we met Mr. Hawkins the marshalman, he searched the apartment again, he found on the second search the pieces of silver which I saw the prisoner take.</p>

            . I am a marshalman. I heard of it promiscuously; I went out of curiosity, knowing the prisoner and Mr. Adams. I found the silver in the two pair of stairs room; the daughter's room. I thought the constable might have overlooked it. The pieces of silver I found in the second drawer from the top, in a cup covered over with a saucers there was a seven shilling piece and two or three shillings along with the silver.</p>

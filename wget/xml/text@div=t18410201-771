                  </hi>. I am a general superintendent of the works of Gris<lb></lb>sell and Peto, who are building new docks at Woolwich. I have been so during the last nine months, during which time the prisoner had been in their service as assistant to the smiths, or hammer-men—we had large stores of iron bolts, nails, and things, which the prisoner had access to—we have missed a great quantity of iron materials—we missed some iron wedges, some of which were defective and unfit for use—three iron wedges were marked "G" and "P"—I know the wedges produced to be the pro<lb></lb>secutor's property—they were made in Woolwich-yard, and have not been used, being too short—here are some dog-nails, made for a special purpose—I know them to be their property, and these bolts I know by a very large screw—the dog-nail is a particular rough one, and is seldom used for any other purpose but dogging down rails for a railway, temporarily—these nuts I know without doubt to be their property, because they fit the bolts we have on the ground—it is a common way to make them—you will sel<lb></lb>dom find a nut fit any thing but the bolt it is made for—this chain is their property—we have part of the same chain on the works now—this bag I know by being one of those we have on the works—it is not the property of Grissell and Peto, but we are accountable for all that are defi<lb></lb>cient—here is some iron hooping—I cannot say that I particularly know</p>

               <p>this, but I linvc every reason to believe it is theirs, as I found some of the very same rolls in the works, in the smith's shop, where the prisoner was at work—it is bound the same as this—the things are worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw a quantity of iron at Bexley heath station which belongs to Grissell and Peto.</p>

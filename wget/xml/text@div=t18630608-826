                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Robinson, a butcher, it Upper Clapton—on 10th February I received four sacks of flour, or sweep<lb></lb>ings, from Mr. Johnson, and received this ticket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with it, dated 10th February—the prisoner delivered the flour from about twenty minutes past 1 to half-past; about dinner-time—he had other goods in his cart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you sign this ticket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; Miss Robinson did; she is not here—the prisoner has been in the habit of delivering flour to us.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to Mr. George Symond, a flour-factor, at Whitechapel—on 10th February, I had to deliver some flour for Mr. Symond, at Mr. Rowe's, a baker's, Upper Clapton; a lad named Shrub went with me; I had a van and three horses—when I got there, Mr. Johnson's van was there with flour, and a man of the name of Choat with it; the prisoner is the man—I should say that was between 2 and half-past; I am sure he is the man who was there—we helped each other to unload; he assisted me and I assisted him with both the vans—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my ticket, which I had from my master on that day, the 10th; my name is on the back of it—the prisoner finished his load there, but I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you certain that this was on 10th February? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have always stated that I was sure.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You received this ticket at the time you say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; on the day I delivered the goods, and took it back to my master—I believe the date was on it at that time; it is proper to put the date on—I never was at Mr. Rowe's with Choat except on that day; I never saw him there at any other time—I know it was from 2 to half-past, because we had a drop of beer together, and I was at Stoke Newington at 4 o'clock—the prisoner went with me there—he came through that way.</p>

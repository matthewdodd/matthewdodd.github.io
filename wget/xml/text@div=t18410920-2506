                  </hi>. I am a Greenwich pensioner. About one or two o'clock in the morning of the 28th of August, I was coming up Queen-street, getting towards the tap—the prisoner, who was standing outside, asked if I would treat her with a pot of beer—I said as it was Sunday I did not suppose she would get it—she said, "If you find money</p>

               <p>I will find beer"—I pave her a sixpence or a shilling—she got it in a can and brought it into her own house—I went in with her—we sat down, and partook of this beer between us—I was rather heavy, and fell asleep on the back of the chair—she rifled my pockets, to try to get something—this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was tied up in the tail of my shirt—she pulled it out from there and took it from me—I awoke the moment she took the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note out of my shirt—I found her doing it—it belonged to a widow named Burrows—I had picked it up in her house, as she and her daughter were removing—I called the daughter, and said, "Here is the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that you and your mother were locked up for;" and her mother told me to take the note in charge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 57.) I was on duty and took the prisoner—I found the note close under where she was sitting in her room—the prosecutor was in the room—she was trying to turn him out of the house—he said he had lost a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—she said he had got no note—there was a piece of paper on the table—the prosecutor said, "That is the paper my note was wrapped in"—the shirt appeared to have been cut with a pair of scissors, and there was an old pair of scissors by there—the prisoner was calling the police, to turn the man out—when I entered the room the flap of his shirt was out of his trowsers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was sitting at the door with three women; the prosecutor came down the street with two fourpenny pieces between his fingers; he said he was going to spend them; the women asked him to treat them; he said he would; we went to the Red Lion public-house, and had a pot of sixpenny ale, and two pots of half-and-half, which he brought to my place; I left them, while 1 went to get a candle; when I came back the women were gone, arid the prosecutor was sitting in a chair asleep, and was awoke by the noise he made about his money; he found the money he said he had lost at his feet.</p>

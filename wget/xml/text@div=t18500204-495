                  </hi>. I live in Paradise-street, Rotherhithe, and am a blocker. Between two and three o'clock, on the morning of 15th Jan., I went into the Surrey Coal-hole—the prisoner and several others were there—two young men were with me—something took place with the barman—I went out, and came in again, when the prisoner caught hold of me round the waist, and I felt his hand in my pocket, and at the same time two men caught hold of each arm—I had two penny pieces and two halfpence safe in my pocket two minutes previous to going into the house—I was let go—I then put my hand into my pocket, and missed them—I went outside, and told my friends—I saw a policeman, and took him inside—the prisoner was not there—I took him afterwards.</p>

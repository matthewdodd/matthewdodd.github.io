                  </hi>. I am a labourer at Potter's-bar—on Saturday, 7th May, a little after 12 at night, I was coming towards Mrs. Mann's house at Enfield—when I got there I saw some men whom I cannot swear to—they pulled me down—when I got up I called out—I felt hands in my right<lb></lb>hand pocket when I was down—I had half-a-sovereign, a half-crown, and sixpence there, which I missed when I got up—I know the Windmill public-house—I saw somebody go to the gate of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were there more than three persons near you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only three, that I saw—no one came to my assistance till they had gone—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186406060039"></xptr>
               <p>two young <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> then came and spoke to me—the three men all ran in the same direction—it was not moonlight, but it was not so very dark; it was not so dark but what I could see them go in at the gate, though it was not light enough for me to see their faces—I could not swear to them—I had come from Barnet; I had a little business to do—I had not had too much beer; I visited one public-house, and remained there very nearly half an hour—I met some friends there, or else I should have had no beer at all—I paid for two pints—I will swear I had my money when I left the public-house—I put it into my pocket at Barnet about 11 o'clock; I had been carrying it in my hand a good bit before that—from the time I put it in my pocket I never saw it again.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a house at Enfield—on 7th May, a little past 12, I was expecting Richard South, but did not sit up for him; I heard his voice, got up, raised up my window, and saw two men in militia clothes—the tallest of them caught South by the shoulder and pulled him back, away from my door—a third man stood a little way off; they were all dressed in militia clothes—the tall man fell on him—I know the prisoner; I have seen him all the time he has been lodging at the public-house, which was two or three days—he knelt on South's throat, and kept him down for some time, put his hand in his right-hand pocket, and I heard money jingle—I went out in my night-gown, and followed the prisoners to the gate of the Windmill public-house and then to the door; it is close by my house—I called out to the pot-boy to open the door; he came as quick as he could, but the prisoner shoved against the door, burst it open, and the three of them went in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How soon after they went through the gate did the policeman follow and take the prisoner out of his bed? was it not almost immediately? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was pretty well an hour afterwards; it might be a little less; I have no clear notion about the time—I looked out of my bed<lb></lb>room window, which is on the second floor—when I first saw the prisoner he was putting his hands on South's shoulder and pulling him backwards, and the moment he had done that he knelt upon him—South fell lengthways across the path—the prisoner was not facing the door when he pulled him down; he lay beside South, with his right hand in South's pocket—he was on South's left side; he lay on the ground till he had got the money—I called to my husband; South is not my husband, he is a lodger—I also called out to the men with whom South was struggling, "Oh, dear, there will be murder;" that was when I heard South squeak—I had spoken to the prisoner several times before this at the public-house, and he to me, during the training; not before—I knew him at the time he was training, and while he lodged there—I don't know how many days the training lasts; he was there long enough for me to know him—he was not billeted at my house, but he passed my door, and I have spoken to him several times—I knew him well, and have seen him three or four times a day—he had a cap on—it was not a dark night; I could see anybody as far off as this door—there was no moon, but it was very light.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, S</hi> 39). On the morning of the 8th May, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I went to the Windmill public-house, Enfield, with Mrs. Mann—I went into two bedrooms and found three men sleeping in each room—she pointed out the prisoner as the man she had seen put his hand in South's pocket—he was apparently asleep—I awoke him, and told him he was charged with stealing a half-sovereign, a half-crown, and a sixpence, from a person named South—he said, "Are not you going to take anybody else?"—I made no reply, but begged him to dress himself, and he took his military clothes from the top of the bed—he said that he was in bed at 11 o'clock—I searched his militia clothes and found fivepence in copper.</p>

I live at 6, Matthews Road, Stoke Newington, and am a plasterer—on 5th September, about 11.30 at night, I was going along the Kingsland Road—the two female prisoners sprang out upon me—they held me, and called out "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>"—the male prisoner came up; and hit row in the face—the female prisoners then left go of me—I had seen my watch safe about three minutes before—I missed my watch after the females left go of me—I said so to Dilby, and he struck me again, and ran away down a turning—the female prisoners went down the first turning on the other side of the road—a railway porter came up, and I told him whit had</p>

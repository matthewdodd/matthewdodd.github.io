                  </hi>. I am a labouring man, and live in Grove-street, Dept<lb></lb>ford. I had known the prisoner very nearly two years, and till this matter happened we had been good friends—on Friday, 25th Aug., I was in a public house with him—I passed the whole evening with him there, till half past 12 o'clock on the morning of the 26th—we had some drink, but only very little—when I came away I was not any the worse for what I had drunk, nor was he—we were both quite sober—he went to his mother's house, and I went with him; and we stopped there till half past 2 o'clock in the morning—I came out of the house before him, and was going home—I next saw him about ten yards from his mother's gate—he overtook me—nothing took place till we got to the Red Lion; I then wished him good morning—he said he should not wish me good morning, he meant to give me a d—d good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi> before he left me—I had not had any quarrel with him—I said, "What for, have you any particular grudge against me?"—he said, "No; not any particular grudge," but he should do it before he left me—I said, "You will have to get some one to help you, or to pray to God to make you able to do it"—he said he did not care whether he had any one to help him, but he should well make me suffer for it before he left me—after he had repeated those words I walked off towards my lodging, and he followed me—he was sometimes a short distance before me, and some<lb></lb>times</p>

               <p>a short distance behind—he got home to my lodging about fifty yards before I got to the door—lie did not lodge in the same house—I went up to the door of my lodging, and he was there—he stood against the door, and he said he should give me a d—d good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi> before he left me—I at<lb></lb>tempted to go in at the door, and he came up to me and told me he should make me fight before I went in—I told him I did not wish to have anything to do with him, I did not want to interfere with him—he said, "Well, I shall make you fight whether you door whether you do not"—I said, "Well, if you make me I suppose I must"—I did not prepare to fight, but he did—he pulled off his coat, and I asked him what for; and he said, for to give me a good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi>—I did not do anything to my dress—I buttoned my coat up—I did not begin to fight, I stood with my hands in my pocket—he came up to me, and struck at me—I turned my back to him, and he struck me in the back—I held up my arm to keep the blows away from my face, and he struck me underneath my arm, and on the left side of my back—I do not know whether it was with his fist or with anything in his hand—he then caught hold of me with his right hand, and tried to throw me down—he put his right hand round my waist—I said, "It is no use your trying to throw me down, you can't"—he said, "I shall make you well suffer for it without that"—after he tried to throw me down, he struck me four or five times in the back—his arm came round me at the time I had hold of him—I could not see anything in his hand till I felt the knife going through my coat into my back—that was the fourth or fifth blow—I felt what I believe to be a knife going through my clothes into my body—I said to him, "George, you are stabbing me"—he said, "I know I am, and I mean to have your b—y heart out before I leave you"—after he had said these words, I saw the knife in his right hand—I do not know what, became of it—I tried to get it out of his hand with my left hand—he had the knife in his right hand—I tried to get hold of his right hand, and he raised his hand and struck me twice in the arm—once in the lower arm, and once just at the bend of the arm—the second time I caught his arm, and as soon as I got hold of his arm he dropped the knife in the road, and he stooped and picked it up, and put it in his pocket—heathen took up his coat and ran towards his own home—I was not able to follow him, I was bleeding very much from four places—I went to my lodging house—a doctor came to me—there was no one by at any time—I believe I have told all that happened—I did nothing to provoke the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 277). I was on duty in Grove-street, Deptford—I heard a cry of murder about 3 o'clock in the morning—I went in the direction of it, and met the prosecutor—he made a complaint to me—he appeared to me to be sober—he was bleeding profusely from the left arm—I took off, his coat, and saw him bleeding from two wounds on the left part of the back, about the shoulder—I also observed two wounds on the left arm—I saw him home, and brought a medical man to him—I had not known him nor the prisoner before—I went afterwards and looked for the prisoner—I found him the same morning at his lodging, No. 8, Wellington-street, Deptford—I found him in bed about 5 o'clock—he appeared to be <hi rend="italic">drank</hi> then, but I had seen him before he stabbed the prosecutor, and he was sober—when I saw him at 5 o'clock he appeared to be drunk, but I believe he was not—I had seen him about half past 2 o'clock that morning, in company with the prosecutor—I spoke to the prisoner, and in my judgment he was then sober—he had no appearance of being drunk—the prosecutor was sober at half past 2 o'clock—when I found the prisoner in bed about 5 o'clock, I took him into custody—I asked him to get up and out of bed—he made no reply—I spoke to him again, and asked him if he had stabbed John Christmas about 3 o'clock—he said he knew nothing at all about it—he then got up and dressed, and came with me to the station—as I took him to the station I passed the door of the house where Christmas lodged—the prisoner saw the blood, and he said if he had caused the prosecutor to lose so much blood as that, he ought to be punished for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at Rotherhithe. On Saturday morning, 26th Aug., I was called to attend the prosecutor at his. lodging in Grove-street, Deptford, between 3 and 4 o'clock—he had two or three wounds in the back of a small character, and two larger ones on the left arm—they were incised clean wounds, as if cut with a sharp instrument—one of those on the arm appeared to be drawn across—those on the back appeared more of the character of punctured wounds—he was then bleeding slightly—he had bled much—one of the wounds on the arm was dangerous—it was near an artery—it was about an inch and a half in length—I dressed the wound, and attended him for a week or ten days afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The one near the artery was the only dangerous one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on account of its locality—all wounds will bleed—if the artery had been punctured, there would have been considerable danger.</p>

I went down-stairs, and saw Howard in the kitchen, within five minutes of my going down - he had lodged with me three weeks; I told him he had been into my bed-room, which he denied; I said I suspected him of stealing my watch - he denied it. Langley came in in about a quarter of an hour. I sent for a watchman, and gave them both in charge.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Shorey; the prisoners lodged there for three weeks. About ten o'clock on the night in question I saw them both in the kitchen; Howard went up-stairs with a candle in his hand, and Langley went up directly after him - about half-past ten o'clock I saw Howard come down-stairs into the street - he went about twenty yards down the street, and returned in four or five minutes, into the kitchen; in about a quarter of an hour Langley came into the house; he had followed Howard into the street, immediately he went out; I saw them in the street, about twenty yards from the house, and saw something pass between them, but cannot say what - they put their hands to one another - they came into the kitchen again, and were soon afterwards taken. I heard master charge Howard with stealing the watch - he denied it.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. James. I was sent for on Sunday night, the 10th, and found the prisoners in the watch-house; I fetched Langley out of the cell first; a friend had come to see him, who said he thought all Mr. Shorey wanted was his watch back again; I said, "Recollect, I don't promise any thing" - I did not use either a threat or promise to him - I searched him, but found nothing relating to this prosecution; after he had denied several times knowing any thing about it, I was about to lock him in another cell, and he said he wanted to speak to me - Howard was not within hearing; Langley said a person, (whom he mertioned) had told him he had taken the watch, and planted it under his (Langley's) father-in-law's kitchen-stairs - he described the spot very minutely; I went there, and after searching some time, found it in the place he mentioned; I then returned to the watch-house, and brought Howard out of the cell - I asked him twice where the watch was - he denied all knowledge of it, and as I was returning him to the cell I pulled the watch out, showed it to him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110034"></xptr>and said, "Have you ever seen this before?" he said No; I was then about to lock him up - he said, "It is of no use to deny it any longer; I did take it," and he mentioned a person who cut the wire while he held the light, and said that he went into the room, took the watch, and gave it to that person, who went and planted it. I afterwards went into a room with Mr. Shorey, and found a pair of shears, which appeared to have been employed against some hard substance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you certain no promise or threat was held out? A. Quite so. I have known Langley about a year, and considered him very honest.</p>
               <p>MR. SHOREY. This is the watch and seals which I lost that night; I showed Gook into the prisoners' room - he found these shears in the room where they worked - they are tailors; nobody else worked there.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave each of the prisoners a good character.</p>

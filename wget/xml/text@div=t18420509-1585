                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Taylor, living in Evans's-buildings, George-street, Chelsea. On the 5th of May, I missed my hus<lb></lb>band's coat from the back-parlour—he had worn it on the Thursday pre<lb></lb>vious—I did not see it again, till I saw it for sale at Lloyd's door, which is about a quarter of a mile from my house—this is it—I had seen the pri<lb></lb>soner at my gate on the Saturday previous.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I own I sold the coat—last Tuesday three weeks I was going to work; I was waiting for a woman; I saw a piece of paper lying on the ground; I picked it up, and it was the ticket of a coat pledged for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I took it with me to the station, and spoke of it there; I took it home to my lodging, and said I had found a ticket for a coat in the name of Murray, Wil<lb></lb>derness-row—at dinner-time I went to inquire, but no such name was there; I kept the ticket till the Saturday following; I then unfortunately went and redeemed it, as they told me I was entitled to do so, as I could not find the owner; I paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and sold it to Floyd for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; a fort<lb></lb>night afterwards I was taken up; the policeman knows the name of the pawnbroker.</p>

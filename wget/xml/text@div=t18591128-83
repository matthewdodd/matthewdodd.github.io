                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler and have kept the Free<lb></lb>mason's Tavern, nearly opposite the dockyard, Woolwich, for four years and a half—it is a large house—there are two compartments, the hotel side and the bar side—the doors come into the same street, we have officers there and the lodges, persons frequently come there after the last train has started—on Sunday night, 6th November, a little before 11 o'clock, I was about to close the house—the barmaid and the potboy were in the bar—there were sixteen or eighteen Irish men and women in the little parlour—the prisoners were among them—I told them to go out, as it was time to close, and while I was speaking a man deliberately broke a glass on the table—I said "You will have to pay for that"—he said "I did not do it"—I said "You will have to pay for it, and I shall have no nonsense about it"—the whole of the company then rose; jostled him out and jostled me out with him—I found if I remained outside I should have violence—I came in and directed the potboy to close his room—I assisted to close the doors, supposing the house to be empty—I then went to the hotel side and got the gentlemen all out except two friends of mine—I bolted the door and fastened the Bramah latch—I heard a great knocking outside and people hallooing "Let us in, let us in"—I told my waiter to let nobody in—the people could not open those doors and they went round to the hotel and burst the doors in—I tried to resist their further entrance, but about a dozen of them came in—the prisoners were the two first men that entered the house—they caught hold of me, pushed me along the passage, chased the potboy to the end of the passage and forced him against the bar parlour door, which burst open, and he got under the table—I could not find my wife, and I went into the passage again, fighting my way as well as I could—I looked into the bar and saw five or six men beating my barmaid, pulling her hair out and otherwise illtreating her—they attacked me and beat me about the head—I defended my face—I had been very ill during the last week, and I was nearly knocked down by them—they pulled out my hair—my potboy seeing my position attacked some of them with some implement, and they left me and chased him up stairs—I got out of their grasp, and there was not a single soul left in the house but the parties who were hurting us—in about a quarter of an hour, policeman 239 came—we had previously sent three messages to the dockyard for policemen, and they would not come—during that time they were hitting me and the barmaid—I ran before her for protection, and said, "What do you want, do you want drink or money; take anything, so that you leave the house"—the spirits were set on, and the glasses and plates broken, a box of cigars were strewed about the bar, everything was in a state of confusion; and they throttled my wife—the policeman behaved very well; he defended himself against numbers—Linahan deliberately struck me in the passage in the policeman's presence and split my lips—I gave him into the policeman's hands—the others at<lb></lb>tempted a rescue—the policeman said, "You must come with me directly to the police-court"—My wife was outside without her bonnet looking for the police; at, the time I gave Linahan in custody, Buckley was standing</p>

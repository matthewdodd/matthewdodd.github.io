                  </hi>. I am a native of Bombay. On a Monday night, about a month ago, I had been to the play with my wife, my brother, and his wife—I returned with them to Kent-street—I saw the prisoner in the street—he pushed me down twice—he beat me, and kicked me, and tore my frock—he was upon me on the ground, and put his hand into my frock-pocket, and took my money—there were other persons there, but none but the prisoner robbed me.</p>

I saw that the prosecutor had his money before he went out of the room to go to the play—when we came back, I saw the prisoner and some other persons at the top of the court—I saw the prosecutor and the pri<lb></lb>soner fighting together—I saw them both on the ground—the prosecutor called out that this man had robbed him of his money—I can swear the prisoner is the man I saw struggling with him.</p>

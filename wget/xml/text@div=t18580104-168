                  </hi>. I keep a tobacconist's shop at No. 110, Cheapside. On the night of 29th Dec. the prisoner came for two twopenny cigars—I placed them before him, and he offered me a sovereign—I opened a drawer and put it in a little basin which had gold in it, closed the drawer, and went to the till to take out the silver—he then said, "Give me back my sovereign, I have smaller change"—I opened the drawer where the gold was, and gave him back the sovereign—he took it with one hand, reached his other to the gold basin, took out another sovereign, and dropped a shilling in it's place—I caught his hand, held it, and found the sovereign jammed between his thumb and the palm of his hand—while I was struggling, an elderly man came to the door, and I said, "Pray assist me, this man has stolen a sovereign;" but he stood very passively by while I took the sovereign from the prisoner—I said, "Do call a policeman," but he refused, and said, "Give me some tobacco"—I could not leave the counter, and he was going out of the shop—I said, "Do send me an officer to take this man;" he said, "Have not you any one else to send?" I said, "No," and he went to the door and spoke to an officer—the prisoner knelt down behind the counter, pulled off his shoes and stockings, and I heard something drop which sounded like gold; but he held a two shilling piece in his hand and said that it was that.</p>

I live at 42, Charles Street, Wandsworth—prisoner is my husband—on 2nd May I asked him if I might hare some meat—he said "No, you will have no meat here; you must go and was for your meat"—I said "Well, I have had hard enough work this year'—I went to get the meat—he threw it out of the house—he got a knife caught me under the arm, gave me a black eye, and stabbed me—he had been naughty all day—I was faint—I was getting a drink of water when the landlord came in—I was sober.</p>

I am a surgeon of 260, Wandsworth Road—on the evening of 2nd May I was called by the police—I saw the last witness and dressed the wound—it was the third of an inch in length, under the right orbit, extending to the bone, and there was a great deal of bruising and blackening—the wound would be caused by such a knife as this—it was not dangerous to life—I could not tell what force then was—I do not think it could be caused by falling against the mantel-piece.</p>

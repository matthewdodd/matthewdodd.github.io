I have thirteen yards of silk, some calico, and some cord, which were pawned by the prisoner on the 5th of July - this prosecutrix called in a few days afterwards, and claimed them as hers - the prisoner came again on the Monday, and brought a coat for sale, and I stopped him; he gave his direction, No. 32, William-street.</p>

I live at No. 17, Circus-street - this silk resembles some silk I saw a man offer for sale at the Stingo-gate, in the early part of July, I cannot tell the day - it was offered to me, but as my wife had a silk dress I did not buy it - it was not the prisoner who offered it - it was an elderly man; he offered it to several people there; I am there every day, to take up the coachmen's tea - there was a coachman here of the name of Hood, but he is gone.</p>

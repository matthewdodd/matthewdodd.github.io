            ; I live in the house, and we keep house jointly. Upon the 18th of December, the prisoner broke the window, I was standing in the shop between six and seven in the evening.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that a part of your dwelling-house? - A. Yes; we go through the shop into the parlour; the candles were lighted, upon hearing the window break I ran out, I was not three feet from the window at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in the shop? - A. Yes; I was serving gloves to a person in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130024"></xptr>shop; I ran out and saw the prisoner run before me; I called out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where he ran from? - A. Yes; I saw him as soon as I got out, he turned to the right from our house; a person that is here stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lost sight of the man before that person stopped him? - A. No; I brought him back into our parlour, where he was searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing upon him? - A. The things were taken from him by another person in court; his name is Hitchcock, he had the things in his possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce any thing there? - A. Yes; the things mentioned in the indictment; four cotton pieces, a stocking piece and a kerseymere waistcoat piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know those things to be your property? - A. Yes; I had seen them just before in the window, when I took out the gloves to shew a person in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance were they lying from the glass that is broke? - A. Almost close; the things were lying one by another.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the whole pane broke? - A. It was a large pane, and part of it was left in at the top.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the things taken out? - A. No; but I ran out immediately upon hearing the window broke; he was stopped about two hundred yards from my window.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you never lost fight of him? - A. No; I was so quick after him I could not lose light of him; I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other person with him at the time? - A. No; I searched him in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed any thing out of your window? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen them in the window? - A. Not five minutes before; he was stopped before he got out of Hanway-yard, near Oxford-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any instrument upon him? - A. There was a knife found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the glass appear to be cut? - A. I cannot say; the glazier could not tell, I question whether it was cut or not, it was suddenly dashed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He swears positively it was me, when at that time it was very dark, so foggy that I could not see any thing before me.</p>
               <p>Cawkwell. I never lost fight of him; he was not thirty yards from the window when I got out, he was running in the middle of the road.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Oxford-street: On the evening of the 18th of December, I was turning into Hanway-yard, from Oxford-street, just as the cry of stop thief was; I heard somebody coming down the street towards me, and I made a stand; I saw a person coming with his hand down, and his hands before him, held down in this manner (describing it); I was afraid of meeting him, I caught hold of him, and clapped my hands upon his arms, that he had not an opportunity of moving them; he struggled very hard, and then dropped something; he could not throw them away, he dropped them between us; there was a glass among the things that he dropped, for I heard it fall; he got loose from one hand and I laid hold of his coat, and tore a part of the slap off; his hands were very bloody; he blooded me a good deal. Mr. Hitchcock then came up, and I desired him to take the things off the ground, which he did; I had then hold of the prisoner: Mr. Cawkwell came up; they took the man away from me, and took him to Mr. Cawkwell's house; I went to the house with him, he wanted to fight with us, if any of us would fight with him; we found a knife upon him; it was said he had a pistol, but we found nothing else; he had put his hand in his pocket, but we would not let him take any thing out till he got into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from Mr. Cawkwell's shop when you first saw him? - A. I suppose two hundred yards, or one hundred and fifty; his shop is about the middle of the street, and this was within four or five yards of Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he was at Marlborough-street, he swore that he saw me throw some things out of my hand before he laid hold of me.</p>

               <p>Cawkwell. I don't recollect whether I brought any of them or not, but they were all brought in at the same time.</p>

               <p>Hitchcock. They were delivered back to me at the office. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Cawkwell. This cotton breeches piece is my property; I have got another piece of it at home, from which this was cut off; I cut it off myself; here is another breeches cotton piece, with my private mark upon it, in my own hand-writing; here is another breeches piece, I have another piece at home of the same, this is dirted, and the colour changed; here is another with my private mark upon the ticket, in my own hand-writing, this is dirty and bloody: The worsted breeches piece is all over dirt too, it is my property; this waistcoat piece is mine; I have had it above this twelve month, it is all over dirt too.</p>
               <p>Q. You can swear to all these things a having been in your shop-window, before you heard your window break? - A. Yes; I had been in the shop about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had not been in your shop? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the seventeenth of December, between six and seven o'clock, I was taking a walk down Hanway-yard, there was the name of stop thief cried out; a person ran by me; I directly, my ownself, went after the person, and several people with me; at the same time, as I was just going out of Hanway-yard, this person ran so very fast, that I lost fight of him, and these two men catched hold of me, and used me very ill; I am quite innocent of the crime laid to my charge; I have not got a friend in the world to speak for me: I leave it to the mercy of the Jury, and you, my Lord; I am a sea-faring young fellow, and have no friends.</p>

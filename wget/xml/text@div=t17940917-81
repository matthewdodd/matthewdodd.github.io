The prisoner came, the 29th of July, between five and seven o'clock: she bought half a yard of muslin, and then asked to look at some cotton stockings; when she was gone away, I missed a pair of the stockings; she did not buy any; I called her back, and desired her to let me see her pocket, she had got a pair of stockings, and when I looked into her pocket, I found this pair of stockings in her left-hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them? - Eighteen pence: I know them by the private mark of the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. All that I have to say, them stockings I know nothing of, I picked them off the ground, the shop floor; when I was detected, there had been a woman in the shop to buy three different sorts of table linen and some stockings; when I came out, he called after me, he suspected me and the other woman made off; he found the stockings on the ground, and he charged me with the stockings, and charged a constable with me.</p>

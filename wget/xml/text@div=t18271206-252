            . I am in the service of Mr. Hinxman. I saw this property hanging at their laundry at Hendon, to dry, on the 1st of December, and at half-past eight o'clock in the evening, it was taken in, and put into baskets - the laundry is not a part of the dwelling-house - it is at some distance in the yard; the yard is between the dwelling-house and the laundry; I slept that night in a room over the laundry - I went to bed at half-past eight o'clock; there is a double sash window to the laundry, which draws back - it fastens with a small nail. I came down at half-past eight o'clock the next morning; the things were then gone from the baskets, and the window was a little way open, but not enough to let a person in; the basket had not been near enough to the window to be reached without a stick; the window would open wide enough to let a person in; the nail was quite out of the window.</p>

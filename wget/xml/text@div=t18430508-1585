I saw the prisoner George Andrew James on the 25th of April, in the West India Dock-road, in a direc<lb></lb>tion coming from the canal-bridge—he was pulling these two iron bolts out of his trowsers pocket—I stopped him, and asked him where he brought them from—he said, from home, and he was going to take them to Mr. Dalman, his master, in Salmon-lane—I asked what he had in his handkerchief—he said, some nails, and he had been at work for Mr. Jeffrey in the Folley-wall—I went there, and found it was not true—I then went and found Mr. Fuller—he said the nails were his—I found Joseph James at work on his premises—I told him I had his brother in custody—he said he knew nothing about it—I asked him to come in and see Mr. Fuller—he then said he had taken them, and given them to his brother that morning to build a shed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barge-builder. Joseph James worked on my pre<lb></lb>mises on the 25th of April, and he has done so for seven or eight years—I placed great confidence in him—I have occasionally seen George Andrew James passing my premises—he lives close by me—these nails are such as I have lost, and these bolts I know are mine—I had had them in my hand on the Saturday previous.</p>

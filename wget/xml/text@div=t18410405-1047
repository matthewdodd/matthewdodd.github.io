                  </hi>. I live in York-street, Church-street, Bethnal-green, and am the wife of John Cooke, a tobacco-pipe maker—we have a room on the first floor—the landlord does not live in the house—it is let out in separate tenements. On the 30th of March, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I locked the door, put the key into my bosom, shut the street door after me, and went out—I returned at five minutes to eight, and found the street-door open—my room-door was also open—my husband's clothes-box was open, and the clothes all gone—the lid of the box was laying in the middle of the room—I had a light—I thought I heard some<lb></lb>body in the room—I shut the door, and hallooed out—the neighbours came</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the night in question I was within thirty or forty yards of the prosecutrix's house, and found the prisoner coming down the street, with a bundle containing a coat, silk dress, pina<lb></lb>fore, flannel dress, shift, and several other articles—I stopped her, and asked what she had got there—she said, "A coat and dress"—I asked where she was going with it—she said, "To Wheeler-street"—I said, "Where have you brought it from?"—she said, "From Wheeler-street"—I said it was strange she should be taking it to Wheeler-street again—she said, "The fact is, it belongs to a sister of mine"—I said, "Where does she live?"—she pointed up-to a street, and said, "Up the corner," and that the coat had been to be cleaned, it having a velvet collar, and the dress was left to have the body altered; that the coat belonged to her father, and the dress to herself—I asked her name—she said Thompson—I asked her to show me where her sister lived—she said it was of no use, her sister was just gone out—I asked if any body saw her sent out with the bundle—she said, "Yes," but she refused to go with me, and said she lived at No, 15, Wheeler-street—I took her to No. 2, Wheeler-street, and she said that was the house she lived at, and wished to run up stairs to call her mother down, but I would not allow her—I took her to the station—this was about ten minutes to eight o'clock—I found the prosecutrix's room open, and the property strewed about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was with Teakle in plain clothes, and saw the prisoner—she said she had got a coat—Teakle said, "What else?"—she said, "A dress," that she was taking them to Wheeler-street, and had brought them from there; that the velvet collar of the coat had been cleaned, and the dress altered; and she had brought them from her sister, just round the corner—I afterwards went up stairs to her mother, and asked what she had sent her out for; and not being satisfied, we took her to the station—on the way there, she said two men gave her the bundle, and gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to carry it to under the railway arch—I asked if she knew the man—she said, "No"—at the station-house a key fell from under her arm—she said the man gave her that also—it would not open the pro<lb></lb>secutrix's door.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was coming up York-street, and met a very re<lb></lb>spectable young woman, and two men; the woman looked in my face two or three times; she was looking at a cap-shop window—she said, "Little girl I want to speak to you; will you carry this bundle to the railway, as far as the new public-house?" I said I would go and ask my mother; she said, "Never mind asking your mother, it will be in your road home;" I ob<lb></lb>jected—she said if I would carry it, she would give me something hand<lb></lb>some; and if I met any body, to tell them it was my clothes, as somebody might stop me, and want to take them from me; and the young man said, "It will look rather odd. if you are stopped, without you say it is your own things."</p>

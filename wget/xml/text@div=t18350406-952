On the 19th of March, I was in the shop opposite the prosecutrix—I saw Under<lb></lb>wood and another boy loitering about—I looked at them, and saw Under<lb></lb>wood take something—I went and told the prosecutrix—the two boys ran off, and she ran after them, but could not catch them—in about an how afterwards I saw Underwood come by again—I ran, and told the prosecu<lb></lb>trix that was the boy—she ran after him with the policeman, and took to—I told the officer that was the boy—the prisoner Richardson stood be<lb></lb>hind, and she called me a false-swearing old b—for saying whit I did.</p>

Richard<lb></lb>son brought me this gown to sell on the 19th of March, about one o'clock—it was very much mended—I asked if she had mended it herself—she said, "Yes," she and her sister had, and it was her own—I gave her 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I should consider it worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is a mere rag—9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is the general price we give when they are washed—we do not give the value to sell them again.</p>

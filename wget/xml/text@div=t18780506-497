                  </hi>. I live at 15, Dowdney Street, Limehouse, and am the wife of John Gouldstone—on 13th April I left home about 8.10 p.m., leaving the doors fastened—I returned at about 9.20 p.m.—I went through my brother's house, and through a wicket gate in at the back door—I saw a bundle in the passage—I went to the foot of the stairs—I heard a lumbering noise upstairs—some one said, "We want George"—the prisoner came down, and some one behind him—I said, "What do you do up there?"—he said, "You know all about it," and knocked me</p>

               <p>in the chest—I heard the men unbolt the door—they jumped into a cart and drove away—I said, "Stop the cart; there are thieves in it"—on examining the bundle I found my clothes and my lodger's clothes—I had left my clothes in boxes and drawers in my bedroom—I went to the police-station and gave a description of the prisoner, and afterwards went and identified him.</p>

He came back and looked at me. I waited three quarters of an hour, when the first witness saw me. She should have given me in custody then. The policeman put things into her head for the purpose of getting me convicted.</p>

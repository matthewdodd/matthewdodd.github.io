               <p>Q. Had you any intention of returning to this house - A. I could not tell whether I should return or not; I still owned the house; I held it on an agreement if business called me to that quarter, I should return again, by agreement; I am precluded from under-letting of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had removed the greatest part of your furniture - A. Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you removed your bed - A. Some of them; I had left one mattress bed in the house, in case I might want to sleep there. I have been continually backwards and forwards to the house; if circumstances would permit, I was determined to come back again.</p>
               <p>Q. You left your house about the 15th of July, did you - A. I did. I was in the house on the 27th, I left it between eight and nine o'clock at night, all safe. I paid for the copper, that was in the house as a fixture, so as to have a right to move it when I went elsewere. I left a mahogany tea-caddy, with brass feet, two small straw baskets, a leaden sink, in the front kitchen, and the keys were taken from the doors from the top to the bottom of the house; I had left the keys in the doors. I went to my house on the 30th, between eight and nine in the evening, it was nearly dark: at that time, I found all the doors were open both front and back.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a house by itself - A. No; it is a house in the street. I went in, and found the articles which will be now produced, missing. I lost some other trifling articles; even the keys were gone, and the brass finger plates were broken off the doors. On the day following there was nobody in the house, nor had I given leave for any body to be in the house. We went again on the 30th, and saw the house in this condition.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your house again - A. On the 1st of

             I am almost sure there must be more than one that committed this depredation; by sundry articles they had left used in the house, and from the dirt they left.</p>

In the morning of the 28th of July, between five and six o'clock; I saw the prisoner coming with the copper on his head, and a bundle in his hand; he was alone; he did not come direct from Mr. Skinner's house, he came down another street. I went up to him, and asked him what he had got there; he said, I am moving. I said where from; he said, only up here, a little way. I asked him where he brought the copper from; he said, he was going to get it mended. I told him he must go to the watchhouse, and give a better account of himself. I took him, and the property to the watchhouse; I took hold of the bundle that he had in his hand. At the watchhouse I saw there was a mahogany tea-caddy in it, with four brass feet. The copper and the tea-caddy, Whitehair, the constable of the night, has them in his possession.</p>

            . I am the constable of the night. On the 28th of July, between five and six in the morning, the acting patrol and the watchman brought the prisoner into the watchhouse, and a bundle in has hand. I asked him where he was going; he said, to the coppersmith, to get it mended. I asked him the name of the coppersmith; he said, he did not know; he should know when he got there. I searched his handkerchief; I found that tea-caddy in it. I asked him whether he was going to the coppersmith with that; he made no answer to that. I searched his pockets. In his inside coat pocket I found a bag, containing five skeleton keys and nine other keys; the fourteen keys and a screwdriver, have been in the custody of the officer of Hatton Garden office ever since, by order of the magistrate. The officer is here, his name is Limbric.</p>

I went to the watchhouse, and saw him; I told him. I knew him. When he brought him to the office, I searched him. In his hat I found these two baskets. I got the keys of the house from Whitehair, the constable. I went to Skinner's house. This skeleton key opens the street door, and these other keys fits every lock in the house. These things have been in my custody ever since. I produce the copper.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear to it being my copper; there had been some acid in the copper, which eat the copper in a circle quite bright. I have not the least doubt it is my copper; the tea-caddy is mine, and the baskets; they were made by the French prisoners; these keys belong to the parlour, and the first floor doors.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, I cannot deny that the property was found upon me; I am innocent of stealing them. I was met by two men, who asked me to carry the property as far as Holborn; I had not proceeded far, before I was taken into custody. I was to have three shillings for carrying them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What is the copper worth - A. Thirty shillings: the tea-caddy six shillings.</p>

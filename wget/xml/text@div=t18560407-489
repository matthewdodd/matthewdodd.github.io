                  </hi>. I am the grain manager, at the Bricklayers' Arms sta<lb></lb>tion, of the South Eastern Railway. There is a warehouse there, appro<lb></lb>priated to the grain sent up by our railway, where it remains until the consignees send for it—I have an office in that warehouse—the grain be<lb></lb>longing to the different persons is deposited separately from each other—some beans were deposited in bin No. 18, belonging to Mr. Turner; they had been sent up by another party, and were purchased by Mr. Turner on the market—on Monday afternoon, 31st March, three empty sacks were placed near my office on two sacks of seed—one was quite a new sack, and the others nearly new—they were folded up—they were in a different part of the warehouse from where the beans wore—the prisoner came that afternoon with two other persona, and three carts for the beans—they drew up to the landing place where they are loaded—these sacks were three or four yards round a projecting corner; the prisoner could not have seen them without leaving his cart and going to a different part of the warehouse—I missed two of those sacks some quarter of an hour after I had seen them safe, and before the prisoner and the others had left the premises—I had occasion to send them to Dartford, and directed a porter to go and fetch them—upon finding they were gone, I went and spoke to Lovell, the officer on duty at the entrance to the station, and whilst I was with him the prisoner and the carts came up to go out of the station—I told the prisoner that I had lost two lacks, and I had suspicion that they were in the carts—he denied it—he said he only had his own sacks—I believe he said that twice—£instructed Lovell and one of my foremen to get on the top of the carts, and see if they could find them; but as they could not see them, the cans were taken back to the warehouse to be unloaded—the prisoner's cart was unloaded first—it was loaded with beans—after taking off three, four, or five sacks, I found one of the missing sacks placed in between two of the bean sacks at the side of the cart, so that they could not possibly be seen without unloading the cart—I think there were also one or two old sacks at the tail of the cart—this is the sack (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is not the new one—I have no doubt it is one of those I missed, from the appearance of it—it is not at all like the other sacks which he had in his cart, they were old, and</p>

               <p>much used and branded—we then proceeded to examine the second cart—I found nothing in that—on the top of the third cart was a fodder bag, with horses' food in it—I examined that, and in it found the new sack, tied up—that cart was in charge of one of the prisoner's compa<lb></lb>nions named Palmer—upon finding the first sack, I asked the prisoner how it came there—he said he did not know, it must hare been thrown up with the other sacks—I asked how the second sack came in the fodder bag, and they all denied knowing anything about it—the prisoner said he knew nothing of it, he did not know how it came there—I was then about to give the prisoner and Palmer into custody, and after some little demur, the prisoner said he had taken up the sack, and seeing it was a clean one, he had put it into the sack with the fodder, thinking it was his own—I then let Palmer go, and gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable, belonging to the South Eastern Railway. I was on duty at the entrance to the station on the afternoon of 31st March—Iverson came to me, and shortly afterwards the prisoner came up with three carts—I saw them unloaded and examined, and the sacks found—when the first was found, the prisoner was asked how it came there, and he said it must have been thrown up with the others in a mistake—when the other was found, he said he knew nothing about it—he afterwards said, "I put it in there, seeing it was a clean one, thinking it belonged to us."</p>

These sacks belong to some one at Dartford—I saw them on the afternoon of the 31st, they were lying on some sacks of seed, about three or four yards from where the prisoner's carts were being loaded—he must have gone round the corner to get them—they are not at all like any he had in his cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carter to Joseph Willis, of Hounslow. On the afternoon of 31st March I went with the prisoner and a lad to the Bricklayers' Arms Station, to get some beans—I did not take these sacks; the sacks we had were old sacks, with a black mark on them—one of these sacks was found in the corn sack at the top of my cart—I did not put it there, and do not know who did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of John Swain, of Upper Norton-street. On Tuesday morning, the 25th of July, about ten o'clock, there was a ring at the bell—I opened the door, and found the prisoner Grant there—he said he had come from Mrs. Smith in Regent-street, who had not ribbon enough to finish a dress—I did not exactly understand him, and said there was no such person living there—I went up stairs to a lodger to ask if she knew any thing about it, and when I came down I found the door open, and the prisoner gone—I am certain he is the boy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Swain. On the 25th of July, I was ill in bed, in the back parlour, and heard the room door open very softly—I saw a boy enter the door, and in the act of taking a bundle off the washing-stand—I asked him what he wanted, and who he came from—he looked me full in the face and made no answer, but went out as quick as possible with the bundle, which contained the articles named, belonging to my children—I got out of bed and rang the bell to inquire how he got in—I looked at him all the while he was in the room, and am sure the prisoner Grant is the boy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Attenborough, pawnbroker, of Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square. The prisoner Read came and offered a frock in pawn on Friday the 27th or 28th of July—a pattern <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the frock had been left me before, and I asked him from whom he brought it—he said from his mother, who lived in Well-street—that it was his sister's, and she had worn it—he afterwards said he brought it from a boy, who was waiting for him at the comer of Rathbone-place.</p>

I was called into the pawnbroker's, and took Read into custody—I took him towards Mrs. Swain's—he said a man in a fustian coat gave it him to pawn, and he was to give him three pence—I took him to the station-house, and on going to Marylebone office in the evening, Grant came up and spoke to him—I told him to walk behind, and he followed me to the office—Read said he was his cousin—when we got to the office I took him into custody.</p>

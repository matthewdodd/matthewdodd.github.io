                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 171 <hi rend="italic">E</hi>). On the morning of 4th December about a quarter to one o'clock, I was in Bury Street, Bloomsbury, with 84 E, who is not here, not being bound over—I saw a scuffle in a street opposite Market Street, I went up, heard a woman cry oat, and saw Warren pushing Lambert against some shutters—Warren said, "This man has robbed that man," the prosecutor, who got up from the street, walked a short distance and sat down—he was bleeding from the nose, and had no hat—Lambert said, "I have not robbed the man, but your woman has; she has the money in her hand—Lambert said, "Yes, I have the money in my hand, and I will give it to you; constable"—previous to that I saw a taller woman run away from the same group, but I was not within ten yards of her—we took Warren and Lambert to the station—I held Lam<lb></lb>bert's hand all the way with the money in it—Lambert was charged, and Warren signed the charge-sheet as a witness against her—Mary Ann Warren then came into the station to inquire if her brother was locked up, and Lambert said directly, "That is the woman who robbed the man, and I catched the money away from her hand"—she said, "It is very hard you are going to let the man go, he is the man who knocked the man down"—Mary Ann Warren said that it was no such thing—I saw Warren holding Lambert, and he told me it was because she had robbed the man—the two Warrens were put in the dock and gave their address, 43, Devonshire Street, the top room back—I went there and found this hat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the bed; I showed it to Mr. Woodward next morning—I found 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. copper on William Warred—Lambert gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of her hand—the prosecutor was also taken to the station and locked up, being drunk and incapable.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Chenies Street, Tottenham Court Road—on the night of 3rd December I had a box of jewellery in my pocket which I found there next morning, and I believe I had a half a sovereign and four or five shillings—I do not remember getting into Bury Street, Bloomsbury—I had no money in my pocket next morning—this is my hat—I have never seen the prisoners before—when I came to my senses I found myself in the police-station.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Grace-church-street, on the last day of April between 11 and 12 at night, the prisoner was coming by me, and just as he pass'd me he let a pocket full by my foct : I said, you have dropped something here, so he came back and took it up; but as he was stooping I saw the tankard shine under his apron. I asked him what, he had got there, he would not tell me, so I put my hand upon it, and felt it was a pot. I said I would see what he had there, he said I should not, so I took him by the collar, and got hold on the handle and pull'd it away. I asked him how he came by it, he said he found it in the Borough. I took him in one hand, and the tankard in the other, and led him to the constable of the night, where one of the watchmen said, after looking upon it, he knew the people it belonged to, so he and I went to the prosecutor's house, and asked her if she had lost a tankard; she said, yes, that it was marked A K, and had never a lid; she went with me, and describ'd it to the constable. The tankard produced in court, and depos'd to.</p>

            . I, my daughter, a woman, and another man were drinking out of this tankard at the prosecutor's house, we went out and left the tankard on the table, and the prisoner by it; but had not been home above a quarter of an hour, before the maid told us the tankard was missing. I told her there was nobody there when we came away, but the man in a red coat (meaning the prisoner), and that he talk'd of going to Kent-street to see for a two penny lodging, so they went there to enquire.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence own'd that he had been drinking at the prosecutor's house, and found the tankard as he was going along.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Foreman, of 2, Yole's-place, Old Kent-road—on Tuesday, 7th May last, about a quarter to 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I sent my daughter, Mary Ann, with the baby, which was four months' old—she came back at about 5 o'clock without the baby—from information which was given to me, I went to 8, King-street, Deptford, on 12th May, and went into the first-floor back room, where I found the prisoner in possession of my baby—(I have been very ill)—I said, "You wretch, I wish I had my will of you"—she said, "It is not your baby"—I had looked immediately, and seen that it was my baby and told her so—she said, "It is not your baby," that it was her baby—I said, "If it is your baby you will never have it again from me"—the husband then said that he could prove that it was born at 8, Charlotte-place, Westminster, on the Monday evening before—the prisoner said, "You know nothing about it"—a policeman was there with me—I do not know that she made any statement to him about it—I noticed a napkin—I identified it at the station—it had my initials—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the things my baby had on when I sent it out—this is the napkin, and this is the dress, but it has been picked to pieces—this is the pinafore, this is the shirt and petticoat, and this is the shawl—I am quite sure these are the things my child had on.</p>

I am the wife of John Jones, lodging at 8, Old King-street, Deptford—I know the prisoner, she lodged in the same house seven weeks—on Tuesday evening, 7th May, when she came home she was pre-tending to be very bad, about 6 o'clock—she said she was very bad, and the e landlady offered to send a midwife up to her—I live on the same floor as her—I did not go into her room just then, not till she came to my door—when I went into her room it was about 8 o'clock at night—I got in, and saw her lying a bed—I did not see a child—I saw her again next morning—I went and knocked at her door, and asked her how she was, and she said that the was better—I went into the room and saw the baby—I asked to look at it and did so; and I asked her if she thought I was a fool, the mother of a family, to think that that was a new-born baby—I said, "This child is from two to three months old"—she told me that she would tell me the truth, that she was married on the 9th November, and was pregnant</p>

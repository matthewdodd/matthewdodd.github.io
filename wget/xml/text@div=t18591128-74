On Wednesday morning, 2nd November, a little after a quarter to 5 o'clock, I was going to work, and saw a cart about one hundred yards below the gate, the main entrance—Harvey and Pomfret were standing close by it; it was not in motion—I work at the docks—I went past them, and was about a yard from them—I saw them distinctly—they are the men—on 1st November, I was at John Parry's beer shop in North Woolwich, and saw Harvey there, whom I knew, mending this box with two pins—there is one pin in it now—it is the same box which I afterwards saw in the custody of the watchman—I asked Harvey what he was about now, and he said that he had been selling some herrings.</p>

From information I received I went to St. Leonard's-road, Bromley, on 3d November, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, in plain clothes, and saw Freeman alone with the horse and cart—I told him that I was a policeman, and said, "Did you go out on Wednesday morning with your cart?"—he said, "No," and afterwards he said, "I went</p>

I often engage his cart;" I said, "Did you engage it on that morning?"—he said, "I did, and when Freeman came to my house to do the job he would not do it"—I said, "What was done with the cart?"—Harvey said, "We both got into the cart and went to market"—I said, "What market?"—he said, "Spitalfields"—I said, "Did you go anywhere else?"—he said, "No, I am quite sure of that"—I afterwards took them to the station—I said they were charged with stealing the nails from the dock—when we were going to the police-court in the morning Freeman said, "If you will make me a witness, or the Magistrate will admit me to bail, I will assist you in recovering the property, and in bringing the parties to justice, as I was only drawn into it"—the Magistrate was spoken to respecting what the prisoner had said, and he refused making him a witness, or admitting him to bail—he said all this voluntarily to me—this was after the remand—he said, "I have taken the property to my stable and unloaded it—it remained there till the afternoon—Harvey came and took the property away to a place in Helithorpe-street, Poplar"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "Harvey has taken it in my cart to Watson's, and disposed of it, and I fetched the cart away"—I may have omitted a little of the conver<lb></lb>sation: Freeman said in his statement—"While we were waiting for Harvey we went into the Bull and Anchor at the entrance of the Victoria-docks to get something to drink, and while I waited there, Harvey took the cart away and went over the swing bridge at the entrance of the Victoria docks, and in about twenty minutes returned with the cart"—I said, "Did you accompany him in the cart?"—he said, "I did, and got into the cart and rode as far as the East India-docks"—that was after the return—I asked what was in the cart at that time, and he said, "Something resembling gunny bags"—I asked him how many were in, and he said he thought no more than four or five—I said, "Do you think there is seven or eight hundredweight?"—he said, "No, not more than four or five;" that he got out of the cart at the corner of the East India-dock, and went into a coffee shop to have a cup of coffee, and while there, Harvey had taken the cart away, unloaded it, and returned it to the same place—I afterwards appre<lb></lb>hended Pomfret—he came out of Freeman's house in St. Leonard's-road, Bromley at a quarter to one on Monday morning, 8th or 9th November—I had been there all Saturday and Sunday night waiting for him—I called</p>

On Friday afternoon, 4th Sept, a little after 5 o'clock, the prisoner came—I was well acquainted with him by sight, as I had seen him when I had been to deliver goods at Keith's, but he has not worked there for some time—he inquired of me whether we had some cochineal that would suit Mr. Keith—I said, "Yes," and gave him a sample to show Mr. Keith—he went away, and returned with this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), at 6 o'clock, as we were closing the shop, and I gave him twenty pounds of cochineal—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Please let bearer have 20 lbs. of s. c. neal.

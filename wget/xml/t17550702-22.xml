            . The prisoner brought this watch to me the 28th of May, between 7 and 8 in the morning. (Producing one deposed to by the prosecutor.) I asked him whose it was? He saip another person and he had been drinking together, and it was that other person's; and they wanted some money upon it to make good the reckoning. He was then in liquor. I ask'd him where the other person was? He said at a publick-house. I bid him go and fetch him. He went away, and I saw no more of him; but I desired to know the person's name. He mentioned Mr. Beaumont's name; by which means it was found to be the prosecutor's property. I found Mr. Beaumont's house; and ask'd him if he had lost a watch? He said he had. Then I gave him directions where to call upon me; and he came and own'd it.</p>

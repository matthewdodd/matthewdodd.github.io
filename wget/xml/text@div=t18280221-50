On Wednesday, the 16th of January, a firkin of butter arrived from the West of England, and that was found at Williams'.</p>

            . I keep the New Post-office coffee-house, St. Martin's-le-grand. I have known the prisoner some months, as using my lower room. I knew he was servant at the Castle and Falcon; he called on me on Saturday, the 19th of January, and asked if I would purchase a tub of Dorset butter, and as the guards of coaches, occasionally bring up such things, I said I had no objection; he said he would send it in - it was sent in the evening, and being in a basket with straw over it, it excited my suspicion. I sent to the principal clerk in the yard, and found they missed a tub - I gave it up, and that led to further enquiry about a flat which my servant will speak about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you ever bought butter of him before? A. I bought a flat of him, but do not recollect buying more; I will not swear I have not. I never heard any thing about that flat afterward- I only know him as a customer at my house.</p>

On Monday, I was informed a tub of butter had been offered for sale to William's - I went to Williams, and in the room below, I saw the tub in question, which I identified as being consigned to Mr. North from Dorset - I had not seen it before; but the brand mark corresponded with the invoice which I have here; it came by post - I know it to be the writing of the person who sent it; I have corresponded with him, and acted upon his letters.</p>

            . I am waiter to Mr. Williams. I only know that a flat, containing ginger, tea, pepper, and nutmegs, was brought to our house by Whorrod - I did not know the contents till it was at Guildhall - the prisoner breakfasted at our house - I saw a tub of butter there, but do not know who brought it. When the prisoner came to breakfast, he said, "Has a parcel been left here for me?" I said, Yes; and fetched this flat to him. He said, "It is all right - I will call for it by and by." I took it to where I had fetched it from, and saw the same flat produced at Guildhall in five or six days; and then saw the contents.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say the prisoner saw it? A. He looked at it, and said, it was all right.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where was it in your house? A. In a cup-board where we keep our bread; nobody called about it afterward, that I know of - it was brought on Wednesday the 16th; it was tied up. I saw it daily till Saturday in the same state; but do not recollect seeing it after that - I believe there was a card on it.</p>

            . I am a marshalman. On the the 19th of January, I was fetched to the Castle and Falcon; the prisoner was given into my charge, with Whorrod, for felony. Whorrod said he did take the flat to Williams, and also a tub of butter at Waite's request; and Waite said he did tell him to take them there; but did not mean any harm, that he had borrowed 17s. from another clerk in the yard, and left it in pledge with Williams, for money he had borrowed to pay him.</p>

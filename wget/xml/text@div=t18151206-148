On Monday evening the 30th of October, at about half past seven; I had occasion to go over the way for one of the shutters, to shut up the shop, I heard glass fall, and on my immediately turning round, I saw a man pulling something out of my window. He run away as fast as he could, and I run after him, and overtook him, and it was the prisoner; I never lost sight of him; he was putting the chints under his coat, when I stopped him; he endeavoured to get away, but I was a little stronger than him, and brought him back, and then sent him to Bow-street. When I came back to my shop, and looked at the window, and found there was a hole in it, and part of the furniture hanging out. This was at the shop of No. 3, the upper part of which was let out. There is a communication from one house to the other; there is a passage between the two houses.</p>

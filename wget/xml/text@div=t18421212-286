                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Skinner-street, Somers-town. On the 27th of Aug. I was in the service of Mr. White, who I have suc<lb></lb>ceeded—in May, June, and Aug. the prisoner called on me to solicit orders—he said he came from Saunders and Little, and that his name was Thomas Taylor—I did not know there was a person of that name in Little's employ<lb></lb>ment—I gave him orders at different times amounting to 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and was supplied with the goods—on the 29th of Aug. he called, and I paid him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., deducting 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for goods I had supplied to him—he said those goods were for himself—when I supplied him with the goods I believed that his name was Taylor, and that he was in Mr. Little's service—he had told me that he came from Saunders and Little, that he was a commission traveller to sell starch for them, and he sold other things for other parties.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Coppin, a wood chopper, and reside at No. 8, Seven-step-alley, Rotherhithe. On Saturday night, 16th Dec., between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was in the Admiral Hawke public house, which is kept by the prisoner—the deceased, Le Compt, came in after I was there—my husband was there, and two or three other persons—the deceased was not drunk—I do not believe he was quite sober, for he had been drink<lb></lb>ing—he did not use any indecent or improper language—he was not offen<lb></lb>sive—he did not insult any one in my hearing—he was making a sort of noise, going, "<hi rend="italic">we we, die away, chirrup, chirrup</hi>"—with the exception of that foolish sort of noise he was not saying anything rude—the landlady and her daughter were behind the bar—I saw the prisoner come out from behind the bar into the bar—the deceased was winking his eye, and Mr. Wilton said, if he kept winking his eye at him, he would knock his two eyes into one, that he should not see for a month—the deceased made no reply—he kept winking his eye, and Mr. Wilton told him to go out—Mrs. Wilton had told him that she would not have her customers insulted—I had not heard him insult any one—he told her to go to heaven, and if she did not like that she was to go to Hackney—when Mr. Wilton told him to go out he came round directly, took the glass out of the deceased's hand that he was drinking out of, and gave it to another person who was standing at the bar; took him by the two shoulders, and shoved him backwards, till he got within a little space of the door, which was partly open, and then he shoved him backward through the doorway, down the steps—it was the doorway leading into Salisbury-street—there are three steps to that doorway, and a large flagstone, which rises higher than the other pavement—one of the steps is stone, the two top ones are of wood—the prisoner seemed to shove the de<lb></lb>ceased down the steps with all the strength that he had—I went and lifted</p>

               <p>the deceased's head up—he was bleeding very much indeed—he was inset<lb></lb>sible; he was lying on his back, with his head on the pavement, and his feet inside the door—I saw the prisoner kick his feet twice before he could kick them off the step—it seemed to me as if that was done to shove his feet of the top step, so as he could shut the door—he did close the door afterwards—I told him it was a very brutal thing, and if it came to any justice I would appear against him—he directly told me if I did not go out, he would serve me in the same way, and I went out—I heard nothing said by the deceased about fighting—I went and fetched his daughter, and she came and sent for her mother.</p>

Wilton, you have almost killed the man"—he turned round or his heels, and said, "Let him die, I will not have my wife insulted."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and a licentiate of the Apothecaries' Company for twenty-eight years, and live at No. 4, Albert-place, Rotherhithe. I was called in to see the deceased on Saturday, 16th Dec., about five minutes past 10 o'clock at night, at his residence, No. 4, Wells-street, Bermondsey, which leads out of Salisbury-street—I found him suffering from a lacerated contused wound on the right side of the head, between the temple and the occipital bone, occupying the lower portion of the parietal bone—it was about two inches long—there had been considerable hemorrhage, but that was arrested by a coagulum, or clot of blood, forming a natural stoppage—I did not take any remedial means at that time—I advised him to be removed to Guy's Hospital, and I believe he was admitted there at 2 o'clock in the morning—I saw him next on 18th Jan.—he was then in bed at his own house—it was about 11 o'clock in the morning—the contusion had then taken an unfavourable turn; it had suppurated, and gangrene and mortification had ensued—he died from an abscess of the brain, connected with that mortified wound on the right side of the head—I have no doubt whatever of the cause of death; he died from the effects of the wound produced by the fall—I took down a declaration which he made on the Monday preceding his death, which was on Friday, 26th Jan.—he was then in great danger—he was aware that he was not going to recover, he told me so—he began to make a statement respecting the transaction, and the manner in which it occurred, and I asked him if he wished to say anything that I should take down—he said, "Yes," and he</p>

Half a pint of gin was called for; a pot of half and half was passed round by some person, I do not know who; some <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi> took place between me and others at the bar, when the landlady said she would have no noise there; I told her she might go to Heaven or Hackney.

               <p>they had a pot of stout—he began to annoy the customers, and was leaning on the bar, and my mother said to him, "Mister," (she did not know his name,) "I cannot have you annoy my customers"—he was pressing his con<lb></lb>versation upon them—my mother asked him to lean off the bar—he was leaning over the bar, and gnashing his teeth in her face; and he said, "Who are you? What business has a d——thing like you in the bar? Go to hell; that is the best place for you. I will put you in the Queen's Bench;" and he gnashed his teeth in a most spiteful manner in her face—my father then came into the bar through the private parlour, and said, "My good fellow, I can't have my wife insulted; you must leave the house"—he said, "I shan't go till I like"—my father said, "Do not be silly, take my advice and go"—he said, "No, I will not go"—my father then went round to the door, and opened it, to look for a policeman—not seeing one, he came back again and said, "My good fellow, do as I wish you, go"—he said, "No, I shall not go till I like"—my father again asked him several times to go; he said, "No," he would not—my father then took the glass out of his hand—I cannot say whether he put it on the bar, or whether another party took it from him and set it on the bar—the deceased then put his hand on my father's shoulder, and said, "Then, if I go, by Christ you shall go with me;" and he seized my father by the handkerchief, and dragged him to the door—the door was partly open, and my father put his right hand up to the side of the door—his left arm was lame, from a broken collar bone—he only had that hand at liberty then, heaving the other one to save him from falling over the man—my father's left hand was on the door and his right hand on the door post, and I saw no more until my father turned round, and his waistcoat was unbuttoned, (he wore a waistcoat buttoned to the throat,) and his Watch was hanging out of his pocket—I did not see the accident—my father had not the use of his left arm.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the Admiral Hawke on the night of this occurrence—I saw the deceased and several other persons there—the deceased came in, and called for a pot of beer—Mrs. Wilton refused serving him; he was drunk—she served the other young man who came in with him; he was not so bad—because Mrs. Wilton would not draw the drink for him, he called her a <hi rend="italic">thing</hi>, three or four times—he was abusive and insulting—she told him she would send for her husband—he said, "You can go to h—," three or four times, "that is the best place for you"—Mr. Wilton was sent for, and came in—the deceased still stood there, grinding his teeth—Mr. Wilton stood very quiet for a minute, I should say, while the deceased kept grinding his teeth, and, at last, he came round and said, "I won't have such language and abuse going on here like this; you had better go out"—he replied, "When I like"—Wilton said, "If you don't go out, I shall have to put you out;" and he put his hand on his shoulder, and said, "Are you going?"—he said again, "When I like"—Wilton said, "Then I shall put you out"—he then seized Mr. Wilton by the collar, and dragged him as far as the door, saying, "If I go out, by Christ, you shall go with me!"—when they got to the door, I saw Mr. Wilton open the door with his left hand, and put his other hand to the other part of the door, to save himself from going with him—with that the man let go; I do not know how, or what he had hold of; I thought he had hold of Mr. Wilton's collar, and by that</p>

Q.</hi> Where were you standing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the end of the bar—there is a little seat, just behind the door that the man went out of—I could see all that took place between them—Mr. Wilton placed one hand on the man's shoulder, one hand on one shoulder; that was at the first start<lb></lb>ing—I am sure he did not put both hands on his shoulders, it was his left hand—he had his right hand at liberty all the time the man was going back<lb></lb>wards towards the door—the man stepped backwards; he was not pushed backwards; he did not go backwards—he did go backwards, but Mr. Wilton was against the door first, and when they came to the door the man turned round—he went through the door backwards; I think that was by losing his hold of Mr. Wilton, and so overbalancing himself.</p>

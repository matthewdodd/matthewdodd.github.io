            . Q. Mr. Wilkinson was with you when you were going home - A. Yes, and when we came within two doors of the prosecutrix's house it was about half past one, I saw Grundel standing within a door or two of that, Mr. Wilkinson had the lanthorn in his hand, he held it up in his face, he said he did not like that man; Mr. Wilkinson poked his stick against two doors and the third gave way, that was Mrs. Taylor's, and out rushed a man, he made a blow at him with the stick, and away the man ran, he ran after him, I ran after Grundel and took him, Grundel ran, I took him to the watch-house; I never lost sight of him.</p>

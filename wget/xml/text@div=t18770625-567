I am butler to Lord Gardner, of 46, Dover Street, Piccadilly—on the evening of 1st April, the prisoner came there—I was waiting at dinner when the second footman made a communication to me, and I went downstairs and told the prisoner to give up the plate—he said he had done it for a lark and gave up eighteen spoons and eighteen forks, which he took from his great coat pocket and from his jacket—he had pre<lb></lb>viously lived with me in service.</p>

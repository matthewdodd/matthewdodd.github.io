               <p>Court. Did you feel your watch go? - No; I thought she had it, I caught her hand, and the watch was in her hand, and I took it from her, I cannot positively say that she took it to defraud me of it, she said, she only took it to know what o'clock it was,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110094"></xptr> I took it from her, she made no resistance, being in liquor I did not feel it, she either said she had taken it, or taken it up, she behaved well till I threatened to ill treat her, then the neighbours came, and said, it was a house of ill same, and they insisted upon my charging her.</p>

               <p>He laid his watch on the table, we were at supper, it was only on one side of the plate.</p>

            </rs>. He was a 2d time indicted on the Statute of Stabbing: And a 3d time indicted on the Coroner's Inquisition for the said Murder. It appeared by the Evidence of the Brother and Widow of the Deceased, and several others, that the Deceased <rs id="t17250115-12-viclabel63" type="occupation">kept a Victualling-Cellar</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17250115-12-victim88 t17250115-12-viclabel63"></join>, and that the Prisoner came down in the Night and enquired for - Foreside, a Soldier. The Deceased's Wife said to him, You have no Occasion to ask that Question, for you know as well as I that he's in the Savoy. The Prisoner then Shaking his Fist, reply'd, D - your Blood, you Bitch, I'll be revenged of you for what you said to him. Some of the Company desired him to be either quiet, or go away; but he continued very troublesome. A Recruit, who was then drinking in the Cellar, stept to him, and thrust him up Stairs. In the Struggle the Prisoner drew his Sword, push'd at the Recruit, and scratched him in the Neck. The Recruit retired, and the Deceased seeing him bleed, went to the Stair foot and called the Prisoner Rogue and Villain, for drawing upon a naked Man. You Black-guard Dog, says the Prisoner, come hither, and I'll serve you the same Sauce. Upon this, the Deceased stept up 2 or 3 Stairs towards the Prisoner, (there being but 7 Stairs in all) and the Prisoner standing at the Top, thrust his Sword down, and stuck it into the Hand of the Deceased, between the 2 Forefingers. The Prisoner then went away, but returned several times that Night to the Stair Head, calling'em ill Names, flourishing his Sword, and swearing that he would stab every one of them. The Deceased received this Wound about 7 of the Clock on Monday Night. They washed it with Geneva; his Hand swell'd, and was very painful. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, he went to a Surgeon, who dressed it, and gave him something to bathe it. The Surgeon depos'd, that he saw the Deceased no more till the Sunday following, at which time he died of a Fever; but could not say that the Wound was the Cause of the Fever and consequently of his Death. Another Surgeon open'd the Wound after his Death, but said, that he did not believe it to be mortal. The Prisoner in his Defence said, that the Recruit struck him first kickt him, and thrust him up Stairs, the Decreased and others followed with Broomsticks to drive him away. Upon which, he was forced to draw in his own Defence, but did not know how the Decreased happened to receive that Wound; and that the Deceased afterwards receiv'd a great Hurt by falling down Stairs with a Barrel of Beer. Several Witnesses depos'd, that they saw the Deceased 2 or 3 days after he received the Wound, going about his Business as usual. That having a Barrel of Beer on his Shoulder, he fell down, and the Barrel rolled over him: Upon which he cry'd out to his Wife, O! my Dear, I am gone! That a little before his Death, his Wife asked him if that Rogue Cameron (the Prisoner) was not the Cause of his Death And he answered, No. The Jury <rs id="t17250115-12-verdict64" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. What public house was it that you went to get a pint of twopenny? - A. They took me to the White Star; I met with them at the corner of the turning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see them before? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have any conversation with them? - A. The public house and wine vaults where I went to get my pint of twopenny was shut up, it was opposite of where I stood with my onions, in the Butcher row, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. You enquired of them where there was a public house that was open? - A. Yes, they told me if I would go down the street with them, they would shew me a public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the public house with them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go into the public house? - A. They called out to a person of the name of George, they called George in the street; I asked them what they called George for, they told me that was always the name they called when it was late, because they knew their customers; they came behind me and knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you at the time they told you the reason of calling out George? - A. In the street, they were by the side of me; I bid them good night and was coming away from them</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to bid them good night, you had not got your beer? - A. Because I would not go any further with them; I catched the shortest of the two with her hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you turned round after you bid them good night? - A. No, I came strait back to go to my things again; I had left a little girl of eleven years of age to mind the basket in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them struck you? - A.

               <p>Q. You said they were behind you just now, you did not chuse to go any further, you were returning to your things? - A. When I bid them good night, one of them came on the pavement and came before me.</p>
               <p>Q. She passed you then did she? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Being knocked down, what happened to you? - A. The tall one held me by the hair of my head, and kept her hand to my mouth, that I was not able to cry to any watchman or any thing else; my money was taken from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took your money? - A. The short one, she took it out of my pocket apron.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did she take from thence? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150022"></xptr>A. I had five shillings and six-pence, in silver, and I had to the amount of thirteen shillings and six-pence, or fourteen shillings and sixpence, in copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the shortest take all away? - A. Yes, while the tallest was holding of me.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after she had taken the money out of your pocket? - A. I did not see the shortest one till she returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Why she had not left you? - A. Yes, when she had taken the money out of my pocket, she went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did she go? - A. I cannot tell which way she went, it was impossible for me to tell while the other held me down by the hair of my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the tall one do any thing to you? - A. She only held me so, and kept me down by the hair of my head till the short one came back again in about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she hold you down all that while with her hand on your mouth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. About ten minutes you say? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was as much as ten minutes? - A. Yes, I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the shortest came back? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she holding of you down when the shortest came back? - A. Yes, she returned with a man with a brown coloured coat on, he fell down a-top of me, and then the girls ran away, I saw no more of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take any thing away besides your money? - A. My apron, cap, bonnet, and handkerchief, was taken from me while I was held down by the hair of my head, I missed them when I got up, I cannot tell who took them.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did the man go away after he fell down? - A. In about two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What light was there in this street? - A. no light but the light of the lamps; it was under a lamp where I fell.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw them before that night? - A. No, I saw them on the Monday following, near the middle of Whitechapel, between the linen-draper's and the pump.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you charged them with this, and had them taken up? - A. I looked at them stedfast in their faces; I watched to see where they went, I followed them down an alley to a skittle ground in Windfield-street; when they came there they called George, and some man looked out of the back part of the skittle ground, between the boards where the wood work was broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they go then? - A. I do not know where they went then, I turned round and saw no more of them; I went to the office and gave information, and they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. The two prisoners seem to be much smaller women than you; how came you not to get up, you seem to have sufficient strength? - A. I wished to keep my hands rather to myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought proper to lye quiet for ten minutes while this girl held you down, rather than try to get up? - A. What could I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You might have exerted your strength, and have tried? - A. How could I when she had me down by mere strength.</p>
               <p>Q. You might have tried? - A. I did try.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not understand you to have tried, just now you said how could you; I think if you had tried you might have overcome them? - A. I was afraid to do much, I was afraid of having a parcel of Jews about me; very possible if I had tried I might have lost my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought then it was safer to lay quiet and let them do what they liked with you? - A. I was afraid I might loose my life they took the copy of my husband's freedom out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of your clothes again, your cap or your apron? - A. No, I was obliged to go home bare headed and bare-sided, I had not got so much as a cap to put on my head.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 3d of August, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I was coming over Kingsland-road bridge, and saw the prisoner with another man coming out of the prosecutor's stable - the prisoners had each a sack; the third man opened a door to see if any body was coming - he did not see me; he said something to the prisoners - they came into the road, and went into a stable belonging to Brace. I followed, and saw them throw down the loads in the stable. I pushed the door open, went in, and there saw Brace, who had been holding the door, so that we should not come in - he keeps a horse and cart. I asked him what they had got - he said a bit of corn and chaff for the horse - we took them in charge; another patrol went after the third man, but he was gone. I went and took Batley's horse-keeper, but he was discharged - here are the two sacks which I found in Brace's stable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you when you saw them? A. By the wall, about thirty yards from the stable. I could see the door by the light of a fire from a coak burner. I saw them within two yards of the stable door; the third man was in the stable.</p>

            . I am a carman. I occasionally sell corn and chaff - I live in Kingsland-road. I sold Brace a sack of chaff - I cannot tell the day of the month, but it was the night before he was taken - I really believe this to be the same chaff. I sold him about five bushels.</p>

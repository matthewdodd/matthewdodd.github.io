            , SEN. I live at No. 6, City-terrace, City-road. I have been a <rs id="t18270913-21-viclabel136" type="occupation">clerk in Messrs. Hankey's banking-house</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18270913-21-victim353 t18270913-21-viclabel136"></join> for fifteen years, and am still with them. On the 22d of August I left their banking-house in Fenchurch-street, at four o'clock in the afternoon, and then had a pocket-book in my inside coat pocket, containing bills of exchange for 53l. 7s. 5d., 150l., 80l., 65l. 2s. 6d., 200l., 25l. 35l. 13s. 6d., 25l., also a 300l. and a 100l. promissory note - they were all in my pocket-book, and my coat was buttoned up from the time I put the book into my pocket, till I came to the end of Copthall-buildings, where I saw five or six men standing, as if in conference with each other, they were close to the posts at the end of Copthall-buildings, by the passage which leads into Bell-alley - I did not observe the features of any of them; as I was going between the posts, a hustling began among them, and they stopped me; I could not go forward nor backward, as I was surrounded by them (I knew nothing of the party at all) - I was hustled for some time by these men, and at last they got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130029"></xptr>so violent, that I really became apprehensive for the consequences of it - I was quite frightened; when they had hustled me for a small space of time, with violence, then they all dispersed in a moment; they all ran off. I immediately looked down, and found my coat had been opened - I felt for my pocket-book, and that was gone, with the contents. I have not since seen it, or any of the property in it; I have no recollection of the features of any of the persons. I gave an alarm, and said I was robbed of my pocket-book; I saw the prisoner in custody within ten minutes - Brady, I think, had him - only one person was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you a son or relation named James? A. I have a son, James, about twenty-five years of age; this happened about a quarter-past four o'clock in the afternoon; the place is a considerable thoroughfare. I could not tell at what time of the transaction the pocket-book was taken. I suppose it was when the violent hustling began - it all happened in less than two minutes.</p>

            . I am a member of the Stock Exchange. I was passing from Copthall-court into Bell-alley, about a quarter-past four o'clock on this afternoon; there are some posts there - I saw Mr. Sharpe, and observed a very unnecessary confusion in passing; there were several men there, and the prisoner among them - it was not till the party separated that I could see Mr. Sharpe, he being a short man, and so surrounded by them; I could not at that instant distinguish him - about five or six persons were surrounding him, besides others who were passing at the time, and had nothing to do with it. I heard a person observe, "The conduct of those men is more like pick-pockets than anything else." I was waiting to get by at the time, and hearing that observation, I took more notice; Mr. Sharpe appeared very much agitated; the persons separated rather in haste; there was only one I could fix my attention on, and that was the prisoner. I can speak to him with the greatest confidence, he was not so far from me as I am from your Lordship; I asked Mr. Sharpe if he had lost any thing - he felt his pockets, and said "I have lost my pocket-book." I asked him if any thing of consequence was in it; he said between 200l. and 300l. I instantly left him, and ran back through the posts, and caught the prisoner by the arm; he was walking at a rapid pace, and two others of the gang were also walking rapidly. I said to the prisoner, "I observed you there under very suspicious circumstances, the old gentleman has lost his pocket-book, and you must not go till you give some account of yourself," he hesitated at the moment and appeared to doubt that I should suspect him. I said, I certainly would not lose sight of him, and resisttance was in vain; he then professed great readiness to accompany me. Mr. Clarke immediately came up, and said"I am sure that is one of the men;" the prisoner was very near, and I suppose must have heard it - I think he was nearer to the prisoner than I am to your Lordship. Mr. Clarke did not speak very loud - I begged of Mr. Clarke to run after the two other men, but none were secured; the prisoner walked down with me to the end of the court - I walked by his side, and while I was speaking to Mr. Clarke he had walked on rapidly some paces, I followed him again and overtook him, and soon after met Brady, the officer, and gave him in charge - he took him into a shop. I am quite confident he is one of the persons who surrounded Mr. Sharpe - when he was in the shop, he accounted for his being seen stooping down, by saying some of the party had lost a few shillings. I had not seen him stooping down - he said he had stooped down because himself, or one of the party, had dropped a few shillings; I will not say his exact words, but it was to that effect - that himself or some of the party had dropped a few shillings; whether it was himself, or one of the party, I will not undertake to say - I had seen no stooping down myself, not so as to swear to it - he was taken to the Mansion-house, and refused to give any account of it. I have not the slightest doubt of his being one of the persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far from where you saw Mr. Sharpe did you come up with the prisoner, when he was walking? A. I should think about fifty yards, it might be seventy; I had asked Mr. Sharpe if he had lost anything.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your attention at that time drawn off to Mr. Sharpe? A. Certainly - I did not see any person do anything - I think I saw a person stooping, but will not swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. You followed some persons who were walking quickly? A. Yes; their backs were towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you saw Mr. Sharpe, you had your eye on the party? A. Yes; the instant the observation was made about their conduct I spoke to Mr. Sharpe - I saw the prisoner before I spoke to Mr. Sharpe, it was long enough to distinguish him, it might be a quarter of a minute at the least - eight or nine persons might be collected, waiting to get through the posts like myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know how easy it is to mistake a man's face? A. Yes; but it is not easy to mistake a yellow handkerchief, and boots, much larger than are usually worn, without tops to them, and a tall man like him - he had a yellow handkerchief, and boots of a peculiar character, which attracted my attention, as well as his features, and his back more particularly. I saw his back and face also; not both at the same instant, but during the time - the crowd was very close together; the prisoner was an outside one.</p>
               <p>Q. When a crowd is collected, can you see who has boots on? A. Yes; he being outside the crowd, but one of them; I noticed his being a very tall, powerful man; I was going to remoustrate with them at first, for pushing in that way against an old gentleman - and when I heard about pick-pockets, I noticed them more - I took hold of him, but when he consented to go quietly I let go of him; he walked on before me eight or ten yards, and I came up to him; he walked away at a very rapid pace - he did not run - the others ran away when they got to the corner; they were all strangers to me - whether they were acquainted together I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see them do anything? A. I saw them very active in surrounding the gentleman; I saw him among the crowd, very active in opposing resistance to any one who attempted to come through the posts, as I thought, but when they separated and the cry of Pickpockets! was given, then I found what they had been about - a considerable quantity of silver was found on him; I believe nearly 3l. but none of the property - Mr. Sharpe was agitated, and said he had lost 200l. or 300l.; but directly he got to the Mansion-house, he said 1200l.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the London Life<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130030"></xptr>Assurance-office. I was passing in Copthall-buildings at the time in question, and noticed a number of persons standing round by the iron posts: I was informed Mr. Sharpe had been robbed of his pocket-book - I did not see him at first, but when I heard he had lost his pocket-book, I saw him - I saw three persons going in the direction which the prisoner went, and several persons going towards Bell-alley: I distinguished the prisoner's person quite plain - When I first saw him he was at a less distance than I am from your Lordship. I joined Mr. Edwards in the pursuit, and overtook the prisoner. I then went to see after two others, but did not succeed. I walked with Mr. Sharpe to the Mansion-house - the office was closed. I attended the examination next morning, and had no doubt of the prisoner's person then, nor have I now. I have no doubt of his being one of the men I saw at the posts at the time Mr. Sharpe was robbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do I understand that your attention was first directed by hearing it said Mr. Sharpe was robbed? A. My attention was first directed by seeing a number of persons together. I directly put my watch into my pocket for safety; that was before I heard Mr. Sharpe had lost his pocket-book. I suppose seven or eight persons were collected - I was not in the crowd.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a crowd? A. There were seven or eight persons round the posts. The passage is not more than four feet wide, I should think: they completly blocked up the passage - I could not see beyond them.</p>
               <p>Q. When they dispersed did not ten or twelve go away together? A. No - I saw no persons walking but myself and Mr. Edwards: he (Mr. Edwards) was close to the crowd; I was further from them.</p>

            . I am a constable of Broad-street Ward. I was going down Broad-street, and saw a crowd of people coming up: I asked a person what was the matter - they sent me down to Copthall-court, but I met Mr. Edwards in Broad-street: he said, "This man has hustled a gentleman, and he has been robbed:" he charged the prisoner with it. I secured him, and took him into a grocer's shop, and searched him, but found none of the property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have only to observe that I was passing accidentally through the court at the time: several other persons seemed obstructing the passage; I passed, as several others did, and did not notice any thing that was going on - I passed through the crowd, through three or four persons - I got through, and was going along another street, out of the passage, when a gentleman accosted me, and asked if I had not come through that court - I said Yes: he said a gentleman had lost his pocket-book there - I said I knew nothing about it; he said it was very suspicious; I said, "If you think it was me, you are at liberty to search me, or I will go any where with you." That is all I know of the transaction.</p>
               <p>MR. EDWARDS. I am not certain that the prisoner said he himself was stooping down.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character, but stated they had known nothing of him for the last three or four months.</p>

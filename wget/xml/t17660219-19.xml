We found some of the silk, part in a band box, and part in a drawer: it had been cut, and some run into two petticoats (some silk produced in court.)

            . I am an officer. On the Saturday before the 8th of February, I was going to the barber's. A man that had been robbed had got hold of the evidence: he delivered him to me. He would not confess any thing at first, but after that he did, and said, he had been guilty of several robberies. This was before the Justice. I went with him to the houses he directed me to: the people all said they had lost the things he mentioned. He gave an account of this silk. We went to the prosecutor; he said, he had lost such. The boy said, it was sold to the woman at the bar. The Justice ordered us to go and fetch her, which we did. We found her in bed at 12 at noon; we went and found this silk in her apartment. The boy said, she bought it of him and the prisoner for 6 s. and he had 3 s. of the money. Burnham was taken five or six days after: he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176602190013"></xptr> not own to any thing at all, we took Fox the evidence and two boys in bed with three girls, like piggs in a barn; some little time before this, the boys promised to go all to sea, upon which they were discharged, and in about a week after he was taken again.</p>

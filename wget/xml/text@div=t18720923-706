                  </hi>. I live with my husband at 3, Market Street, Kennington Lane—on 19th August I was in Kennington Lane with my son by my first husband; his name was Richard White, and he was ten years old—he went out between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening; he had a barrow with him—he turned from Market Street into Kennington Lane, and crossed to the left-hand side, going towards Kennington Cross—I was on the right side, on the pavement, and he was in the road, on the left side, pushing the barrow, with the handles in his hand—I saw a three-horse van close to the pavement, on the same side as my son, who was close to the behind horse of the van—there were two wheelers, and one in the shafts, and he was passing them; they were walking—I saw a Hansom's cab coming in an opposite direction very quickly towards town from Kennington Cross, close to my boy—there was a very wide space between the cab and the pavement; the cab was more towards the left than the right, and there was loads of room for the cab to pass—I heard several people halloa "Look out!"—the cab came very quickly, and overturned the barrow, with all my goods, and my boy was thrown under the waggon—I went to the hospital with him—I did not see the prisoner till the day of the inquest—I am sure the cry occured before my boy was struck.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Magistrate "I did not notice the cab before it was almost close to the barrow"—the barrow was not heavily laden; there was fried fish on it; the wheels are very small—the prisoner drove us to the hospital in his cab.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a traveller, and live at 27, Gilbert Road, Lower Kennington Lane—on 19th August I stopped at the Roebuck, Kennington Cross, and just as I started my horse I saw a cab in the middle of the road—there was a cab rank there, but no cab in it, and nothing to prevent the cabdriver from going on his own near side; there was plenty of room—I saw the boy with the barrow, and saw that if the cab did not turn out of the road a little it would touch the barrow—something made me turn round, and I saw the boy ten or twelve yards from me—I called out "Stop! cabman, don't you see the barrow?" loud enough for him to hear, but he made no answer—he drove past me very fast, and his off-wheel caught the front of the barrow and turned it quite round, and turned it under the van—there was plenty of room; ten or twelve yards, I should say, between the cart and the barrow—the boy was thrown under the van; it seemed to jam him up against the horses, and the wheel of the van injured him—it seemed to come up right against him, but it did not go over him, or it must have cut him in two—the prisoner kept going on; I called to him to stop, and he did so—I jumped down and said "You have done a very fine thing; you have killed this poor boy"—he said "Oh, it was not my fault; it was the fault of the van; I did not go near him"—I heard several people call out before he struck the barrow.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 19, Haines Street, Battersea Fields—I was the carman with the three-horse waggon on the day—I was coming from the City with about five tons of goods, and saw the boy with a barrow; he came out of Lower Kennington Lane—I said, "You get back you young rascal, do, "and he got back behind my van, which was going very slow, eighteen inches or two feet from the kerb—the boy came on my off-side, as I was</p>

               <p>not going quite fast enough for him and passed my van, and the fore part of his barrow was between my leader and the off-side wheel horse—there was about a foot between the barrow and my horses—the barrow was on the off-side, and there was room for two vehicles to pass; there was my width and the barrow's width, and room for two more on the opposite side—when the barrow was run into there was room for him to pass if he had pulled the near side rein—when I saw the cab coming I sang out "Hold hard, you will catch that barrow"—I bellowed as hard as I could, and I should say that he could hear me—he was coming about eight miles an hour, and no sooner had I done halloaing than his off-wheel caught a notch in the barrow, and turned it right round, which very nearly turned the cab over, and as the barrow came over it threw the boy under my wheels—there was only two wheels to the barrow—the cab got about twenty yards beyond the van; some lad got hold of the horse's head and stopped him, and the cab came back and stopped—there was no vehicle on the off<lb></lb>side between the barrow and the pavement.</p>

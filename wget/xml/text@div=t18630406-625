                  </hi>. In December last, I had an office at 35, Aldersgate-street—we are agents for Messrs. Broadbent and Son, of Bradford—about that time we were to receive from them a case of alpacas for transmission to Paris—I never saw any goods of that kind on my premises—I was ill in the month of December last—I was acquainted with the prisoner, and he was employed by me in a friendly way—I was not able to walk to my office, and I gave him the key and asked him if he would oblige me by going to my office to bring the letters—he did so—he had no authority to interfere with my goods in any way or to sell them—he has never told me that he sold them—he has never accounted to me for any sum of money—I was not acquainted with the history of these goods till 11th December—the prisoner absconded on the 15th; I saw him on that day—I had no conversation with him about these goods till 18th March, when I met him and gave him into custody.</p>

Walmsley, of Paris—I had ordered them—I did not know to a day or two when they were to arrive, because the order was divided—I had had one portion on 26th November, and shipped them on the 28th—I heard that the goods had arrived three days before 15th December, the last time I saw the prisoner—I never have any goods arrive at my premises—I heard they had been delivered, from the clerk at Hambro'-wharf, Mr. Dear—I did not give any direction as to their being shipped or re-shipped—I called at Hambro'-wharf to make a complaint about the previous case being so long on the road, and to say I expected a out in two or three days, and Dear said, "Why you had some case here yester<lb></lb>day, and your clerk came down and signed an order for the goods"—I said, My clerk! I have no clerk," and he showed me the paper—that was about 4 o'clock on 12th December—I wrote directly to Messrs. Broadbent's—the clerk could give me no more information about the goods, except that they had been signed for and taken up to Aldersgate-street—we went to Alders<lb></lb>gate-street, but did not find the goods there—I did not speak to the prisoner about the non-finding the goods—the paper was not his signature, but William Lees'; I could not take Martin for Lees—I went to consult the police first.</p>

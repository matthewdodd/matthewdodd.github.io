               <p>I was going to Mr. Jennour's on Tuesday the 4th of this month; I saw the prisoner lift a prickle basket upon his shoulder; I saw some wine on the ground, and knowing Mr. Jennour had a fresh pipe of wine in, I asked him what he had in his basket, he said, nothing, he then pitched the basket on the outside of the door.</p>
               <p>Court. What had he in the basket? - Upon searching the basket I found eleven bottles of wine, and one broke and the wine running about.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, prisoner's counsel. How far was you from the prisoner? - About a yard.</p>
               <p>Was his face from the house or towards it? - From it, he was in liquor at the time; he was reeling.</p>
               <p>He had not quitted the door? - No.</p>

               <p>On the 4th of July, about seven o'clock coming down Dean's-court I observed the prisoner coming up the steps from the kitchen; he let the basket fall, he was very much intoxicated; upon further enquiry we found it was wine, one of the bottles was broke, and the wine running about; just before the prisoner said, they were empty bottles, and was going away with them; Mr. Fenton insisted upon his putting the basket down again, and on searching it, we found it was red port containing twelve bottles, one of which was broke.</p>

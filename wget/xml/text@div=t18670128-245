                  </hi>. I live at 25, Victoria Street, Hackney—on 29th January, between three and four in the afternoon, I went to Low Layton to see some empty houses, my mother's property—when I got there I heard some one coming down stairs in one of the houses—I unlocked the front door, and heard somebody run out at the back door and slam it—I followed through the house and saw the prisoner getting over some rails—I took hold of him and asked him what he did there—he said some carpenter, who he met in the street, brought him into the house to mend a door, and he did not know his name or where he lived—there were only footmarks of one person having gone into the house—I missed a brass tap from over the sink, and some keys, which were taken from the prisoner in my presence—at the station I said, "I believe these are mine"—he said he took them to try them to the doors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When we got back to the house did you not ask me how I got in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—you did not tell me that the carpenter had left the door open, nor did I say, "It is impossible, as there has been no carpenter employed there lately"—the policeman did not press me to own the keys and the tap, so as to give you in charge—this tap is covered with white<lb></lb>wash—I had seen it a week or two before—'the policeman laid hold of your hand, which was partly in your pocket and partly out, and took out a number of skeleton keys—fifty or sixty keys were found on you, from which I picked but these six—I cannot swear to them, as about forty or fifty of them resembled one another very much, but mine were rusted through being in an empty house—I could not get into the other house because the lock had been tampered with, but I have broken in since and found the taps and keys arc gone from there—I had not been there for several weeks—I did not see you at the second house.</p>

               <p>on him—there were altogether fifty-seven door keys and eleven brass taps—Davies picked out six of the keys and one of the taps—I took these six keys and tried them to six locks in the house, and they fitted—I compared the brass tap with a place over the sink which had been forcibly cut, and it corresponded exactly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was there any policeman to be found? had not you to be taken out of bed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was off duty and was in bed—Davies walked be<lb></lb>hind you to the station and said, "He has got something in his hand"—you were about dropping the taps and keys when I seized your hand, but you did not drop any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, stated that he was employed by a carpenter at the house, and, having found the taps and keys concealed, he thought there would be a reward for them, and, as he could not find a policeman, was going to take them to Stratford Station when Mr. Davies came to the door.</hi>

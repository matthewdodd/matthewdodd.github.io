                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Goodwin. I work at my needle—my husband works on the railway—the prisoner lodged in the same house—my shawl laid among my clothes—we had no box in the place, our things being burnt some time before—on the 21st of July the prisoner assisted me in folding up my shawl—she said it was a d----d good shawl—I laid it among my clothes in her presence—she asked me how much the shawl would pledge for—I said I did not know, and hoped I never should—she stayed and had tea with us—the next morning I went with my husband's breakfast—when I came back the prisoner came up to assist me—I told her I would rather she went down and got her own place comfortable before her husband came—she said no, she would be d----d if she did—she sat down on my bed—I went down for about ten minutes, I came back—the prisoner was ill, and she asked me for some water—I gave her some tea—she stayed till she considered it was twelve o'clock—she then desired me to go with her husband's dinner—she went away about five minutes before me—I missed my shawl about five minutes after she left the house, on Friday, the 22nd of July—no other person could have taken it but the prisoner—she was in my room from the time we folded it up till I missed it—I gave her in charge at Kingston on the Monday following—I lost it from Hanwell—she had not given up her lodging—when she went out, she said she was going to gather wood—I have never seen my shawl since.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Penton Arms public-house, in Baron-street, Pentonville—the prisoner came into my service about four months back as pot-boy—I had an account with Mr. Henman, which was going on most of the time the prisoner was with me—on Tuesday, the 22nd of September, he paid me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for Mr. Henman, and said the balance was to be paid the following week.</p>

I told him, if he gave any credit he must be responsible—I discovered this on the Monday after I discharged him, which was on Friday—I had him taken into custody on the Monday or Tuesday evening, when he came into my house and was smoking his pipe—I had not seen him between the Friday and Monday—he might have been in my house between Friday and Monday, but I did not see him—I do not know that I saw him on Sa<lb></lb>turday or Sunday—I do not often go into the tap-room—I did not see him in my house on Saturday or Sunday—if any one told me he was there, I did not pay any attention to it, for I did not know till Monday morning that he had robbed me—I do not believe he was in the house on Saturday or Sunday—I do not know where he went to from my house—there had been a quarrel between the cook and the pot-boy shortly before—the pri<lb></lb>soner went before the Magistrate about it—I was angry with him for going as a witness against the cook—I discharged him for it, because he had told me he knew nothing about it—I did not say I would <hi rend="italic">serve him out</hi> for it—I did not say so to any body—I have known the prisoner's father since this occurrence—I never saw him till I saw him before the Magistrate—I never told him that I would <hi rend="italic">serve</hi> the prisoner <hi rend="italic">out</hi>—I said I would make an example of him, as I had been robbed by so many pot<lb></lb>boys—I have not the least feeling against the boy—I did not ask him for any explanation about the money before I gave him into custody—I did not ask why he did not pay me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had been about in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood saying that I owed him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he never stated to me that I was in his debt—he said stoppage of wages was no payment—I never kept back his wages—he always took more than 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of beer out, and his</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Chapel-street, Pentonville.

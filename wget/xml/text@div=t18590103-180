                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, F</hi> 50). On 2d January I was on duty in Holborn, in plain clothes—Walker was with me, also in plain clothes—it was between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening—we followed the prisoner and another man some distance—as we were going along Holborn the prisoner turned round and saw me—he knew me, and he said to the other man who was with him, "Come up here"—they were then at the end of a court—the prisoner began to walk up, himself, and the other man turned to follow him—I made a rush up the court, and laid hold of the prisoner—before I got to him he put both his hands in his trousers pockets—I told him I suspected he had got some base coin about him, and I should see—I and Walker took him in custody—he resisted very violently—I succeeded in getting one of his hands out of his pocket, and I put my hand in his pocket, and took out this purse, which had two sixpences in it, one bad and one good—I had pulled his left hand out, and he held that hand very close—I took his right hand out, but found nothing in that—he still held his left hand very tight—we tried to open it but could not—he bent his hand nearly double, and I heard something drop—a man opened his door just at that moment, and I asked him for a light, and I picked up this bag, containing seven sixpences, all wrapped in paper—we took him to the station, and as we were going along he said to mo, "Fifty, who has put me away"—I was in plain clothes, but he knew mo well—the other man was taken, and was detained that night; but he had nothing on him, and the Magistrate discharged him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, E</hi> 62). I was with the last witness on that occasion—we followed the prisoner for about ten minutes—he had another man with him—the prisoner turned round—I don't think he saw me; but he knew Holmes—ho turned up a court, and Holmes rushed up and seized him—he directly put his hands in his trousers pockets, and held them tight</p>

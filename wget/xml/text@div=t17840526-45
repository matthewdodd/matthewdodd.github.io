               <p>What did you do with the money? - I paid one gentleman five guineas, and another four, when I paid the money I received some hand-bills, I wrapped up the rest of my money in two of these bills, I went to the Blue Posts in the afternoon of the same day, I wrapped the money up in these two bills, and put it in my pocket, I felt it in my pocket at Taylor's the constable's, and I lost it going down to the Justices, I had a quarrel with a person, and the prisoner was there, I asked her to drink.</p>
               <p>Court. In which side pocket was it? - In my right hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Did you go to Taylor's? - Yes, the prisoner said she would see me righted, and I went to Taylor's, and there I felt it in my pocket, and I saw it in my hand, nobody went with me but the constable and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>When you came to the magistrate's, what happened then? - I asked for a warrant and put my hand in my pocket, and said what shall I do, I am robbed of all my money, she immediately cried out she had nothing but the change of a shilling, which I had given her.</p>
               <p>Was that answer immediately upon your declaring you had lost your money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What passed then? - Then Mr. Taylor the constable insisted upon searching her.</p>
               <p>Did he search her? - He did, and she declared she had nothing but this money, and be pulled out of her pocket two sixpences and some halfpence, and then he put his hands under her arms, and said, by God, here is the woman's money; with that she said, do not make any words, and they opened her clothes, and either under her right breast, or her left breast, the money was found, the Justice saw it found.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Did you feel her take it out of your pocket? - No, Sir, I did not indeed.</p>

               <p>I am constable of St. Margaret's parish, Westminster; the prosecutor and the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260083"></xptr> came to my house between nine and ten, I was at supper, I went with them to get a warrant, when we was at the Justice's, while he was writing out the warrant, the woman felt in her pocket and said she had lost her money; I did not think she had any money, but I said to the woman next to me, I will search you, she said she had no money, and just underneath her arm, I felt a great lump, and I made oath here is the money, I put my hand between her skin and her shift; and there was the money, I put it down by the Justice, and he counted it, and there was twenty guineas, and eighteen half guineas, and half a crown piece, and two shillings and sixpence, the Justice inclosed it and he sealed it, and I sealed it, and he gave me his gold seal to take care of, this is the seal, I left it with the Justice to take care of, it has never been opened, I can swear to the seal, I left it in the Justice's hands for fear of an accident.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. What were those hand-bills that you wrapped it up in? - This is one of the same sort, I had four or five.</p>

               <p>My Lord, the man that the prosecutrix cohabits with happened to have a quarrel, and a great dispute arose, she gave me a gown to hold, I saw something lay, and I took it up, and put it into my bosom; in a little time after she asked me to go with her, I told her I had found something, she never said she had lost any thing at the time, I never looked at what I had, I kept it in my bosom, I went with her to the constable's, and from thence to the Justice's, when I came there, she said she had no money to discharge the warrant, I did not imagine the money belonged to her, or that she could have so much.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it before you went to the constable's that you picked this up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Are you sure that you had it when you was at the constable's? - Yes, my Lord.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carver and gilder, of 14, Chiswell-street—on 15th January, about half-past 9 o'clock, I was between Bunhill-row and Artillery-court—I saw the prisoner and another man coming towards me, apparently drunk—I moved on one side to get out of the way, but the man who is not taken, gave a lurch against me and I fell—my hat fell in the gutter and I stooped to get it—he came to help me up, but he seemed more disposed to pull me about, or tumble over me—the prisoner came behind me,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186203030075"></xptr>
               <p>and I felt something being drawn from my pocket—I put my hand in my pocket and found that all was gone—there had been a purse containing thirteen sovereigns, a half-crown, and two sixpences: and a silver snuff-box—I had them in my pocket less than half an hour before—I caught hold of the prisoner's coat, and said, "This man has taken my purse"—I turned round and the other man was gone, and my silver snuff-box was lying in the gutter—I held the prisoner—a policeman came up and I gave him in custody—Mrs. Brooks laid hold of him as well.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Where had you been to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was coming from my employer's—I did not hear any conversation between you—you had not your arms linked together, but were a very short distance from each other—I was perfectly sober—the other man, who had knocked me down, came in front of me under pretence of picking me up, and you pulled me about here—you were not in front of me; you put your left arm under my right arm, and I think Mrs. Brooks laid hold of your other arm—neither of you lifted me up—after I fell, I twisted myself round to get my hat, but I was not on my back, I was in a sitting position, and my impression is that your hand was in my pocket, but I will not swear it was your hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph James Brooks, of 4, Artillery-court, Chiswell-street—on 15th January, about half-past 9 o'clock, I was in Chiswell-street, and saw the last witness sitting in the gutter—I asked him if he fell down—he said, "No, these two men pushed me down"—the prisoner was then behind him, and the other man in front of him—I saw them attempting to help him up, and heard him say to the prisoner, "You have taken my purse;" and he caught hold of his hand—there was no one near him but the two men—the prosecutor, as he was sitting in the gutter, seized the bottom of the prisoner's coat and held him till he was given in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you see me picking Mr. Ward up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; your left hand was under his right arm, and the other under your Inverness cape—you appeared drunk, and you were very abusive at the station-house—you were close to me—I did not smell your breath—I was not there when he was knocked down; I came up when he was in the gutter—I had hold of his left arm to assist him up, and you had hold of his right—I did not see you take the purse,—I was not on the side you were on—I did not take notice of the other man's hands.</p>

About half-past 9 on 16th January I was in Chiswell-street, and saw the prosecutor sitting in the road, holding the prisoner by his coat—I said, "What is the matter?"—he said, "I have lost my purse, and this man has got it"—he charged him, and I took him in custody—the prisoner said that he did not know anything about it, and would not go to the station—he resisted a great deal—he refused his address at the station; I believe he afterwards gave it, but not to me—I searched him, and found on him two sovereigns, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, thirty-two receipt stamps, and two postage-stamps—he appeared sober when I took him and when he got to the station, but he shammed drank going along—I was close to him, and he did not smell of liquor.</p>

I was on a visit at the Dover Castle, in Church-street, Greenwich, on the 1st of September I saw a bundle in front of the bar—the prisoners were there—they drank a little spirits, then called for another quartern, which they put into water, and sat down upon the bench where the bundle was—I saw Byrne move the bundle aside, and sit down where it had been—it was then between them both—I afterwards missed them and the bundle from the house-Weeks inquired for it—I saw nobody near it but the prisoners.</p>

We had been there all the week, when we wanted refreshments—we drank a quartern of rum—I went into the kitchen, and when I came out the bundle was by the bar—my fellow prisoner was gone away, and I took it, thinking it was his—she knows I was drunk. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

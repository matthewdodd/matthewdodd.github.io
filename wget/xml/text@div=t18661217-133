                  </hi>. I am travelling inspector of the missing letter department—the prisoner was a letter carrier in the northern dis<lb></lb>trict office, but I do not know for how long—there has been a very large number of letters lost in that district lately—I made up a letter contain<lb></lb>ing a marked half-sovereign and 58 marked penny postage stamps, and ad<lb></lb>dressed it Mrs. Delaney, 2, Norfolk Square, New North Road, London—I addressed it so that it would not go into his district—I securely fastened it and posted it at the northern district letter-box at a little before six in the evening of Monday, 10th December—it should be delivered about half-past seven the same evening—next morning I went to the northern district office a little before nine—I saw the prisoner there and told him I was an inspector of the head office, and wished to inquire about a letter that was missing—I asked him if he recollected having a letter for 2, Norfolk Square, last evening—he said, "No, I had so many miss<lb></lb>sorts I cannot recollect any particular one"—I said, "What would you have done with such, a letter if it came into your hands?"—he said, "I should have sorted it to the blind table or given it to the man on the Rotherfield walk"—I asked him if he had taken any letters back that morning that he could not deliver the previous evening—he said no, he had not brought any letters back that morning—he was then searched by Bingham in my presence, and nothing was found on him—after that Bingham and the inspector of the northern district office left, and returned in about half or three-quarters of an hour—Bingham brought back an old uniform coat, which he said he found behind a door at the prisoner's house, and had found these stamps (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in it—he did not say then where the house was—the prisoner at once said, "I know nothing about these stamps, some one must have put them there"—I asked him if it was his coat—he said it was—I identified the stamps, and said, "These are the stamps that I placed in the letter that is missing"—he said, "I know nothing about them"—these are the stamps, they have my mark on them—I gave the prisoner in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was this letter in the prisoner's district? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I understand not—persons can send money in letters without being regis<lb></lb>tered if they please, but we strongly recommend them not to put coin in letters—it was an old coat, with the number cut out of the collar—I should say it was not in use, from its state—I do not know that the prisoner has been twenty-one years in the service.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of letter carriers at the northern district post-office—a communication was made to me, and about six o'clock on 10th December I went to the letter-box there, and found a letter addressed to Mrs. Delaney, No. 2, Norfolk Square—I placed the letters for sorting, and placed the letter for Mrs. Delaney among those to be sorted by the prisoner—I am quite sure this letter was among those I placed before him to sort—while he was arranging his letters I was close behind him—I saw the letter addressed Mrs. Delaney in his left hand, and another in his right hand, which he placed with the one in question on his left side on the table—he left the office about ten minutes past six for his delivery—I did not see that letter after he left—it was not in his district—when he found that the letter was not in his district his first duty would be to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186612170079"></xptr>
               <p>deposit it in the coin letter-box, in order to compel registration—he certainly ought not to have taken it with him, it ought to have been sorted to the other carrier, McIlwin—it was not amongst McIlwin's letters—I made a report of what had taken place—I examined the registration box, and searched all likely places, but could not find it—it was not the prisoner's duty to return that day, he returned the following morning about 630—subsequently, while Mr. Muloch was in conversation with the prisoner, I went with the officer to the prisoner's lodgings, 42, Foster Street, Hoxton—I saw the officer find an old uniform coat—it was hanging just by the door, at the foot of the stairs leading to the back kitchen—in that we found a small packet, which was afterwards shown to Mr. Muloch, con<lb></lb>taining postage stamps, enclosed in a piece of newspaper—Mr. Muloch identified them as being marked by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Has the prisoner been twenty-one years in the Post Office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot speak to the exact date—from my own knowledge I can speak from 1855—I cannot say whether he was entitled to a pension some years ago—after a man has been ten years in the service of the Post Office he is entitled to a pension of one-sixtieth for every year's service—the coat was found close to the back kitchen door—any persons passing upand down would have access to it—it was in his apartments—I cannot say that persons going in to fetch coals or water would have access to it—I know that he rents the house—I did not ascertain whether there were lodgers in the house—I did not make inquiries whether people went down to fetch water or coals—it was no part of my duty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police constable attached to the Post Office—I went with Mr. Hyland to the prisoner's lodgings on the morning of the 11th, and found this coat hanging up close to the back kitchen door, on a peg, against the prisoner's official cape—there were two or three pegs there—it was just outside the door—I found these stamps in the inside coat pocket, and took them and the coat back to Mr. Muloch, at the northern district office, and gave the stamps to him—the prisoner was there—I produced the coat and the stamps, and the prisoner said he knew nothing about the stamps, but the coat was his—I said where I found it—I found 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver on him.</p>

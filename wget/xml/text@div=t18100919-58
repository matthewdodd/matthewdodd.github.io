               <p>Q. How long before you reached the corner of St. Paul's-church-yard had you reason to be certain that you had these notes - A. I had them in my pantaloons pocket when I came into St. Paul's-church-yard, I had a one pound note and two twenty pound notes. At the corner of St. Paul's-church-yard the prisoner came to me and hugged me round the waist, and pressed me to go with her, she was alone, I told her to go about her business, I had not a wish to go with her, after which, I said, where do you live, I insist upon your going about your business. She then said, I am unwell, she would not go with me, and then left me; she left me before I perceived I had lost the notes. When I got upon Ludgate-hill, I put my hand to my pocket, to see whether I had the notes, and my pocket was inside out.</p>
               <p>Q. After this woman left you had you been accosted by any other woman - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of an evening was this, light or dark - A. It was dark; but there were lamps where she stood. I looked her in the face, I am sure it is the woman; afterwards I went to Charing-cross and made my loss known. I saw her again on the 17th in custody; I was sure that she was the woman that accosted me in this way. The bank sent to me, informing me that they had stopped the twenty pound notes. I only know that I had two twenty pound notes in my pocket that I had of Mr. Read. I have one twenty pound note, the other is at the bank, I could not trace it.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you receive that of Mr. Read - A. On the 8th of August, about four or five hours before I lost it.</p>

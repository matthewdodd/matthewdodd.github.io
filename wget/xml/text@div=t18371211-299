                  </hi>. I am a sailor. On the 3rd of December I was half tipsy, and met the prisoner—I went to her lodgings, and went to bed—I had a watch—I kept it in my fob—it was safe when I went to bed—I did not take off my trowsers—I took the watch out as I was going to bed, and it was eleven o'clock—I awoke in the morning, before daylight, and my watch was gone—I called the policeman, he came, and could not find it, but he searched the yard and found it in a dunghill—she was in bed when I awoke—this is my watch.</p>

You was very tipsy, and said you were so tipsy you could not go to bed—you came home with me, and I helped you off with your jacket—you asked me if there was a water-closet, and went into the yard to the water-closet. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I did not go out of the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. There was a man saw him fumbling about the ashes, and the man came and said, I will not go near him, he has hidden something"—he came up into my room and bad plenty of silver—he did not lose a penny in my room—I asked him if he had lost any money—he said "No, only my watch"—I said, You will recollect where it is, and what you have done with it" <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, she did not.</p>

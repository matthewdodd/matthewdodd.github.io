                  </hi> I am a dealer in earthenware at Penny-fields, Poplar—the prisoner was my servant about five months—these plates and jugs are mine—I speak positively to a portion of these other things, but not to all—they are all goods which I supply, and were safe on 6th Feb., at one o'clock.</p>

On 6th Feb., just before eight o'clock, I followed the prisoner into a coffee-shop, in High-street, Poplar, with this dozen plates—he asked the landlord to let him leave them there for a few minutes—the landlord made no answer—the prisoner put them under she seat—as he came out, I said, "Let me see what you have"—he said, "No"—I took them up, and asked where he got them—he said he bought them—I asked where—he said, "Down the street"—I said, "What shop?"—he could not tell me—I took him to the station, searched him, and found this mug in his pocket—he told me where he lived—I went there, and found this jug, and half-a-dozen china cups and saucers, with the straw and dust just as they came from the warehouse.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The warehouse was locked up—I was going to take the plates to the other warehouse, and went into the coffee-shop—a number of these things my mother has had for years—Mr. Hardwick never had any cups and saucers of this shape.</p>

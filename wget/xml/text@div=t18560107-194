                  </hi>. In July last I was a waiter at a public house near Temple-bar. On the afternoon of 1st July I was in Hyde-park—I some<lb></lb>times go there on a Sunday, I am not in the habit of doing so, I go occa<lb></lb>sionally—about 4 o'clock I was near the Serpentine, on the other side of the drive, the further side from the Serpentine—there was a very great crowd—I saw an old man struck by some policemen, upon which I cried out "Shame!" and the great majority of the persons in the crowd did the same—at the same time something went by close to where I was standing, I do not know what it was, I did not throw anything, I did not see that it struck any one—I turned my head round to see from whence it came and I was immediately seized by the collar by A 398, the prisoner—I did not have time to recognise his number then, but he is the man—he did not say what he seized me for—I was about to remonstrate with him for taking hold of me, but I was immediately struck down by a blow on the left side of the head with the priaoner's staff—it was a blow sufficient to render me partially insensible—when I recovered my recollection, I found myself being placed in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I was very much covered with blood, my waistcoat, shirt, trowsers, handkerchief, hat, and everything—the blood came from my head and streamed down the side of my face—I had done nothing to the police<lb></lb>man before he struck me, after he took hold of my collar—I had not struck him or raised my hand against him—I did not see him till he seized me by the collar—he was by himself, and the crowd began to close round, and I believe they tried to pull me away, but I could not be positive—the prisoner went with me to Vine-street station in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and there charged me with throwing stones and assaulting him—I was kept there till about 12 o'clock at night, in a cell along with about forty more, I was then taken to Marylebone lane that same night—on Monday I was taken to Marlborough-street to go before the Magistrate, but I did not go till Tuesday—I was then discharged—I was kept in custody till then.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you charged with throwing stones at the police? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The policeman charged me before the Magistrate with throwing stones at the police, but not with assaulting him—I cannot say how many witnesses were examined before the Magistrate—Mr. Hard<lb></lb>wick requested the gaoler to examine my head to see whether it was a blow from a truncheon or some missile—he did not examine my head, he put his hand on it but not where the cut was, and I stated so at the time—it was not stated that it was more likely done by an oyster shell than a truncheon—he said there was a slight cut, apparently from a stone, and the Court hissed him at the time—I hissed at the police, I cannot say that I</p>

               <p>was shouting and hooting at them—I was crying "Shame!" I was decidedly not so meek and mild as I am now, I was very much excited—I did not hear it stated that it was unlawful to go to the Park—I saw it posted up to that effect—I did not go on purpose for a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—there was no one with me, I went by myself in my best things—I was at that time potman and waiter in Ship-yard, I had been so for about six months—I left there last Christmas eve—I have not been doing anything since—I have been out of place—I have a little money in the bank, in St. Martin's-place—I have not been living entirely upon that—I have been living at home with my parents—I have 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the bank at present—that is my balance at my bankers—the policeman charged me before the Magistrate with being the person that threw the stone—I cannot say positively whether the mob did or did not try to rescue me, I had not sufficient time, I believe they did—I was pulled different ways, first by the mob and afterwards by five or six policemen—I was knocked down—I believe the policeman did not fall down also, nor was he trampled upon by the mob—I think I could swear he was not—I do not think he ever released his hold of my collar—I cannot say that he went down, he might—I did not see any one in the mob with sticks, flourish<lb></lb>ing them about and knocking the police—I saw only the one stone thrown—I am not sure whether it was a stone or not, the only other throwing I saw was a man throwing handfulls of dust at the carriages, I do not know that there was a brick or two in it—it all flew back in the faces of the people—I cannot say what I said before the Commissioners—I recollect saying, "I resisted a little, I think, I did not want to be locked up"—I did not beg of the policeman as I went to the station in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, to make it as light as possible for me—I said to him, "I believe I did not strike you?"—he said, "Oh! did not you?" and I said, "I dare say you will charge me with it, to justify yourself in striking me over the head"—I did not say if he had not been a <hi rend="italic">plucky</hi> one the mob would have got me away, for they were <hi rend="italic">game</hi> to it, and I was good for it myself—I am not aware that I said to the police, "I don't care, after all, for I have had a good <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> for it"—I do not believe I ever said I had had a good <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> in spite of Mr. Commissioner Mayne—I did not say so to the police—I never said so to anybody that I am aware of, not before I was discharged from the Magistrate—I said after that, that I did not care about being locked up, it was in a good cause—I was very much cheered by the people as I came out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I think it was about half past 3 o'clock when I went to the Park—I was not shouting at the horses as they went by, not generally speaking—I do not recollect shouting at anything in particular until I saw the man struck by the police—I was not shouting at the people, and telling them to go to church—I do not remember saying to the police, "Who stole the goose?"</p>
